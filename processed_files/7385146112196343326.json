        "3 FOREWORD Highly pathogenic and emerging (or re-emerging) diseases (HPEDs) cause serious crises and affect live- lihoods. The economic and public health costs of HPEDs are so great globally that a preventive strategy is not only cost-effective, but essential. Over 30 new pathogens have been detected in the last three decades, 75% of which have originated from animals. New pathogens from animals, par- ticularly viruses, remain unpredictable. They continue to emerge and spread across countries, and many of them have profoundly affected countries in Asia. The European Union's (EU) regional strategy in Asia refl ects the specifi c situation there by encouraging regional integration and cooperation and by contrib- uting to the control of epidemics and zoonosis and to disaster risk reduction. Cross-border activities focusing on animal and human health are among the strategic priorities for EU-Asia regional cooperation in the period 2007-2013. This brochure looks at the EU\u2019s recently launched HPED regional programme in Asia. The programme's objective is to improve epidemic and pandemic pre- paredness in the region. The programme is funded by the Directorate-General for Development and Cooperation \u2013 EuropeAid and implemented by the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE), the World Health Organization (WHO) and the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), in close consultation with the ASEAN and SAARC secretariats.

        "Highly pathogenic and emerging or re-emerging diseases (HPEDs) in animals and humans continue to spread across the world, with considerable health, social and economic consequences. Highly pathogenic avian infl uenza (HPAI) caused by the infl uenza virus A, subtype H5N1, has been the most signifi cant of these during the last fi ve years. Efforts to control the outbreaks have resulted in the culling or death of hundreds of millions of domestic birds worldwide. The eco- nomic losses in the Asian poultry sector alone were estimated at nearly \u20ac8 billion following the HPAI outbreak in 2003-2004. Despite global action to contain the disease, HPAI has spread to several Asian countries and beyond. Areas where the disease is considered endemic, because of its permanent presence in wild birds, include Indonesia, Vietnam, China, Avian infl uenza and other HPEDs as a global challenge Bangladesh and Egypt. Outbreaks of HPAI H5N1 among domestic birds in Asia, Africa and Europe mark the fi rst time in the history of this disease where so many countries have been simultane- ously affected with large-scale losses of birds. Avian infl uenza can affect several species of domestic birds (e.g. chickens, turkeys, quails, guinea fowl), including pet birds and wild birds with some strains resulting in high mortality rates. Humans can be infected through close contact with infected birds, for example when live birds car- rying infection are sold or by coming into contact with bird droppings or contaminated equipment. So far, human-to-human transmission of the H5N1 virus has been rare and has followed no general pattern. However, if HPAI is not controlled at the original source, i.e. poultry, the risk of human H5N1 infection remains and the threat of a potential infl uenza pandemic continues to exist. Apart from avian infl uenza, other highly patho- genic emerging and re-emerging diseases include severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), the Hanta virus, the highly pathogenic Nipah virus, rabies and leptospirosis. The number of HPEDs is expected to increase, creating a constant threat especially in countries with weak animal health and public health servi- ces. This is why it is also essential to strengthen capacities at a regional level, ensuring good prevention systems and adequate capacity for responding to outbreaks. The European Union has made this a priority action through its regional cooperation programme on HPEDs in Asia. 5 MN3111067ENC_001.pdf 5 19/09/11 16:39 ",

R Between 2003 and the end of 2010 there were 6 735 outbreaks of H5N1 in 63 countries. R The virus has killed and prompted the destruction of hundreds of millions of domestic and wild birds in more than 60 countries. R The most affected countries are Bangladesh, Egypt, Indonesia, Nigeria and Vietnam. R A total of 516 cases of infected people were confi rmed in 15 countries; 306 of them died. Source: WHO and OIE, situation by end 2010 The global response to animal and pandemic infl uenza B etween 2005 and 2010, the global commu- nity made unprecedented efforts to limit the impact \u2013 on both poultry production and human populations \u2013 of the HPAI H5N1 crisis that origi- nated in Asia and spread across the entire world. The comprehensive response processes put in place against HPAI H5N1 achieved a degree of preparedness which greatly helped ensure that effi cient global, regional and national responses to the H1N1 pandemic (2009) were provided. Bilateral and multilateral donors pledged total contributions of $4.3 billion (approximately \u20ac3.3 billion) between 2005 and December 2009 to fi ght AI. $2.7 billion was actually paid. Approximately 40% ($1.6 bil- lion) of committed funds went directly towards supporting country programmes, while 29% ($1.1 billion) supported country efforts and global functions through international organisations.

        "9 One Health is an integrated approach that calls for increased multidiscipli- nary and intersectoral cooperation and communication to address diseases that emerge at the human-animal-ecosystem interface and that pose a threat to ani- mal and human health. Together with partners around the world, the EU has promoted One Health since 2008. One Health encourages deeper under- standing of the links between the health of humans and animals and the ecosys- tems they inhabit. Zoonoses \u2013 animal diseases that can be transmitted to humans, or vice versa \u2013 occur at the interfaces between humans, animals (including domestic and wildlife) and the ecosystems in which they co-exist. It is an intricately interrelated system where any event that affects one domain can bring about profound effects and changes in other domains. The diseases of primary importance under the One Health approach are those with the potential to jump between ani- mals in the wild and livestock or humans. Diseases targeted by this approach include emerging or re-emerging infec- tious diseases (EIDs). Examples are HPAI, Nipah/Hendra viruses, SARS, monkeypox and Hanta viruses, rabies, Rift Valley Fever and Q Fever.

        "10 Regional Cooperation EU-Asia 2007-2013 Europe\u2019s contribution T he European Union, one of the two largest donors to the global response to avian infl u- enza (GRAI), has provided more than \u20ac413 million worldwide for the fi ght against animal and human pandemic infl uenza. All funds have been pledged under the global AI framework agreed in Beijing in 2006. The EU has been a key partner in defi ning the policy response to the avian infl uenza crisis. From the outset, the EU has placed its response to the AI crisis in the context of a medium- and long-term vision. It is linking crisis response and develop- ment, investing in institution-building and regional/ global networking, contributing in a sustainable way to the control of epidemics and zoonoses, and rebuilding affected sectors. The core principle of EU cooperation on AI is to support the development and implementation of integrated national plans for avian infl uenza con- trol and pandemic preparedness. Various types of activities are funded: public awareness and communication, technical assistance, training, equipment and operational expenses; all focusing on sustainable, long-term improvements, includ- ing regional networking. Millennium Development Goals Human health is a key element in eradicating poverty and achieving the UN Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). Addressing pandemics and HPEDs is therefore part of the EU\u2019s commitment to the MDGs. It is of direct relevance to MDG 6 (combating HIV/AIDS, malaria and other diseases), to MDG 4 (reducing child mortality) and MDG 5 (improving maternal health). Dealing with the causes and consequences of HPEDs also supports MDG 1 (eradicating extreme poverty and hunger) and MDG 7 (ensuring environmental sustainability). The biggest part of the EU\u2019s budget for exter- nal action against avian infl uenza is channelled through multi-donor trust funds, such as ALIVE 1 or the Avian and Human Infl uenza Facility (AHIF) 2 . Furthermore, the EU has allocated more than \u20ac100 million to 50 infl uenza research projects via its Research Framework and Public Health Programmes since 2000. The EU funds research worldwide in a number of areas, from basic virol- ogy and drug target research to the development of new diagnostics and better avian and human pandemic vaccines. The regional cooperation programme on HPEDs in Asia is a logical next-step in this process. 1 http://www.alive-online.org/ 2 http://www.worldbank.org/avianfl u MN3111067ENC_001.pdf 10 19/09/11 16:39 ",
        "11 The Avian and Human Infl uenza Facility (AHIF), operational since June 2006, is a multi-donor trust fund administered by the World Bank for highly pathogenic avian infl uenza and other zoonoses. The EU is one of the main funding partners of the AHIF. By December 2010, the AHIF had received combined pledges of \u20ac95 million from 10 donors, of which \u20ac71 million came from the EU. CASE STUDY AHIF supports a coordinated and effective response to HPAI H5N1 in Laos Grant amount: \u20ac3 million Disbursement (September 2010): \u20ac1.9 million Closing date: June 2011 In 2004 and 2007, Laos faced major out- breaks of H5N1 that led to the culling of 505 000 birds. For its national plan, the Laos government requested an AHIF grant, receiving an initial \u20ac1.4 million and a subsequent \u20ac1.6 million. These funds have been used to plug gaps in resources provided from other sources. Activities in support of the AHIF included: strengthening and upgrading laboratory facilities; capacity-building at all levels of society; training on biosecurity to mini- mise the effects of outbreaks on farms and beyond; and supporting local training courses, such as a three-month course on epidemiology. One of the most suc- cessful components supported by the AHIF was a compensation programme aimed at offsetting losses experienced by families and poultry producers.

        "12 Regional Cooperation EU-Asia 2007-2013 M ore than 3.9 billion people, or 60% of the world population, live in Asia, a continent that contributes 31.75% to the global burden of infectious diseases ( Global Disease Burden , WHO, 2002). Over 30 new human pathogens have been detected in the last three decades, 75% of which have originated in animals. New pathogens from animals, particularly viruses, remain unpredict- able; they emerge and spread across countries, sometimes with profound effects, posing a major challenge in the region. Thus, while HPEDs may emerge in any single country, it is imperative to address HPEDs on a regional basis. Signifi cant investment in building regional capacity to deal with HPEDs is highly relevant given the potential socio-economic impact of their global spread. The EU\u2019s regional HPED programme in Asia In Asia, two signifi cant zoonotic diseases have emerged in the past decade to cause serious epidemics in humans: the Nipah virus disease and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). More recently, highly pathogenic avian infl uenza (HPAI) H5N1 has become a major problem across the region with varying incidences of outbreaks at national levels. European cooperation in the health sector in Asia has traditionally targeted the national level. However, both continents have suffered recent outbreaks of transboundary infectious diseases, shifting the emphasis towards developing a rapid, broad response at regional level. The EU regional strategy in Asia refl ects the specifi c situation there by encouraging regional integration and cooperation and by contributing to the control of epidemics, epizootics and zoonoses and to disaster risk reduction. Cross-border cooperation in animal and human health is among the strategic priorities for EU regional cooperation in Asia over the period 2007-2013.

        "13 Programme focus The new EU regional cooperation programme on HPEDs in Asia, launched in December 2009, provides funding to strengthen animal health and human health services and to develop regional efforts to combat the disease. The regional programme aims at improving food security, preserving human health and nutrition, and reducing trade disruption in Southeast and South Asia, thus alleviating poverty through the prevention and control of HPEDs. It can therefore signifi cantly contribute to achieving the Millennium Development Goals. All diseases with a high potential for crises are targeted, with particular focus on HPAI. The programme takes an inter-sectoral, integrated One Health approach to disease prevention and control, thus broadening the scope of the EU response to the HPAI crisis. The programme consists of three individual projects implemented by the OIE, FAO and WHO. Programme governance Implementation of HPED programme activi- ties is managed within existing coordination mechanisms, namely the Regional Steering Committee (RSC) for Asia and the Pacifi c of the Global Framework for Progressive Control of Transboundary Animal Diseases (GF-TADs), which is composed of members from the OIE, FAO and WHO, as well as regional organisations, including ASEAN and SAARC. The fi rst steering committee meeting of the programme was held with the RSC GF-TADs for Asia and the Pacifi c in Bangkok in July 2010. MN3111067ENC_001.pdf 13 19/09/11 16:39 ",
        "14 Regional Cooperation EU-Asia 2007-2013 Programme objective The objective of the HPED programme is to strengthen the institutional capacities of ASEAN (Association of Southeast Asian Nations) and SAARC (South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation) and their secretariats to control HPEDs and to improve epidemic and pandemic preparedness in the region. ASEAN and SAARC are two major and well-defined sub-regions in terms of human population, culture and farming systems. In their respective areas, they seek to foster sub-regional cooperation to promote stronger cultural ties, trade and economic growth. More than 40 years old, ASEAN has evolved as an influential organisation improving regional economic cooperation. In South Asia, SAARC is expected to become increasingly important as a number of countries in the sub-region experience rapid economic growth and recognise the benefits of greater regional cooperation. ASEAN COOPERATION IN ANIMAL AND HUMAN HEALTH The Association of Southeast Asian Nations is a geo-political and economic organisa- tion of 10 countries located in Southeast Asia. ASEAN was formed in August 1967. The member states are Brunei, Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar/ Burma, Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam. The organisation\u2019s secretariat is in Jakarta, Indonesia. ASEAN members cooperate in political and security mat- ters, the economy, socio-cultural issues and external relations. SAARC COOPERATION IN ANIMAL AND HUMAN HEALTH The South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation was set up in 1985. Its mem- ber states are Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka. The SAARC Secretariat is in Kathmandu, Nepal. SAARC members cooperate in agricultural and rural develop- ment, biotechnology, culture, the economy, energy, the environment, human resource development, information, communication and media, poverty alleviation, science and technology, security, social development, tourism, and trade and finance. In recognition of the human, economic, social and security threats posed by zoon- oses, ASEAN members have worked over the past several years to implement integrated approaches to strengthening surveillance and responses to HPEDs with a focus on multisectoral cooperation, information-sharing and multi-country approaches. The ASEAN Secretariat working group tar- gets human-animal-ecosystem interface issues \u2013 One Health; and coordinates various health-related initiatives of the Secretariat to maximise the use of resources and promote efficiency and integration. Foot-and-mouth disease and Peste des Petits Ruminants (PPR) are the two pre- dominant transboundary animal diseases currently causing severe economic diffi- culties in South Asia. The risk of HPAI in poultry and also of its spread remains a key challenge. Rinderpest has recently been eradicated from the region. MN3111067ENC_001.pdf 14 19/09/11 16:39 ",
        "The OIE is a highly specialised intergovernmen- tal organisation responsible for improving animal health worldwide. The objectives of the OIE include ensuring transparency of the global animal disease situation, collecting, analysing and disseminating veterinary scientifi c information, and improving the legal framework and resources of national veterinary services. Duration of the action 48 months, December 2009 \u2013 December 2013 Total budget \u20ac9 million (EU contribution \u20ac7 million) Benefi ciary countries Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, Cambodia, China, India, Indonesia, Democratic People's Republic of Korea, Laos, Malaysia, Mongolia, Burma/Myanmar, Nepal, Pakistan, Philippines, Sri Lanka, Thailand and Vietnam The objective of the project is to strengthen regional integration and regional and sub-regional cooperation, and to provide capacity-building for surveillance, early detection and eradication of highly pathogenic emerging and re-emerging transboundary animal diseases in the region as well as good governance in animal health structures. Key activities \u2022 Set up a global vaccine bank for avian infl uenza, foot-and-mouth disease and rabies, which may be extended to other highly pathogenic emerging and re-emerging animal diseases. \u2022 Use the OIE-PVS tool to evaluate the perform- ance of veterinary services in Asia, and use the PVS Gap Analysis tool to confi rm priorities and to help prepare an indicative fi ve-year budget for the country\u2019s veterinary services. \u2022 Capacity-building: organise national and regional seminars and workshops on good governance of veterinary services and on the need for appro- priate legislation and implementation through national animal health systems, thus allowing for early detection; transparency; notifi cation of animal diseases including zoonoses; rapid response to outbreaks; biosecurity measures; compensation for farmers in cases of compul- sory slaughter; vaccination when appropriate; and cooperation between public and private sec- tors (notably farmers and private veterinarians). Programme projects The programme consists of three individual projects implemented by the OIE, FAO and WHO. Strengthening veterinary services in Asia, a regional vaccine bank, and capacity-building for surveillance, early detection and eradication of highly pathogenic emerging and re-emerging animal diseases Implemented by the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) Traditional vaccine banks often make losses due to the limited shelf-life of the stored biological materials. This situation has encouraged the creation of virtual rolling stocks. Biologicals are not physically stored in the bank, but delivered by the supplier to one main airport in the benefi ciary country when needed. They are produced by the sup- plier when needed, or stay with the supplier at the supplier\u2019s risk, being renewed on a rolling basis to ensure a guaranteed minimum one-year shelf-life. 15 15 MN3111067ENC_001.pdf 15 19/09/11 16:39 ",

The FAO helps developing coun- tries and countries in transition to modernise and improve agriculture, forestry and fi sheries practices. Duration of the project 48 months, December 2009 \u2013 December 2013 Total budget \u20ac8.8 million (EU contribution \u20ac8 million) Benefi ciary countries Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar/ Burma, Philippines, Thailand, Vietnam, Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka The objective of this project is to enhance the capac- ities and capabilities of ASEAN and SAARC member countries to prevent, control and eradicate HPEDs, with a focus on HPAI, through improved veterinary and public health services and inter-sectoral coop- eration on a regional basis. Key activities \u2022 Establish two regional support units in ASEAN and SAARC to serve as hubs for seconding national animal health personnel, covering train- ing, mentoring and experience for regional staff, and also as an additional source of support for animal health policy makers, risk communication, and emergency preparedness of animal health services. \u2022 Create a regional epidemiology network in ASEAN through sharing training, expertise and informa- tion. This will strengthen the regional capacity to understand epidemiology in the context of farming systems, HPAI and other HPEDs in animals and humans, so that appropriate control measures can be designed. \u2022 Set up a regional epidemiology centre in SAARC to serve as a platform for training in epidemiology expertise. \u2022 Establish a regional laboratory network in ASEAN to act as both a support for leading laboratories and a training platform. \u2022 Strengthen leading regional diagnostic laborato- ries in SAARC: organise and coordinate networks of national laboratories in order to provide tech- nical support to improve laboratory diagnoses of priority HPEDs and also provide backing to epidemiological studies on developing rational disease control strategies. Improvement of regional capacities for prevention, control and eradication of HPEDs (including HPAI and other Transboundary Animal Diseases - TADs) in ASEAN and SAARC Implemented by the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) The FAO Emergency Centre for Transboundary Animal Diseases (ECTAD) was established in December 2004 as part of the FAO\u2019s commitments to the fi ght against HPAI H5N1. Since HPAI H5N1 and its control need to be addressed using a comprehensive, systems-oriented approach, ECTAD operates professional work- ing groups and regional centres which encompass the socio-economic/farming system dimensions of the programme in addition to animal health and social communication. The FAO offi ce for Asia and the Pacifi c region (RAP) is involved in coordinating, networking and providing technical support for the control of HPAI and other HPEDs to countries in the region.

It is responsible for providing leadership on global health matters, shaping the health research agenda, setting norms and standards, articulating evidence-based policy options, providing tech- nical support to countries and monitoring and assessing health trends. Duration of the project 48 months, December 2009 \u2013 December 2013 Total budget \u20ac4.805 million (EU contribution \u20ac4 million) Benefi ciary countries Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar/ Burma, Philippines, Thailand, Vietnam, Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka The overall objective of the project is to mitigate the socio-economic impact of HPEDs in ASEAN and SAARC regions by strengthening surveillance and response capacities in member countries to prevent, detect, notify and react to HPEDs. Key Activities \u2022 Strengthening coordination and cooperation between animal health and public health sec- tors through joint workshops, training and networking. \u2022 Training on laboratory diagnosis, fi eld epi- demiology and priority zoonoses, and short epidemiology courses. \u2022 Translation of risk communication documents on HPEDs into national languages. \u2022 Pilot project for controlling priority zoonoses of regional importance. \u2022 Operational research activities including research seminars. \u2022 Diagnostic kits and reagents for diagnosing zoonoses. \u2022 Community-based activities (awareness, sur- veillance and risk reduction measures). Strengthening surveillance and response capacity for highly pathogenic and emerging and re-emerging diseases in ASEAN and SAARC countries under World Health Organization Regional Offices for Southeast Asia and the Western Pacific Implemented by the World Health Organization (WHO) The International Health Regulations (2005) provide a legal framework for an international public health response to the global spread of diseases. Several countries in Asia and the Pacifi c have been or continue to be affected by emerging diseases such as SARS, Nipah virus and HPAI. This led to the decision by WHO Regional Offi ces for Southeast Asia and the Western Pacifi c to work together against the emerging diseases in line with the IHR. These efforts have resulted in the development of an Asia-Pacifi c strat- egy for emerging diseases (APSED) which highlights the prevention and control of HPEDs, including zoonoses, as one of the priority programme areas. APSED provides guidance for coun- tries in the Asia-Pacifi c region in strengthening capacity for prevention, preparedness and rapid response to emerging infectious diseases. The scope of APSED is broad and includes interrelated objectives for the short-, medium- and long-term capacity required to reduce the threat of emerg- ing diseases. 17 MN3111067ENC_001.pdf 17 19/09/11 16:39 ",
