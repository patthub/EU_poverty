        "Evaluation of legislation, policy and practice on child participation in the European Union (EU) March 2015 ii Executive Summary Article 24 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union recognises the child's right to be heard. The right of all children to be heard and have their views being given due weight in accordance with their age and maturity is also laid down in Article 12 of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child (UNCRC). The key focus of the study was to provide a comprehensive overview of the legal and policy framework for child participation at Member State and EU levels; particular structures and approaches; barriers and enablers; and the impact and benefits of child participation. The study also identified good practice on child participation which could be used to improve possibilities for participation of children in actions, policies and decisions that affect them. Besides this main report, deliverables also include a research summary, a child-friendly summary and a specific fact sheet for each Member State, analysing its particular situation and pointing to best practices. A resource catalogue was also produced which will prove useful to promote the better respect of the views of the child. Study findings This study underlines the need to respect the child's right to be heard in all matters that concern her or him. Children have a valuable role to play in influencing policy and practice, where there are appropriate dialogue structures in place, and where both adults and children have opportunities to gain the competences needed for effective participation. Overall, the study has shown that the legislative arrangements relating to child participation vary considerably across the EU and that the inclusion of the child's right to participate into national laws has been a gradual process. The child's right to participate is now reflected to some extent within the national laws of all but a very few Member States with responsibilities for implementation shared between national governments, Ombudspersons and NGOs, although the detailed arrangements vary between individual sectors, and progress with regard to civic participation has fallen significantly behind other participatory forms. A key theme to emerge from the research is the need for greater transparency and accountability with regard to the efforts of individual Member States. Too few countries have established appropriate systems for monitoring and evaluating child participation and budgets for child participation remain indistinct . The main evidence of impact relates to participation activities at a local level , where the benefits are most tangible and measurable. Here, children have often been able to observe and articulate the changes to their everyday lives in settings such as schools, care, and their local neighbourhoods. Greater challenges clearly exist at a national policy level. The most commonly found examples of national policy impact relate to children\u2019s participation in developing youth strategies or action plans, and raising awareness of policy issues through child-led research, or via children\u2019s forums or parliaments. There are numerous examples of positive outcomes for individual children , relating to participation in decisions affecting their care, education or treatment within justice settings . In the fields of child protection, healthcare and education amongst ",
        "Evaluation of legislation, policy and practice on child participation in the European Union (EU) March 2015 iii others, examples were found where children\u2019s right to be heard has achieved direct results for their wellbeing and safety, even if these outcomes are infrequently monitored or evaluated in a systematic way. The study has drawn attention to the gap that so often exists between legislation and practice . Even in countries where the legislative framework is better established, children\u2019s participation rights continue to be compromised through a combination of legal exemptions and restrictions, problems with their enforcement and application, tensions between the child\u2019s right to be heard and laws governing parental rights and responsibilities and legal guardianship, and restrictive public attitudes towards the child\u2019s place in society. The need for raised levels of awareness of the right of the child to participate amongst legal, health, social care, educational and youth professionals, and practical skills for supporting children\u2019s participation within the context of specific sectors and settings was also a recurrent theme across the EU. The study evidence concurs with existing research and practice regarding the very significant benefits of child participation for children\u2019s confidence, self-esteem and leadership skills, and developing civic and social responsibility. These outcomes were commonly achieved as a result of children engaging in participatory democracy activities, through youth councils, public debates, and participatory research. This is distinct from the individual child\u2019s right to be heard within justice, asylum, and care proceedings, where the benefits of child participation often have a more immediate bearing on the child\u2019s rights, status, or material circumstances. The study also provided an opportunity to explore directly with different stakeholders form across the EU what further action might be needed to strengthen the right of the child to participate. Overall, there was consensus that the emphasis within most Member States should be one of improving the implementation of existing legal provisions , rather than to add to the legislative machinery. It was thought that this might be achieved through more effective remedies in the event that legislation is breached; the utilisation of standards and monitoring frameworks; training for professionals who work with and for children about participation, and public awareness-raising and education about the benefits and relevance of children participation. Nonetheless, there was a perceived need amongst many of the interviewees for further selective legislation to strengthen the participation rights of specific disadvantaged or vulnerable groups of children, such as Roma, children with disabilities, asylum seeking and refugee children, and very young children.

        "Evaluation of legislation, policy and practice on child participation in the European Union (EU) March 2015 1 1.0 Introduction In November 2012, the European Commission Directorate-General for Justice (Justice and Consumers as of 1.1.2015) (DG JUST) commissioned an evaluation to carry out an evaluation of legislation, policy and practice on child participation in the European Union (JUST/2011/CHIL/FW/0159/A4). The study commenced with a kick-off meeting on 19 November 2012 and concluded in January 2014. The methodology included desk research, primary research and a child-led participatory action research within five EU Member States 2 . This final report presents the detailed findings from the evaluation. In this first chapter, we present the study background; outline the aims, objectives, and definitions that were used for the evaluation, and explain the methodological approach. We also highlight the main caveats and considerations to be applied when interpreting the findings, before going on to explain the structure for the remainder of the report. The outputs from the evaluation include: \uf0b7 a main evaluation report, containing results of the country research, EU-level research and child-led research; showcasing good practices based on a list of good practice criteria, putting forward recommendations; a set of practical guidelines for implementing children\u2019s participation, and appendices with further information on legislation within individual Member States relating to United Nations Commission on the Rights of the Child (UNCRC) Article 12; national participatory networks and forums; lists of key stakeholders, and a full method description \uf0b7 child friendly summary of the main report \uf0b7 individual country reports documenting the situation for children\u2019s participation in the EU28; and, \uf0b7 a searchable PDF catalogue, with examples of research, toolkits and other resources for practitioners. All of these outputs can be accessed and viewed online at the website of the Directorate- General for Justice and Consumers 3 (DG JUST). They will also be available to download from the EU Bookshop 4 . 1.1 Study background The 1989 United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child (UNCRC) legally enshrined the right for children to express and have their views heard in all matters that affect them, overseen by the Committee on the Rights of the Child. Of the 54 Articles, Article 12 makes an explicit commitment for children and young people\u2019s right to be heard and respected in all matters that affect their lives, and has become synonymous with the term \"participation\". It is one of four rights identified by the Committee on the Rights of the Child as general principles of the Convention, relevant to all aspects of implementation of the UNCRC and to the interpretation of all other articles. 2 Croatia, Greece, Netherlands, Poland and the UK 3 http://ec.europa.eu/justice/fundamental-rights/rights-child/index_en.htm 4 http://bookshop.europa.eu ",
        "Evaluation of legislation, policy and practice on child participation in the European Union (EU) March 2015 2 A considerable body of research and practice on children\u2019s participation has been amassed in the decades since the UNCRC was first adopted. The 2009 report of the UN Children's Fund; The State of the World's Children 5 underlined the relative progress that has been made over these 20 years. Children\u2019s codes have been incorporated into national legislation by around 70 countries worldwide, although participation has proven more difficult to measure using the available data 6 . The Convention on the Rights of the Child does not use the word participation specifically, but the term has become widely adopted in the literature to describe the process of respecting the right of children to express their views 7 . This was explicitly acknowledged in General Comment No 12 of the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child 8 where participation was described as: \u201con-going processes, which include information-sharing and dialogue between children and adults based on mutual respect, and in which children can learn how their views and those of adults are taken into account and shape the outcome of such processes.\u201d A variety of definitions of participation have been put forward in the literature (e.g. Hart 1992 9 , developing Arnstein's original ladder of citizen participation; Treseder 1997 10 , and Shier, 2001 11 ). An over-arching definition of the term is provided as follows in the UNICEF Innocenti series: \"[Participation can be defined as]\u2026 the process of sharing decisions which affect one's life and the life of the community in which one lives.\" (Hart, 1992, p.5) 12 Building on this, the working definition of child participation, developed by experts on the study team, and of which we were mindful during the course of the data collection and analysis for this study is as follows: \"The democratic action and involvement of individual children and groups of children in matters affecting them.\" 5 UNICEF (2009) The State of the World's Children [online].

        "Evaluation of legislation, policy and practice on child participation in the European Union (EU) March 2015 3 1.1.1 Child participation in Europe Whilst the promotion and protection of children\u2019s rights is underpinned by the UNCRC, this agenda is also reflected in the objectives of the European Union. The Lisbon Treaty 13 included for the first time at the Treaty level the promotion of the protection of the rights of the child as one of the EU internal and external policy objectives. It also specifically included the protection of the rights of the child in reference to human trafficking, sexual exploitation and other criminal activity. 14 Article 24 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union identifies that a child's well-being and \"best interests must be a primary consideration\" in decisions made relating to an individual child or children as a whole. In addition the article clearly outlines that children must be allowed to give their views and their views must be taken account of in relation to any matter that affects them, as appropriate depending on their age and level of maturity 15 . Children\u2019s participation forms a specific dimension of children\u2019s fundamental rights, cross- referencing Article 12 of UNCRC and the right to be heard in all decisions affecting them, but also extending to include the active implementation of children\u2019s views in partnership with adults. Participation is acknowledged as being central to children accessing protection and provision rights. At a European level, the participation of children and young people under the age of 18 was given new impetus through the European Commission's EU Agenda for the Rights of the Child 16 (the EU Agenda). The EU Agenda outlines a set of principles to make sure that the EU upholds the rights of the child outlined in the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, the Treaties and the UNCRC to the highest standard, and this has further been reflected in recent EU legislation, such as Directive 2012/29/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council 17 , which established minimum standards on the rights, support and protection of victims of crime, and Directive 2011/36/EU on preventing and combating trafficking in human beings and protecting its victims 18 . Looking more widely than policy emanating from the EU, The Council of Europe Recommendation to Member States of 28th March 2012 (CM/Rec (2012)2) 19 further placed an importance on the governments in Europe taking the principles of child participation into account in their government's legislation, policies and practices as well encouraging the exchange of good practice concerning the principles. Most importantly, the recommendations emphasised governments' responsibility in ensuring children and young people are aware of the principles of participation and provision is made for children and young people to take part in decisions that affect them. These principles are shown in the table below. 13 European Union, Treaty of Lisbon Amending the Treaty on European Union and the Treaty Establishing the European Community , 13 December 2007, 2007/C 306/01 14 Article 3 of the Treaty of European Union states that the Union \" shall combat [...] discrimination and shall promote [...] protection of the rights of the child\", and specifies that \"in its relations with the wider world, the Union shall [...] contribute to [...] the protection of human rights, in particular the rights of the child.\u201d 15 Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, OJ C 364, 18.12.2000.

        "Evaluation of legislation, policy and practice on child participation in the European Union (EU) March 2015 4 Table 1.1 Principles of participation \uf0b7 There is no age limit on the right of the child or young person to express her or his views freely. All children and young people, including those of pre-school age, school age and those who have left full-time education, have a right to be heard in all matters affecting them, their views being given due weight in accordance with their age and maturity. \uf0b7 The right of children and young people to participate applies without discrimination on any grounds such as race, ethnicity, colour, sex, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, property, disability, birth, sexual orientation or other status. \uf0b7 Consideration needs to be given to the notion of the evolving capacities of children and young people. As children and young people acquire greater capacity, adults should encourage them to enjoy, to an increasing degree, their right to influence matters affecting them. \uf0b7 Particular efforts should be made to enable participation of children and young people with fewer opportunities , including those who are vulnerable or affected by discrimination, including discrimination on multiple grounds. \uf0b7 Parents and carers have the primary responsibility for the upbringing and the development of the child and, as such, play a fundamental role in affirming and nurturing the child\u2019s right to participate, from birth onwards. \uf0b7 In order to be able to participate meaningfully and genuinely, children and young people should be provided with all relevant information and offered adequate support for self- advocacy appropriate to their age and circumstances. \uf0b7 If participation is to be effective, meaningful and sustainable, it needs to be understood as a process and not a one-off event and requires on-going commitment in terms of time and resources. \uf0b7 Children and young people who exercise their right to freely express their views must be protected from harm including intimidation, reprisals, victimisation and violation of their right to privacy. \uf0b7 Children and young people should always be fully informed of the scope of their participation , including the limitations on their involvement, the expected and actual outcomes of their participation and how their views were ultimately considered. \uf0b7 In line with the General Comment on Article 12 of the UNCRC, all processes in which children and young people are heard should be transparent and informative , voluntary, respectful, relevant to children\u2019s lives, in child-friendly environments, inclusive (non- discriminatory), supported by training, safe and sensitive to risk, and accountable. Member States should integrate these requirements into all legislative and other measures for the implementation of this recommendation. \uf0b7 Article 12 UNCRC right should be enshrined in national legislation applicable to all children and all settings of their lives.

        "Evaluation of legislation, policy and practice on child participation in the European Union (EU) March 2015 5 The direction of travel in Europe is therefore a positive one, which has gained considerable momentum. Children\u2019s participation is now an established feature of policy and programme agendas across Europe. In many European countries, structures and approaches for hearing the voices of children are common features and children\u2019s participation is now routine for an expanding number of practitioners. Yet, in spite of these general trends in the development of children\u2019s participation there are irregularities and shortfalls. Developments in children\u2019s participation have been uneven across countries, sectors, levels of governance and for different groups of children. Uneven progress in developing participation is also reflected across public sectors and at different levels of governance, with certain sectors such as children\u2019s services, play sectors and aspects of local planning/community development (particularly those concerning facilities for children), appearing to achieve greater advances. The research carried out for this study aims to provide a deeper understanding of the situation within individual Member States, and to shine a light on potential good practices, evidence of positive outcomes and impact, barriers to further implementation and possible solutions for addressing them. 1.2 Aims, objectives, and methodology The aim of the study was to identify and map the existing situation in terms of child participation in the EU. Essentially, it sought to provide a baseline on the participation of children in the development and implementation of actions and policies that affect them both at national and EU level, for individual children, groups of children and children as a group. The study also aimed to provide an overview of tools and methods being used, and to examine the impact of child participation. The Terms of Reference (ToR) can be found at Annex Eight. More specifically, the objectives of the study were to: \uf0b7 Map legislation, policy and practice in 28 EU Member States with regard to implementation of Article 12 UNCRC and other UNCRC articles pertaining to child participation. Examine cultural attitudes to, and cultural acceptance of, child participation in the various settings. \uf0b7 Identify any barriers to full implementation of Article 12 and identify enablers of child participation. \uf0b7 Identify and showcase good practice on child participation in the EU, and Member States, including at a local level. \uf0b7 Identify and evaluate the work done by the EU on child participation on the territory of the EU. \uf0b7 Draw up practical guidelines for child participation at local, regional, national and European level. These study objectives were pursued through various tasks: a) mapping of country level legislation, policy and practice in all 28 EU Member States; b) mapping of EU level activity, c) identification and analysis of good practice at both levels; and, d) child-led strand; involving participatory research in five Member States, Figure 1.2 below summarises the work programme.

Drawing upon the Framework for Monitoring and Evaluating Children\u2019s Participation developed by Lansdown (2011 21 ), the data collection took particular account of three main types of participation \u2013 consultative, collaborative, and child-led, whilst avoiding any assumptions about an implicit or explicit \u2018hierarchy\u2019. In other words, it should not be assumed that child-led participation is necessarily of a higher order than collaborative participation, as this depends on the specific context. The evaluation also found numerous examples where children are provided with \u2018 child- friendly information\u2019 . Following the framework, the provision of information can be considered a prerequisite for effective and informed participation by children. However, it could equally feature within examples of consultative, collaborative and child-led practices, and has not been treated as a form of participation in its own right. The study also took into account the different stages of the policy or project development cycle at which participation takes place, as this can have a significant bearing on the forms participation takes and children and young people\u2019s opportunities to be heard and influence decision-making. The following table shows how these dimensions were combined into an over-arching framework. 21 Available at: http://resourcecentre.savethechildren.se/library/framework-monitoring-and-evaluating-childrens- participation-preparatory-draft-piloting ",

Policy or programme implementation Children are invited to participate on adult terms. Children are jointly involved with adults in implementing programme/policy actions, for example, communicating, contributing and/or taking responsibility for delivery of some aspects of the initiative.

        "Evaluation of legislation, policy and practice on child participation in the European Union (EU) March 2015 10 1.4 Report structure The remainder of this report is structured as follows: \uf0b7 Chapter two reviews the legislation, structures and mechanisms relating to Article 12 UNCRC across the EU28, and explores the key issues and challenges arising from their implementation. It also considers the influence of other drivers for children\u2019s participation including the Council of Europe Recommendation. \uf0b7 Chapter three examines the situation within key sectors and settings across the EU to determine the level of coverage of Article 12 UNCRC. It then goes on to examine the specific issues faced by vulnerable groups of children, and examples of good practice in supporting these groups. \uf0b7 Chapter four examines the different forms that participation takes, the factors that influence relative effectiveness, and some of the hallmarks of \u2018good\u2019 and \u2018poor\u2019 quality participatory practices. \uf0b7 Chapter five reviews the practice dimensions of children\u2019s participation in greater detail. It examines the extent to which children have been able to routinely effect changes to policy and practice, the ways in which this has been achieved, and the benefits of participation for children and young people themselves. \uf0b7 Chapter six looks at the main barriers to effective participation, including the reasons why legislative responses have not always been effective. It then goes on to identify the enablers for achieving effective participation, and sets out a number of priorities for further action. \uf0b7 Chapter seven turns to examine the evidence from the child-led strand of the research. It provides an overview of the work carried out with children on the five participatory projects, before examining the children\u2019s definitions of participation and their experiences of participation in their everyday lives. . \uf0b7 Chapter eight further explores the findings from the child-led research strand in relation to the challenges and barriers encountered by children in relation to participation, and the solutions they have proposed. \uf0b7 Chapter nine presents the findings from the analysis of data at an EU-level. It gives an overview of EU legislation and policy development, looking across the work of the different Directorates General, and other EU institutions, and examines how this work has translated into practice; and, \uf0b7 Chapter ten presents the overall conclusions from the country mapping, EU-level, and child-led strands of the evaluation. It then goes on to present a series of recommendations for future policy development, and a set of practice guidelines for managing child participation at the EU, regional and local levels. ",
        "Evaluation of legislation, policy and practice on child participation in the European Union (EU) March 2015 11 2.0 Legislation, structures and mechanisms for implementing child participation within EU Member States Key messages The legislative response to Article 12 UNCRC \uf0b7 The legal provisions for Article 12 UNCRC vary significantly across the EU. These provisions are most commonly reflected in multiple sources of legislation regarding children\u2019s rights. Eleven Member States (BE, BG, DE, ES, FI, IE, HU, LT, PL, SK and SI) have included provisions within their national Constitution, whilst six (AT, LV, PL, RO, SE and UK) have introduced a more comprehensive Children\u2019s Act or Code addressing child participation. In a few cases, (CY, MT), there was little or no evidence that Article 12 has been taken into account within national legislation. \uf0b7 Specific legal provisions pertaining to Article 12 UNCRC are most visible within the education, care, and justice sectors (including asylum and immigration), where Article 12 is covered in all 28 Member States. The child\u2019s right to be heard is the most clearly defined in decisions affecting their immediate welfare \u2013 through adoption, custody or, care proceedings. In contrast, fewer legal provisions were found relating to children\u2019s participation in designing, planning and evaluating services provided on their behalf. Structures \uf0b7 Most EU countries have a specific Government Ministry or Ministries with oversight of policies and programmes for children and young people as part of a wider portfolio for youth, citizenship, and education. These responsibilities are rarely defined in terms of \u2018child participation\u2019, however, and this usually forms part of a wider portfolio for youth, citizenship, and education. There was very limited evidence for a cross-Government agenda for child participation within Member States, in contrast to other related areas of children\u2019s policy such as tackling child poverty. \uf0b7 An independent Ombudsperson has been mandated with responsibilities for monitoring children's rights under UNCRC, including Article 12, in all but two EU Member States. In half of these countries (13), the role is performed by a Children\u2019s Ombudsperson or Commissioner (AT, BE, HR, CY, FI, IE, IT, LT, LU, MT, PL, SE, and UK), whilst the same number have assigned responsibilities to a National Ombudsperson as part of a wider portfolio (BG, DK, EE, EL, ES, FR, HU, LV, NL, PT, RO, SK, and SI). In two countries (CZ and DK), responsibilities for UNCRC are subsumed within Ministerial functions. \uf0b7 The country mapping also identified a wider range of Non-Governmental Organisations (NGOs), child rights organisations and networks acting in a support or advocacy role for child participation at a national level within Member States. UNICEF National Committees were cited as performing an important monitoring role for UNCRC, including Article 12, in making progress more transparent. Budgets for participation \uf0b7 The visibility of public budgets for child participation has generally been poor. Government funding for programmes with a child participation element has often fallen between \u2018children\u2019 and \u2018youth\u2019 policy, with the latter usually understood to cover young people from the ages of 14-25. This reflects that much child participation activity has originated from a citizenship and cultural agenda, rather than necessarily being rights-based and linked directly to UNCRC (0-18 year olds). There was evidence that levels of public funding allocated to promoting and monitoring Article 12 have not always been fit for purpose. ",
        "Evaluation of legislation, policy and practice on child participation in the European Union (EU) March 2015 12 Implementing policy and legislation \uf0b7 Enforcement of Article 12 has proven difficult. Very few countries have introduced a workable framework for assessing compliance or imposing remedies in the event of a breach. Article 12 is still relatively untested in case law; and progress has been slower in higher profile policy areas and where children\u2019s rights come into conflict with political interests. \uf0b7 Responsibilities for implementation of Article 12 typically rest with a number of different official bodies and institutions at a national level. Much trail-blazing of children\u2019s participation has also taken place at a municipal level, where authorities working individually or as part of a network have often shown active leadership. The Child Friendly Cities Initiative and Children\u2019s Town Councils are prominent examples of municipal initiatives. Participation in practice \uf0b7 The country mapping found that nearly all Member States have some form of participatory children and youth structure at a national level; most commonly National Youth or Children\u2019s Councils or Children or Youth Parliaments. A wider range of NGOs, child rights organisations and networks acting in a support or advocacy role for child participation were also identified. The existence of networks representing more specific groups of children was less evident through the mapping exercise. \uf0b7 There was a clear trend across countries for forms of child participation that involve \u2018consultation\u2019 and the gathering of children\u2019s views. It was common that consultation activities were pursued as singular or time limited activities relating to a specific policy or project initiative. Emerging from the mapping were some examples of more collaborative participation activities, with children involved collaboratively at the design and planning stage of the policy or programme cycle, but to a lesser extent in subsequent stages of decision making, implementation and evaluation. A handful of potential examples of child- led participation were found within the study. Some local youth movements were identified as being almost entirely child-initiated, and operating outside of an adult-led structure. 2.1 Introduction This chapter draws upon the findings from the country mapping and desk research to review the legislative and policy frameworks that exist to support children\u2019s participation within EU Members States, and with a particular focus on UNCRC Article 12. The chapter starts by examining the forms of legislation that have been introduced, and how participation is defined and constituted \u2013 at national and regional or local levels. It goes on to examine which types of official bodies or institutions have legislative oversight, and how participation is funded. The chapter then addresses the question of how relevant legislation and standards have been implemented, and the challenges that exist for ensuring compliance. Finally, it examines the structures and mechanisms that exist to support participation in practice, including the role played by NGOs and grassroots children\u2019s networks. ",
        "Evaluation of legislation, policy and practice on child participation in the European Union (EU) March 2015 13 2.2 Legislative frameworks for child participation The legal provisions used to implement Article 12 of the UNCRC were closely examined through the country mapping phase of the study and were found to vary significantly across the Member States. Table 2.1 provides an overview of the situation across the EU28. It should be noted that the categories are not mutually exclusive, as some Member States have used more than one method of transposition for Article 12. Table 2.1 Transposition of Article 12 in national legislation within the EU28 Method of transposition Country coverage (EU Member States) a. Comprehensive Children\u2019s Act or Code AT 22 , LV, PL, RO, SE, UK b. Reflected in the national Constitution BE, BG 23 , DE, ES, LT 24 , FI, HU 25 , IE 26 , PL, SK, SI c. Reflected in wider / multiple sources of legislation regarding children\u2019s rights CZ, DK, EE, ES, FR, EL, HR, IE, IT, LU, NL, PT, SK, SE d. Weak / limited evidence of national legislative basis for Article 12 CY, MT There are six countries where a comprehensive children's act is used as the legal basis. The most notable examples were Austria\u2019s Federal Constitutional Act on the Rights of the Child of 2011( Bundesverfassungsgesetz \u00fcber die Rechte von Kindern / BVG) 27 and the UK\u2019s Children\u2019s Act 2004 28 ; although numerous other pieces of legislation in the UK variously reinforce the provisions of Article 12 within the devolved administrations. These include, for example, the Rights of Children and Young Persons (Wales) Measure of 2011 which requires Ministers to have due regard to UNCRC when exercising their functions within office 29 . A slightly more common approach was the inclusion of Article 12 rights in the national Constitutions of countries (11 countries). The Austrian Federal Constitutional Act on the Rights of the Child 30 includes participation in its overall definition, and the Finnish Constitution implicitly includes children in an article outlining universal rights to participation. The Constitutions in Lithuania, Belgium and Spain also include explicit references to child rights and participation, although in both of the latter cases the wording of Article 12 is not transposed exactly as in the UNCRC: \u201cThe public authorities shall promote the conditions for the free and effective participation by the young in political, social, economic and cultural development.\u201d (Spain) 22 The Federal Constitutional Act on the Rights of the Child does not include all the rights protected under the UNCRC, in particular social and cultural rights of children are missing. The right of participation (Art 4) is included. Specific laws may contradict this right and remain valid until declared unconstitutional by the Constitutional Court. 23 The Child Protection Act guarantees the child\u2019s right to participation in judicial and administrative proceedings concerning his or her interests, if the child is 10 or older. 24 The decision on child\u2019s ability to express his/her views, when he/she is under the age of 10, is made with the involvement of the psychologist. The laws define a manner and situations when child\u2019s opinion needs to be heard. 25 The understanding of Article 12 in Hungary is rather limited to children involved in judicial or administrative proceedings 26 The result of the referendum is currently being challenged before the Irish Supreme Court so the constitutional amendment has not yet been written into law at the time of writing. 27 Bundesverfassungsgesetz \u00fcber die Rechte von Kindern (Federal Constitutional Act on the Rights of the Child) 2011 http://www.parlament.gv.at/PAKT/VHG/XXIV/BNR//BNR_00335/fnameorig_204922.html 28 The Children\u2019s Act (2004). http://www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/acts2004/ukpga_20040031_en_1 29 http://www.legislation.gov.uk/mwa/2011/2/contents 30 \u00d6sterreichische Bundesverfassung (Austrian Federal Constitution) 1920/1929 http://www.bmeia.gv.at/fileadmin/user_upload/bmeia/media/4-Oesterreich_Zentrale/182_bv_deu_eng_frz.pdf ",
        "Evaluation of legislation, policy and practice on child participation in the European Union (EU) March 2015 14 \u201cEvery child has the right to express herself/himself on all matters of interest to her/him; her or his opinion is taken into consideration depending on age and capacity of discernment.\u201d (Belgium) In Ireland, a referendum on the constitutional rights of children was successfully passed on 10 November 2012. Once passed into law, the proposed amendment will afford children specific rights to be heard in relation to proceedings concerning child protection, care, adoption, guardianship and custody 31 . The inclusion of Article 12 is also evident at a constitutional level within individual regions or provinces, within some federalised countries. For example, child rights, including the right to participate, are explicitly included in all L\u00e4nder constitutions with the exception of Hamburg and Hesse in Germany, although not using entirely consistent definitions or with a guarantee of a consistent level of protection. Similarly, in Austria, the incorporation of general references to children\u2019s rights, although the right to be heard is not made explicit, can be found within the constitutions of some - but not all - provinces, including Upper Austria, Vorarlberg, Salzburg, Lower Austria, and Tyrol. In just under half of EU Member States (14 countries), the implementation of Article 12 has been realised through several or multiple pieces of legislation , rather than a comprehensive or singular Act. In most cases, the legislation supporting child participation is intertwined with general legalisation about children\u2019s rights, and is often additionally a part of a wider piece of legislation governing a particular sector. A more detailed consideration of the arrangements within specific sectors can be found within Chapter 3 . 2.2.2 Definitions of participation evident in legislation The country mapping showed that there is considerable variation in how Article 12 is reflected in national legislation, with the most notable area of variation around the definitions and wording of legislation in respect of participation, and the strength and scope of the duties that are imposed. In the main, the wording of legislation largely reflects that of the UNCRC. However, the evidence gathered in country-level research indicates that not all countries have a single definition of child participation enshrined in legislation, so different pieces of legislation present a sometimes contrasting view. Where participation is referenced in legislation, it is generally interpreted in terms of consultation and providing a voice for children on decisions that affect them, with wording commonly in line with the spirit of the UNCRC. Typically the working definition evident across legislation is for \u2018children\u2019s opinions to be taken into account\u2019 . 2.2.3 Official bodies and institutions The evidence gathered at a country level suggests that in individual countries there are typically multiple official bodies and institutions with a role or remit for the implementation of UNCRC Article 12 at national level. They include national and regional government bodies, Children\u2019s Councils, and Ombudsmen. A list of these institutions can be found at Annex Three. An Ombudsperson is mandated with responsibilities for children's rights, including Article 12, in most EU Member States. In most cases, these functions are performed by a dedicated Children\u2019s Ombudsman or Commissioner (AT, BE, CY, FI, IE, HR, IT, LT, LU, MT, PL, SE, and UK). 31 Thirty-First Amendment of the Constitution (Children) Bill 2012 (Bill No.78 of 2012) ",
        "Evaluation of legislation, policy and practice on child participation in the European Union (EU) March 2015 15 In the UK, a Children\u2019s Commissioner exists for each of the devolved administrations (England, Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales), whilst in Austria there is an \u201c Ombudsoffice for Children and Youth\u201d in each of the L\u00e4nder (Burgenland, Carinthia, Lower Austria, Salzburg, Styria, Tyrol, Upper Austria, Vienna, and Vorarlberg 32 ). In addition to the National Ombudsman for Children and Adolescents, nine of the Italian regions 33 have passed a law enabling the creation of a regional Ombudsman for Children; although at the time of writing these structures have not yet been established. 34 In Member States where there is not a specific Children\u2019s Ombudsman, the remit for monitoring children\u2019s rights most commonly falls within a wider set of responsibilities for a National Ombudsperson . This was found to be the situation in 13 Member States (BG, DK, FR, EE, EL, ES, HU, LV, NL, PT, RO, SK, and SI). In two further countries, these responsibilities do not fall to an independent Ombudsperson, and are instead situated within government, as an extension of existing Ministerial functions (CZ, and DE). There is evidence that in some Member States the role of an Ombudsman is still relatively new, and in others it is still evolving. In Bulgaria, for example, the Ombudsman Act was only adopted in 2012 so the role and remit of the Children\u2019s Ombudsman has still to be clarified. In the UK, the Children and Families Bill (2013) includes proposals to widen the functions and powers held by the Office of the Children\u2019s Commissioner and provide greater independence from Government, in the wake of an independent review of the role. This strengthening will include a change in reporting arrangements, from reports to the Education Ministry, to direct reporting to Parliament, along with new powers to undertake child rights impact assessments for all new government policies affecting children. 35 In other Member States, however, the work around children\u2019s rights, and therefore participation, sits directly within an individual Ministry. The specific location was found to vary between Member States, as might be expected given differences in how national Ministries are structured, and their specific remit. Generally, however, they sat either within education (for example, the Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports in the Czech Republic; Ministry of Education and Culture\u2019s Youth Policy Division in Finland, and Ministry of Education and the Ministry of Youth in France), or social affairs/social protection (for example, the Ministry of Social Affairs, The Ministry of Labour, Family and Social Protection in Romania, and The Ministry of Social Affairs, Department of Children and Families in Estonia). Crosscutting the above, child participation is pertinent to Ministries of justice and home affairs in all Member States, in the context of asylum, immigration, and justice. In the main, these official bodies and ministries exist and operate at a national level. Exceptions were found, however. In Lithuania the promotion and implementation of child participation is decentralised with local authorities playing a key role. Specifically each local authority in Lithuania has a child rights protection body. The German federal system also means that the policy areas relating to child participation are in the main within the competence of the Federal States. 32 United Nations Children\u2019s Fund (2013) Championing Children\u2019s Rights: A global study of independent human rights institutions for children , UNICEF Office of Research, Florence: http://www.unicef- irc.org/publications/pdf/c950_ccrbook_130903web_noblanks.pdf 33 Basilicata, Calabria, Emilia Romagna, Liguria, Lombardia, Piemonte, Puglia, Toscana, and Umbria 34 Ibid.

In no Member State was there an entirely separate, ring- fenced public budget for child participation activities within Ministries, although the planned expenditure for Child Ombudsmen was usually found to be more transparent due to their reporting and accountability requirements. The absence of information about targeted public funding in the Member States can be attributed in part to the cross-cutting nature of child participation, which is implicit to a much wider range of youth welfare, educational and social inclusion provisions rather than necessarily being confined to a specific set of \u201cactivities\u201d. Nevertheless, a lack of transparency was raised as problematic in some countries, due to the restrictions this places both on the ability to monitor expenditure and also for children to influence how funding is prioritised and spent. In some countries, there has been lobbying to create a \u201cchildren\u2019s budget\u201d , These budgets cover a range of activities and it is implicit that children will participate in some way in determining how it is used. For example, in the case of Croatia: \u201c We have advocated in the last six or seven years [for] the creation of a so-called \u201cchildren\u2019s budget\u201d. We insist that the state clearly says \u201cThis is for children\u201d...and then we will monitor...to be able to recognise which resources are [available] for children.\u201d (National Expert, Croatia) Different viewpoints were expressed on this issue by the experts consulted for the study. Whilst all recognised the importance of transparency with regard to funding for the promotion of child rights, some considered that having a ring-fenced budget for children runs contrary to the objectives of child participation to an extent, by separating children\u2019s interests from those of adults, and by separating out child participation rather than mainstreaming it in policies. From this perspective, the central issue \u2013 the need for children\u2019s participation to be reflected across all areas of public policy \u2013 is not fully addressed. A number of examples of funds were found within the country mapping exercise, with a direct focus on participation. Some of the better established examples have benefited from a steady funding stream, supported at a national level via special programmes. The following are four examples of this: Table 2.2 Country examples: allocating and monitoring expenditure for children \uf0b7 In Italy , the Youth Policy Fund was established with Law n. 248/2006 as a financial mechanism to promote \u2018student participation 36 \u2019. The funding is distributed via municipalities of university towns, to support the work of student consultative bodies, and to establish dialogue with local stakeholders. Student participation in project design and management is one of the award criteria. \uf0b7 In Slovakia , the Ministry of Education, with its IUVENTA branch provides grants for youth participation, including via the ADAM Programme. This is an important source of funding, with 40% of youth NGOs now supported by ADAM. It is the only programme that also provides core funding 37 . \uf0b7 In Sweden , The National Board of Youth Affairs allocates funding to promote child-led organisations. Just over 100 child and youth organisations were approved for funding in January 2014. The Swedish inheritance board (Allm\u00e4nna Arvsfonden) also provides funding to projects working on children\u2019s rights, some of them explicitly regarding participation. \uf0b7 In Slovenia , budgetary resources exist with the aim of promoting and implementing child participation. National and local governments financially support child and youth organizations which promote, support and work on child participation. The most influential government body is Office for Youth at the Ministry of Education and Sport. 36 http://www.gioventu.gov.it/dipartimento/politichegiovanili.aspx 37 Stakeholder interview evidence ",
        "Evaluation of legislation, policy and practice on child participation in the European Union (EU) March 2015 17 It is clear though that even when public funding for participation exists, the amount is often low. Figures are difficult to ascertain due to the often complex forms of governmental budgets, but officials in various countries such as Bulgaria, Spain, and Slovakia point to the small budgets as one of the key challenges for achieving sustainable participation across different sectors. This view is supported by evidence from the CRC Committee country reports, which indicate that financial support from national Governments has not always been adequate to maintain child-rights institutions at a level where they are able to perform all of their functions 38 . There was also a rather mixed picture at a regional or municipal level . Some, but by no means all, local and regional children and youth parliaments are subsidised from municipality and regional government budgets. In Austria, The Austrian Child and Youth Advocate Offices (Ombudspersons) / \u00d6sterreichische Kinder- und Jugendanwaltschaften 39 are funded by the provinces (L\u00e4nder). In Portugal, there has been a growing use of participatory budgets at a municipal level, since the creation of the Children and Youth Participatory Budget initiative in 2006 40 , although levels of take up have varied across the country 41 . In Sweden, many local governments publish specified budgetary allocations for children and young people but this does not extend to identification of specific ring-fenced funding for participatory activities per se. As with the national picture, a lack of transparency in relation to budgets has been a common criticism. Some good practice examples were found, however, for particularly proactive municipal authorities. One of these examples relates to the City of Opatija (Croatia), where the municipal authorities assign a dedicated children\u2019s budget. Children\u2019s participation is reflected in the activities to be funded, although not as a specific strand of funding, and is also reflected to some extent in the processes for accounting and reviewing \u201c We in Opatija have a special budget item for Children\u2019s Council activities... children suggest certain activities for the city budget. After the budget is accepted, children receive an explanation for which of their suggestions were accepted [Sic.], which were not and why not. Children also receive a brochure called \u201cChildren\u2019s budget\u201d in which everything is explained. \u201d (Municipal Representative, Croatia) The mapping exercise found a strong role for NGOs in the field of child participation and as such potentially an additional strand of private funding. However, in many countries NGOs received financial support from public authorities so there is the risk of \u2018double-counting.\u2019 As with public funding, it was difficult to robustly identify specific budgets allocated for participatory activities, beyond where a specific project was funded. 38 United Nations Children\u2019s Fund (2013).

        "Evaluation of legislation, policy and practice on child participation in the European Union (EU) March 2015 18 2.2.5 Approaches taken to implement legislation Compliance with the standards set out in Article 12 UNCRC cannot be measured only with reference to whether or not individual Member States have adopted provisions in their law determining the status of children and their rights. The legal basis for compliance has invariably required further legislation to be set in place; referring to the participatory standards under Article 12 UNCRC (as further interpreted in General Comment No. 12). Actual progress with strengthening the legal basis for children\u2019s \u2018participation\u2019 rights within the individual Member States was usually found to have taken place incrementally - through a raft of secondary legislation at a national level; and sometimes indirectly - through measures intended to strengthen children\u2019s rights in a wider context rather than always with UNCRC as a main driver. In Croatia, for example, there has been a succession of legislative changes over the past decade to strengthen children\u2019s participation. These have included: the Family Law Act 42 (rights and responsibilities in the relationships of parents and children, including provisions for guardianship and custody disputes); Child Ombudsman Law 43 ; Law on Education in Primary and Secondary Schools 44 ; Social Welfare Act 45 ; Foster Care Act 46 , and Youth Councils Law 47 . The latter instituted the National Council of Students, and gave it a duty to represent all students of primary and secondary schools, with regard to matters affecting their lives, work and education . Importantly, these changes to the legal framework have also been accompanied by policy development, and in 2013 child participation was included as a high- level goal for the national strategic document for children (2013-2020, unpublished at time of writing). Similarly, Austria ratified the UNCRC in 1992, with reservations enabling Government to implement the Convention by passing its own, separate laws. Nearly twenty years later, in 2011 the Federal Constitutional Act on the Rights of the Child ( Bundesverfassungsgesetz \u00fcber die Rechte von Kindern / BVG 48 ) was adopted, elevating some child rights to constitutional status, including the right to participation. The implementation of Article 12 has not always been possible without also undertaking wider reforms to the framework for children\u2019s rights, as has been the case in much of Eastern Europe. 42 Family Law Act, Official Gazette, 116/03, 17/04, 136/04, 107/07.

        "Evaluation of legislation, policy and practice on child participation in the European Union (EU) March 2015 19 Table 2.3 Bulgaria case study: legislative reforms relating to Article 12 In Bulgaria, the introduction of a national child protection system has provided a focal point for the implementation of Article 12 and other child rights legislation. A significant part of this process has been to challenge normative values relating to children\u2019s roles within society as \u2018property\u2019 of parents, which have posed a barrier to more rapid implementation of Article 12 \u2013 especially at regional and municipal levels. The CRC principles were adopted in May 2000, with the Child Protection Act 49 . This addressed (Art. 12 and Art.13) the right of the child to express their own views and to be informed and consulted. In 2003, secondary legislation was created to the Child Protection Act, which stipulated the need to inform and consult with children for the development of child protection plans. This legislation also included provisions that the child may be informed and consulted without the parents\u2019 knowledge or consent. This text introduced for the first time the hypothesis that the child\u2019s best interests may not coincide with that of the parents. Bulgaria then went through a series of legislative reforms to set in place a basic infrastructure for promoting child rights, and a child protection system, culminating in a National Strategy on the Child 2008-2018 50 , which aims to guarantee children the right to local and regional participation, and the Charter of the Children\u2019s Council 51 , which has introduced a Mechanism for Child Participation at all levels. In contrast to this example, the situation in Denmark is different again. The country expert for Denmark, who is also a prominent academic in the field of child participation, observed that public and political awareness contributed towards rapid progress following the ratification of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child in 1994. However, the Danish system is quite weakly affiliated with Article 12. The stakeholders who were interviewed had differing views on the merits of this approach. Some asserted that Denmark has not relied to such a great extent upon UNCRC because child rights were already heavily instituted within alternative legislation, whilst others perceived this as a relative weakness, due to the lack of a universally accepted definition of child participation that can be rooted in international treaties. 2.2.6 Challenges for implementation The country research underlined that legislation alone is not guaranteed to safeguard children\u2019s participation rights. The subsequent interpretation (and enforcement) of legislation has also presented a number of challenges, which are summarised below. 2.2.6.1 Exemptions and restrictions Various interpretations have been applied to the ratification of Article 12 by Member States, which preclude its implementation to the benefit of all children. In Austria, the BVG Kinderrechte does not include all the rights protected under the UNCRC. In particular, the \u201csocial and cultural rights\u201d of children are missing, which was a controversial point of discussion between the ruling political parties and child rights NGOs. In Denmark, the legislation concerning non-nationals is dictated primarily by immigration law, which puts some groups of children on a lower status with regard to Article 12. Belgium also adopted the convention on the rights of the child with \u201cinterpretations\u201d, and additional protocols have come into effect since then to reinforce the legal position. However, the protocol of 19 December 2011 enabling children to submit an official complaint about specific violations of their rights, had not yet taken effect at the time of writing this report. 49 Child Protection Act, (2000, and. 2013): http://www.lex.bg/bg/laws/ldoc/2134925825 50 National Strategy on the Child, 2008-2018 (2008): http://www.strategy.bg/StrategicDocuments/View.aspx?lang=bg-BG&Id=464 51 http://sacp.government.bg/detsko-uchastie/mehanizm-na-detskoto-uchastie/ ",
        "Evaluation of legislation, policy and practice on child participation in the European Union (EU) March 2015 20 Age restrictions present another dimension, with national legislation often excluding specific groups of children by definition. For example, in Austria legislation giving children a legal capacity in defining consent to medical treatment and extended rights to file applications, only applies to individuals over 14 years of age. Similar age limits can be found across the EU28 in relation to judicial and administrative proceedings (being restricted to children from 12 years upwards in Belgium and 10 years in Bulgaria for example). 2.2.6.2 Problems with enforcement and application One of the principal barriers to implementing legislation is that very few countries have set in place a specific framework for assessing compliance with Article 12, or identified appropriate indicators or a monitoring mechanism. Indeed, much of the challenge to the status quo has come through the mandate of UNICEF to provide an independent analysis of the situation through its country reports; particularly in those countries that do very little of their own monitoring. Very few countries were found to have imposed remedial actions in the event of non- compliance, or publicised the existence of such actions where they do exist. Indeed, Member States were found to have a limited number of remedies at their disposal outside of a legal enforcement context with regard to specific pieces of legislation. The issue remains that Article 12 is still relatively untested in case law, and its implementation is more limited in sectors where case law is better established (this usually includes immigration and asylum). One country expert gave the example of the 2011 Austrian Federal Constitutional Act on the Rights of the Child ( BVG Kinderrechte) . Although the Act is rooted firmly in Article 12 UNCRC and has a strong legal basis, it is feasible that other specific pieces of legislation may contradict it but remain valid until such a time as they are declared unconstitutional by the Constitutional Court. A lack of specialist legal training for professionals is a further contributory factor, which can make the enforcement of legal provisions difficult. One expert in Bulgaria commented that: \u201cThe law stipulates the possibility for a child younger than 10 years to participate in such [judicial and administrative] proceedings if his or her stage of development permits it. However, this has practically almost never been enforced by a court or administrative body because professionals who are supposed to prepare the child lack the necessary competence to conduct an individual assessment of the child\u2019s development stage.\u201d (National Expert, Bulgaria) Moreover, the issue of legal guardianship can serve to short-circuit potential legal action: \u201c[In Bulgaria] there are no legal mechanisms for guaranteeing the child\u2019s right to express views in judicial or administrative proceedings in the case where their interests do not coincide with those of the parents or legal guardians.\u201d (National Expert, Bulgaria) ",
        "Evaluation of legislation, policy and practice on child participation in the European Union (EU) March 2015 21 2.2.6.3 Lack of awareness of legal disposals Much of the legislative apparatus surrounding Article 12 UNCRC is far removed from public view, and only a limited number of examples of promotional campaigns were found within the country research, where Governments sought to make the legal position more widely understood by both children and adults. For example, in Austria there was reported to have been limited publicity surrounding the Federal Constitutional Act on the Rights of the Child (all children), whilst single cases receive high media coverage and public interest. A lack of child-friendly information was also cited as a problem, even in those instances where legislation affords children with certain participation rights. In Bulgaria, for example, children have a right to be heard and consulted on certain medical procedures, but there is no state funded provision of information for children via medical information centres. 2.2.6.4 Structural, political and cultural factors Across the EU28, it is possible to identify a series of shared challenges relating to participation policy, legislation and its promotion. These tend to be primarily cultural, structural and historical in nature. The most formalised of these challenges is that of governance structures; especially in federal or decentralised countries such as AT, BE and DE. In such instances the devolution of powers has led to occasions where there is disparity between regions in terms of either funding allocations or the depth of relevant legislation: \uf0b7 In Austria, the federal government is only responsible for enacting basic legal standards in the field of youth welfare (Art. 12 of the Constitution 52 ), while legislation on implementation and enforcement is the responsibility of the nine provinces/L\u00e4nder, which also develop regional youth policies. The result has been divergence in the standards and definitions, including age criteria for \u201cchildren\u201d and \u201cyouth\u201d, In turn, this has repercussion for children\u2019s participation within specific sectors and settings, given that the responsibilities for the L\u00e4nder and communities/Gemeinden include youth welfare, social protection, housing, planning and education. Similarly in Germany, legislation is reported to be divergent between regions. \uf0b7 Within Belgium also, the coordination of the rights of the child is led by the federal authority, the regions (Flemish, Walloon, and Brussels-capital) and the communities (Flemish, French, and German-speaking). Legislative development has not always been equal within the three communities, resulting in some disparities in how children\u2019s rights are implemented. Historically, Article 12 was implemented via separate entities for the different communities. However, the formation of the Belgian National Commission on the Rights of the Child (NCRC) in May 2007 53 provided a central mechanism for the Belgian State for the first time. This has had a centralising influence, bringing together around 90 actors in the field of children\u2019s rights. A challenge facing a large proportion of countries is the legacy of totalitarian rule. In Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Estonia, Poland, Portugal, Slovakia and Spain we can see how decades of totalitarian government hampered the development of participation as a principle. In turn this means that even in light of recent legislative developments the countries are still attempting to catch up to others such as the Netherlands and Sweden where a political organisation, public awareness and wider culture have combined to normalise participation. Even in countries such as Bulgaria where participation did exist during communism, it was characterised by child and youth organisations ideologically linked to the Communist party and serving its agenda, not dealing with children's rights or serving a child-led agenda. 52 \u00d6sterreichische Bundesverfassung (Austrian Federal Constitution) 1920/1929 http://www.bmeia.gv.at/fileadmin/user_upload/bmeia/media/4-Oesterreich_Zentrale/182_bv_deu_eng_frz.pdf (Selection) 53 http://www.ncrk.be/ ",
        "Evaluation of legislation, policy and practice on child participation in the European Union (EU) March 2015 22 The more cultural aspects of public awareness and attitudes play a key role in determining the success or otherwise of child participation measures in many of the countries analysed. On the one hand there are some instances where the public seems to have a low awareness of child participation, its objectives or its benefits linked invariably to views of childhood and the status of children. The country experts concluded this to be the case in LT, AT and FI, based on the interviews and desk research. Nonetheless, Finland does have a well-developed participation system \u2013 implying that awareness can boost effectiveness but a lack thereof does not necessarily stop progress being made. On the other hand there is the underlying challenge presented by shared cultural attitudes, especially paternalism. \u201cI note with regret that, to a large extent, Cypriot families remain tied to the traditional model, which expects a child to be fully dependent on the parents, a passive recipient of their care and wishes.\u201d (National Stakeholder, Cyprus) Numerous countries demonstrate a paternalistic cultural attitude base that could undermine the spreading of child participation norms and ideas, despite existing legislative frameworks. In most European countries, the dominant view is still that adults decide what is right for children, in spite of legislation that provides for participation opportunities. 2.2.7 Influence of the Council of Europe Recommendation on Child Participation The terms of reference for the study required that child participation was examined in the context of the existing EU and international standards, including the Council of Europe Recommendation on child participation 54 . Based on information gathered through the mapping, countries can be grouped according to what they have done pursuant to the Recommendation (see Table 2.4 ). By far the largest group of countries are those where awareness of the Recommendation is limited amongst stakeholders and dissemination or promotion has not occurred to any extent. Where stakeholders commented on the reasons for the lack of activity, in some cases it was felt that the Recommendation did not add anything new to the legislation and policies that existed at a national level. \u201cNothing specifically has been done because it is considered that the existing policies cover the topic.\u201d (Country Expert, Romania) Additionally, the necessity of an additional document on child participation was questioned when the UNCRC already had a high profile as a piece of international law in the field. Other stakeholders suggested that the lack of activity in response to the Recommendation was because it was not specific enough with it being more of an overall statement that did not translate easily into specific legislation of actions. In contrast, in ten countries, it was reported that activity had been undertaken in respect of the Recommendation. For some countries, the Recommendation was reported as a welcome driver behind the overall pursuit of child participation : \u201cThese initiatives are welcomed, since they put pressure on governments to do something with it and they increase their cooperation with experts and NGOs.\u201d (Country Expert, Slovakia) 54 https://wcd.coe.int/ViewDoc.jsp?id=1927229&Site=CM ",

        "Evaluation of legislation, policy and practice on child participation in the European Union (EU) March 2015 24 2.2.8 Other drivers for child participation Beyond Article 12 there are some important drivers for child participation across the EU that have been identified in this research. The third sector with its variety of NGOs and civil society organisations was frequently mentioned as a catalyst for work on child participation. These were seen as important in countries regardless of geographic location: \uf0b7 Austria, especially through the Child Rights Network \uf0b7 Belgium, including the work of the UNICEF National Committee in collaboration with domestic partners \uf0b7 Bulgaria, again recognising the importance of the UNICEF National Committee \uf0b7 Croatia, with the Union of Societies of Children, founded in the 1950s operating nationally through 100 local Societies \uf0b7 Germany, through the role of Government-funded NGOs \uf0b7 Ireland, through a wide array of child and youth NGOs \uf0b7 Romania, especially prior to accession to the EU when NGOs such as Save the Children led the way for child participation; and, \uf0b7 Slovenia, predominantly the UNICEF National Committee, and Association of Friends of Youth, organised on local and national level. NGOs and the agenda setting work that they undertake are not the only drivers identified. Another key driver is the presence of domestic youth organisations that mirror national and regional governance structures. 2.3 Participation in practice \u2013 structures and mechanisms This section examines the main structures and networks that exist within Member States, and the mechanisms through which children\u2019s participation is achieved. 2.3.1 Child and youth structures at national Level The country mapping found that nearly all Member States have some form of participatory child and youth structure at national level; often working alongside other child rights organisations and maintaining close communication with Ombudsmen. A full listing of these mapped organisations is found at Annex Three . \uf0b7 A National Youth or Children\u2019s Council 56 has been established within all 28 Member States, including separate arrangements for the German, Flemish and French Communities of Belgium. The national youth councils often provide an umbrella function for local councils, and have a formal process to elect standing members through a national \u2018call\u2019 for representation. In Luxembourg and Latvia the National Youth Council plays a coordinating role for youth NGOs across the country. This is also the case in the UK, but the British Youth Council additionally runs a number of youth-led networks 57 \uf0b7 A national Child or Youth Parliament was found within 12 Member States 58 . In contrast to the Youth Councils, the Parliaments tend to meet for a relatively short period of time \u2013 typically once or twice per year, to gain experience of parliamentary work and to debate issues of significance to children. The Bulgarian Child and Youth Parliament draws its membership from local youth parliaments within 35 Bulgarian cities. 56 Across countries these structures are broadly the same, the specific name of the structure \u2013 \u2018Youth\u2019 versus \u2018Children\u2019s Council\u2019 - varies between countries depending on the age range of children involved. In some countries, the age of members of the youth councils can be up to 30 years old, while typically children\u2019s councils involve children up to age 18. 57 These include: the UK Youth Parliament, Young Mayor Network, Local Youth Council Network, National Scrutiny Group and Youth Select Committee.

        "Evaluation of legislation, policy and practice on child participation in the European Union (EU) March 2015 25 Time-limited activities were also supported in BG, LT, RO, SI and the UK as part of the Youth Parliament Project (YPP) 59 , which was run by the European Council and IDEA to establish new children and youth structures and to develop training for local authorities, NGOs, youth and social workers. Furthermore, National Committees (NCs) have been established within individual EU Member States to support the European Youth Parliament (EYP), albeit with an international focus 60 . In some cases, these national child and youth structures are supported and subsidized by central Ministries. For example, the National Students Council in Croatia is managed and funded by the Ministry of Science, Education and Sports. In Bulgaria and the Czech Republic the national child and youth parliaments are supported by the adult National Parliament, which has served to strengthen the links between the child and adult-led structures. The country mapping evidence suggests that the influence of these national forums differs considerably. In Austria, for example, the Austrian National Youth Council/ Bundesjugendvertretung is the main political representative body of Austrian young people (until the age of 30), and is empowered to have a say in all important political decisions. A similarly \u2018strong\u2019 role in national decision-making is reported for the role of the Dutch National Council (Netherlands). The numbers of members of National Youth Council are typically small, however, resulting in some criticism that they lack the capacity to \u2018represent\u2019 the child population. Child or Youth Parliaments benefit from engaging larger numbers of children and young people, but some stakeholders commented that they are constrained in their ability to influence policy or practice due to meeting infrequently. In Luxembourg, more formal mechanisms are being explored to bring the Youth Parliament closer to the National Parliament, with the aim of engaging more directly in political processes 61 . The country mapping also identified a wider range of NGOs, child rights organisations and networks acting in a support or advocacy role for child participation at a national level within Member States. The Youth Red Cross take an active role in supporting children\u2019s projects in Denmark, whilst Save the Children have a strong presence in Finland and Sweden.. The existence of networks representing more specific groups of children was less evident through the mapping exercise. However, some examples of structures were found to support children and young people in care. In both HU and SK, children\u2019s parliaments have been established exclusively to represent children living in residential care. These parliaments operate at a regional level in Slovakia 62 , within four regions, and at a national level in Hungary, with participants elected at a regional level by children in care homes. In the UK (England), local networks supporting children in care have been afforded a more formal status, through legislation requiring each local authority to establish a \u2018Children in Care Council 63 \u2019. These Councils have a direct link to senior officials; allowing children in care to express their views about the quality of services and support they receive. The work of the Councils is further reinforced by the requirement for local authorities to publish a local \u2018Pledge\u2019, setting out the 59 http://www.agora-parl.org/sites/default/files/EC-IDEA%20-%20The%20Youth%20Parliament%20Project%20- %20English%20-%20PI.pdf 60 Founded in 1987, the EYP is an international NGO with over 5,000 active members aiming to promote cultural and citizenship education.

Overall, these structures can be separated into more schools-based councils that operate within the educational system and those that shadow municipal or regional government . The table below provides an overview of the principal types of fora that were identified within each Member State through the mapping study.

This covers all groups of children. Each town municipality also has a youth policy strategy 74 There are no specific councils or forums at a local level within Malta, but there is a national Children Council (Kunsill tat-Tfal), which was created under the Commissioner for Children Act of 5th December, 2003:http://justiceservices.gov.mt/DownloadDocument.aspx?app=lom&itemid=8928&l=1. At a local level most organised activities take place via school student councils, which are often run in conjunction with other local organisations. 75 Since 2001, the Dutch Government has funded a national umbrella organisation for youth participation called the Dutch Youth Council (NJR), which has performed a consultative role in relation to policy changes regarding children. Between 2012 and 2015, the responsibility and budget will be transferred to municipal government. Municipal governments have indicated they will focus on prevention, early support and the self-empowerment of child and family. 76 Legally constituted within article 5b, section 2 and 3 of Local Government Act of 8 March 1990 (Dz. U. z 2001r.

        "Evaluation of legislation, policy and practice on child participation in the European Union (EU) March 2015 28 As the table shows, the arrangements differ between MS along the following lines: \uf0b7 Well-established children and youth councils or forums exist at a regional level within AT, BE and DE; reflecting the devolved governance structure in these Member States. The children\u2019s parliaments in SI also have regional coverage 80 , as do some of the youth councils in PL (which vary in their geographical scale and scope). \uf0b7 Equivalent structures are also found at a municipal or local level within AT, BE, BG, CY, DK, EE, EL, FI, FR, HR, IE, IT, PL, PT, RO and SE. Their coverage varies considerably, however, with fewer Member States having a youth council or forum in every municipality. The exceptions to this are where Member States have passed specific legislation requiring a structure to be put in place; as is the case for some of the more longstanding structures like the children\u2019s town councils in France 81 . \uf0b7 No prescribed structure was identified for children and youth forums in LT, LU, LV, MT, and NL. In the case of NL, LU and LV, it would seem that this is because children\u2019s participation has traditionally focused on consultation activities, centring on a \u2018Youth Plan\u2019 rather than on membership of representative organisations (see also Local and Regional Government, in Chapter 3). For LT, MT and RO, the main youth forums exist at a national level, with arrangements being less well developed at a municipal level, In the case of Latvia, the highest level of activity at a local level is carried out by schools rather than municipalities, under the coordination of the Schoolchildren Parliament and School Children Union (2000). Furthermore, these structures are sometimes \u2013 but not always \u2013 differentiated on the basis of age. Children\u2019s councils generally provide an opportunity for children in the pre-teenage years to gain experience and opportunities to participate in civic and political life; including meetings with mayors or city councillors, and collaborative projects with a focus on specific issues within the local community. Youth councils tend to cater for older age groups; often including young people in their \u201820s (up to 30 years old in Belgium and Greece). They are more likely to have a statutory (legal) basis, and act in an advisory capacity to adult forums. In Croatia, there is continuity for children and young people, who can join a children\u2019s council at the age of 9-14 years, and progress to youth council membership if they wish to do so. In Estonia, however, the absence of a formalised children\u2019s council system means that children do not qualify for membership until their teenage years, and are more reliant on school-based associations up until this time. The interview evidence shows that children and youth councils can provide a direct access route for children to engage in local decision-making processes, on the condition that they are adequately resourced and supported. This view was widely expressed by stakeholders interviewed for AT, BE, EE and IE. In countries where these structures are now well established, one of the main success factors was thought to be their \u2018strong\u2019 legislative basis or their introduction as part of a national strategy, to assist with some degree of uniformity or minimum standards country-wide (Estonia and Ireland). This has sometimes been achieved through a series of reforms, to progressively extend the powers of the councils. In the French Community of Belgium, for example, the decree of Dec 15 th 2006 extended the requirement for children and young people to be involved in the design of local youth policy plans, to their active participation \u201c when executing the actions \u201d. This step extended child participation from policy development to policy implementation. 80 Parliaments start every year in each Slovenian primary schools (age 6-15), continue at a regional level, and finish at a national level. 81 The children\u2019s town councils (Conseils communaux d\u2019enfants et de jeunes) in FR are another distinctive participatory structure. Founded in 1979 during the International Year of the Child at the City of Schiltigheim, an extended network now includes 2,500 children\u2019s town councils in France involving 7 to 25 year olds. ",
        "Evaluation of legislation, policy and practice on child participation in the European Union (EU) March 2015 29 Two examples of particularly well established networks of municipal children and youth councils can be found in Estonia and Ireland: \uf0b7 In Estonia, the municipal youth councils have had very close ties with the equivalent adult structures, and are reported to have \u201c \u2026engaged young people concretely in issues that are relevant for them\u201d (Estonian expert). A recent study found that the engagement of children and young people was identified as a distinct goal within half of Estonian municipal development plans. There has also been a widespread cultural acceptance of young people\u2019s municipal engagement, which comes with responsibility \u2013 they are expected to actively participate. \uf0b7 Similarly in Ireland, the local youth councils (Comhairle na n\u00d3g 82 ) have become synonymous with children and young people\u2019s municipal participation. One Irish expert study described them as \u201c\u2026 the bedrock of child participation in Ireland\u201d. In 2011, an independent evaluation of the participation goal in the National Children\u2019s Strategy was conducted on behalf of the Department for Children and Youth Affairs (DYCA) 83 . The evaluation reached the following conclusions with regard to the Comhairle: \u201cThe vast majority of organisations and young people involved in the Inclusion Programme would not have had access to participation structures without this targeted support, demonstrating the need for a dedicated support programme in this area.\u201d (2011, p.115) The country mapping shows that few Member States have been able to achieve this level of success. As with other aspects of child participation, one of the main challenges has been translating legislation into practice: \uf0b7 In Greece, despite having a firm legal basis for local youth councils 84 , many difficulties arose during the implementation phase, and only a very few councils have been activated. At present, the General Secretariat for Youth has opened a discussion for restructuring the legal framework. \uf0b7 In Croatia, many cities and local municipalities have not established youth councils even though they are obliged to by the law. According to one national expert, the main problem is the fact that there are no sanctions for failing to meet the legal requirements. There have also been varying interpretations of the conditions for establishing councils; selecting members, and running activities. This has resulted in some municipal councils being organised and run by political parties for their own objectives. Furthermore, a 2011 survey of council members revealed that children had concerns about not being taken seriously by adults, and felt that their suggestions were rarely taken into account. 85 82 http://www.comhairlenanog.ie/ 83 Department of Children and Youth Affairs, \u2018National Consultation with Children and Young People on the New National Children\u2019s Strategy (2012-2017)\u2019, [online], http://www.dcya.gov.ie/viewdoc.asp?DocID=1528 [accessed 11 September 2013]. 84 Local Youth Councils-Law 3443/2006 85 \u017di\u017eak, A., Koller-Trbovi \u0107 , N., Je \u0111 ud Bori \u0107 , I., Maurovi \u0107 , I., Mirosavljevi \u0107 , A., Ratkajec Ga\u0161evi \u0107 , G.

        "Evaluation of legislation, policy and practice on child participation in the European Union (EU) March 2015 30 A further challenge for children and youth forums is to ensure that they attract young people from diverse cultural and socio-economic backgrounds, and that they are representative of the local communities that they serve. The evaluation report of the Comhairle in Ireland concluded that more targeted work is needed: \u201c[There is a need for] more specific information provision for organisations; practical presentations to make the participation structures more understandable and tangible to organisations working with marginalised children; inclusion of a broader range of organisations\u201d. (DYCA, 2011, p.115) The mapping data also highlights the difficulties presented by a devolved governance structure, which has made it challenging to maintain a coherent national framework (Austria). Different levels of municipal and popular support have also resulted in patchy coverage in some Member States (CZ, EL, FI, DK, HR, and IT). 2.3.3 Mechanisms and processes to support children\u2019s participation Drawing upon the framework developed by Lansdown (2011 86 ); the country mapping sought to examine different types of participation using the following categories (see Section 1.3.3 for a further description): 1. Consultation 2. Collaboration 3. Child-led activity 2.3.4 Consultation There was a clear trend across countries for forms of child participation that involve \u2018consultation\u2019 and the gathering of children\u2019s views. It was common that consultation activities were pursued as singular or time limited activities relating to a specific policy or project initiative. Consultation was most evident in numerous participation initiatives pursued in children\u2019s local surroundings where children\u2019s views or opinions were sought in relation to the planning of a particular development that had the potential to impact strongly on children\u2019s everyday lives. One common example cited in various countries was consultation on the planning of new or adaptation of existing playgrounds to allow children\u2019s views to influence the design or location. Another example, from Luxembourg, was the creation of an information point with feedback boxes to allow young people to provide their views on the local Youth Action Plan 87 and to determine issues to be tackled in subsequent annual plans. Equally there were some examples of on-going processes that allowed consultation. Most commonly the numerous examples of councils, fora or parliaments operating at local, regional and national level were used as a consultation mechanism by a range of adult agencies. In other examples, consultation is more ad hoc. For example, the Children\u2019s Commissioner in Cyprus has developed a programme of visits to schools entitled \u201cVoice your Opinion 88 \u201d, aiming at informing educators and children on the role of the Commissioner and at exchanging views with children. 86 Available at: http://resourcecentre.savethechildren.se/library/framework-monitoring-and-evaluating-childrens- participation-preparatory-draft-piloting 87 Local youth action plans were created to respond to the needs for a knowledge-based and process-oriented tool for the local and regional youth policy. 88 Commissioner for the Rights of the Child, Annual Reports 2009, 2010, 2011 http://www.childcom.org.cy/ccr/ccr.nsf/DMLannualRep_gr/DMLannualRep_gr?OpenDocument ",
        "Evaluation of legislation, policy and practice on child participation in the European Union (EU) March 2015 31 A common mode of participation is the design and implementation of research with children, to elicit their views and opinions on issues affecting them . There were numerous examples of this; either as a stand-alone activity or a mechanism used to broaden the reach of existing structures as a regular or one-off activity. Some examples are described in the following table. Table 2.6 Children\u2019s participation in research \uf0b7 In Italy, the NGO \u2018For the Rights of the Child\u2019 (Per i diritti dell'infanzia e dell'adolescenza, or \u2018PIDIDA\u2019) conducted a one-off survey of 22,000 children in 2010 89 . The survey sought to explore the concept of participation with children, and covered all aspects of CRC. \uf0b7 In Denmark, the national Children's Council maintains a Children\u2019s Panel of 1000 children. The panel is surveyed four times a year to gather views on a range of issues. The results are used to produce reports on relevant topics, which are subsequently made public 90 . \uf0b7 The Austrian Youth Monitor ( Jugendmonitor 91 ) is a representative opinion survey, which is part of the Austrian Youth Strategy and regularly (since 2010) collects children\u2019s and young people\u2019s opinions on different topics (800 respondents aged 14 to 24). In October 2012, children\u2019s and young people\u2019s opinions towards participation were in the focus of this survey. \uf0b7 In England young researcher networks exist to promote and support children\u2019s role in research. Two of the most prolific of these are The Young Researcher Network at the National Youth Agency 92 , which has developed a toolkit for other organisations seeking to promote child or youth-led research, and the Children\u2019s Research Centre 93 at the Open University. The Centre was formed in 2004 and is run by a multidisciplinary academic team, who support children and young people to design and implement their own research projects, and also undertake evaluation to establish the benefits of child-led research. \uf0b7 In Cyprus, the Ombudsperson for the Protection of Children\u2019s Rights launched an action plan and campaign in 2008 entitled \u201c Children have a Voice \u201d. This provided a focal point for a large number of activities including workshops, meetings and research focussed on the participation rights of children. \uf0b7 In Luxembourg, the General Conference of the Luxembourg Youth (Conf\u00e9rence G\u00e9n\u00e9rale de la Jeunesse Luxembourgeoise) 94 convenes a Youth Convention (Jugendkonvent) every two years, to gauge the opinions of attitudes of young people regarding politics and society. The event is supported by the Ministry of Family Affairs and Migration, and features moderated workshops, and research activities which seek to gather children\u2019s views, which are in turn discussed with national parliamentarians and party representatives. 89 PIDIDA (2010) Un mondo a nostra misura.

        "Evaluation of legislation, policy and practice on child participation in the European Union (EU) March 2015 32 2.3.4.1 Collaboration Emerging from the mapping were some examples of more collaborative participation activities. It was most common for children to be involved collaboratively at the design and planning stage of the policy or programme cycle, but to a lesser extent in subsequent stages of decision making, implementation and evaluation. One example of involvement at the planning stage from Cyprus was a small group of young people recruited to act as Youth Advisors 95 to work alongside the Children\u2019s Commissioner in determining priorities and activity for the subsequent year. Similarly, UNICEF Slovenia has trained younger children as Junior Ambassadors within their schools, to work with teachers; to make suggestions on activities to be pursued within the school, and to be actively involved in their delivery. As an indicative example of input at the later implementation stage of the cycle, one municipality in Luxembourg recruited young people to sit alongside adults on the steering group overseeing the implementation of the local youth action plan. In another example from Romania, one national stakeholder described the collaborative work of NGOs and children, in the context of the IMPACT programme 96 : \u201cWhen carrying out an IMPACT project by a team [consisting of children aged 12 to 18, coordinated by one or two teachers or student leaders], children are asked by leaders in what field they want to develop their next project, according to the needs of the community that can benefit. Children are the ones who identify the problem and come up with solutions/actions, but discussions are coordinated and moderated by the leader. Therefore, both listening to children and working with adults is important.\u201d (Country Expert, Romania) As illustrated by these examples, most collaborative participation was found within the context of work undertaken by specific child and youth institutions or projects, rather than within everyday life. 2.3.4.2 Child-led A handful of potential examples of child-led participation were found within the study. Some local youth movements were identified as being almost entirely child-initiated and run, and operating outside of an adult-led structure. According to one national expert, for example youth groups in BE are typically \u201c \u2026well-anchored within their local communities, and\u2026 can be quite \u2018child-led\u2019 in their formation \u201d. The same qualities apply to some youth movements in HR, BG and HU, and to the \u2018child welfare groups\u2019 in Finland: \u201cThese initiatives are coming more from the children themselves, because \u2018older\u2019 children take the lead, and because they have different ways of working\u2026 they can invite adults to the meeting and they have invited the President, who is interested to listen to them.\u201d (Country Expert, Finland) 95 For further information on Youth Advisors, view the Commissioner for the Rights of the Child, Annual Reports 2009, 2010, 2011. http://www.childcom.org.cy/ccr/ccr.nsf/DMLannualRep_gr/DMLannualRep_gr?OpenDocument 96 http://impactromania.com/ ",
        "Evaluation of legislation, policy and practice on child participation in the European Union (EU) March 2015 33 2.3.5 Training and professional development The country mapping found that child-rights training and development is generally most widespread amongst professions with a child-centred role, such as kindergarten and school teachers, youth workers and social workers . There were mixed views on the sufficiency of this training, however, with some stakeholders (from AT, EL, EE, FI and UK) expressing concerns that UNCRC and Article 12 do not feature prominently within initial teacher training, that the inclusion of child rights within school curricula is too ad hoc 97 , and that a greater focus is needed on acquiring the practical skills to facilitate participation. These issues are also documented to a varying degree within UNICEF country reports. 98 A number of Member States are taking practical steps to strengthen training amongst professionals who work with children in a variety of contexts, in recognition of these issues. According to one NGO stakeholder in Romania, the Ministry of Education has launched a programme the \u201cEducation Campaign on Child Rights\u201d, which includes awareness-raising materials and the development of a new child rights module to be delivered by Teacher Training Houses as part of in-service training for teachers. In Finland, the Ministry of Education and Culture has established a working group to develop a national communications strategy on children\u2019s rights. Amongst their priorities is reviewing how education on children\u2019s rights and participation can be arranged for professionals in various fields as part of their basic education and as a continuing education 99 . A similar working group has been established in Austria ( ARGE Partizipation 100 ). This work has received greater impetus following the creation of a number of transnational networks aiming to share knowledge in the field of child rights. These networks included the European Network of Masters in Children's Rights (ENMCR), which was founded in 2004 and includes a membership of 28 Universities covering BE, EL, ES, HR, LT, NL, PT, DE, SE, IT, RO, UK 101 , and the Children\u00b4s Rights Erasmus Academic Network (CREAN), which aims to develop interdisciplinary approaches for studying child rights. The latter includes 29 Universities within its membership, covering AT, BE, CY, DE, DK, EE, EL, ES, FR, HR, HU, IE, IT, LT, LV, NL, PL, PO, RO, SE and UK 102 . Research undertaken for another recent EU-wide study (2013) 103 found that mandatory training is provided to professionals working with children in the criminal justice system in 20 Member States. Of these professionals, police who are in regular contact with children were the most likely to receive some form of training in child friendly justice (14 Member States 104 ), followed by judges (12 Member States 105 ), public prosecutors (11 Member States 106 ), and defence lawyers (7 Member States 107 ). Mandatory training is delivered to all four key professional groups in CZ, EE, FR and IT. This mandatory training is typically provided by Ministries (Justice or Social Affairs). 97 In Finland, one Non-Governmental stakeholder described how the levels of awareness of child rights differ amongst teachers on a regional basis, with a more established tradition of pupil education on UNCRC within Northern Finland. 98 Including FR and ES.

        "Evaluation of legislation, policy and practice on child participation in the European Union (EU) March 2015 34 Training is also provided in some Member States for public officials to raise awareness of child rights within national and municipal government. In the UK (Wales and Northern Ireland), this training was provided until recently through a central coordinating mechanism, but in each case funding was time-limited and has now expired: \uf0b7 In Wales (UK), a central Participation Unit was established in 2004 with funding from the Welsh Government Children and Family Grants Scheme and the European Social Fund. The Unit was run by Save the Children Cymru to oversee the development of national participation standards and to provide training to organisations and public officials 108 . The Unit closed in 2013, but a smaller training function has been retained to ensure that all government departments have sufficient knowledge of UNCRC to implement the mandatory Children\u2019s Rights Impact Assessments. \uf0b7 The Northern Ireland Government (UK) funded a Participation Network between 2007 and 2012 to undertake capacity-building for child participation within the public sector, working closely with NGOs . Other options are being considered to train public officials following the closure of the unit, such as matching individual NGOs with specific policy areas. \uf0b7 According to one national stakeholder in Estonia, a smaller scale project exists where the Department of Youth Affairs and National Youth Council have jointly developed the \u2018Participation Caf\u00e9\u2019. The project offers special meetings and events for public officials to learn about youth participation. NGOs and Ombudsmen have taken a prominent role in delivering training around child rights and the UNCRC, often supplementing the training provided by national government, or being directly commissioned to deliver aspects of this training. This is particularly the case in BG, CY and PL, where the stakeholder interviews indicate that NGOs are the main source of rights- based training for professionals. In CY, the Commissioner provides annual training to groups of professionals on UNCRC and child rights, which has subsequently been included within the curriculum of the Police Academy as part of their core training for officers. In BG, there has been very significant NGO involvement in the delivery of professional training. The following case study example describes the role that has been played by one such NGO. Table 2.7 Good practice example \u2013 championing of child-friendly standards and training (Bulgaria) In Bulgaria, an NGO called the Social Activities and Practices Institute (SAPI 109 ) has played a major role in developing child-friendly standards and practices for the justice sector since 2009. This has included a programme of specialized training for social workers and psychologists on how to prepare and accompany a child in hearing procedures, alongside guidance for judges, investigative officers and prosecutors. Standards were introduced for child-friendly interviewing procedures in 2012, which extend to the use of customized interviewing rooms and recording equipment for children. The work of SAPI was reported to have helped gone some way towards rectifying the overall low levels of professional awareness of child participation in the justice sector in Bulgaria, which are documented in Section 2.2.6.2. The country mapping highlighted challenges for ensuring that knowledge and awareness of UNCRC is embedded at a municipal level. This is a particular issue for Member States with a devolved governance structure, but has been a consideration for all Member States in ensuring sufficient access to training country-wide. A lack of systematic training for municipal officials was identified in BG, DK, EE, SE and PL, with stakeholders raising concerns about gaps in coverage. In Sweden, the Ombudsman for Children has received Government funding to support each local authority with delivering training to professionals and to meet their commitments under Municipality Law. 108 http://www.participationworkerswales.org.uk/consortium-unit.aspx 109 www.sapibg.org/ ",

Some individual municipal authorities have also taken the initiative to develop their own training. The province of Vorarlberg (AT) was cited as one such example, where all professionals who work with children and young people benefit from a very comprehensive local training programme supported by the municipal authority (\u201cKinder an die Macht\u201d) Table 2.8 Good practice example \u2013 delivering child participation training at a municipal level (CZ) The \u201aKeys for Life\u2018 project was a major four-year venture (2009-13) led by the Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports (MEYS) and the National Institute of Children and Youth (NICY), with the aim of Developing Key Competences in Leisure-Time and Non Formal Education 111 . One of the topics of the national project covered the themes of children and youth participation and active citizenship. Within this theme, a training course on children and youth participation was developed for the regional coordinators who manage child and youth participation activities. The Czech Republic is divided into 14 regions, and each region has its representative who attended the course in 2010. In the period from 2010-2011 a total of 106 youth workers from leisure centres and youth NGOs were trained in this course. Finally, from August 2011 to June 2012, 42 selected projects on youth participation and active citizenship were piloted in selected leisure centres and youth NGOs across the country. Although the project has not been independently evaluated, the activities were thought to have achievd an impact on policy and strategy development: \u201cThanks to to our cooperation with the Ministry of Education, Sports and Youth, the project outputs are reflected back to the strategic documents which significantly influence leisure-time and non-formal education of children and youth in the Czech Republic as well as the professional training of educators who work with them\u201c (Project Manager, Keys for LIfe) Finally, a number of examples were found of training for children to build skills and competences for effective participation. These examples tended to relate to time-limited projects with additional funding, such as action research (Italy and the UK), although there was some evidence of on-going training. In the Netherlands, for example, the Youth Council has established a \u2018trainers\u2019 pool\u2019, which includes specific training for children and young people on participation, alongside training for public and private organisations. There has also been a strong tradition of participation training for children within the UK, including the accredited Act by Right 112 programme (England, UK), which aims to develop research and advocacy skills; and a toolkit developed by Education Scotland working with the Scottish Youth Parliament to strengthen pupil councils: \u201cV3 Vote, Voice, Valued 113 \u201d (Scotland, UK). 110 This training is provided centrally by the Union of Association of Our Children (Savez dru\u0161tava Na\u0161a djeca), and takes place on a continuous basis for all adults who work as mentors for Children\u2019s Forums and Children\u2019s Councils. 111 http://www.nidm.cz/projekty/realizace-projektu/klice-pro-zivot/klice-pro-zivot-2009/project-keys-for-life-2009 112 http://www.actbyright.org.uk/ 113 Scottish Pupil Councils, V3 (Vote, Voice, Valued) Training materials http://www.syp.org.uk/v3-pupil-council- training-W21page-193- ",
        "Evaluation of legislation, policy and practice on child participation in the European Union (EU) March 2015 36 In conclusion, the country mapping found a diverse range of training and development programmes in place across the EU to support child participation. Whilst steps are being taken in many Member States to ensure that practitioners have access to resources, however, the visibility of child rights training remains low within training programmes for professionals working with children in different contexts. In particular, the country evidence suggests that there is too often an implicit assumption that teachers and social workers are knowledgeable about the UNCRC without this knowledge being systematically applied or tested. NGOs and Ombudsmen play an important role in raising levels of knowledge and awareness, but coverage remains patchy at a municipal level in many Member States and there is a reliance on time-limited funding. Affording a legal basis to local forums and councils would appear to have been effective in helping to access funding and support from government. In turn, this has helped to ensure that municipalities are able to retain sufficient numbers of trained adults to sustain these structures. Training for children to develop the skills to participate is a comparatively overlooked area of practice, and warrants closer attention. ",
        "Evaluation of legislation, policy and practice on child participation in the European Union (EU) March 2015 37 3.0 Child participation within key sectors, settings, and in relation to vulnerable groups of children Key findings Participation in different sectors and settings \uf0b7 Coverage of Article 12 and its interpretation is varied across the EU at a sector level. Legislation relating to child participation is the most visible within the education, care, and justice sectors, including asylum and immigration, where Article 12 is covered in all 28 Member States. The child\u2019s right to be heard is the most clearly defined in decisions affecting their immediate welfare \u2013 through adoption, custody or, care proceedings. Implementation has often proven challenging, however, and the arrangements for child participation are found to vary significantly in practice between individual Member States. \uf0b7 Within the health sector, the most widespread examples of legislation relate to children\u2019s consent to individual medical procedures and treatments. Provisions within Member States differ according to the qualification criteria for consent, with some imposing a de facto age limit and others determining eligibility in accordance with the maturity or competence of the child. Children generally have fewer opportunities to participate in developing, planning and reviewing healthcare services. \uf0b7 The education sector shows the most widespread evidence for legislation relating to Article 12. All Member States include some degree of provision for child participation within their general Education Act or Code. In many countries, children\u2019s participation is instituted through school councils. These structures are the most widespread for students of secondary school age, but are less evident for primary school students. The participation of younger children is highly variable, but some good practices exist. \uf0b7 Beyond participation in student councils, the mapping showed a more worrying picture with regard to \u201ceveryday\u201d mechanisms for children\u2019s participation in their education. Children are rarely consulted on curriculum development, and fewer mechanisms were identified to support children\u2019s individual participation in relation to subject choices, learner support, assessment, and making complaints. \uf0b7 Child participation was less clearly defined in national legislation for recreation, culture and local planning decisions. However, an abundance of \u201ceveryday\u201d examples of practice were found at a local level. Many of the strongest examples of children\u2019s participation in their \u2018everyday lives\u2019 are initiated through school, family, and community where interactions take place with their peers and adults.

        "Evaluation of legislation, policy and practice on child participation in the European Union (EU) March 2015 38 Participation of vulnerable groups of children \uf0b7 The participation rights of Roma children, migrant children, and children with disabilities were consistently found to have been overlooked or under-valued, across a wide range of sectors and settings: \uf0a7 Social exclusion, discrimination and low levels of participation in education have had a direct impact on the opportunities for Roma children and their families to participate more widely in society; \uf0a7 There are also limited provisions in many countries to meet the needs of migrant children, for whom difficulties with legal status, stigma and access to resources present additional barriers to being heard, and having views and opinions taken into account; and, \uf0a7 Significant barriers to participation exist for children growing up in institutional care. \uf0a7 Approaches to improve the situation for vulnerable groups of children have included legislative change; to ensure parity of rights with other children; the provision of individual coaching and mentoring services, and training for other professionals to meet these children\u2019s social, cultural and educational needs. 3.1 Introduction This chapter examines the situation for children\u2019s participation within specific sectors of public policy, and the settings where adults\u2019 interactions with children take place. It first presents the evidence from the country mapping with regard to whether Article 12 UNCRC is evident within key national legislation for each sector within the EU28, and whether General Comment No 12 has been applied. It then goes on to examine in further detail the situation for children within these different settings, and to compare and contrast how participation has been implemented in different countries. Finally, the chapter examines the participation rights of vulnerable groups of children across Europe, and some of the good practices that exist. 3.2 Sector coverage of policy and legislation The country mapping sought to establish the situation for child participation for the main sectors of public and social policy. In particular, it sought to establish how or whether Member States have introduced legislation corresponding with Article 12 of UNCRC. During the first phase of the mapping, the situation was explored across nine sectors , drawing upon the headings used in the Implementation Handbook for the Convention on the Rights of the Child 114 , and supplemented with those identified by the European Commission in the ToR. Table 3.1 below provides a breakdown of this coverage. The sectors are shown in bold, with further settings listed underneath. 114 United Nations Children\u2019s Fund, 2007.

The sampling criteria for the settings included whether there was evidence of: a) specific challenges facing children\u2019s participation warranting further exploration, and/or b) specific good practice. This approach allowed for a deeper level of analysis, and to compare and contrast the situation in different Member States. The findings are further explored within this chapter. 3.3 Evidence for UNCRC Article 12 within sector legislation The table below presents a summary of the situation for child participation the nine main sectors that were reviewed for each of the 28 Member States. The table shows those countries for which there was clear and direct evidence that Article 12 UNCRC is reflected within the relevant sector legislation. 115 To provide consistency with the separate study to collect data on children's involvement in judicial proceedings in the EU, these three categories were proposed by the Commission at the inception meeting.

Legislation was almost universal within the education, care, and justice sectors (including asylum and immigration), where Article 12 is covered in legislation in all 28 Member States. The specific arrangements vary according to criminal, civil and administrative law. A comprehensive study was recently published by the European Commission, which provides a full breakdown of children\u2019s involvement in criminal, civil and administrative justice proceedings across the EU28 116 . The analysis also clearly identified some sectors where legislation specifically promoting participation is lacking. There were very few examples of specific legislation covering Article 12 within the media, although examples of good practices for children\u2019s participation in this sector were identified. Likewise legislation promoting participation that covered the recreation and play sectors was less comprehensive. This is in contrast, however, to some good examples of participation activity on the ground that were identified in other parts of the mapping exercise. 3.4 Implementation in practice within key sectors and settings The following provides a summary narrative for each sector, with reference to examples from specific settings within them. 3.4.1 National government and overall policy and law-making The situation with regard to National Government was found to be a mixed one across the EU28. As discussed in Section 2.1, the position of Article 12 UNCRC relative to the Constitution of individual countries is a key factor in the visibility afforded to children\u2019s participation within overall policy and law-making . This has inevitably affected the degree of influence exerted on other areas of social policy. 116 European Commission Directorate-General Justice (2013) Summary of contextual overviews on children's involvement in criminal judicial proceedings in the 28 Member States of the European Union LINK (http://bookshop.europa.eu/is-bin/INTERSHOP.enfinity/WFS/EU-Bookshop-Site/en_GB/-/EUR/ViewPublication- Start?PublicationKey=DS0313659) ",
        "Evaluation of legislation, policy and practice on child participation in the European Union (EU) March 2015 42 The study underlined that children and young people\u2019s participation in political processes remains significantly under-developed across the EU. This is particularly demonstrated with reference to the voting age. Austria is the only EU Member State that has legislated to lower the voting age to 16, although other Member States have watched with interest and shown some intentions to follow suit 117 . The evidence from the Austrian case suggests that this has largely been successful, with a relatively high turnout amongst younger voters 118 . The move is also linked to a raised level of awareness and interest in politics amongst young people 119 . The 2013 Flash Eurobarometer report on young people\u2019s participation in democratic life provides a further insight to political participation across the EU 120 . A total of 12,927 young people between the ages of 15-30 were interviewed, of whom over half reported having voted in a political election at the local, regional or national level in the past three years (56%). Whilst the Eurobarometer extends beyond the age range of interest for the present study, it is perhaps significant that young people at the lower end of the age range within the survey (16- 19 year olds) were the most likely to indicate their intentions to vote at the 2014 European elections 121 . This indicates potentially unmet demand for political enfranchisement from young people who are not currently eligible to vote in national elections on the grounds of their age. A number of mechanisms were identified through the country mapping, to promote levels of engagement of children and young people in politics. Youth debates provide one such example. In the Netherlands, the National Youth Debate ( Nationaal Jeugddebat ) 122 brings together young people who have won several rounds of a competition and politicians. The debate covers subjects important to youth, and is widely disseminated in the media. This approach was highlighted within the country study as being one of the most visible and widely acknowledged forms of youth participation in the Government sector. 3.4.2 Local and regional government and services The legislative situation with regard to regional and local government is strongly influenced by the internal governance structure of individual Member States: \uf0b7 Article 12 is evident within the constitutions of individual regions within some devolved or federal countries, including AT and DE, thereby affording a strong legislative basis to child participation. \uf0b7 In Germany, a number of L\u00e4nder have introduced further regional laws lowering the voting age to 16 123 in district elections, whilst Scotland (UK) has also lowered the voting age to 16 years for the forthcoming referendum on independence 124 . \uf0b7 Arrangements at a local level are generally driven by the status of children within the Acts of Local Government or their equivalent, and / or through supplementary guidance surrounding youth councils or parliaments. In Estonia, the Local Government Organisation states that youth work is the responsibility of local government, but the conditions of youth work and youth participation at local level are specified in Youth Work Act 125 . 117 See for example in the UK: http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/labour/10250506/Labours-pledge-to-lower- voting-age-makes-coalition-more-likely-Lib-Dems-say.html 118 AUTNES (Austrian National Election Study) http://www.autnes.at 119 Zeglovits, E.

        "Evaluation of legislation, policy and practice on child participation in the European Union (EU) March 2015 43 3.4.2.1 Municipal planning and governance Legislation relating to municipal planning can be distinguished to some extent on the basis of whether child participation is made implicit or explicit. According to one national expert in the Netherlands, the new Social Support Act ( Wet Maatschappelijke Ondersteuning 126 ) obliges each municipal authority to ensure the full participation of all of its residents. There is no special mention of child participation or the UNCRC within this legislation. In Germany, Law \u00a7 47 f Gemeindeordnung 127 in Schleswig-Holstein is rather more unambiguous, and states that children must be included in the planning and decision making in all cases where their interests are affected. Thus the onus falls on municipalities to make this participation possible. Nevertheless, the Dutch Youth Council (NJR) has worked closely with 95% of municipalities in NL to set in place a \u2018Participation Plan\u2019. This has been managed as a consultative exercise, involving children and young people, planners and municipal officials: \u201cIn terms of political participation at municipal level; one third of the municipalities provide youth with an opportunity to voice their opinion on changes through a consultation, or stimulate them to come up with ideas themselves. Rather than providing \u2018unwanted\u2019 advice, nearly two thirds of the municipalities support the development of new initiatives developed by children. This is especially the case in large municipalities.\u201d (Country Expert, Netherlands) A further area of child or youth-led planning relates to accountability for public funding. In PT, a Children\u2019s and Youth Participatory Budget has been established, with the aim of giving children a more tangible influence over public spending decisions. Since the fund was introduced, participatory budgeting has taken place between children and adults for a number of local projects 128 . National youth legislation typically provides the main basis for ensuring that children and young people have a say regarding youth services budgets and expenditure. In LU, for example, the Youth Act (2008) 129 requires municipalities to secure the participation of children and young people in drafting a Local Youth Action Plan (Plan Communal Jeunesse) before it is possible to secure financial support for public youth institutions. At a more practical level, we have already considered how youth councils and children\u2019s parliaments have provided one of the most well established mechanisms for children\u2019s participation in municipal decision-making within the EU (refer to Section 2.3). These structures have played an important role in giving children experience of civic and political life, and have sometimes \u2018mirrored\u2019 adult decision-making structures. 3.4.2.2 Sustainable urban development A significant amount of child participation has taken place in relation to sustainable development, and the expansion of cities and towns in particular. The UNESCO Growing Up in Cities (GUIC 130 ) project tackled some of these issues during the 1990s, and has been a source of good practice. In the EU, however, the Child Friendly Cities Initiative (CFCI) is one of the more widely known programmes.

Habitat II identified children\u2019s wellbeing as a key indicator for healthy and democratic urban life. The CFCI \u2018movement\u2019 has gathered momentum since then through an international network of local and national government bodies and civil society organisations. An International Secretariat of CFCI was established at the UNICEF Innocenti Research Centre in 2002. The Secretariat has supported the development of a CFC Framework for Action, which sets out the criteria for awarding Child Friendly City status, grounded in UNCRC. The Framework outlines 9 \u2018building blocks 133 \u2019 for a Child Friendly City, each of which includes a checklist to assist with monitoring progress: 1. Ensure children\u2019s participation 2. Have a child friendly legal framework 3. Develop a city-wide children\u2019s rights strategy 4. Create a children\u2019s rights unit or have a coordinating mechanism 5. Ensure a child impact assessment and evaluation 6. Have an appropriate children\u2019s budget 7. Ensure a regular state of the city\u2019s children report 8. Make children\u2019s rights known among adults and children 9. Support independent advocacy for children The Secretariat lists examples of CFCI programmes operating within 10 EU Member States 134 , but does not claim to be exhaustive. The evidence from the country mapping indicates that CFCI has become particularly well established in France, Spain, and Italy, with examples of CFC activities also reported in Belgium, Denmark, Portugal and Slovenia. Examples include the following: \uf0b7 In France, some 246 towns and cities in FR have been awarded child friendly city status following a national launch by UNCEF France and the Association of French Mayors 135 . Participating towns must engage with children and young people, through structures to listen to their views, as well as improving access to education and facilities for this age group. \uf0b7 In Spain, CFC operates under the banner of the Child Friendly Municipalities programme (Ciudades Amigas de la Infancia 136 ) a total of 62 municipalities have achieved the CFC status. The programme is overseen by the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs, the Spanish Federation of Municipalities and Provinces and the Local Network for Children\u2019s Rights and uses a child rights-based certification scheme modelled on the CFC Framework. \uf0b7 In Italy, the CFC movement has also achieved wide coverage at a municipal level, including examples where children have been actively involved in urban development. In one such example, children were involved in the re-design of city pedestrian routes, as a collaborative project with city planners 137 . 131 http://childfriendlycities.org/ 132 http://www.unhabitat.org/categories.asp?catid=9 133 http://childfriendlycities.org/building-a-cfc/checklist/ 134 Including BE, FR, DE, HU, IE, IT, NL, ES, SE, and the UK 135 www.villesamiesdesenfants.com 136 www.ciudadesamigas.org 137 http://www.cittasostenibili.minori.it/ ",

These forms of consultation are usually initiated and overseen by adults. A further approach is where children inform decisions about planning and development on a larger scale. Examples include the \u2018 Kinderforum \u2019 in Stuttgart (Germany), which involves an annual consultation exercise with children aged 5-13 from across the city to decide how the city should look and how to renovate and build. The forum is supported via schools, with children presenting their ideas to town planners and officials. A review of the project showed that around 80% of children\u2019s ideas were carried forward into local planning decisions. The \u201cCapital of Children\u201d 138 project in the city of Billund (Germany) has a similar focus, with a child panel contributing their ideas towards an on-going regeneration project, alongside adult planners. Two further examples of good/effective practices are described below. Table 3.4 Good practice example \u2013 Children\u2019s participation in urban planning (Sweden) Trafikverket (The Swedish Transport Administration), Boverket (The Swedish National Board of Housing, Building and Planning) and Folkh\u00e4lsoinstitutet (The Swedish National Institute of Public Health) have worked closely to improve the level of child participation in urban planning. From 2010 \u2013 2012 they launched the \u2018 It Gets Important When It\u2019s for Real Project 139 \u2019 , aiming to develop processes of child participation in daily urban planning. 138 http://www.capitalofchildren.com/ 139 Det \u00e4r viktigt n\u00e4r det blir p\u00e5 riktigt\u201d (It\u00b4s important when its for real) project by Trafikverket \u2013 The Swedish Transport Administration, Boverket \u2013 The Swedish National Board of Housing, Building and Planning.

The redevelopment included regular meetings between children aged 6\u201315 and urban planners and architects. Some children worked with photos, others with drama and others with models. The children played a key role in shaping the area, and results included environmental improvements and a park for small children. ",
        "Evaluation of legislation, policy and practice on child participation in the European Union (EU) March 2015 46 Table 3.5 Good practice example \u2013 Children\u2019s participation in renewing a City Master Plan (Italy) Municipal authorities in Empoli (Italy) undertook a consultation exercise, to assist with updating the City Master Plan 140 . Surveys were carried out with school pupils across the city to establish their views, and this was followed-up with workshops with children from two local neighbourhoods. The findings resulted in specific changes to the original Master Plan, with the inclusion of additional green spaces and pedestrianised access areas; two new public meeting spaces, and a restoration project to convert a historic building into an \u201curban farm\u201d for children. One criticism of youth projects relying on the goodwill of municipal leaders is that they are vulnerable to changes in the political or funding climate. In Slovakia, one stakeholder described a public participation project involving a large number of children aged 15-18 years, who had worked alongside officials to develop a \u2018shadow\u2019 plan. Following a change of Mayoralty, the project was set aside and the proposals went no further. In Germany, a new federal law on construction has been implemented, which obliges organisations to consult with children for new public projects. This is subject to differences in implementation by individual Lander, but adds a further potential strengthening mechanism for upholding children\u2019s rights in this area. Examples were also found where a lack of participation in planning or redevelopment decisions has had a negative impact on children. In Romania, the stakeholder interviews highlighted concerns about policies relating to construction and social housing. These policies were thought to have disproportionality impacted upon families in poverty and Roma communities, who have very limited participation rights 141 . 3.4.3 Care Legislative provisions relating to Article 12 were found to be widespread within the care sector across the EU28, due to the immediacy of decisions affecting individual children (i.e. relating to custody and guardianship). Specific legislation of some kind was found in all Member States, outlining a principle that children should be consulted and their views heard in decisions and processes affecting their care. However, there was variation in the extent to which this legislative framework covered specific care settings and processes (e.g. child protection, alternative care, custody, and adoption decisions) as opposed to a general principle of participation. The latter was most common where the relevant legislation was an overarching children\u2019s act or code, for example the Children\u2019s Act 142 in the UK or the Child Welfare Act 143 in Finland. In Croatia, for example, more specific legislation existed in the form of the Foster Care Act, which addressed this specific setting. The age at which legislation specified that children were to be consulted also differed across Member States from 10 years (Romania) to 15 years (Sweden). In Greece and Spain it was reported by national stakeholders that while existing legislation provides only a weak reference to child participation rights in the care sector, it is expected that children\u2019s opinions and feelings would be discussed between the child and their social worker or legal representative as part of the processes involved. 140 Francis, M. and Lorenzo, R.

        "Evaluation of legislation, policy and practice on child participation in the European Union (EU) March 2015 47 3.4.3.1 Child protection and alternative care Child protection is the process of protecting individual children identified as either suffering, or likely to suffer, significant harm as a result of abuse or neglect. Across Member States measures and structures exist to prevent and respond to such abuse and neglect. This often results in the removal of children from the home environment and their placement in an alternative care setting such as family-based care (fostering) or residential/institutional care. In well over half of Member States (AT, BE, BG, CY, DK, FI, HR, HU, IE, IT, LT, LU, PT, RO, SE, SI, SK and the UK), specific legislation outlines a requirement for children to be heard in cases of child protection. For example: \uf0b7 Austria, where the new Federal Child and Youth Welfare Act ( Bundes- Kinder und Jugendhilfegesetz ), adopted in March 2013, states that children\u2019s and young people\u2019s views have to be considered with regard to clarification of the presumed endangerment of child welfare, before decisions for out-of-home-care are taken 144 . \uf0b7 Slovenia, where Article 410 of the Act Amendng the Civil Procedure Act 145 states that any child who is capable of understanding the proceedings and the consequences of their decisions, has the right to express his/her opinion about their care. Depending on age and other circumstances, a judge invites the child to have an informal interview in court or with a mediator present. The child may select a trusted adult to attend the interview to assist with expressing his/her opinion. \uf0b7 In Bulgaria, the Child Protection Act 2000 obligates the court and the administrative body - the Child Protection Department - to hear the child before announcing a child protection measure 146 . \uf0b7 In Croatia the Foster Care Law prescribes that a \u201cc hild in foster care has the right to be informed of all phases of removal from their family.\u201d 147 \uf0b7 In the UK, the 1989 Children\u2019s Act outlines that during child protection processes \u201ca court shall have regard in particular to ... the ascertainable wishes and feelings of the child concerned.\u201d 148 Despite the general principle of child participation promoted through legislation covering the care sector and these specific legislative frameworks, the implementation of child participation in child protection cases is generally poor. In practice, in AT, BG, EL, ES, HR, HU, IE and PL national stakeholders reported that children\u2019s views are typically either not taken into account or they are informed once the decision has already been made to remove a child from the home environment due to child protection issues. This is because most child placements in alternative care due to child protection concerns are carried out in cases of abuse requiring urgent removal, and so participation regarding alternative placement is essentially nominal as the state has a duty to act. Stakeholders in CY, EL, and HU also highlight a lack of training - both of judges to implement participation within the law, and experts involved in the process. One good example of a child participation structure within the child protection context, however, is the Children\u2019s Counsellor in custody proceedings in Austria. In proceedings and custody visitation rights, a representative is appointed for the child if the case is highly controversial. The Counsellor follows proceedings with the child, and communicates the child\u2019s opinions and concerns to the court. Evaluation shows that in more than half of cases, the child\u2019s wishes were taken into account in the judge\u2019s decision 149 . 144 Bundes- Kinder und Jugendhilfegesetz (Federal Child and Youth Welfare Act) 2013 www.parlament.gv.at/PAKT/VHG/XXIV/BNR/BNR_00709/fname_295630.pdf 145 Zakon o spremembah in dopolnitvah Zakona o pravdnem postopku (ZPP-D), Act Amending the Civil Procedure Act, Retreived August, 15, 2014, from http://www.pisrs.si/Pis.web/pregledPredpisa?id=ZAKO5040 146 Child Protection Act (2000, last amd. 2013). www.lex.bg/bg/laws/ldoc/2134925825 147 Foster Care Act, Official Gazette, 99/11, /narodne-novine.nn.hr/clanci/sluzbeni/2011_08_90_1921.html 148 Children\u2019s Act 1989. www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1989/41/introduction 149 Krucsay, Brita; Pelikan, Brita (2008) \u201eBericht der Begleitforschung zum Modellprojekt \u201eKinderbeistand\u201c.

        "Evaluation of legislation, policy and practice on child participation in the European Union (EU) March 2015 48 Other structures exist, before the decision of placement, such as the Committee for Special Youth Care in Flanders (Belgium), which supports the child or young person and allows for mediation involving the parents. Consent is sought if the child or young person is at least 12 years old. However, the children must be heard even if they are younger. Once in alternative care, children\u2019s participation tends to involve inputs into their own care plans (BG, EE, IE, LT) or they have options for different forms of participation by influencing decisions that concern their life in an institution (AT, BE, DE, DK, NL, SK, and the UK). Examples include decision-making with regard to the improvement of services, new activities, and the purchase of certain things. In Germany, the Bundeskinderschutzgesetz (2002) introduced the obligation for care institutions to introduce a complaints and participation procedure. All new care institutions are required to have this measure in place before approval is granted. In Greece, there is no legal provision for child participation in residential care, but the rules of public residential institutions allow for the formation of \u201cchildren\u2019s groups\u201d to take a more active role in decision-making. There are countries with examples of individual institutions demonstrating a good level of child participation, for example in DK, NL and the UK. In Northern Ireland, children are supported to peer-review children\u2019s homes and in the Slovak Republic, the majority (60%) of children with experiences of care felt listened to and that their views were taken seriously, suggesting evidence of effective participation, although the specific structures for participation were not detailed in the study 150 . Systematic and formalised examples of children\u2019s participation in the monitoring and inspection of alternative care arrangements can also be found in the UK (Young Inspectors in Scotland) and Sweden. The Swedish case is further explained below. Table 3.6 Good Practice Example for Child Participation in Care: \u2018Focus on Children\u2019s Needs\u2019, Sweden 151 In Sweden, a voluntary system of monitoring and evaluating children in care has been developed. The Barns Behov I Centrum (BBIC) (Focus on Children\u2019s Needs) system was developed by the National Board of Health and Welfare in the early 1990\u2019s and is now used by almost all of Sweden\u2019s 290 municipalities. BBIC advocates a holistic view of the child as a competent individual and highlights for those agencies adopting the method an obligation to listen to the child in the care process and to make the child the centre of the intervention. It is a quality system that contains methods for research, planning and evaluation of children in social care, by providing prompts for social workers to ask a child if she/he wants to state their opinion at all meetings or contacts as well as templates for interviewing the child to establish their opinion at relevant stages of the process. Elsewhere, however, despite legally obligatory, the level of children\u2019s involvement in decision- making or influencing has been found to be limited (e.g. BG, DK, EL, FI, HR, IE, and PL). In Denmark, for example, there is an overall statute stating that before making any decisions on care plans, an interview with the child must take place 152 . However, in practice stakeholders reported there are large variations on how these interviews and the involvement of children are assured. In other countries (for example Bulgaria and Finland) despite the legislative framework it was reported that child welfare workers do not have sufficient time to support children to participate in determining the direction of their care. 150 \u2018 Child and Youth Participation in the Slovak Republic: A Council of Europe policy review\u2019 , Council of Europe, Strasbourg, 2012 151 www.socialstyrelsen.se/barnochfamilj/bbic 152 Law on Social Services LBK nr 810. 19/07/2012 ",
        "Evaluation of legislation, policy and practice on child participation in the European Union (EU) March 2015 49 A lack of a participatory culture was often cited as a key barrier to implementation of participation at the level of institutions. Regarding wider participation, in AT, BG, HR, CZ, DK, FI, IE and the UK there are specific structures to ensure children in alternative care are able to participate at a national or local level to support developments in the setting as a whole. These are as follows: \uf0b7 In the Czech Republic, Young Circle 153 (Kruh mlad\u00fdch) is an informal group of young people from foster care which aims to engage young people in decision-making and influence change at the regional and national levels. In several regions they have successfully established cooperation with the statutory agencies involved in the protection of children and representatives from one group has on occasion met representatives from the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs demonstrating potential national influence. \uf0b7 The Irish organisation Empowering People in Care (EPIC) 154 is an independent organisation enabling young people who are in care to speak out and be heard in relation to their own lives. \uf0b7 In the UK (Northern Ireland), Voice of Young People in Care (VOYPIC) 155 is an independent regional children\u2019s charity that seeks to empower and enable children and young people with experiences of care to participate fully in decisions affecting their lives. Within VOYPIC, looked after children have the opportunity to play an active role via formal e-consultations, completing the \u2018Our Life in Care\u2019 survey, via the young people\u2019s blog and as Young Reps, a group of young people living in care aged 16 to 25 from across Northern Ireland. Voices from Care Wales 156 (Wales, UK) also focuses on involving young people living in care in the decision making process. \uf0b7 The Young Developers Group 157 in Finland consists of working groups of children with experience of child welfare services and social workers, who meet twice per month to discuss care issues. The results are positive, and the young people report no longer seeing themselves as just child protection clients, but as experts by experience. \uf0b7 More widely the youth parliaments in Ireland, UK, Finland and Sweden have places specifically reserved for children in care as a further opportunity for children from this setting to participate. In other examples, adult led forums or organisations facilitate participation for children living in alternative care settings. In Croatia, for example, youth representatives who sit on the Forum for quality foster care 158 are acknowledged as promoting participation for children in care. In the Netherlands, the state agency responsible for overseeing alternative care supports the production of a newspaper targeted at young people aged 12-18 living in care to provide information on their rights. In Bulgaria, Finland, Ireland and the UK one-off events or consultation activities have successfully promoted and fostered the participation of children in alternative care. The \u2018We believe in you \u2013 so should you Tour\u2019 was organised by the Children\u2019s Ombudsman across Finland in 2011, to consult with children in care through seven forum meetings and where services for children in care were evaluated with the purpose of developing alternative care services. 153 www.kruhmladych.cz 154 www.epiconline.ie 155 www.voypic.org 156 www.voicesfromcarecymru.org.uk 157 \u201c Young developers \u2013 a new method to increase participation\u201d, Presentation in the 3 rd European Conference for Social Work Research (ECSWR 2013) by Kati Palsanen 158 www.udomiteljizadjecu.hr ",
        "Evaluation of legislation, policy and practice on child participation in the European Union (EU) March 2015 50 It resulted in clear messages which have been used as a main starting point for change. This includes investment in professional training 159 . The Irish Department of Children and Youth Affairs carried out a national consultation in 2011 with 220 children living in care, ranging in age from eight years to young adults, and published the findings in a publication entitled Listen to Our Voices! 160 . In early 2012, the Teenagers and Children Talking in Care (TACTIC) group \u2013 comprising 13 children and young people who are in or have been in care \u2013 was formed to act on the recommendations of the report. In Bulgaria, the process to develop a national strategy to deinstitutionalise care setting gave a central role to child and youth organisations which included children from specialised institutions. 3.4.3.2 Custody decisions and adoption In other aspects of care, such as parental custody proceedings, specific legislation or structures exist (in AT, HR, DK, DE, EE, ES, HU, SE, and the UK) to bolster the general legal framework for participation. In Croatia, for example, the Family Law Act prescribes consultation with children in the legal proceedings in divorce cases. In practice, however, the existence of a legal framework does not guarantee that the child\u2019s right to be heard is respected in all instances or taken into account in the final custody decision. This is at the discretion of the individual judge hearing the custody case. Further information on participation in respect of this care setting is provided in chapter 3.4.5 examining it in the context of the civil justice setting. The participation of children in adoption cases was explicitly articulated in legislation and process documents in all Member States, with a clear focus on gaining the child\u2019s consent for the adoption. The age at which it is considered appropriate for child to give their consent varies, as shown in Table 3.7. Table 3.7 Age of consent for adoption decisions Age of child Member States 5 years AT 161 7 years IE 162 10 years EE, LT, RO, SL 12 years BE, DK, EL, ES, FI, HR, LV, NL, SE, UK (Scotland) 13 years FR, PL 14 years BG, DE, HU, IT,MT 15 years LU No age stated CY 163 , CZ, SK, UK (ex.

        "Evaluation of legislation, policy and practice on child participation in the European Union (EU) March 2015 51 As the table illustrates, the age at which children\u2019s consent is obtained for adoption decisions ranges from five years of age in Austria, to 15 years of age in Luxembourg 164 . In Austria, policy makers were heavily involved in developing standards for the new European Convention on the Adoption of Children. These were subsequently integrated into Austrian legislation in the Family Law Amendment Act ( Familienrechts-\u00c4nderungsgesetz 2009 165 ). In Ireland, under law when an adoption order is being made in relation to a child who is over the age of seven years, the Adoption Authority must \u201c give due consideration to the wishes of the child, having regard to his or her age and understanding 166 \u201d. In Bulgaria, the law supposes not only child participation in the judicial adoption process, but also the child\u2019s full consent in the final placement decision. As confirmed by a Bulgarian national stakeholder: \" It is mandatory to conduct informational meetings between adoption candidates and the child in order to assess the level of the established emotional connection between the two parties; before the child\u2019s full consent is attained .\u201d (Legal Expert, Bulgaria) Four Member States (CY, CZ, SK, and UK excluding Scotland) do not mention any age of consent. Some Member States also impose specific conditions upon whether the child\u2019s views are heard and taken into account. In Cyprus, the consent of the child should be asked \"\u2026 if his/her age or spiritual capability permits that .\" 167 In the case of Spain, the law requires that the child be heard from 12 years, but consent is not mandatory within adoption decisions. 3.4.4 Asylum and immigration Asylum and migration was a further area where relevant legislation has restrictions in its coverage. The provisions relating to participation were almost exclusively concerned with recognising the right of unaccompanied children to be heard. Many countries had only weak provisions; mainly because children in most countries have few rights, and limited opportunities for participation. The right to be heard is enshrined in EU law through a series of Directives and Regulations 168 which cover all aspects of the asylum process for children, with provisions made that all action should be in the best interests of the child. Specific asylum and migration legislation is evident in a number of countries (BE, ES, FI, IT, SP, SE, and SK). For example, in Finland the Section 6 of the Aliens Act 169 (301/2004) contains provisions on migrant and asylum seeking children; it states that the best interests of the child should be paid attention to before a decision is made concerning a child who is at least twelve years old, and that the child shall be heard unless such hearing is manifestly unnecessary. In Belgium, an unaccompanied child is heard, as soon as they are deemed competent, for the purpose of asylum 170 . 164 http://ec.europa.eu/civiljustice/news/docs/study_adoption_synthesis_report_en.pdf - 165 Familienrechts-\u00c4nderungsgesetz (Family Law Amendment Act ) 2009 http://www.ris.bka.gv.at/Dokumente/BgblAuth/BGBLA_2009_I_75/BGBLA_2009_I_75.html 166 Adoption Act 2010 section 24(2) http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2010/en/act/pub/0021/sec0024.html 167 Law19( \u0399 )/1995 - Law to Provide for the Adoption 1995, paragraph 4. http://www.mlsi.gov.cy/mlsi/sws/sws.nsf/All/B96F1BC34B2419FBC2256E820032FA73/$file/Law%20to%20Provide%2 0for%20the%20Adoption%20Law%201995.pdf?OpenElement 168 DG Justice (2014) EU acquis and policy documents on the rights of the child 169 http://www.finlex.fi/en/laki/kaannokset/2004/en20040301.pdf 170 Derde Periodiek rapport van Belgi\u00eb betreffende het internationaal verdrag inzake de rechten van het kind, (Juli 2008): http://www.kinderrechtencommissariaat.be/sites/default/files/bestanden/belgisch_derde_en_vierde_periodiek_rapport _kinderrechten.pdf ",
        "Evaluation of legislation, policy and practice on child participation in the European Union (EU) March 2015 52 The main limitations with regard to child participation in this sector concern the following: \uf0b7 Implementation - in Spain, although the law recognises the right for unaccompanied children to be heard, this is not systematically implemented according to experts interviewed for the study. \uf0b7 Conditionality - in Sweden, the Aliens Act (2005:716), states that a child should be heard, \u201c if it [Sic.] is not found improperly \u201d 171 . The same restriction is found for the election or suspension of a representative 172 , which has been criticised by the UN 173 and the Ombudsman for children in Sweden. \uf0b7 The status of the child - in the Slovak Republic, according to the Asylum Act No. 480/2002 174 , children have the opportunity to be heard in asylum-seeking cases only when they are unaccompanied. In other cases, their parents or legal representatives are heard. Slightly fewer than half of Member States provide guardianship or a legal representative for children seeking asylum (AT, BG, CY, DK, FI, FR, IE, RO, SE, SI and SK). The legal basis differs between Member States, and is sometimes based on legislation related to care (Ireland is one example), whereas in other cases this derives from specific asylum and immigration laws (AT, FI, FR, SE, and SK). The function of guardianship also varies. In Bulgaria, unaccompanied migrant children's participation is to some extent enshrined in legislation via their guardian and the orientation centre (OOC 175 ). Each child receives a guardian, who performs and advocacy role, which includes listening to the child\u2019s story and their aspirations 176 . Whilst there is no legal basis for the participation of unaccompanied children in Bulgaria, they do receive a coach (a social worker) upon arrival. Officials who were interviewed for the study considered that real efforts were being made to engage with these children, but that practice can vary depending on the individual social worker assigned to them. In Finland, some young asylum seekers are supported through peer-to-peer counselling, in addition to having a legal representative 177 . Table 3.8 Good Practice Example for Children Seeking Asylum: Peer-to-Peer Counsellors in Finland The project, run by the Finish Refugee Council and funded by the EU, provides young asylum seekers (12-18) with counsellors at two reception centres. The counsellors provide information and social support to the children, including what their options are and what they can tell the police. The counsellors have different backgrounds, gender, ages (20-55); they are migrants and/or former asylum seekers. They receive a specific training, including on health and mental health and on the organisation of activities (leisure) with asylum seeking children. Specific attention is given to the fact that counsellors speak the language of children, so they do not need translators. In the first year, 200 young asylum seekers were supported by 20 counsellors. The feedback from the children is that the group is very useful for them. They value the support they get, but also the practical and social activities (drama, cooking together and sports). 171 http://www.government.se/sb/d/5805/a/66122/dictionary/true. 172 Law for a special representative for unaccompanied asylum seeking children (2005:429). 173 UNCRC (2009).

        "Evaluation of legislation, policy and practice on child participation in the European Union (EU) March 2015 53 In practice, however, being assigned a representative does not guarantee that children will be able to participate. The main reasons are as follows: \uf0b7 Legal representatives are not always specifically trained to work with children (for example, AT, FR, FI). In Finland, the skills of representatives and police officers to use child-friendly interview techniques were reported to vary considerably, and training is not compulsory. \uf0b7 Children are not always assigned a representative. In Cyprus, for example, this process is non-systematic and is limited to the legal representation of unaccompanied children during the hearing of the case by the competent authorities. In France, according to one official stakeholder\u2019s views, the waiting period for the appointment of a guardian can be very long. As a result, children who are not taken in charge by Department of Social Welfare are unable to fully exercise their rights as they are not deemed competent in law to do so. \uf0b7 The rights of asylum seeking children can sometimes be over-ridden by legislation, policy and practice regarding asylum seekers. In Sweden, for example, several legal experts and civil society organisations consulted for this study cited the practice of asylum seeking children being taken into foster care and then being expelled from Sweden together with their biological parents. This is also an issue highlighted by the National Ombudsman for Children, and has reportedly arisen due to the problem with combining the Aliens Act 178 and Social Security Act 179 in Sweden. Children seeking asylum are often detained in administrative detention centres (this practice was reported within, but not exclusive to: CZ, HU, MT, and NL). As a result, in the Czech Republic, as reported by stakeholders, only little participation, if any, can happen. The case of children maintained in centres, when accompanying their families, has been investigated in 2012 by the Ombudsman in Hungary. Conversely, in the Netherlands, as one in three asylum seekers is under the age of 18, all centres have facilities in place for education, child care services and pre-school activities. Activities for children can be organised in close cooperation with foundations and volunteers, although these are very dependent on local arrangements and the governorship of individual centres. Recently, there has been a more centralised effort of the Central Agency for Asylum seekers (COA), which cited UNCRC Article 12 as a basis of its work with children. In 2015, the Commission will publish the results of a separate study on children's involvement in administrative judicial proceedings, covering also the child's right to be heard in asylum and migration judicial proceedings. The criminal justice results were published in June 2014 180 3.4.5 Justice Legislation including provisions for Article 12 UNCRC in the justice sector was found in the areas of criminal, civil and administrative justice ; and specifically covering processes such as custody, visitation, and child protection proceedings. As reported above, legal provisions exist in many countries that allow children to express their views in civil legal proceedings (AT, BG, CY, DE, DK, EE, ES, FR, GR, HR, HU, IE, MT, SE, SI and the UK). In the main, the legislation establishes a general principle of child participation but there are examples (see Austrian example below) where legislation results in specific structures or process to promote child participation in justice settings. In 2015, the Commission will publish the results of a separate study on children's involvement in civil and administrative judicial proceedings, covering also the child's right to be heard.

        "Evaluation of legislation, policy and practice on child participation in the European Union (EU) March 2015 54 Table 3.9 Good Practice Example for Child Participation in Justice: \u2018Children\u2019s Counsellors in Austria 182 The practice of children\u2019s counsellors in Austria is enshrined in law through the Children\u2019s Counsellors Act 183 . The counsellor is available for children aged 5-14 in proceedings regarding custody in parental divorce; an area where children need particular support in participating due to the difficulty of expressing their views, when their parents are in conflict. The counsellor gives the child a voice, supporting them legally by explaining their rights and the judicial processes that are to be followed, and emotionally through the provision of psychological support. The process was reported to have worked well, and an evaluation found that in over half of cases the children\u2019s requests were incorporated into the judicial decisions. A comprehensive study was recently published by the European Commission, on children's involvement in criminal, civil and administrative judicial proceedings in EU28. The first phase mapped all aspects of the criminal justice system relating to children in the role of suspects/offenders, victims and witnesses 184 . Key findings from the first phase relating to child participation in criminal judicial proceedings 185 are summarised here. Full details and summaries for each Member State can be found within the published report. The study identified that legislative provisions exist in all countries to provide children who are suspects or offenders with an explicit right to be heard during the course of criminal judicial proceedings. The nature of this participation varies, however, and in only AT, CZ, EE, LV, PT do children have the right to participate in all stages, for example the right to consult the court files at any stage of the proceedings and the right to interrogate witnesses and experts themselves. In other Member States, the opportunity to participate is more limited. For example in Italy, the right of suspects to be heard only exists in the \u2018investigation\u2019 stage of the proceedings. In Romania, child suspects only have the right to be heard by the judge on one occasion. Where children are involved in criminal proceedings as victims, many Member States (AT, BE, CZ, EE, EL, ES, FL, HR, HU, LT, LU, LV, MT, NL, PL, PT, RO, SE and SK) likewise have legal provisions covering participation during criminal judicial proceedings. In other Member States the participation of child victims is at the discretion of the police and prosecuting authorities. Legislation in several Member States (BE, EE, EL, ES, FI, FR, HR, LT, LU, PT, RO and SK) specifies that children who have witnessed a crime, but who are not victims themselves, also have a right to be heard in criminal proceedings. More common, in other Member States, is that children may be obliged to testify in a court but they do not have an automatic right to be heard by the judge if they are not called to testify. In Italy, for example, the child\u2019s right to be heard under Article 12 only applies during the preliminary investigation, but following the commencement of the trial the child does not have an automatic right to be heard and the public prosecutor can decline this request. In Romania, the right to be heard is limited to a single hearing by the judge. This constitutes \u201c \u2026.a limitation which does not exist in the case of adults 186 \u201d. 182 Krucsay, Brita; Pelikan, Brita (2008): Bericht der Begleitforschung zum Modellprojekt \u201eKinderbeistand\u201c.

In FI, for example, children below 15 years of age must be legally represented by their parents, whereas children above 15 have independent or parallel legal rights with their parents to participate in the proceedings. In BE, it is at the court\u2019s discretion whether to hear children below 12 years of age. \uf0b7 The right for very young children to be heard is often dependent on an assessment of the maturity and discernment of the child victim by the judges, or by a specially appointed expert, but in some MS (e.g. BG) this applies to all children. \uf0b7 A number of countries provide an opportunity for child victims to strengthen their right to be heard and to participate in the proceedings by applying to become civil parties (e.g. BE, BG and EL), \u201cauxiliary prosecutors\u201d (IT) or \u201cassistentes\u201d to the prosecutor (PT).\u201d Source: European Commission (2014) The European Commission study found that even though legislative frameworks exist that cover the participation of children in criminal justice processes: \u201cThis right may be compromised if parallel efforts are not made to ensure that the conditions in which the child is questioned or gives testimony are child-friendly.\u201d 187 In Bulgaria, the NGO Social Activities and Practices Institute (SAPI) is running a pilot, \u2018Listen to the Child\u2019, to overcome this issue (see below).

It aims to: \uf0b7 Build professional capacity of the specialists who conduct hearings/interviewing for children - the magistrates, police, social workers, psychologists \uf0b7 Form a specialised mobile team for hearing child participants in legal proceedings \uf0b7 Reduce the negative consequences for child participants in legal proceedings by creating suitable conditions for the hearing/interrogation This has involved the following developments: \uf0b7 Collaborative work between social workers of the child protection system, the social services, and prosecutors on the cases the child is involved in \uf0b7 Opening 11 specialised interviewing rooms for children, which provide the needed material resources for guaranteeing the child\u2019s rights and protecting their best interest \uf0b7 Forming a specially trained mobile team, which implements child hearing according to special methodology, based on leading world practices for child participation in legal procedures \uf0b7 Developing the standards for hearing child participants in legal procedures. 187 Ibid.

Adaptations to the physical environment of court for example, presence of screens, separate rooms and/or audio-visual facilities were common. In many Member States (AT, BE, CZ, DE, DK, EL, ES, FR, HU, IE, IT, LU, MT, NL, PL, PT, RO, SI, and the UK) there are specialist courts dealing with child offenders. 189 Isolated examples exist of participation opportunities where child suspects or offenders are held in secure facilities during proceedings or as part of their sentence. In the Slovak Republic, juvenile justice institutions have \u2018boxes of confidence\u2019 which allow residents to provide feedback, complaints or other information anonymously by leaving a written comment in a secure box. 190 The contents are gathered and checked by staff of the concerned institution and information is handed to legal representatives where appropriate.

        "Evaluation of legislation, policy and practice on child participation in the European Union (EU) March 2015 59 The mapping further identified the following issues with regard to participation in \u2018health\u2019: \uf0b7 Legal provision fixing an age limit for consent to medical treatment was identified in nine Member States (AT, BE, DK, FI, FR, HU, IE, NL, and PT). The legal provisions include either a de facto age threshold, or this threshold is determined along with the degree of maturity (Belgium) and/or the child\u2019s competence or ability to participate (France). In the case of divergence between children and their parents or legal representative, a judge can intervene (Belgium, Austria) or the decision can be taken by the medical authorities. \uf0b7 In some Member States, the possibility exists for children to give their consent, but this is restricted by their parents\u2019 approval. For example, parental or guardian consent is also needed in the Netherlands for children aged 12-15 years. Elsewhere there are restrictions enabling adults to define at what age a child is capable to consent (as in Germany and Slovak Republic). \uf0b7 Legal provisions differ considerably across medical areas. This is especially true for biomedical research, which sometimes operates different age restrictions to other forms of medical consent (FI, EL, LT, and SK). In Finland, for example, the age of consent to participate in biomedical research is 5 years, rather than 12 years old. In Bulgaria, the Ministry of Health has set up a list of examinations and procedures to which children can provide their consent from the age of 16. \uf0b7 Another example concerns sexuality, and in particular abortion (IT, DK, and PT). In Italy, for example, Law 194/78 on the interruption of pregnancy 207 states that a judge can intervene to allow the interruption of pregnancy if the child has requested an abortion, if this is deemed to be in in the best interests of the child. This judge can over-rule the opinions of the parents on this basis, or decide not to hear the parents\u2019 views if necessary. The UK's policy guidance the \u2018Fraser Guidelines\u2019 rule that children under 16 can consent and make decisions regarding contraception if they show suitable signs of maturity 208 . \uf0b7 In some countries, whilst legislation often covers the right to be informed about health decisions, it does not specifically indicate that children have a right to participate in the making of the decision itself (as in SE, EL, IT, and ES). However, policy guidance might still exist (Sweden 209 ). In some countries, children were just covered by the general legislation (as in EE, LV). Despite the existence of relevant legislation regulating consents for medical treatments and participation in biomedical research, the interview evidence suggests that arrangements vary in the effectiveness with which they are implemented . For example: \uf0b7 In Denmark, a national stakeholder interviewed for this study noted that much is done in order to make children co-responsible for decisions about their own health. However concerns remained that too often their participation is ultimately decided by adults. \uf0b7 Clarity of the supporting guidance for children\u2019s participation was thought to be lacking in some Member States, according to the interviews with country experts (for example in SE, FI, NL). This is also supported by previous research. For example, several observation studies conducted in Sweden illustrate how healthcare appointments can shift from being child-focused to becoming a dialogue between a parent/carer and professional 210 . In Finland, despite progressive legislation, a number of the interview respondents for this 207 Osservatorio nazionale per l\u2019infanzia e l\u2019adolescenza, Relazione sulla condizione dell\u2019infanzia e dell\u2019adolescenza in italia 2008-2009. Firenze, Istituto degli Innocenti, 2009. 208 See: http://www.nspcc.org.uk/inform/research/questions/gillick_wda61289.html 209 The Swedish Law for Health and Health-care (H\u00e4lso- och sjukv\u00e5rdslagen 1982:763) do not specifically indicate that children have the right to participate. However, paragraph 2g of the Law for Health and Health-care states that the child\u00b4s need for information, support and advice should be respected and fulfilled by the healthcare services in those cases a parent or other carer is incapable of doing so. At the time of writing, a New Patient Law was at drafting stage, with Article 3 and Article 12 UNCRC explicitly mentioned. 210 Stakeholder evidence (country expert for Sweden) ",
        "Evaluation of legislation, policy and practice on child participation in the European Union (EU) March 2015 60 study perceived that there is still not a culture of child participation within hospitals and that child friendly information is also not widely available 211 . \uf0b7 One legal adviser who was interviewed claimed that Romanian physicians rarely inform children and listen to their opinion on treatment. It is common to deal with parents as legal representatives who, in their turn, prefer not to involve children in decision-making. Similar observations were made by interview respondents in SK, MT, HU, and EL. Numerous initiatives and protocols were found to exist at an individual institutional level , referring to children\u2019s rights, and serving to reinforce child participation in medical treatment. Such examples were reported in ES, IE, IT, and FR. In Spain, for example, a number of hospitals have been awarded \u201cFriendly Hospitals\u201d status and children are informed about their diseases in a more child-friendly and understandable way 212 . Charters such as the \u201cManifesto for the rights of sick children (le Manifeste des droits des enfants maladies) 213 in France and the \u201cCharter of Rights of the Child in Hospital 214 \u201d in Italy, cover the rights of the child to be informed and participative practices. The potential drawbacks of these examples are that they rely on the initiative of individual institutions and are voluntary in nature rather than drawing their remit from legislation. As such, they tend to be restricted in terms of their geographical coverage. In France, for example, the Manifesto was published by a union of children\u2019s associations (COFRADE 215 ), who lobbied for its introduction in all French hospitals, but the actual take-up was reported to have been disappointing. In Slovenia, a specific NGO has been established to champion child rights in respect of their healthcare, as the following example serves to illustrate. Table 3.12 Good Practice Example for Child Participation in Health: Association for the Rights of Sick Children (Slovenia) Founded in June 2006, the Association for the Rights of Sick Children is a voluntary, independent and non-profit association of individuals who have come together in order to resolve technical, professional and socio-humanitarian problems in the field of child care before, during and after the treatment at home and/ or in the hospital 216 . Their aim is to improve the living conditions of sick and / or hospitalised children. The Association monitors and evaluates the situation of sick children at home and in hospitals, regarding medical and psycho-social aspects of their care. Child rights are central to this role, including the child\u2019s right to have the parents with them; to stay in special rooms separate from adults; to have appropriate information; and have an opportunity for decision- making about treatment options and to control the pain. Regarding the second area, of wider engagement in health services , examples of legislation are more limited. The legislation rarely covers the right for children to give feedback on the healthcare they receive, although there are a few exceptions to this. For instance, in the UK, the Patient Rights (Scotland) Act 2011 217 sets out that every patient has the right to \u201c give feedback or comments, or raise concerns or complaints about health care received .\u201d This legislation applies to children although they are not explicitly identified. 211 Council of Europe (2011). \u2018Child and Youth Participation in Finland: A Council of Europe policy review\u2019, p.89 212 Country expert stakeholder evidence; example cited is the Infant Jesus Hospital of Madrid 213 http://cofrade.fr/2012/04/17/le-manifeste-des-droits-des-enfants-malades-article-le-monde-17-avril-2012/ 214 The largest pediatric hospitals in Italy have adopted the Charter of Rights of the Child in Hospital, structured in 14 articles, of which article 7 states that the child has to be informed and heard. 215 Conseil Fran\u00e7ais des Associations pour les Droits de l'Enfant (French Council of Associations for the Rights of the Child) 216 Zdru\u017eenje za pravice bolnih otrok.

        "Evaluation of legislation, policy and practice on child participation in the European Union (EU) March 2015 61 While child participation is not commonly enforced by law, there are good practice examples, which usually come from policy or practice rather than legislation. Good practice examples of child participation in the healthcare sector include: \uf0b7 Children's psychiatry practice in Greece, places great emphasis on the importance of child participation, where the \"child's words\" are crucial to psychiatric treatment. 218 \uf0b7 In Estonia, the National Institute of Health Development organises different programmes to promote healthy conduct of children and young people, and children are also engaged in developing and implementing those programmes through different participation methods (e.g. competitions, events, games). \uf0b7 In Croatia, the National Plan of Activities for the Rights and Interests of Children 219 is a policy aimed to encourage all forms of active participation of children in creation, implementation and monitoring of health programmes. In some countries individual institutions also operate good practices, such as in Ireland where some hospitals have youth panels for ongoing consultation. In other countries, many healthcare sector professionals have had no specific training regarding the rights of children, and how these rights could affect their working practices (Greece) and child participation and wider engagement in health services is limited or not existent (Malta). In summary, there is very little evidence of legislation underpinning the overall importance of child participation in the health sector and where it does exist, it tends to focus on issues around consent to medical procedures and treatment. The area of child participation and wider engagement in health services and institutions (for example in terms of policy development) is rarely underpinned by legislation, although examples do exist of policy and practice in this area. 3.4.7 Education The education sector shows the most widespread evidence for legislation relating to Article 12 UNCRC across the EU28. All Member States include some degree of provision for child participation within their general Education Act or Code. The main Act is usually supplemented with further provisions for specific settings, including complementary or alternative education; pre-school education, and Vocational Education and Training. In Estonia, for example, five separate Acts combine to provide the legal framework for the education sector, spanning all age groups and settings 220 . In many countries, including BE, CY, CZ, EL, FI, HU, LU, NL, PL, RO, SI, and SK, children\u2019s participation is instituted within schools through formal mechanisms, such as school councils, communities, and cooperatives. In most of these countries, the decision to establish a school council is voluntary, and is at the discretion of individual schools. In a few countries, however, student bodies are required by law. This is the case in BE, EL, HU, SK 221 , the UK (Wales), and FI (at upper secondary level only 222 ). 218 Country expert stakeholder evidence; example cited is for the Child Psychiatric Unit of the P. and A.

        "Evaluation of legislation, policy and practice on child participation in the European Union (EU) March 2015 62 In Greece, student bodies of various kinds are guided by the institution of \u2018school communities\u2019, which have a legal basis and apply to all types of schools at a secondary level. Article 2 of the operational framework of school communities, which is based on Law 1566/1985 (Article 45), states that: \u201c[The communities] are the cell of democratic life, where with dialogue and participation the school children with a collaborative spirit exercise themselves in democratic processes and in participation in common life, examining and proposing solutions to the problems that concern them \u201d. In contrast, there is no rights/legal framework for student councils in the Netherlands. To influence school policy, all students within secondary school are allowed to join the Council for Co-Decision, which has its own legal framework for consultation. However, students can (and do) still form local student bodies. The age of the child was found to be quite significant for educational settings, with many provisions being restricted to older children. In particular, there are marked differences between primary and secondary schools in this respect. In the Netherlands and Greece, Opportunities for participation in student bodies and associations were found to vary quite considerably according to age and ability. Two main groups of countries emerge from the mapping: \uf0b7 In a first set of Member States, opportunities are more or less \u2018universal\u2019 and age restrictions do not apply for membership (DE, FI, LU, PO, PT and SK). As a result, pupils of all ages are able to join school councils, although this infrastructure is generally better developed in secondary schools. For example, a major study of Finnish schools conducted by the National Board of Education (2009) found that whilst 98% of secondary schools had active student bodies, this figure dropped to just 40% where primary schools are concerned 223 . In Germany, the specific arrangements differ between individual Lander, but follow a similar pattern of being more established for older students (especially at upper secondary stage). \uf0b7 In a further set of Member States, the membership of student bodies follows specific age restrictions . In Spain, education laws do not allow minors to participate in the school council until they reach mid primary stage, and their right to elect directors begins when they reach the second grade of \u201c Bachiller 224 \u201d (age of 16). In Greece, the \u2018school communities\u2019 are implemented at the level of secondary schools, and child participation is less systematic at primary stage. However, school cooperatives can be formed by schoolchildren of the upper three grades. At this level, the rationale is that children should enhance their participatory skills and their engagement within school life. In the Netherlands, membership of the Council for Co-Decision is reserved for secondary school pupils, who can elect and be elected from the age of 13 years. Children in primary education do not participate in formal consultation structures. Their parents are however, able to participate in the Council. Arrangements for children with disabilities are more varied, and in many individual Member States special schools have distinct institutional arrangements from mainstream schools. In some instances, this can mean that children with disabilities have more restricted opportunities for representation on student bodies. In the Netherlands, for example, there is an exception that special schools can elect members of the Council for Co-Decision exclusively via staff and parents. The participation rights of children with disabilities are further discussed at Section 3.5.3. 223 Child and Youth Participation in the Slovak Republic: A Council of Europe policy review\u2019 Council of Europe, Strasbourg, 2012 224 Organic Law of Education 2/2006, 3rd May (Ley Org\u00e1nica de Educaci\u00f3n LOE 2006) ",
        "Evaluation of legislation, policy and practice on child participation in the European Union (EU) March 2015 63 The situation for younger children was found to be very mixed across Europe, with many Member States reporting more limited provisions for chid participation in nurseries and kindergartens, and decision-making tending to focus on interactions between teachers and parents. This situation was found in Finland, Luxembourg, Netherlands, and Poland. A number of study respondents pointed towards the fact that Early Childhood Education and Care (ECEC) has only recently emerged as a policy agenda at an EU level 225 , and awareness of good practices is gradually improving. This evolving situation is evident from a recent academic study of pre-school settings in Germany. The study identified three main classifications: \u201cdemocratic\u201d \u2013 showing a high level of on-going participation by children in everyday decision-making; \u201cAufbrechende\u201d (or \u201cawakening\u201d) where some forms of participation are starting to be introduced, and \u201cnon- participative\u201d 226 . Around half of pre-school settings were estimated to fall into the middle category, but with residual poor practices also found 227 . A number of countries have made more rapid progress with instituting child participation in pre-school settings. They include the following: \uf0b7 Sweden - all children have the right to participate under the Education Act (2010 228 ). The legislation is very strongly in favour of children\u00b4s participation within pre-school settings \uf0b7 Slovenia \u2013 pre-school children can routinely participate in decisions about their education and care; making choices and expressing their views about planned activities 229 , although scope has been identified to improve the monitoring and evaluation of these practices 230 . \uf0b7 Italy \u2013 the \u2018Reggio Emilia Approach\u2019 has become synonymous with high quality early childhood education, based on a model of critical enquiry, experimentation and research by young children 231 . Reggio Emilia preschools are \u201c\u2026 part of a public system that strives to serve children's welfare and the social needs of families while supporting children's fundamental right to grow and learn in favourable environments\u201d. The approach has inspired more recent methods of participatory action research with young children 232 The country mapping also provided insights to the scale at which student councils and representative bodies have been instituted across the EU. Based on the available data from individual Member States, the overall coverage is generally high. In the Netherlands, some 99% of secondary school students are represented in the Council for Co-decision 233 , whilst 98% of secondary schools in Finland have an operating council (based on nationally representative data) 234 . 225 Council conclusions on early childhood education and care: providing all our children with the best start for the world of tomorrow (2011/C 175/03).

        "Evaluation of legislation, policy and practice on child participation in the European Union (EU) March 2015 64 The coverage of student councils is lower in Slovakia, at around two thirds of secondary schools at a national level, and is estimated at around half of secondary schools in Ireland, based on unpublished figures quoted by the Irish Secondary Students Union. This is despite legislation requiring the board of management of all Irish secondary schools to \u201cencourage\u201d the formation of student councils 235 . The extent of coverage only provides a partial view of the situation, however, and the mapping identified the central importance of the quality of opportunities afforded to children through school councils. In both Sweden and Hungary, the highly decentralized nature of the education system was identified as a main challenge to implementation (although this trend has been reversed in recent years within Hungary). Without having stronger guidance for implementation, significant differences have been documented in the quality and effectiveness of student bodies between individual schools. In Greece, some of the most effective examples of children\u2019s councils are thought to include those with a stronger inter-generational dimension, so that the children participate in \u201c social solidarity and environmental activities\u2026 [such as] food collection and distribution for poor families, tree planting 236 \u201d rather than focusing exclusively on the mechanics of decision-making within the school. A number of specific barriers and challenges were also identified (refer also to Chapter Six for a consideration of the over-arching barriers to child participation): \uf0b7 A common problem encountered for school councils is tendencies towards over- representation from more academically able pupils who are already actively involved in school activities and do not necessary reflect the diversity of the school community. In an effort to address this problem, school councils in Luxembourg are required to include at least three students from lower sets and at least four from upper sets. The pupils then work together collaboratively, playing a role in school decision-making, and initiating child- led projects \uf0b7 The levels of awareness and professional training for teachers and other educational professionals in child rights and child participation were also identified as a main area for attention (mentioned in BG, EL, FI, HR, PL and the UK). Professional networks and NGOs have provided additional specialist training over-and-above what is available through initial teacher training in some countries. In Finland, The Centre for School Clubs 237 mentors school councils in basic education and provides training courses for teachers. In Slovenia, the progress that has been made in pre-school education has been greatly assisted by the development of professional networks that support teacher development and implementation of the curriculum 238 . The main drawback of these approaches has been one of scale. For example the Centre for School Clubs is a relatively small organisation and can reach only a finite number of teachers, and has called for the Board of Education to assume greater responsibilities in this area. Similarly, in Cyprus, a successful one-day conference was organised for head-teachers by the Commissioner for Children\u2019s Rights, within the Programme of Priorities for 2010 with an emphasis on child rights and child participation specifically 239 , but this was ad hoc and has not translated into ongoing investment. 235 Section 27 of Education Act 1998 provides the board of management of second level schools shall encourage the students to establish a Student Council. The Student Council shall promote the interests of the school and the involvement of students in the affairs of the school, in co-operation with the board, parents and teachers: http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1998/en/act/pub/0051/. 236 Expert stakeholder viewpoint 237 \u2018 Child and Youth Participation in Finland: A Council of Europe policy review\u2019 , Council of Europe, Strasbourg, 2011 (p.61-62) 238 Pedago\u0161ki in\u0161titut, Razvojno.raziskovalni center pedago\u0161kih iniciativ Korak za korakom Research institute, Developmental Research Center of pedagogical Initiatives Step by Step 239 Ministry of Education, Official Circular (2012) ",
        "Evaluation of legislation, policy and practice on child participation in the European Union (EU) March 2015 65 Beyond participation in student councils and associations, the mapping study showed a more concerning picture with regard to the \u201ceveryday\u201d mechanisms for children\u2019s participation in their education (AT, BE, ES, FI, HR, SE, PL, and PT). This includes both collective participation in the development of curricula, and the day-to-day running of schools, and individual participation in decisions relating to subject choices, student assessment and learning support. Levels of participation in curriculum development were generally reported to be low, but with some examples of good practice found within individual Member States. In Hungary, Malta and Slovakia, there is no requirement to consult children in curriculum development and the design of school programmes. In Malta, the consultation on reforms to the national minimum curriculum did not involve children, and there was no child friendly information. More positive steps had been taken in Bulgaria, Greece and Spain, but primarily in the sphere of \u201cextra-curricular\u201d activities that fall outside of the National Curriculum, rather than in the context of assessed schoolwork. In Spain, for example, child participation has been more prominent in recent healthy schools campaigns. Stronger participation of both pupils and parents was identified in Finland, with a more established culture of decision-making in relation to school curricula and activities; both individually and via parent\u2019s associations 240 . This activity culminated in a successful example of children\u2019s participation in national policy-making, as the following example illustrates. Table 3.13 Case study example: Children\u2019s participation in national curriculum reforms (Finland) In Finland, an extensive consultation exercise was undertaken with children and young people by the National Board of Education to inform a redesign of the national education curriculum in 2009-10. Nearly 60,000 children and young people from across Finland took part in an online interview, offering their views on how teaching methods might be improved and how the curriculum might be strengthened. The findings directly informed the re-drafting of the curriculum guidelines. The Ministry of Education and Culture subsequently drew-up a set of basic education quality criteria, and has provided support with implementation. According to the criteria, education providers must ensure that appropriate procedures exist to enable children to participate in discussions about their educational provision, and to participate in the evaluation of further provision arising from those discussions. These procedures must also be regularly assessed. Schools must have an open and interactive operating culture that appreciates the participation of pupils and their parents or guardians 241 . Children\u2019s level of actual influence over school policies and decision-making was found to be low, based on existing research undertaken with children at a country level. In Croatia, one quarter of secondary school pupils participating in a major national survey thought that their opinions were not routinely taken into account 242 . A study in Austria elicited a similar response, finding that one third of students did not identify regular opportunities to participate in school life. Levels of satisfaction were lowest amongst children from migrant families 243 . In Finland, too, just one third of basic education students responding to a national survey felt that they were able to influence school decisions. 240 Ibid.

        "Evaluation of legislation, policy and practice on child participation in the European Union (EU) March 2015 66 A study carried out among 1130 students from six upper secondary schools in 2009 found that 44% of the young people felt that they are not sufficiently consulted on matters concerning them. The most positive attitudes to participation opportunities came from upper secondary school students in municipalities with an active youth council 244 . Overall, students felt that they were more likely to be listened to in terms of preferences for school trips, breaks, and leisure activities, but had very little influence over \u2018whole school\u2019 issues such as school food, timetables, or curricula, although a dialogue has emerged in recent years. Despite these concerns, just over half of the children responding to the same survey felt that teachers and college lecturers took their views seriously \u201c always or most of the time \u201d, indicating that children\u2019s experiences of participation were quite varied at an individual level. Elsewhere, research undertaken by Stokking en Sol underlines the significance of variations between individual schools and individual teachers in influencing children\u2019s right to be heard. The study identified a correlation between the existence of school policies to support participation and children\u2019s satisfaction that their views are heard and taken into account 245 . Particular gaps in legislation, policy and practice were found within the country study for individual participation relating to subject choices, learner support and assessment. There was a consensus amongst respondents from across the EU that children are often addressed \u201c as a group \u201d, and that individual children find it more difficult to be heard and to have their opinions taken into account. Some more promising good practice examples were found, however, in relation to bullying individual learner assessment and personalisation and participatory forms of education, such as the Transparent and Participative School programme 246 (Poland) and the Escola da Ponte 247 school (Portugal), which follow an alternative education curriculum and are based on principles of democratic school life and \u201cmutual learning\u201d between students and teachers. Educational good practices are examined in further detail at Chapter 4.6. 3.4.8 Recreation The country mapping identified few examples of legislation relating to children\u2019s participation in recreational activities, such as play, sport and cultural activities . Despite this relative lack of a legislative framework, however, recreation was reported to be one of the main sectors within which participation takes place on a day-to-day basis, overlapping as it does with the family, school and community. Recreational activities are more clearly defined in legislation, within the following contexts: \uf0b7 leisure activities provided through local youth services , and which fall under the main laws and codes of practice for youth work \u2013 in Estonia, the Youth Work Act of 2010 underpins many regulated youth work activities, and place an emphasis on children\u2019s participation in setting and monitoring \u2018quality\u2019 in youth work practice. \uf0b7 sports and physical education provided through schools and kindergartens , which fall under the relevant educational laws and regulations within each Member State.

        "Evaluation of legislation, policy and practice on child participation in the European Union (EU) March 2015 67 one national expert in Bulgaria, the Law on Physical Education and Sport regulates that children participate in sporting activities voluntarily. \uf0b7 legislation regulating the membership of organised clubs and associations \u2013 in Spain, the Associations Law 248 permits children over the age of 14 to join associations, with parental consent, and to hold a position of responsibility within an association at 16 (again, with parental consent). This right is restricted in some Autonomous Communities. Similarly in France, children over the age of 16 have the right to form an association, inside or outside of school 249 . Children\u2019s play is a distinct area where participation has taken place across the EU; with a focus on projects to engage children in designing playgrounds or recreation areas (see also Chapter 3.4.2: Local Government). Examples of play policies and strategies were identified in IT, IE, and the UK; all of which make explicit reference to children\u2019s play rights as defined under Article 31 UNCRC 250 . This right is also enshrined within the Preschool Curriculum in Sweden 251 . In Italy, projects on the right to play, culture and socialisation were initially funded by Law 285/1997 252 , and have continued to be supported on a smaller scale by the Regions following devolution. In the UK, the National Play Strategy 253 was launched in England in 2008, backed by significant investment, with the aim of widening access to children\u2019s play and supporting the development of child-friendly communities. Specifically one key strand of the strategy is that \u201cchildren and young people and their families take an active role in the development of local play spaces.\u201d A non-statutory guidance document was also issued to local authorities with recommended planning guidance, along with a new national indicator to measure children\u2019s satisfaction with local parks and play areas. More recently, the national UK body for the protection of the English countryside has initiated a project to re-engage children and young people\u2019s interest in nature and the outdoors (see below). 248 Ley Org\u00e1nica 1/2002, de 22 de marzo reguladora del Derecho de Asociaci\u00f3n (Organic Law 1/2002, of March 22 on Association\u2019s Right regulations) http://www.boe.es/buscar/doc.php?id=BOE-A-2002-5852 249 Loi du 1er juillet 1901 relative au contrat d'association (Bill of 1st July 1901 on the right of association) http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichTexte.do?cidTexte=LEGITEXT000006069570&dateTexte=20090506 250 Article 31: 1.

In responding to the report findings, the National Trust established the \u201cKid\u2019s Council\u201d in November 2012. The Council is formed by a group of 10 children who provide advice on how to encourage their peers to enjoy the outdoors. The Kid\u2019s Council have helped to develop the National Trust campaign: \u201c 50 things to do before you are 11 \u00be\u201d developed a scrapbook and co-designed the accompanying website 255 . They also participated in testing the activities. Many of the examples of child participation in culture and recreation provided by country experts related to children \u201ctaking part\u201d in a wider sense, rather than specifically to their views being heard and exercising a decision-making influence. However, some exceptions were found within the area of community arts, theatre and performance . In Slovakia, for example, one country expert described a number of child-led events organised by the National Edification Centre (NEC 256 ), in which children are not only participants, but also co-organisers, co-authors, and evaluators. One such event is called \u2018The Golden Spinner\u2019: \u201cChildren participate in opening and closing the event. They play the instruments, and also act as presenters. Each day in the afternoon, the children\u2019s jury meets to evaluate the event. This evaluation is solely taken part in [Sic.] by children, without adult leaders, or directors\u2026 the children and young people create their \u201cfuture programmes\u201d according to their interests and in response to prior feedback given by the children when they evaluated their activity\u201d (Country Expert, Slovakia) Other examples found within the mapping and relating to arts and cultural projects were as follows: \uf0b7 The Children\u2019s University 257 ( Kinderuni ) projects have been run at several Austrian universities since 2003. These projects are open to children aged seven and upwards, and widen access to university campuses and their facilities for the local community. There is evidence that children are able to make decisions on what activities to undertake and are involved in evaluating the projects on completion; and, \uf0b7 In Finland, there are good practice examples within the community arts sector, including the \u2018Aladdin\u2019s Lamp\u2019 network 258 of 11 art centres, which organise cultural activities for children and use child-oriented methods to encourage self-expression. Using the methods, children have the opportunity to input into the final pieces developed and again are provided opportunities to feedback and evaluate the activities. Some of the main challenges for achieving child participation in the recreation sector include the lower profile and availability of \u2018cultural\u2019 activities compared with youth and sports clubs and a tendency towards time-limited funding. This leads to more ad hoc activities undermining the ongoing participation of children to have a greater role in the design and development of activities. 254 Moss, S.

        "Evaluation of legislation, policy and practice on child participation in the European Union (EU) March 2015 69 3.4.9 Child employment and child workers There is little evidence of participation in this sector and no tangible evidence for children\u2019s participation having an impact on policy and practice arising from this study. This may be because this is a more marginal issue for many EU countries than for example education which affects almost all children. There are, however, examples where child participation has been utilised to research this area. In Italy, child participation has helped to refine information on child labour in that country; an important addition as robust statistical information on child labour in Italy is rare. This has been achieved through peer research and interviews; conducted by the NGO Save the Children Italia 259 . Their investigation used six young people to act as peer researchers, collecting information from their own working experiences and interviewing other child labourers 260 . The peer researchers were also able to add solutions and fresh, child-centred approaches to the issues faced by child labourers in Italy. 3.4.10 Media Examples of legislation specifically regulating child participation in the media were not generally found to exist in Member States. Legislation generally tended to focus on protection of children for example against exploitation, violence or pornography (as in Slovenia or the UK). Legislation in Bulgaria was relatively unique in legislating for the observance of child rights by media outlets, including, the child\u2019s right to participate 261 . Policies to reinforce child participation in media were also rarely identified, although some media organisations did have policies covering other dimensions such as child protection policies (as in the UK) and the provision of special programmes to develop and educate children, but which did not go as far as covering participation explicitly (as in Hungary) that occasionally addressed participation. Child participation in media largely exists across the EU at the practice level, rather than at legislative or policy levels. The study located many good practice examples of child participation in a variety of forms of media (for example in BE, HU, IT, NL, UK). Examples include: \uf0b7 In Hungary, the reformed national public broadcasting channel, M2, provides televised content which is not only designed for children, but has consulted children when considering its programming. Channel M2 produces some of its content with significant involvement from children. Young people take on specific professional media roles, for example, operating cameras, editing and presenting. The chief editor advocates communication and involvement of its young audience via social media and events run at over 200 Hungarian schools. M2 is one of the highest viewing-rated channels in Hungary. \uf0b7 In Belgium, StampMedia 262 is a press agency totally run by young people aged 16 -26, aimed at expressing the view of young people on the latest news in the world. The young people focus on issues where their opinion is important and is not reflected in the mainstream channels. 259 http://www.savethechildren.it/ 260 Save the Children Italia, Io Partecipo Tu Partecipi.

The children are the main participants by realizing their own projects in these areas.

It aims to inform children about the issues which affect their lives. Children propose, suggest broadcast content, prepare scenarios, reports, interviews, comment and express their views. They also report about results of child participation around children\u2019s initiatives. \uf0b7 In the UK, content targeted at children also often involves children as producers and presenters of the content and the public service broadcaster in England (the BBC) does make a commitment to \u201c maximise opportunities for children to participate \u201d In Wales, the Participation Workers' Network ran a year-long \u2018Youth in the Media\u2019 project aiming to engage children and young people in schools across the country in debate about the role and presentation of children and young people in the media. The findings were presented to the Children\u2019s Commissioner for Wales, with recommendations on how to improve the fairness and accuracy of children and young people\u2019s portrayal in newspaper and television coverage 264 . Safer internet initiatives were commonly identified in the country analyses (as in UK, IT, EL, and ES), often led by NGOs. For example: \uf0b7 In Italy, Save the Children have been particularly proactive in ensuring children are safe when using media, particularly relating to online media. One project involved consulting 50 children on media safety, which was effective in bringing different perspectives and highlighting issues never noticed by adults, politicians or NGOs (for example inappropriate advertisements on social network platforms) 265 . The NGO Save the Children in Italy has also run participatory class discussions with children aged 10-14 reflecting on their use of the media, accompanied by training of teachers and meetings with parents. \uf0b7 The Greek Centre for Safer Internet uses child participation to elicit children\u2019s views on a safer internet. The University of Athens also runs a helpline for children and adolescents on safer use of internet, mobile phones and electronic games (covering topics like harassment, addiction, and pedophilia.) \uf0b7 In Spain, the Cibercorresponsales project 266 is an NGO-led aimed at promoting child participation among journalists under 18. It promotes the safe participation of children and adolescents in information and communication technologies. Finally, good practice examples also exist where organisations have used media as a channel through which to increase children\u2019s participation (as in NL and SE). The boxes below illustrate.

Children can develop film, video and other forms of journalism in their own way and on their own terms. The children get help broadcasting it (with some being broadcast on public television). The Stockholm based project got started with a three year project financed by the Swedish Inheritance Fund. www.fanzingo.se Radio Fri (\u201cRadio Free 267 \u201d) is a radio programme supported by Fanzingo, produced by young persons with experience in prison and with crime and addiction. Radio Fri aims to strengthen young people as individuals as well as make their voices heard in society. Radio Fri provides another perspective to what is usually reported in the mainstream news and other media. One of the long-term goals of Radio Fri is to ensure that the opinions of young people with experience of imprisonment are heard when issues concerning their situation are discussed and debated in wider society. While the countries outlined above had reasonable evidence of child participation in the production of media, in other countries (AT, DK, PL, and RO) the study found only evidence of media consumed by children, rather than where children had actively participated. Here, media content is tailored to children but children do not seem to actively participate in its production. In France, one stakeholder consulted for this study commented child participation in the media is low and the situation was similar in Croatia 268 .

        "Evaluation of legislation, policy and practice on child participation in the European Union (EU) March 2015 72 3.5 Vulnerable groups of children A further important dimension of the study was to examine the participation rights of children in many different situations of vulnerability, while recognising that \u2018vulnerability\u2019 can also be contextually specific. The country research therefore distinguished primarily between: a) vulnerable groups that reflect a current Europe-wide interest, and b) other vulnerable groups that are more likely to reflect interest in specific individual countries. The following table provides a summary. Table 3.17 Categories of vulnerable groups of children Europe Wide \uf0b7 Roma \uf0b7 Migrant children irrespective of their legal status \uf0b7 Children with disabilities (including children with intellectual disabilities) \uf0b7 Children of imprisoned parents \uf0b7 Young carers Specific to individual countries \uf0b7 Children in institutional care settings \uf0b7 Children experiencing domestic violence \uf0b7 Indigenous and ethnic minority groups \uf0b7 Asylum seekers/refugees \uf0b7 Homeless/street children \uf0b7 Child workers \uf0b7 Early school leavers/Children experiencing educational disadvantage \uf0b7 Lesbian/Gay/Bisexual/Transgender As with the coverage of \u2018settings\u2019 in the previous section the individual country experts examined the situation for children\u2019s participation among a sample of vulnerable groups. The sampling criteria included whether there was evidence of: a) specific challenges for these groups relating to children\u2019s participation warranting further exploration, and/or b) specific good practice relating to these groups. As such the coverage was not exhaustive, but instead served to allow analysis of specific grassroots examples of work with these groups from different Member States. Good practice in child participation should be inclusive of vulnerable groups, for example, as in the case of the Child Friendly Cities initiative, according to UNICEF Slovenia: \u201c A Child Friendly City is actively engaged in fulfilling the right of every young citizen to: [become] an equal citizen of their city with access to every service, regardless of ethnic origin, religion, income, gender or disability 269 As well as participation in practice that integrates vulnerable groups alongside their peers, many of the examples below include projects that have targeted vulnerable groups specifically in order to increase their representation. The findings on each group are further explored within the section below, except in the case of children in institutional or alternative care, whose experiences of child participation were closely linked to specific settings, and therefore were covered in Chapter 3.4. Children from indigenous and ethnic minority groups are also not examined as a separate group, with the exception of children from Roma families, as the country mapping work revealed that this is typically a cross cutting characteristic. The participation of these children is examined in relation to groups that they also belong to e.g. migrant children and those facing educational disadvantage. 269 www.unicef.si/projekti-v-sloveniji/otrokom-prijazna-unicef-ova-mesta ",
        "Evaluation of legislation, policy and practice on child participation in the European Union (EU) March 2015 73 3.5.1 Europe-wide Roma Children from Roma 270 families are identified as a group experiencing low levels of participation, based on evidence from the country fiches in BE, CZ, EL, FR, HU, IE, IT, and RO. Social exclusion, discrimination and low levels of participation in education are reported to have a direct impact on Roma children\u2019s opportunities to participate more widely in society and in decision-making. For example, in the case of Ireland, the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child has repeatedly expressed concern about the lack of adequate recognition, action and positive measures taken by Ireland to enhance the rights and life opportunities for Traveller children 271 . A recent NGO report on the condition of Roma children in Italy denounced violations of children\u2019s rights to health and safety, education and play 272 . Specifically, one of the main problems is Roma children\u2019s participation in school, such as non-enrolment, Early School Leaving (ESL), school segregation, and the absence of intercultural elements in the school curricula. For example, in Romania, 80% of Roma children aged between 3 and 6 years have not been to pre-school. There are multiple reasons for this low participation, which go beyond the scope of this study. In France, some municipalities still refuse to enrol Roma children in schools, for fear this could \u2018validate\u2019 or favour the creation or expansion of shanty towns, where many Roma families live. The dismantling of slums where Roma families often reside creates continuous movement for them, creating practical consequences for children\u2019s attendance and participation at school. Furthermore, once at school Roma children face further hurdles to participation, including the multiple prejudices faced by Roma people and, for some, the limited ability to speak the native language. In Romania, the country study identified that some of the main participatory mechanisms for children \u2013 the Students\u2019 School Council, and the County and National Student\u2019s Councils have struggled to secure the engagement of the Roma community. As one national expert who was interviewed commented: \u201cIt's not enough to create a framework for the student council . There should be measures to require from schools to involve children in council according to the percentage of Roma pupils in the school. The same for parents\u2019 councils. Good practice examples should be shared at European level\u201c Specific legislation, strategies or institutions have been created to support Roma children\u2019s participation in a number of countries, including France, Greece, and Romania. For example, in Greece and Hungary a range of strategic objectives linked to Roma participation have been created through the Integrated Action Programme for the Social Integration of the Greek Roma (2012), and Hungary\u2019s \u2018National Social Inclusion Strategy \u2013 Extreme Poverty, Child Poverty, The Roma 273 \u2019 (2011-2012). Also in Hungary, the Equal Treatment and the Promotion of Equal Opportunities Act 2003 defines that municipalities of cities, towns and districts of Budapest have to prepare and adopt a local programme on equal chances every five years. This programme requires an analysis of the situation of disadvantaged groups, including the Roma, and local measures to manage problems identified by the analysis. Finally, the 2011 Act on the Rights of Nationalities (national minorities) defines that a child belonging to a national minority has the right to choose the language through which they are taught in education settings. In the case of Roma children the language of national education can be Hungarian, Romani or Be\u00e1s\u2019. 270 For the purposes of this study, this group includes Roma, Sinti and Traveler children. 271 Children\u2019s Rights Alliance, 2013.

        "Evaluation of legislation, policy and practice on child participation in the European Union (EU) March 2015 74 In a few countries (including the UK, Ireland and Romania) there have been specific research projects involving Roma and Traveller children. Typically, these projects typically have a wider focus on what it is like to be part of the Traveller community in general and focus on the discrimination faced by this community. For example the Article 12 organisation in Scotland has a Gypsy Travellers' Lives project the steering group, which includes Traveller children, have looked into discrimination and online media concerning travellers 274 . Further successful initiatives are highlighted in the boxes below; however in most cases they were time-limited projects and evidence of the longer term impact of projects is limited. Table 3.18 Good Practice Example of participation by Traveller children, Save the Children peer research in the UK Several projects in the UK have sought to gather the views of Traveller children with the purpose to feed into wider inquiries or information resources on Traveller communities. \uf0b7 Save the Children in Scotland worked with 14 Traveller children through the Having Our Say 275 project. This peer research project aimed to enable them to gather opinions from Traveller children living in their local areas. This exercise was launched to enable additional information to be included in Save the Children\u2019s response to the Scottish Parliament\u2019s Equal Opportunities Committee enquiry on the way Traveller communities are treated by public bodies. The children were supported to produce and administer a brief questionnaire to their peers. The exercise included production of videos allowing children to speak directly about their experiences \uf0b7 The All about You 276 project was a Save the Children project in England which asked Traveller children aged 5-13 living in Birmingham what would make their lives better. The children expressed their views through talking, painting, clay modelling work and photographs. The final report from the project was disseminated by the Education Service for Travelling Children and presented to the City Council\u2019s Education Committee. \uf0b7 The Travelling Ahead project 277 was set up by Save the Children Cymru to support children from the travelling community to have their say. The website has a forum for children and young people as well as information for parents and tools for professionals.

Associazione 21 luglio implements awareness-raising meetings with teachers and social workers, with the aim of challenging prejudices and stereotypes about Roma children in education settings. Roma children are reported to be highly segregated in schools, and often put in special classes or groups requiring support together with children with disabilities. Participatory activities are also delivered with Roma children including the use of art-therapy workshops with younger children, aimed at gathering views of how they would like their city to be. Associazione 21 luglio also organises training of young human right activists, especially girls of 16 years upwards with the aim that they themselves can become advocates for the community. In other examples, the focus is on building leadership skills to support older children to participate in the field of rights. In Greece, the \u201cIntegrated Action Programme for the Social Integration of the Greek Roma 2012-2020\u201d, aims to develop Roma youth leadership and the involvement of Roma young people in the field of rights. The objective is to train five groups of Roma youth across three regions, and involve them in the implementation of the national Roma strategy, albeit with the ultimate aim of improving school enrolment and attendance, and reduce early school leaving. The Empowering Children Project in Romania is a programme for youth civic engagement and dialogue led by NGO Romanicriss. 279 The project brings together Roma and Romanian students from Romania and Moldova with the aim of initiating and implementing community development projects which seek to enhance community cohesion. Activities include a summer camp for Roma and non Roma (14-17 year olds) to develop leadership qualities to initiate and deliver community development projects. 3.5.2 Migrant children, irrespective of their legal status Children from migrant families are identified as a group experiencing low levels of participation, based on evidence from the country reports in AT, BE, CY, DK, DE, EL, HR, LU, NL and MT, as are asylum seekers in CY, DE, FR, HR and MT. Children\u2019s opportunities for participation depend on having the time, economic and intellectual resources available, and are affected by power relations, and feeling comfortable in the setting and relationships. The 2011 \u201c Audit of Children and Young People\u2019s Participation in Decision-Making 280 \u201d in Ireland found that two thirds of respondents agreed they found it hard to reach specific groups, with children and young people from ethnic or migrant minorities identified as the hardest groups to reach. One difficulty with involving these groups is because they may have been excluded from services in the past and often do not see the point of engaging. However, despite these barriers, organisations report a significant involvement of certain \u2018seldom-heard\u2019 children and young people. 281 In Ireland, a number of NGOs provide direct support to migrant children, including in relation to child participation.

In Portugal, the Project@Ventura 284 aims to promote active citizenship and solidarity among children and youth aged 6 to 24, from vulnerable families, who have difficulties with integration, which include also the descendants of immigrants. An example activity was participatory budgeting with children and young people. In the Netherlands, The Urban Family 285 is an NGO led project in a district of Rotterdam that supports four prominent groups of (migrant) youth. The project supports children to articulate their priorities through a series of consultation exercises and seeks funding for creating projects that helps young people to build a better life. Member States across Europe have taken steps to improve the process of reception for asylum-seeking unaccompanied children: \uf0b7 In Germany, unaccompanied and separated children are accommodated in special reception centres for three months. During this time the child\u2019s health, educational and protection needs are checked in a \u201c clearing procedure \u201d in cooperation with the guardian and the youth welfare office. 286 The need to train people involved in this process has been recognized and is being offered by the Federal Association for Unaccompanied Minor Refugees (B\u2013UMF). 287 Such a procedure, based on an approved and standardised model and oriented towards the individual requirements of each unaccompanied child, would make possible a transparent procedure that took full account of the interests of the child. The \u201cclearing procedure\u201d is carried out before any subsequent asylum procedure that may eventually follow. \uf0b7 In Italy, when the child has consented to and requested voluntary repatriation, planning is done with the child and the child\u2019s family with the involvement of child social services and IOM. 288 \uf0b7 In Austria, the care provided by the NGO Verein.Menschen.Leben in the Initial Reception Centre for asylum applicants provides activities such as psychological care, escorts to doctoral visits, German language courses, and legal advice. 289 \uf0b7 The UK Border Agency approach is to work with local authorities in the UK to ensure that the asylum screening unit is child-friendly and that essential child protection services are in place with a team of social workers in situ , supported by special funding arrangements. 290 However, in England, for example, children of asylum seekers and refugees appear to have a low level of participation (for instance, in choice of schools). 291 \uf0b7 Finally, in Belgium, a specific co-ordinator or tutor for unaccompanied children is appointed who is in contact with the different stakeholders. The Guardianship Act (2002) states that the tutors \u201c interact with the minor in order to develop a relationship of trust and to know the view of the minors on the decision he[she] intends to take. The guardian explains the 284 http://proj-aventura.blogspot.pt 285 http://theurbanfamily.nl/ 286 The clearing phase (\u201cClearingverfahren\u201d) is not laid down in the German law, but has proven to be a successful practice and is therefore being increasingly implemented in the 16 German Federal States. Several clearing centres have been opened under the Youth Welfare Act and in some federal states, guidelines have been developed by the responsible ministries, youth welfare offices or NGOs, where such a clearing phase is an inherent part of the reception concept. 287 See Bundesfachverband Unbegleitete Minderj\u00e4hrige Fl\u00fcchtlinge (Federal Association for Unaccompanied Minor Refugees), www.b-umf.de 288 ibid, p.46 289 See http://www.menschen-leben.at/ 290 European Migration Network, Unaccompanied Minors \u2013an EU comparative study, September 2010, p.101, http://www.emn.fi/files/288/0._EMN_Synthesis_Report_Unaccompanied_Minors_Publication_(Sept10)_1_.pdf 291 United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child (UNCRC): How legislation underpins implementation in England, Department for Education, 2010 https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/296368/uncrc_how_legislation_under pins_implementation_in_england_march_2010.pdf ",

There is also an obligation to conduct an individual assessment in order to identify the special needs of vulnerable persons, including unaccompanied children. In practice, the EU asylum legislation was found to have been subject to varying implementation. The feedback from the country research indicated that, when a child arrives in a Member State with their family, their rights tend to be subsumed within their parents\u2019 rights. There were isolated examples of additional support available in practice to enhance participation, For example, in France, GISTI ( Groupe d'information et de soutien des immigr\u00e9s 295 ) a human rights NGO set up a free legal advice service to enable young immigrants to ask for judicial help, seek advice on their rights and obligations and be kept informed about their participation in decisions concerning their requests for asylum or residence on French territory. In Cyprus, the Social Welfare Services of the Ministry of Labour and Social Insurance may act on behalf of unaccompanied children seeking asylum by providing legal representation during the hearing of their case by the competent authorities (Law 122(1)2009). One national expert reported that: \u201cNot enough has been done to tackle the plight of immigrant and unaccompanied children. Although the government insists that its existing regulatory framework is sufficient to encompass these children and reinforce their rights, most stakeholders agree that the particular needs of these children cannot be subsumed within those of local children, which are not only more affluent but are generally supported by the system, speak the language and are fully integrated.\u201d 296 In the UK, while legislation strongly outlines child participation rights in general, in practice child friendly measures are not always implemented at all stages of the asylum process for unaccompanied children. For example, the appeal process involving a specialist Tribunal does not require child welfare ticketed judges to sit on children\u2019s appeals. NGO stakeholders are of the view that insufficient procedural powers are in place to ensure that the voice of the child and their best interests are at the heart of the judicial process. For example, the Tribunal lacks any power to appoint a guardian. In Croatia, social workers from the Centres for Social Welfare act as guardians, but were viewed by some NGO stakeholders as ineffective, with participation further hampered by unaccompanied children being placed in secure institutions. Similarly, stakeholders from Bulgaria, France and Cyprus called for more training for professional working with unaccompanied children and young refugees. 292 The Guardianship Act, 24 December 2002, http://www.etaamb.be/fr/loiprogramme-du-24-decembre- 2002_n2002021488.html 293 European Migration Network, Unaccompanied Minors \u2013an EU comparative study, September 2010, p.101, http://www.emn.fi/files/288/0._EMN_Synthesis_Report_Unaccompanied_Minors_Publication_(Sept10)_1_.pdf, p.102 294 Directive 2013/33/EU of the European Parliament and of the council of 26 June 2013 laying down standards for the reception of applicants for international protection (recast) 295 http://www.gisti.org/index.php 296 Hope for Children (2012) Recommendation to the UN Committee on the rights of the child - www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/crc/crcs60.htm ",
        "Evaluation of legislation, policy and practice on child participation in the European Union (EU) March 2015 78 Despite the existence of several agencies offering assistance and underpinning EU legislation, a number of French interviewees for this study felt that many unaccompanied migrant children had difficulties in accessing their rights. They felt that many of their rights were not fulfilled, with public authorities avoiding the problem, due to issues linked to responsibility and capacity. In France, institutions responsible for taking care of unaccompanied migrant children include French Child Welfare (FCW), which is charged with the care of children who have been declared to be \u2018in danger\u2019 by the Juvenile Court Judge, and the organisation should, in principle, be almost systematically designated as guardian for unaccompanied migrant children. There are also a large number of networks in assisting and supporting unaccompanied migrant children. 297 Due to these limitations in legislative and administrative protection, there were few reported examples from country experts where child migrants or asylum seekers had opportunities to participate in decisions affecting their individual circumstances. Occasional projects (such as the example below from Finland) seek to involve them as a group in wider participation projects, to compensate their perceived under-representation. Table 3.20 Good Practice Example of participation by asylum seeking children, Safety Net, Finnish Refugee Council, Finland 298 The Finnish Refugee Council \u2018Safety Net\u2019 project (2012-14) offers peer-to-peer counselling and social support to the asylum seeking children in two reception centres in Finland. Some 23 counsellors, who speak 12 different languages and all of whom have experienced the asylum process have received training, manuals and guidelines to in turn provide support to younger children currently going through the process. The counsellors use participative methods or social activities to provide space for children to talk about their experiences and for the counsellors to provide advice based on their own experience of arriving in a new country and claiming asylum. Being provided with opportunities for participation may also be a new experience for some children because they come from cultures where children are not usually afforded such opportunities. Thus it can feel more comfortable to be invited to engage in consultation and participation exercises with peers. The project feedback from the children is that the group is very useful, they feel that the older counsellors are like parents. 3.5.3 Children with disabilities (including children with intellectual disabilities) Children with disabilities are identified as a group experiencing low levels of participation. Research into this group by Inclusion Europe and evidence from the country reports (BG, EE, EL, ES, LT, LV, NL, PL, RO, SK, SE, and the UK) did not find legislation that explicitly focuses on children with disabilities as a distinct group in relation to participation 299 . Instead, where legislation did exist it focused on the rights of children or children with disabilities as distinct groups. 297 For example: DEI France, Gisti, Cimade, Education sans Fronti\u00e8res, Forum R\u00e9fugi\u00e9s, Collectif des Exil\u00e8s du XX\u00e8me, France Terre d\u2019Asile Publication 6 (Ombudsman for Minorities, National Rapporteur on Trafficking and Human Beings); Helsinki 298 \u201cChildren\u2019s Rights for All\u201d inclusion-europe.org/images/stories/documents/Project_CRC/Results/European_Report/EN.pdf 298 www.uradni-list.si/1/objava.jsp?urlid=201158&stevilka=2714 298 Parsons, A.

        "Evaluation of legislation, policy and practice on child participation in the European Union (EU) March 2015 79 One example to the contrary was found in Slovenia, where The Law for Children with Special Needs 300 , 2011, ( Zakon o usmerjanju otrok s posebnimi potrebami ) explicitly states that a child with special needs must be involved in preparing and monitoring their Individualised Programme in Education, depending on the child\u2019s age and maturity. Slovenian interviewees felt that this law was leading to a cultural change in how children with disabilities are perceived, as it set out, for the first time, that children with disabilities were seen as capable of making decisions about their education. This example is typical of other Member States where instead of referring to the participation of children with disabilities explicitly, legislation refers to a concept of the \u2018maturity\u2019 of the individual when it comes to care proceedings and court processes. The definition of maturity is not clearly defined in any of the legislation examined and therefore relies on the subjective judgement of the professional to ensure participation, which therefore may not happen due to poor judgement or lack of understanding of the legislation. Although there were few examples of legislation explicitly referring to children with disabilities and their participation, there are examples of countries marrying up legislation in relation to disabilities and legislation in relation to children to form a coherent policy framework in relation to children with disabilities. The example of Bulgaria is illustrated overleaf. Table 3.21 Good Practice Example of strategic framework on children with disabilities\u2019 participation rights, Bulgaria The Child Protection Act 301 requires the state to undertake special measures to fulfill the rights of children, who may have difficulty participating or expressing their views due to a disability. Children with disabilities\u2019 participation rights are included in the Bulgarian Law for Protection, Rehabilitation and Social Integration of People with Disabilities, which sets \u201cconditions and guarantees for an equal-level footing for people with disabilities, social integration of people with disabilities and the ability to exercise their rights\u201d . 302 This legislation is part of a wider policy framework, guaranteeing that the rights of children with disabilities are in line with the following: \uf0b7 National Strategy on the Child 303 \uf0b7 National Strategy \u201cVision for Deinstitutionalisation\u201d 304 \uf0b7 National Programme for Protection of the Rights of Children with Disabilities 2010- 2013 305 The Criteria and Standards for Social Services for Children (DCSSSC) 306 also state that when drafting a care plan, it is compulsory to investigate the child\u2019s personal needs and wishes, and ensure support for children with disabilities or communication difficulties, to include them in the decision-making process. 300 www.uradni-list.si/1/objava.jsp?urlid=201158&stevilka=2714 301 \u0417\u0430\u043a\u043e\u043d \u0437\u0430 \u0437\u0430\u043a\u0440\u0438\u043b\u0430 \u043d\u0430 \u0434\u0435\u0442\u0435\u0442\u043e (Child Protection Act), (2000, last amd. 2013). http://www.lex.bg/bg/laws/ldoc/2134925825 302 \u0417\u0410\u041a\u041e\u041d \u0417\u0410 \u0418\u041d\u0422\u0415\u0413\u0420\u0410\u0426\u0418\u042f \u041d\u0410 \u0425\u041e\u0420\u0410\u0422\u0410 \u0421 \u0423\u0412\u0420\u0415\u0416\u0414\u0410\u041d\u0418\u042f (Law for integration of persons with disabilities) (2005, last amd.2013)- http://lex.bg/laws/ldoc/2135491478 303 \u041d\u0430\u0446\u0438\u043e\u043d\u0430\u043b\u043d\u0430 \u0441\u0442\u0440\u0430\u0442\u0435\u0433\u0438\u044f \u0437\u0430 \u0434\u0435\u0442\u0435\u0442\u043e 2008-2010.(National Strategy on the Child 2008-2018), 2008. http://www.strategy.bg/StrategicDocuments/View.aspx?lang=bg-BG&Id=464 304 \u041d\u0430\u0446\u0438\u043e\u043d\u0430\u043b\u043d\u0430 \u0441\u0442\u0440\u0430\u0442\u0435\u0433\u0438\u044f \u201e \u0412\u0438\u0437\u0438\u044f \u0437\u0430 \u0434\u0435\u0438\u043d\u0441\u0442\u0438\u0442\u0443\u0446\u0438\u043e\u043d\u0430\u043b\u0438\u0437\u0430\u0446\u0438\u044f \u043d\u0430 \u0434\u0435\u0446\u0430\u0442\u0430 \u0432 \u0420\u0435\u043f\u0443\u0431\u043b\u0438\u043a\u0430 \u0411\u044a\u043b\u0433\u0430\u0440\u0438\u044f \u201d (National Strategy \u201c Vision for the Deinstitutionalization of Children in the Republic of Bulgaria\u201d) - http://www.strategy.bg/StrategicDocuments/View.aspx?lang=bg-BG&Id=601 305 \u041d\u0430\u0446\u0438\u043e\u043d\u0430\u043b\u043d\u0430\u0442\u0430 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0433\u0440\u0430\u043c\u0430 \u0437\u0430 \u0433\u0430\u0440\u0430\u043d\u0442\u0438\u0440\u0430\u043d\u0435 \u043d\u0430 \u043f\u0440\u0430\u0432\u0430\u0442\u0430 \u043d\u0430 \u0434\u0435\u0446\u0430\u0442\u0430 \u0441 \u0443\u0432\u0440\u0435\u0436\u0434\u0430\u043d\u0438\u044f 2010-2013 \u0433 .

        "Evaluation of legislation, policy and practice on child participation in the European Union (EU) March 2015 80 The reasons for the lack of a distinction of children with disabilities as a specific group is due to a number of factors that are present, to differing degrees, across Member States. The concept of \u2018special needs\u2019 can be a difficult one to define. Special needs children are an extensive and heterogeneous group comprising physical, mental, emotional and developmental needs and not all children who have special educational needs are children with disabilities. It has been suggested that countries\u2019 estimates of the number of children with disabilities within the country may be largely inaccurate, with the case of Lithuania cited by the NGO Algojimasas as underestimating by around half the number of children with disabilities due to the government basing their estimate on social support payments and not taking into account a lack of take- up. In addition, a disproportionate number of children with disabilities do not access formal education, especially those who live in remote areas. Nevertheless the main barrier is that children with special needs are seen as not able to participate in decision making. In Europe, and particularly East European Member States, evidence from stakeholders in these countries suggests that there is still significant stigma associated with special needs, and the \u201cpaternalistic\u201d culture towards children is even more evident towards children of minority groups, including those with special needs and/or disabilities. The challenge therefore is to develop the culture of child participation within this specific group. At the national level, children with disabilities experience low levels of participation often because they need special equipment and conditions, which are not provided. There was no evidence in the country reports of any Member States legislating or enforcing specialist provision or equipment for children with disabilities. Wales (UK) does, in the 2010 Children & Families Measure 307 , legislate to \u201cfacilitate participation by children in decisions\u201d, but this is only as far as local authorities \u201cconsider suitable\u201d and there is no explicit reference to the needs of children with disabilities. Evidence from the country reports and Pan-European research by Inclusion Europe 308 found that professionals are often ill-equipped and lack the necessary techniques and mechanisms to fully investigate children with disabilities\u2019 opinions, relying on parents or professionals (such as teachers) to tend to children\u2019s needs (for example, converse with the child through sign language 309 ) or overlook the child\u2019s right to participate due to their perception that the child with disabilities does not have the ability to participate due, or in spite of, their disability. For example, in Latvia, Netherlands and Slovenia, parent councils are seen as key organisations representing the views of children with disabilities. Also in the Netherlands, only a few secondary special needs schools have places reserved for students 310 . While it is positive that at least the interests of the children with disabilities are represented, the fact this is not done first-hand, or not at all, means that representation of children with disabilities at a national level remains inconsistent. Stakeholders report that barriers remain in terms of attitudes, since the social model of disability has only replaced the medical model a few years ago. 311 They report a lack of competence among specialists to conduct individual assessments of the child\u2019s level of development, and in supporting younger children, children with disabilities or children from minority groups to create and express personal opinions. Projects that seek to remedy this are shown below. 307 www.legislation.gov.uk/mwa/2010/1/contents 308 \u201cChildren\u2019s Rights for All\u201d inclusion- europe.org/images/stories/documents/Project_CRC/Results/European_Report/EN.pdf 309 \u2018 Child and Youth Participation in the Slovak Republic: A Council of Europe policy review\u2019 , Council of Europe, Strasbourg, 2012 310 Bokdam, J., Bal, J. & Jonge, de, J.

The partners aim to make sure that the complaints procedure introduced by the Optional Protocol to the UNCRC will also be made available for children with an intellectual disability. This project takes place at school and in child services, where training material and model cases are being developed and tested. In order to fulfil its objective, the project develops: guidelines for teachers and young workers on how to enable participation of children with an intellectual disability involving development of a learning model programme for children at school; guidelines for non-disabled peers on how to involve children with an intellectual disability; model cases for participation of children with an intellectual disability in the format of a children\u2019s book presenting easy tips for children to interact with their disabled peers, especially when children have no verbal communication faculties. The book is based on short stories and includes drawings (like a comic book); and videos showing good practices from these model cases. Finally, this work stream includes training for children with an intellectual disability on how to participate. The project has involved conferences, seminars, trainings, events, including training seminars for children with an intellectual disability with 10-15 participants At an individual level , good practice is correlated with specialist provision (e.g. specialist schools or those run by a disability foundation or charity) and NGOs. These organisations, due to their specialist nature, are more inclined to use participatory methods and have the knowledge and resources to work with children with disabilities on an equal footing. Examples include: \uf0b7 Slovakia: the Association of Support to Intellectually Disadvantaged People (see below). \uf0b7 Spain: the specialised education centres of the Spanish Down Syndrome Foundation (ES), where children with an intellectual disability take part in their School Council and have their own class delegate, through which they communicate their proposals to their teachers and directors. \uf0b7 Netherlands: special needs schools have included children in the process of the individual development plans. They also have more opportunities through other informal channels: for example 33% of special needs schools have a student council. These are the areas in which good practices occur on a case by case (school by school) basis. \uf0b7 UK: The Children with Disabilities Strategic Alliance\u2019s Manifesto outlined the need for more consideration of how to engage children / young people with disabilities in planning and designing services. \uf0b7 Latvia: The National Artistic Festival of Children with disabilities and Children with Special Needs was the first attempt to publicly showcase the talents of children with disabilities. 312 www.inclusion-europe.org/childrights4all/ ",

The project focuses on both improving the self-advocacy skills of children and adults with mental disabilities (aged 16\u201355) and works with professionals to increase their ability in supporting persons with disabilities abilities to self-advocate. The project runs self-advocacy centres, in which there is a strong focus on the education of human rights for mentally disabled people. The course is accredited by the Ministry of Education in the Slovak Republic. The project also produced a brochure on self-advocacy. Table 3.24 Good Practice Example of Participation by the Romanian Government The Ministry for Education continues the National Strategy for Community Action (SNAC) established before Romania joined the EU in the period 2000-2004. Since 2007 it has been regulated by the Association for Children\u2019s High Level Group. The strategy is built on cooperation to mobilise the resources of the community and promotes inclusion of people/children with disabilities. It is an educational programme that brings together children from mainstream schools, special schools, placement centres and plans for action based on participation and volunteerism. Teachers and children volunteers create a space where children from different backgrounds and capacities can demonstrate their competences. SNAC has coordination in the Ministry of Education, at regional, county and institutional level. Each school has its own Community Action plan, and plans for its own budget for such actions. Table 3.25 Good Practice Example of participation by children with an intellectual and development disability: V.I.D.A Project (Spain) 314 The V.I.D.A project is a Spanish project granted by the Ministry of Education being delivered by the FEAPS Foundation. This project strengthens the participation of children with intellectual and developmental disabilities (aged 12-18 years) who are studying in specialised educational integration centres to support the inclusion and the promotion of their rights and their self-determination. One of the aims of this programme is that children learn to make important decisions about their life and their future. To achieve this objective, the children are supported to develop their skills and competences for self-determination. This includes the following components: decision making, problem solving, relationships, and self- monitoring. Some Member States (ES, IE, and SK) have variously held one-off consultations with children and young people in relation to important issues on disability and special needs. \uf0b7 Spain: the National Organisation of Spanish Blind (ONCE) in collaboration with the Committee for Children of the World Blind Union and the International Council for Education of the Visually Impaired (ICEVI) developed an international conference with the aim of promoting the voice and inclusion of children who are visually impaired and communicating their needs. As a result the Congress edited the book \u201cListening to children.

        "Evaluation of legislation, policy and practice on child participation in the European Union (EU) March 2015 83 \uf0b7 Ireland: a national consultation into the experiences of children in the care of the State was undertaken in 2010. The Listen to Our Voices consultation 316 engaged with 220 children and young people who were living in State care. Because the consultations were geared towards young people themselves using their own voice to express their views and opinions, this excluded some children with disabilities. To remedy this, a parallel process was established for young people with disabilities who needed additional support to express their views. Of the nine participants, five had severe-profound intellectual and multiple disabilities, two had learning disabilities and two had physical and intellectual disabilities. The researchers conducted four direct interviews with the participants while in the other five cases proxy interviews were carried out with care-staff and supplemented with video- recordings of the children or young people themselves. Some of the key issues identified for these children and young people were the need for increased contact with families as well as improvements in the physical environment including increased supports for communication. \uf0b7 Slovakia: a small scale good practice example was given by a director of a primary residential school for hearing-impaired pupils, who indicated that a multi-functional playground had been built in school. The children were informed of the project and activities planned early on and could contribute with their ideas. Children expressed their views on school educational programmes and leisure activities in discussions and informal communications with pedagogic staff. 3.5.4 Children of imprisoned parents It is estimated that every day, some 800,000 children across the European Union live separated from their parents due to the latter\u2019s imprisonment. 317 The country mapping, however, identified few examples of specific legislation and practice concerning the participation of children of imprisoned parents (IT, SE, and UK). A number of dedicated NGO\u2019s do exist across Member States which focus specifically on this group, for example Families Outside 318 in Scotland, Riksbryggan 319 in Sweden and Bambinisenzasbarre in Italy 320 . Where practice examples do exist delivered by these organisations and others they are typically limited to the provision of child friendly information in the form of pamphlets written in child- friendly format, DVDs and e-learning packages about what to expect when visiting parents in prisons. One particular example from Sweden is an online resource 321 specifically targeted at children of imprisoned parents which includes stories, quizzes and a glossary to provide accessible information to children whose parent is involved in the criminal justice system or servicing a sentence in prison. The Children of Prisoners Europe (formerly known as Eurochips) is a Europe wide network that champions and raises awareness of children of imprisoned parents\u2019 rights. The COPING project 322 , funded by the EU Seventh Framework Programme, undertook interviews with more than 700 children of imprisoned parents across Sweden, Germany, Romania and the UK to explore children\u2019s experiences of having a parent in prison. The research identified that receiving information about why their parent was imprisoned was important for children of imprisoned parents\u2019 resilience and wellbeing. In each of the four countries local examples of good practice in relation to services and interventions for the children of imprisoned parents were identified. 316 www.dcya.gov.ie/documents/publications/LTOV_report_LR.pdf 317 The Danish Institute for Human Rights, Bambinisenzasbarre, Ulster University and European Network for Children of Imprisoned Parents, (2011) Children of Imprisoned Parents 318 www.familiesoutside.org.uk/ 319 www.riksbryggan.se/ 320 www.bambinisenzasbarre.org 321 www.minfriaplats.se/ 322 See: childrenofprisoners.eu/?page_id=3819 ",
        "Evaluation of legislation, policy and practice on child participation in the European Union (EU) March 2015 84 Participation was also touched upon with a recommendation emerging from the research that children\u2019s expert/advisory groups should be established in each prison to regularly evaluate the children\u2019s experience of visiting the prison and/or maintaining contact with their parents by other means and to recommend improvements in practice where necessary. At this stage there is no progress to report in terms of the adoption of this recommendation by public authorities. A group of children with imprisoned parents from Sweden and the UK also spoke at the research\u2019s conference to policymakers in November 2012 and a key recommendation was \u201c children and young people receiving information about what is going on with the parent, where they are going to be or when they are coming back \u201d 323 . The conference was well received by policy makers present, however there has been no visible change to policy to date. 3.5.5 Young carers Research conducted for this study found very few countries where young carers\u2019 rights to participate are covered in legislation. The only example found was in the UK, where an amendment to the Children and Families Bill 2013 was proposed in October 2013 324 and was being debated in the UK parliament (in 2014). This amendment includes the right for young carers to receive an assessment alongside the person being cared for, allowing them clear opportunities to have their needs assessed and views heard. There is particularly effective practice in ensuring young carers\u2019 participation in Scotland. In Scotland, the right to participate for all children, including young carers is covered by the Children and Young People (Scotland) Bill. Young carers\u2019 rights to participate are further supported by the Scottish Government\u2019s recent young carers\u2019 strategy: Getting it Right for Young Carers: the Young Carers strategy for Scotland 2010-2015 325 . This identified that young carers had specific needs for advocacy support to ensure that they were able to contribute to both the assessment of the person they care for and their own young carer\u2019s assessment. In addition to this, there are various national mechanisms for young carers in Scotland to support participation, including: \uf0b7 The Young Carers Network hosted by the Carers\u2019 Trust represents all young carers\u2019 services in Scotland and provides opportunities for young carers across the UK to get involved in raising the profile of young carers; \uf0b7 A young carers\u2019 festival, which provides a chance for young carers to speak to their ministers and representation from the health boards and councils as well as have fun and meet other young carers 326 ; \uf0b7 A Carers Parliament to raise the issues that affect carers, which includes young carers 327 323 See: www.coping-project.eu/final_conference.php 324 See: www.gov.uk/government/speeches/children-and-families-bill-young-carers 325 See: http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Resource/Doc/319441/0102105.pdf 326 See: www.carers.org/news/scottish-young-carers-festival-2010. 327 See: www.carersuk.org/policy-a-campaigns-scot/carers-parliament-scotland ",
        "Evaluation of legislation, policy and practice on child participation in the European Union (EU) March 2015 85 3.5.6 Specific to individual countries 3.5.6.1 Children experiencing domestic violence As is the case with other vulnerable groups, there were no examples in the Member States where this group was examined (FL, IE, SE, SK, and the UK) where the participation of children experiencing domestic violence was specifically legislated for. Research by key NGOs in the sector in the UK- Refuge 328 and the NSPCC 329 - found that children experiencing domestic violence are rarely given opportunities to express their own views, and professionals are typically reluctant to talk directly with children and young people and to involve them in decisions which affect them. 330 This conclusion was reflected in the evidence presented from other Member States (FL, IE and SE) and as such examples of participation at an individual level were limited. With regards to national level participation, the county mapping found examples in Scotland which has been particularly effective in ensuring children experiencing domestic violence have been able to influence national policies. The Voices against Violence (VAV) project, supported by the Scottish Government and the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities, COSLA, comprises young people with direct experience of domestic violence. They influenced the three-year national domestic abuse delivery plan for children and young people published in 2008 and its members are actively involved in the discussions on the next three-year delivery plan. 331 In Ireland, the Office of the Minister for Children supported a research project in 2007 with the overall aim of increasing understanding of children\u2019s experiences of living with domestic violence. 332 3.5.6.2 Homeless children The European Federation of Street Children targets some of the most vulnerable children in Europe, for whom, in many ways, \u2018participation\u2019 as generally understood is not high on the agenda: \u201c\u2026These are children living in heating pipes under the roads in Romania\u2026 the idea of \u2018participation\u2019 is almost absurd\u2026 there is not even socialisation or basic services\u2026 their first instinct is to eat and to survive .\u201d (European NGO stakeholder) As a result of this context, examples of participation involving this group of children reported in the country reports (UK, SE, IE) were most commonly consultation or research focused, involving children in adult led research projects to explore the needs and experiences of these children. For example the Railway Children NGO in the UK undertook research with 103 \u2018detached 333 \u2019 children and young people with the aim to develop a range of policy and practice recommendations to meet the needs of this group of children and young people. 334 Building on the research, the organisation developed the Reach model of intervention to provide services for young people before, during and after episodes of running away. 335 In Ireland, The Ombudsman for Children received complaints concerning the crisis intervention and out of hours services for homeless children. 328 refuge.org.uk 329 www.nspcc.org.uk/ 330 NSPCC (2011) Meeting the needs of children loving with domestic violence in London www.nspcc.org.uk/Inform/research/findings/domestic_violence_london_pdf_wdf85830.pdf 331 SCCYP, Mid term Report Participation Scotland.

        "Evaluation of legislation, policy and practice on child participation in the European Union (EU) March 2015 86 As a result the Ombudsman for Children undertook a consultation with homeless children with the aim of ensuring that homeless children\u2019s experiences and views inform both policy and practice concerning emergency care and accommodation. 336 More isolated examples of participation exist at a local level in some Member States (UK, SE). For example, in Newcastle in the UK a housing association providing accommodation for homeless young people has created a Youth Independence Forum 337 . This group of young people meets monthly with the aim to create an opportunity where young people can speak to decision makers in the city to ensure that their voices are heard and they can make a difference in providing services for young people who have experienced homelessness or housing issues. 3.5.7 Early school leavers/children facing educational disadvantage The country mapping identified that in a number of countries, children that experienced educational disadvantage, including children at risk of exclusion, were likely to have very low levels of participation (AT, BG, DK, IE, LT, LV, NL, and SK). However there were examples of projects focusing on particular sub groups of children experiencing educational disadvantage. A study of second chance education schemes for children and young people who had left school before the compulsory leaving age found that participation in decision-making actually proved to be a highly effective way of engaging this group. For instance in the Matosinhos Second Chance School 338 in Portugal students are able to decide on the subjects they study. Young people consulted fed back that being involved in choosing the subjects leads to them feeling more positive about their studies and helps them to engage in their learning. Similarly a recent report on learning and wellbeing highlights importance of empowering and considering that children are competent partners to nurture personal responsibility more than compliance. 339 Investing in Children 340 , an NGO in the UK is currently delivering a participation project in Scotland that seeks to explore the effect of participation in an education setting with the aim to enhance educational engagement and achievement. Throughout 2014 the project will see children and young people engaged in Agenda Days, report writing and presenting their ideas for change to head teachers and the local authority. In terms of children\u2019s participation outside of a school setting, across a number of countries, it continues to be very challenging to involve children experiencing education disadvantage in youth parliaments and children and youth forums. However there are examples of initiatives supporting these groups. For instance in Estonia Youth in Action National Agency specifically supports young people experiencing educational and social disadvantage through support projects around youth democracy and youth initiatives. 341 In Italy, support was provided to a specific group of educationally disadvantage children as the NGO Save the Children Italia has trained child workers as peer researchers in order to explore the issues surrounding child workers. 336 Ombudsman for children and young people Ireland ( 2012) Homeless Truths: Children\u2019s Experiences of Homelessness in Ireland: http://www.oco.ie/assets/files/issues/HomelessTruths/HomelessTruthsWEB.pdf 337 youthhomelessnortheast.org.uk/regional-champions/youth-independence-forum-newcastle/ 338 Day, L; Mozuraityte, N; Redgrave, K; McCoshan, A (2012) Preventing Early School Leaving in Europe \u2013 Lessons Learned from Second Chance Education, European Commission 339 Kickbusch I., Gordon J. and O'Toole L.

        "Evaluation of legislation, policy and practice on child participation in the European Union (EU) March 2015 87 The peer researchers and the child workers they interviewed were also able to suggest solutions to overcome these problems which were reported alongside Save the Children\u2019s recommendations. 342 Peer research was considered to be an effective approach as it ensured child workers views on their situation and how they can be involved in decisions that affect them were heard. However this has not solved the problem of a lack of clear policy concerning child labour exploitation that the research findings can feed into. 343 3.5.8 Lesbian/Gay/Bisexual/Transsexual (LGBT) LGBT children and young people were examined as a potentially vulnerable group of children in a number of the individual country reports prepared for this study (CY, FI, IE, LU, and the UK). LGBT young people are reported to have some opportunities for participation in Finland and the UK, although fewer opportunities were documented within the other named countries. Effective examples of collaboration and peer-led work in the UK include, LGBT North West 344 , a regional organisation that has a strong focus on involving young people in running the projects. Their support includes a peer mentoring service and running the Young Women\u2019s Group, a peer-led and peer-governed project for young lesbian, bisexual and questioning women that meets weekly. The Allsorts Youth Project 345 , in Brighton, England, also aims to empower young people who are LGBT or unsure of their sexuality. This also includes a youth peer educator project and a youth steering group. Some evidence was also found of transnational activities, with LGBT Youth Scotland developing a collaborative European Commission funded project on challenging homophobia in education with Legebitra 346 , - a Slovenian LGBT organisation working with young people and the wider LGBT community. The project aimed to encourage EU member states to tackle issues around sexual orientation and bullying in schools, with a central role for young people. Cutting across the work of individual Member States, the European Parliament\u2019s Intergroup on LGBT Rights 347 provides an informal forum for Members of the European Parliament who wish to advance and protect the fundamental rights of LGBT people. Members of the Intergroup would usually take a positive stance on LGBT issues when they draft reports or amendments, when they vote in the Parliament, or when they deal with constituency affairs. The LGBT Intergroup is the largest of the European Parliament\u2019s 27 Intergroups, currently gathering over 150 Members. The Council of Europe\u2019s standards and mechanisms also seek to promote and ensure respect for equal rights and dignity of LGBT persons. In 2010, the Council\u2019s Committee of Ministers adopted a recommendation to member states on measures to combat discrimination on the grounds of sexual orientation and gender identity 348 . The Council of Europe provides support to member states by sharing good practices, organizing capacity building activities for government and local authorities dealing with LGBT issues, providing support and empowering LGBT rights organizations and raising public awareness on issues related to discrimination. 342 Save the Children Italia (2010) Un\u2019analisi dei metodi Di lavoro e delle buone Pratiche di partecipazione Di bambini e adolescent Realizzate da Save the children italia; A cura di Ines Biemmi http://images.savethechildren.it/IT/f/img_pubblicazioni/img127_b.pdf 343 Italy, Non Government Stakeholder consultation 344 www.lgbtyouthnorthwest.org.uk/ 345 www.allsortsyouth.org.uk/ 346 http://www.lmit.org/baza/drustvo-informacijski-center-legebitra-2.html 347 http://www.lgbt-ep.eu/ 348 http://www.coe.int/t/dghl/standardsetting/hrpolicy/Publications/LGBT_en.pdf ",
        "Evaluation of legislation, policy and practice on child participation in the European Union (EU) March 2015 88 4.0 Effectiveness of participation practices Key messages \uf0b7 Effectiveness varies across different types of participation and in different sectors and settings. Some contexts emerged as being more conducive to effective participation than others. These included local level day-to-day contexts such as schools, care settings and neighbourhoods where there are more routine opportunities for interaction between children and adults. \uf0b7 Effectiveness is characterised by the existence of one or more variables including: inclusivity; opportunities for dialogue and collaboration with adults; respectful relationships; whole project involvement; children taking the initiative; children developing skills of active citizenship; ongoing rather than one off involvement; integrity and consistency; tangible changes or outcomes resulting from participation; when children can provide solutions; and when participation is informal and rooted in children\u2019s lives. \uf0b7 Poor practice is evidenced by: children\u2019s views not being taken into account; children not being kept informed or expected to participate without information; tokenism; when organisations/staff control the agenda; failure to use child friendly environments and practices; and lack of monitoring and evaluation to measure and review the effectiveness of activities. The act of exercising their participation rights can place children at risk of ridicule or harm from adults. \uf0b7 Good practices exist at all levels and within a wide range of contexts. They extend across different types of participation, including structures and networks; consultation initiatives; participatory practices that seek to include and empower children to participate in local development as well as national decision making. \uf0b7 A further set of good practice examples are concerned with actions to support or promote children\u2019s participation, including information, advice, support and advocacy, education, promotion and awareness raising, and professional training. Good practice criteria are relevant to all children regardless of situation. However some good practice initiatives are relevant to particular sectors or settings and particular groups, with examples predominantly found in education and care settings. ",
        "Evaluation of legislation, policy and practice on child participation in the European Union (EU) March 2015 89 4.1 Introduction This chapter examines the different forms that participation takes; their relative effectiveness, and some of the hallmarks of \u2018good\u2019 and characteristics of \u2018poor\u2019 quality participatory practices. This evaluation has already discussed different structures, mechanisms, tools and frameworks for realising participation in practice (see Section Two). One of the frames of reference used in this evaluation to assess different forms and modes of participation involved making a distinction between consultation, collaboration and child-led initiatives. Whilst these are useful in terms of understanding the degree to which power is shared between children and adults, many of the initiatives and examples in this evaluation do not fit neatly into any of these categories. Student or youth councils can be consultative and collaborative, for example, as a respondent from a child rights organisation in Cyprus explained: \u201cThe Commissioner [for Children] uses consultation and collaboration with children\u2019s organisations and with the Youth Advisors and is now beginning to implement child-led projects through the youth advisory panel.\u201d It is also evident that context matters, and that different forms of participation are appropriate for different purposes. For example as one respondent from Slovenia stated: \u201c All kinds of levels and forms of participation are needed, because children sometimes\u2026 just want to express their opinion, but they also need protection. Sometimes they need adults to organise and help them realise their ideas.\u201d This chapter will discuss more and less effective forms of participation in terms of a generic set of features that characterise effective participation. These elements of effective practice go beyond the scope of the standards for children\u2019s participation set out by the Council of Europe which focus on conditions and principles of participation and instead focus on the process of participation in practice. 4.2 Effective participation practices The numerous examples and initiatives provided in the evaluation indicate that participation takes many forms and there is no one size fits all. Instead there are elements or features which characterise examples of effective practice. In particular many of these characteristics involve participation as a collaborative or intergenerational practice. 4.2.1 Inclusive Initiatives that are most effective are those that target and involve all children rather than a small number of representatives. Similarly, where different stakeholder groups are involved, participation needs to include all groups including parents and multi stakeholder groups of professionals and/or policy makers where this is necessary. For example in the care sector in Hungary participation is seen to be most effective when different actors such as school and child care services work together. Education in Greece provides another example, as one respondent from the country mapping explains: \u201cForms of participation that have proven more effective are those that involve all children irrespective of their age; adjust to children\u2019s age; involve all actors (children, parents, school); are based on interdisciplinary collaboration but a with a clear reference point for children.\u201d ",
        "Evaluation of legislation, policy and practice on child participation in the European Union (EU) March 2015 90 4.2.2 Dialogue, collaboration and shared processes with adults Many interpretations of participation are concerned solely with hearing children\u2019s views as a one off process, yet one of the features of effective participation in some of the responses in the evaluation highlight the value of co-production, dialogue and shared decision-making. In particular, having opportunities to reflect and learn together. As one practitioner who was interviewed for the country study in Portugal commented: \u201c\u2026Creating moments of social analysis and discussion among children, young people and policy makers has been and continues to be provided, either in the context of the Youth Municipal Assembly, both in the context of the activity of a group of young people who participated in the Assembly and where we have sought to engage in other activities that tend to their mobilisation and civic participation. Having access to this group is referred, by themselves, as a positive experience, as it provides increased knowledge and the rapprochement with the decision-makers.\u201d Good practice examples below that focus on dialogue and debate are important in physically bringing children and adults together. For example Have your Say and the National Children and Youth Parliament 349 (Czech Republic) promote cooperation through round table discussions at a national level. A further example exists for Dialogue Days 350 (Finland) and the National Youth Council National Youth Debates 351 in the Netherlands. Effective collaboration however depends on the quality of relationships between children and adults wherein children are valued and respected. 4.2.3 Quality of relationships A recurring feature of good practice examples from different countries was the way in which adults engage with children. A key element that appears important in all initiatives regardless of what form participation takes is that children are valued and respected for their contribution and are not judged or pre-judged by professionals. \u201cThe most effective forms of participation have been where children were given a say in a way that they were valued and treated with respect. This is when the listener shows the child that s/he is there to get in touch with what they want and need and not for anything else.\u201d (Practitioner, Malta) \u201cWhere professionals gain the trust of children through genuine and respectful communication, objective information and sincere interest; that are child-friendly and patient in terms of the time allowing children to relax, communicate and genuinely express their views and feelings; that give the opportunity to children to fully participate and develop a kind of a \u201ccontract\u201d with the professionals.\u201d (Practitioner, Greece) 349 www.participace.cz/ndpm/ 350 \u2018 Child and Youth Participation in Finland: A Council of Europe policy review\u2019 , Council of Europe, Strasbourg, 2011 351 www.njr.nl ",
        "Evaluation of legislation, policy and practice on child participation in the European Union (EU) March 2015 91 At an individual level this is reflected in children\u2019s desire for adults to \u201creally listen\u201d to them. For example the Dandelion children project in Sweden 352 involved producing a checklist for how professionals engage with children. \u201cThe children mention general issues, for example the importance of \u201creal listening\u201d and also details such as, \u201cdon\u00b4t take notes during our conversation, we can make them together after the meeting instead.\u201d They also mention the importance of having enough time with the social worker, being able to meet up without parents/carers, maintain contact through e-mail/SMS, not only by phone.\u201d Frequent responses about less effective practices concerned professionals who are not skilled in talking and relating respectfully with children. This was seen to be largely the result of prevailing attitudes towards children as well as a lack of professional training. Good practice examples such as the Social Activities and Practices Institute\u2019s Listen to Children child friendly interview training in Bulgaria (see Section 4.7) with professionals are therefore important in improving practice. The quality of relationships also means adults ensuring children receive information, skills and support to participate effectively. 4.2.4 Whole project involvement Consultation with children is one of the most common forms of participation. However, this is a relatively passive form of participation which restricts children\u2019s roles to simply being informants. More effective participation practice is reflected in those examples that involve children actively in all phases of the project cycle including identifying issues, dialogue and decision making as well as taking action and evaluating outcomes (see for example counselling centres in Slovenia 353 ). Whole project involvement requires opportunities for children and adults to engage in dialogue and inquiry together in a process of co-production of knowledge. The local youth action plan 354 in Luxembourg is a further illustration of whole project involvement with young people involved in needs analysis, a development phase and an implementation phase. \u201cThe local youth action plan (as an instrument) has the potential to be very effective. However, it depends strongly on the implementation of the respective municipality (and the individuals involved); in some communities they are very satisfied, but in others there are rather disappointing results .\u201d (Practitioner, Luxembourg) Good practice examples that focus on debate and dialogue such as the examples in Germany (see section 4.6.2) are therefore indicative of effective practice as they provide an opportunity for learning between children and adults, collaboration and a more informed basis for joint decision-making and action. Children\u2019s involvement in monitoring and evaluation is an important part of that project cycle. For example the South Tyneside Check It Out group 355 in the UK are involved in service inspections in which they also have to take decisions about solutions. 352 www.maskrosbarn.org 353 http://www.scoms-lj.si/si/about-us.html 354 Overall, up to 10% of the approx. 100 local communities (municipalities) in LU have participated in the local youth action plan 355 Percy-Smith, B.

        "Evaluation of legislation, policy and practice on child participation in the European Union (EU) March 2015 92 4.2.5 Child-led Children\u2019s participation is often understood as involvement in response to adult requests. Yet some of the best examples of effective practice concern children taking the initiative and taking a lead (see example from Wales below and other child-led initiatives such as the Flemish Association of School Children 356 ). \u201cThere has been progress in the care sector recognising children and young people\u2019s views however it is reactive and issues are only considered if something is not working well.\u201d 357 (Child in care setting the agenda, Wales) The \u2018We Want 2 Hear - Young People\u2019s Participation Audit for and by Marginalised Young People project\u2019 involved young people auditing the support they received from the social care service. The young auditors were supported to take part and at the end of the project wrote and delivered a presentation of their findings and recommendations to the Children\u2019s Commissioner for Wales 358 . Other examples where children take a leadership role include the preparation of information written by and for children in care and children as asylum seekers. Initiatives that provide space and encouragement for children to use their own creativity and initiative according to their own agenda are characteristic of effective participation. This is also seen in local neighbourhood development initiatives such as the Child Friendly City Initiative: \u201cOne of the positive aspects is linked to the knowledge that children participate in the city, by developing activities autonomously and according to their own interest.\u201d (Official, Child Friendly Cities Initiative) An example of effective practice involves children taking the initiative to influence improvements in service provision in response to key issues facing young people (see for example Off the Record, Bristol UK 359 ). In contrast to young people participating in adult designed projects, there are examples of successful projects which have been completely youth led. (See for example the \u2018Don\u2019t judge me till you know me\u2019 campaign in the UK 360 and the \u2018Awareness through Entertainment\u2019 project in Cyprus in the following case study). 356 http://www.scholierenkoepel.be/info-over-vsk 357 Voices in Care Cymru consultation 358 http://www.childoneurope.org/issues/child_participation/5_UK_Ear%202%20The%20Ground_A1-4.pdf 359 www.otrbristol.org.uk 360 See Percy-Smith (2009) Evaluating the development of young people\u2019s participation in two Children\u2019s Trusts , Year Two report.

        "Evaluation of legislation, policy and practice on child participation in the European Union (EU) March 2015 93 Table 4.1 Awareness through Entertainment: A child-led project to increase knowledge about Sexual and Reproductive Health and Rights outside formal education (Cyprus) Children\u2019s (teenagers\u2019) participation was encouraged through a project called SAFE, which aimed to enhance students\u2019 awareness of issues related to sexual health and rights (relationships, safe sex, contraception, unwanted pregnancy etc.) Teenagers aged 14-17 years participated in a series of three experiential workshops which helped them increase their knowledge and build skills on issues related to sexual health and rights. The workshops also served as a platform where the young person\u2019s specific needs with regards to sexuality were identified, as were their own ideas on how they would like to communicate what they have learned to other young people. The students decided themselves that the best way to communicate with their peers was through theatre. A small team of young people (eight boys and girls) who participated in the workshops undertook the initiative to write their own theatrical script outlining issues pertaining to teenage relationships and sex. Here, it must be noted that the responsibility of writing the script was originally assigned to an experienced and famous adult script writer but the young people rejected her play (claiming that it was neither youth friendly nor relevant to their realities) and decided to write their own. Young people were involved in the entire decision-making process and had the final say in any activities that were undertaken. The play was enacted by the students themselves and various performances were carried out in Nicosia. Five performances took place. No particular structures were in place (in terms of forums or advisory groups). The students were however supported throughout the entire programme by the Project Managers and their teachers. There was a constant dialogue with the students, whereby the progress was discussed, problems were solved, new ideas were generated and alternative ways forward explored. After each theatre performance and peer training, the Project Managers, teachers and actors/peer trainers engaged in feedback sessions, where they discussed how the activity went, how well they did and the impact they had on participants. In response to the impact, the discussion focused on feedback that was received directly from the audience/participants and how perceptions may have been shifted. Impact also took into account the degree of interest the audience demonstrated and whether or not they engaged in the activity (peer training or performance). Effectiveness was measured in terms of conveying the right knowledge to other young people, and making an impact in terms of shifting or challenging perceptions and misconceptions. Quality was measured in terms of audience/participants providing a positive feedback and claiming satisfaction with the activity, as well as engaging their audience and keeping them interested. This feedback showed that young people reacted positively to the performance; that they were generally more receptive to the key messages about sexual health and rights, and that they identified better with the scenarios that were presented by their peers than might have been the case in a more traditional educational context.

        "Evaluation of legislation, policy and practice on child participation in the European Union (EU) March 2015 94 Child-led participation such as this, where children have the space to decide what is most relevant to them and design and carry out the activities accordingly is highly effective. At an individual level children can become empowered through taking on more responsibility for their own situation. This is reflected in the democratic school examples in Section 4.6 (for example Escole da Ponte 361 in Portugal) but also in care settings with children with a disability and where children are involved in their individual development plans. In the Netherlands for example: \u201cThere has been a shift towards less pampering and more self-sufficiency of children with disabilities. This has especially been noted by interviewees who highlighted that more special schools have included children in the process of the individual development plans. They also appear to have more opportunities through other informal channels, for example 33% of special needs schools have a student council. These are the areas in which good practices occur on a case by case (school by school) basis .\u201d 362 4.2.6 Learning the skills of democratic citizenship One of the features of effective participation in the evidence from this study is for children to have the opportunities to develop the skills of participation. \u201cThe NGOs where children can acquire specific skills or where they can develop personally or socially for example the Youth Bank programme that supports young people\u2019s ideas and projects by funding the best projects.\u201d (Practitioner, Romania) For example in Dutch schools, despite school councils not being compulsory \u201c\u2026 children are taught how they can become active citizens from an early age. They learn about the processes and methods. Then they learn to experiment with such process through the Council of Co- decision .\u201d (See also the democratic school example of Escola da Ponte in Portugal and the inclusion of empowerment and participation as implicit values within youth work projects). 4.2.7 Sustainable and longer term One widespread criticism of participation is when a token group of children are brought in to be consulted on a one off basis. In contrast participation is more effective when children have opportunities to participate on a regular basis in different areas of their everyday lives and on an ongoing basis. Medium and long term initiatives are therefore seen as more effective than short term projects. 4.2.8 Integrity and consistency Simply having a children\u2019s council or undertaking consultations is not in itself an indicator of effective practice. Participation initiatives that demonstrate the most effective practices are those that have a dependable structure to their activities involving regular meetings, with support from professionals without being overly controlled, where children are informed through communication flows, and where children have a sense of identity and belonging with the group. 361 Escola da Ponte is located in the parish of S. Tome of Negrelos, Santo Tirso, Porto district. Covering the 1st, 2nd and 3rd cycle of basic education, the school defends a different model of education from that is presented in the national/traditional educational framework. 362 Bokdam, J., Bal, J. & Jonge, de, J.

        "Evaluation of legislation, policy and practice on child participation in the European Union (EU) March 2015 95 The Cyprus Children\u2019s Parliament is an example of good practice because: 1. Children are elected and not appointed \u2013 their peers in schools elect them every two years and they are accountable to them. 2. The two year term of office allows children to work on issues after they are well informed and helps them go deeper into understanding the issues and thus come up with meaningful and applicable suggestions. 3. The meetings are regular and enable children to come to decisions that reflect the group and not individuals. 4. The children get the feeling of belonging to a group that can make a difference and that can affect the decision makers. As a formally constituted group they have the chance to participate in events not only in Cyprus but also in the rest of Europe and gain experience and knowledge that they bring back and enhance their national work In Germany there was recognition of the importance of having some definite points of contact for children to engage with politicians and decision makers, for example through the Children and Youth offices in Berlin through which politicians can listen to children and make a commitment to take forward their cause. 4.2.9 When change and influence happens There is abundant evidence that the process of participation in itself provides tremendous benefit for young people. However, responses suggest that in addition, participation is most effective when change happens; specifically when there are responses to children\u2019s needs that bring about improvements to children\u2019s lives. \u201cA programme is effective for Roma children if it produces personal development. Our programmes are efficient, they increase the self-esteem of the children, as opposed to marginalisation, trust; they become aware that they can change things at local level. They become models for others.\u201d (NGO, Romania) To achieve this effective practice involves understanding children\u2019s needs holistically. This may also involve changes to local policy or to developments in organisations and communities. However, a number of country responses suggested that often the participation of children has little influence as it has \u201cno real power\u201d. There is a need for more research to substantiate this assertion, however, the available evidence in this evaluation concerning the lack of direct impact from participation suggests this falls short of effective practice in many cases. 4.2.10 Children providing solutions Approaches to participation that focus solely on children \u2018having a say\u2019 can often lose out on possibilities for children taking a fuller role in providing solutions and taking action. Although taking action is part of the project cycle, it is important to highlight here in its own right as illustrative of an effective form of participation. This was seen as also being important with younger children in early years settings. \u201cChildren like to participate in consultation processes. They have an interest in participating in play, defining rules for common life and giving solutions to problems.\u201d (Practitioner, Slovenia) \u201cTraining on communication, when civic engagement is involved, is effective. It is not enough if problems are identified, children should be involved in finding solutions. They should implement projects in their community.\u201d (Country Expert, Romania) ",
        "Evaluation of legislation, policy and practice on child participation in the European Union (EU) March 2015 96 A number of responses concerning effective practice highlighted how well children can participate in taking action and providing solutions in community based projects in school or neighbourhood (see good practice examples in the following section). The good practice examples included instances where children provided support and services through peer-to-peer support. These are more effective forms of participation because of the experience children have gained. Valuing children\u2019s experiences is also central in providing effective training for professionals. For example in Wales, the organisation Children in Care developed and delivered training for adults through the Voices in Care network 363 . Similarly, in Maskrosbarn 364 (the Dandelion children) in Sweden, children developed a checklist for professional training. 4.2.11 Informal community-based integrated initiatives The local projects discussed above or initiatives within schools or care settings are important for children to have the freedom to participate more informally in their own everyday life contexts at both an individual and group level. Indeed some respondents stated that most participation initiatives happened regardless of legislation. However, others argued that legislation is important to provide a framework within which participation can happen. It is also important that local, bottom up initiatives connect with, inform and integrate with top down political decisions. The Northern Irish councils and Welsh Children in Care projects are good examples of more effective participation of this kind. In this respect effective participation needs to involve wider community based participation initiatives being integrated and embedded with decision making structures in organisations and local governance structures (See for example the Flemish Youth Council) 365 . Legislation and local governance structures provide a structure and framework for participation, but are not the only drivers of participation. There needs to be flexibility to accommodate bottom up community based participation initiatives within democratic processes at a local and national level. \u201cThere is a tension between enabling or facilitating children\u2019s participation and ordering it by law only. The power of legal regulations per se should not be over-estimated. They can only be effective if there is dialogue between different stakeholders (ministries, NGOs, children\u2019s rights organisations, helplines, children and youth ombudspersons, confident teachers, etc). Authorities need exchange with NGOs, as they represent the human dimension of legal and technocratic regulations.\u201d (Practitioner, Austria) These features of effective practice have emerged from evidence from all the countries in the evaluation. However, they do not apply uniformly in all countries or across all sectors and settings, in part due to different countries and different sectors being at different stages of understanding about child participation. 363 http://www.voicesfromcarecymru.org.uk/ 364 www.maskrosbarn.org 365 http://vlaamsejeugdraad.be/ ",
        "Evaluation of legislation, policy and practice on child participation in the European Union (EU) March 2015 97 4.3 Evidence of poor practice Poor practice is where the principles for effective practice outlined above have not been upheld. There are some specific areas where poor practice was indicated in the evaluation. Children\u2019s views not taken into account \uf0b7 Where the child\u2019s perspective was not taken into account at all. \uf0b7 Where there is a recognised child participation structure such as a children\u2019s council, but children\u2019s suggestions are not taken into consideration (see for example the case of children\u2019s councils in Croatia) 366 and evidence from this study that in Germany 80% of the decisions of youth parliaments are immediately rejected. \uf0b7 There is a general lack of participation of younger children under the age of 12. Failing to take children\u2019s views into account tended to happen in situations where the child is seen to be particularly vulnerable for example in judicial proceedings concerning migrants or in family court cases. In such cases children are not only unable to speak out on decisions that affect them but are often also not informed about what is going on. Children not informed or expected to participate without information \uf0b7 Other examples of poor practice concerned situations where children were expected to participate but were not given prior information to prepare them or support in understanding what is going on. \uf0b7 Equally there are many children going into alternative care who are not informed about where they will be placed, experience a lack of information and are not included in decisions about which school they go to. 367 Tokenism \uf0b7 School councils are often seen as a good example of effective participation, yet evidence suggests that they can be controlled by school staff and merely fulfil legal obligations with young representatives chosen undemocratically and with agenda set by staff. . \uf0b7 In spite of individual children participating in individual development plans being seen as good practice, this is only sometimes the case (see for example Croatia 368 ) and often becomes a legal formality without the child having real impact on decisions (Finland) . . 369 Failure to provide child friendly environment/practices \uf0b7 An example where children were informed about the outcome of family court proceedings via the abusive parent. \uf0b7 The lack of availability of a female professional to work with or interview girls where this is requested. \uf0b7 Where there are no professional protocols or standards for child friendly interviewing. 366 \u017di\u017eak, A., Koller-Trbovi \u0107 , N., Je \u0111 ud Bori \u0107 , I., Maurovi \u0107 , I., Mirosavljevi \u0107 , A., Ratkajec Ga\u0161evi \u0107 , G.

These child-friendly witness rooms are hardly used, it has to be requested, even though the law on criminal procedure prescribes their use, without an obligation to do so. They are only used by police, court, prosecutors, doctors, psychologists but they will not hear the child in these rooms. It is also not ensured that girls are heard by women. There is no professional protocol for people questioning children, the testimonies are recorded by hidden cameras; the child does not receive appropriate notification or assistance to understand what is going on. There is no regulation, professional or ethical rule prescribing the court to use the recordings.\u2019\u201d 370 (Country Expert, Hungary) Where organisations/staff control the agenda \uf0b7 Top down, professional-led initiatives which tend to be reactive to issues rather than proactively engaging with children around issues which are also a priority for children. \uf0b7 Where children\u2019s input is used to validate adults\u2019 decisions. A number of countries reported how less effective participation is evident in the way school councils can be operated as a formalised top down process of validating school decisions. Lack of monitoring and evaluation \uf0b7 The lack of monitoring and evaluation of participation by national and local authorities is seen as undermining effective practice. 4.4 Contexts for effective participation There were some contexts that emerged as being more conducive to effective participation than others. These included day-to-day contexts such as schools, care settings and local neighbourhoods which are more relevant to the immediate reality of children\u2019s lives. Local projects in particular were identified as being conducive to effective participation since children can more easily comprehend and relate to the purpose of the project, impact becomes more easily realisable, they tend to involve collaboration with adults and other members of the community, enable children to develop skills for participation on a familiar context and, through their undertaking, help to change attitudes and perceptions of adults towards children. Projects in everyday contexts provide opportunities for children to derive personal benefits through realisation of their own abilities as they undertake projects. This highlights the importance of learning in a participatory process and is therefore especially relevant to school contexts which are conducive to developing initiatives for children to develop participatory competences. This is evident in the Democratic School good practice examples in Chapter 4.7. Similarly the good practice examples with children in care reflect this as children are encouraged to take on more responsibility for decisions in their everyday contexts such as individual development plans as well as having a say on issues concerning children in care and civic issues of wider relevance. For example in Bulgaria the use of summer camps for children in alternative care provide a different context for children to express their views on wider issues such as the environment and climate change rather than just their immediate affairs. 370 Csal\u00e1d, Gyermek, Ifj\u00fas\u00e1g Egyes\u00fclet (2013) Alternative - NGO \u2013 Report on the Implementation of the UN CRC in Hungary 2006\u20132012.

        "Evaluation of legislation, policy and practice on child participation in the European Union (EU) March 2015 99 4.5 Intergenerational dimensions of participation Children do not participate in isolation, but in relation to other groups in society. Hence discussions about impact and effectiveness of children\u2019s participation relate to children being able to influence outcomes of decision making processes in relation to adults. Many of the examples in this section concerning effective (and ineffective) practice relate to children being able to engage in intergenerational processes with adults. These include for example: \uf0b7 Shared processes \uf0b7 Joint decision making \uf0b7 Dialogue and debate \uf0b7 Developing relationships of respect \uf0b7 Children training adult professionals \uf0b7 Communication and joint learning between children and adults Analysis of intergenerational processes was a contractual requirement for the analysis in this evaluation, given that child participation cannot be addressed in isolation to the rest of the society, and during the evaluation there was particular focus on integrated child participation that promotes intergenerational understanding, solidarity, communication and activities. and is reflected in the discussion of good practice examples and revised good practice criteria. In addition to the country mapping the child peer research element of this evaluation organized a series of intergenerational workshops for young people and adults to come together in dialogue in response to the findings the evaluation. Many of the questions and responses children raised in the peer research as well as the good practice examples illustrate the way in which intergenerational relations are central to children\u2019s experience of participation and key to the extent to which children are able to participate effectively. \u201cI would like to express my enthusiasm for this (intergenerational) meeting which pleased me very much. Apart from meeting new people \u2013 which was definitely a very interesting part \u2013 and the exchange of views, we had an opportunity to sit at the same table with adults having important positions relating to children. I was impressed by their willingness (at least most of them) to listen to our views. I was also surprised by the fact that \u2026 they dedicated time to listen to us.\u201d (15 year old girl) \u201cI was given the chance to make new acquaintances. \u2026 I had to confront people older than us and exchange views. I was very much impressed by the willingness of most of them, if not all, to answer our questions and try and help us.\u201d (15 year old boy) Evidence from the peer research however also revealed that for many children active participation with adults in relationships of equality and mutual respect are rarely the norm, instead being exceptional within projects such as this. One of the findings from the child peer research in Greece highlighted that a quality of relationships with adults is not only often absent with professionals but also with parents in the home. These are illustrative of the struggles many children face in seeking to participate in everyday matters and are frequently characterised by an inequality of power relations between children and parents (and often professionals). Scenarios such as this are also reinforced by dominant social constructs of childhood and cultural (paternalistic) attitudes about the position of children in the family. ",
        "Evaluation of legislation, policy and practice on child participation in the European Union (EU) March 2015 100 However, the importance of a quality of intergenerational relations is clear in the good practice section below. In particular through joint processes, where communication and learning between children and adults is open and effective and where dialogue and debate (and more widely joint learning) between children and adults is a feature. There is increasing attention being paid to understanding children\u2019s participation as an intergenerational process 371 with good practice examples 372 that highlight the importance of children involved collaboratively with adults rather than simply being invited to contribute a view to an adult agenda. As an example, in Greece some of the most effective examples of children\u2019s councils are thought to include those with a stronger inter-generational dimension, so that the children participate in \u201csocial solidarity and environmental activities rather than focusing exclusively on the mechanics of decision-making 373 \u201d. The evidence in this evaluation highlights the importance of participation to young people as a relational process rooted in everyday life interactions. In the child peer research project in Bristol, UK in this evaluation, a key finding from young people with mental health issues was that they felt that adults didn\u2019t know how to listen to them or respect what they had to say. \u201cWhat makes it work is staff compromising, working with you, helping you out\u2026 but it's got to be vice versa as well. It\u2019s a two way thing really. It\u2019s just the staff working with the individual and the individual working with the staff\u201d. (18 year old boy, UK) 4.6 Good practice in participation 4.6.1 Nationally recognised good practice This study has highlighted a variety of very different types of good practice reflecting different interpretations of what participation involves in different situations and at local and national levels. To some extent this is the result of inevitable subjectivity on the part of country experts. Accordingly, good practice examples seem to be selected according to different criteria. For example, whilst some examples are based simply on opportunities for children to \u2018have a say\u2019, others are characterised by more active participation of children in developing and undertaking actions in partnership with adults in which children have higher levels of influence and involvement. To a large extent these different positions appear to reflect a literal understanding of Article 12 of the UNCRC and on the other hand, the influence of a wider understanding of participatory practice as a more holistic process of engagement in all phases of a project or decision making cycle beyond just having a say. In other cases examples are not about participation at all, but about providing activities or services to children. Taken together however, there are patterns that are evident in good practice across the case study countries that provide an indication of the state of child participation across Europe. The good practice examples provided here are based solely on those nominated in the evaluation. There are therefore likely to be comparable examples of different practices in other countries. These do however provide evidence of where participation can be most effective. 371 Percy-Smith, B. and Thomas, N. eds (2010) A Handbook of children\u2019s participation: Perspectives from theory and practice .

        "Evaluation of legislation, policy and practice on child participation in the European Union (EU) March 2015 101 4.6.2 Patterns of good practice across Europe Annex Two documents the main types of good practice examples that have been evidenced in this study according to different types of participation and provides details about each example. Overall the patterns illustrate that participation does not take one form and instead develops in different ways, at different levels, and in different contexts. Most commonly countries have followed conventional models of representative democratic structures with children and youth councils at both local and national level, children and youth parliaments at a national level and other advisory committee and fora to influence mainstream adult decision making and political processes. In some cases these are supported by National networks. At the same time there are many different projects and initiatives that seek to support the development of participation in everyday contexts. To a large extent these are driven by NGOs, research projects or initiatives within schools or other services. Whilst many are concerned with supporting children to have a say, others are concerned with promoting children and young people to take on more active roles either autonomously or in collaboration with adults. To that extent the nature of some of the good practice examples are characterised more by process than structure, for example, through dialogue and debate or the promotion of active citizenship and through developing different relationships with adults for example in schools. A further category of good practice example concerns initiatives that can be identified as supporting actions to educate, promote and build capacity for participation. These include the many initiatives that provide information, advice, support and advocacy for children\u2019s participation; education and awareness-raising about rights and participation; and professional training for participation. In addition there were a number of examples provided that indeed seemed to indicate good practice but were about children\u2019s policy and practice generally rather than about participation.

        "Evaluation of legislation, policy and practice on child participation in the European Union (EU) March 2015 105 4.6.2.1 Structures and networks for influencing public sector decision making Children\u2019s councils and parliaments are a common form of good practice across Europe at both local and national levels. Children\u2019s councils as a model can be identified as good practice as they are open for all children to take part, can operate at different levels and in different contexts and are ideally suited to ensuring connections with adult dominated decision making structures. Children\u2019s councils tend to be financed by local authorities. They consist of elected representatives of children aged 12 years and over with the exception of the Children\u2019s Town councils in France which have been in existence since the 1970s and include children as young as seven. School councils commonly involve children younger than 12. Two particular examples of Children\u2019s Councils stand out as good practice \uf0b7 Children\u2019s councils of Opatija (Croatia) \u2013 these were identified by a number of respondents as good practice and stand out as they are not simply concerned with children\u2019s views and input into decisions but have developed based on an explicit commitment to a set of values concerning children\u2019s role as active citizens in local governance. These include developing mutual respect; developing communication beetwen children and City of Opatija; respect for the rights of all groups of citizens; and a commitment to supporting children's evolving capacities to participate and developing responsibility of children for decisions they make. \uf0b7 Children\u2019s Town councils (FR) \u2013 have been in existence for several decades and as such are an established and sustainable feature of local French democratic life. But more importantly they are widespread and open for children as young as seven years to take part. At a local level there are also councils and forums which are specific to sectors and settings. For example pupil or student councils which are a common feature for many countries and Children in Care Councils in England. Whilst school councils tend to be specific to particular schools, other sector specific groups such as Children in Care Councils tend to serve young people across a whole city or district. At a national level there are children or youth parliaments in many countries to which local councils provide representation. Unlike local children's councils that meet monthly, children and youth parliaments tend to meet less often for example two to three times a year often as part of an annual youth conference (for example the UK youth parliament). Funky Dragon, the children and young people's parliament in Wales is a widely acclaimed example of good practice. It aims to \u201cenable children and young people in Wales to get their voices heard by Government and others who make decisions about policies and services that affect their lives.\u201d The Grand Council is made up of 100 children and young people from across Wales which includes representatives for statutory service, school councils, voluntary sector and equality for each local authority. Alongside national children and youth parliaments there are advisory bodies such as the Commissioner\u2019s Youth Advisory Committee in Cyprus or the Children and Young People\u2019s Forum in Ireland which have a dual role of advising on issues of concern to children and young people; as well as undertaking projects or activity at the behest of the Minister or department. These typically involve 30-40 young people from 12-18 years and often involve a wider representation of children including those from vulnerable groups. In the UK many local authorities have shadow scrutiny committees which undertake an advisory role, for example, in South Tyneside. The best examples of children\u2019s councils are those where there is a strong connection between local councils and the national youth parliament and, in turn, where there are strong connections to adult structures. A good example is in Ireland where the Comhairle na n\u00d3g (Local youth councils) feed into the D\u00e1il na n\u00d3g (National youth parliament) which work closely with local and national decision making structures. Three key factors are instrumental in the success of these structures in Ireland. First there is a network of regional participation officers to support the local councils. Second, there is a lead government department that oversees; funds, and supports these councils. ",
        "Evaluation of legislation, policy and practice on child participation in the European Union (EU) March 2015 106 Third, councils are complemented by the Children and Young People\u2019s Forum which advise on issues of concern to children and young people as well as undertake projects on behalf of the Minister. A further example of good practice is the Children\u2019s parliaments in Slovenia. These are multi-tiered having influence at national level whilst also having foundations in schools and regions. School parliaments are supported by the Slovenian Association of Friends of Youth and include children as young as six years. To complement parliaments there are also national networks of children and youth organisations such as Network of child friendly schools (Latvia) or The Flemish association of school children (Vlaamse Scholierenkoepel \u2018VSK\u2019) (Belgium) that support local activity as well as lobby governments on key issues of concern generated autonomously by child members. The network of child friendly schools was initiated by the Ministry of Welfare and coordinated by the State Inspectorate on Protection of Children\u2019 Rights (financed by The National Child Protection Inspectorate, VBTAI) to support the active participation of students in school decision making. Whereas this network is concerned with supporting the realisation of participation in practice, others are concerned more with influence at the level of policy. For example \u2018Atoms in the network \u2018in Poland is a federation of youth organisations that work with local politicians to develop a strategy for youth involving a process of inquiry, dialogue and cooperation as well as young people and politicians learning experientially how to talk to each other. Young people are seen as a resource, not just the subject of an action or source of problems. Child Friendly schools for example; in Latvia and Slovakia where children take on the role as junior ambassadors in promoting the rights of children in schools; and, at a pan European level, the Child Friendly Cities network are both UNICEF initiatives. The Child Friendly Cities initiative provides numerous examples of good practice in different countries and cities. The initiative provides a framework of support and guidance and criteria for monitoring success. Stuttgart has been widely recognised as a good practice example of a child friendly city. Some networks are more focused on support for professionals such as Participation Network in Northern Ireland and others playing an essential lobbying role such as the Children\u2019s Rights Alliance for England. Notable outcomes from the activities of these structures that have been identified as being good practice include the children\u2019s services strategy in Austria \u2018Kinder in die Mitte\u2019, the Nationaler Aktionsplan and Kinder und Jugendreport (child and youth report) in Germany and the Program for Youth in Warsaw (2013-2020). 4.6.2.2 Children\u2019s voices and consultations A second significant cluster of good practice concerns initiatives that have a primary concern to hear the views and experiences of children. These involve both consultations initiated by government authorities or children\u2019s ombudspersons; as well as projects and initiatives established to promote the voice of the child, including those of specific groups. For example the Office of the Ombudsman for Children in Ireland (who has a statutory obligation to consult with children), undertakes numerous consultations with children generally through Youth Advisory Panels and initiatives such as the Big Ballot (2007) and the Big Debate relating to the Children\u2019s Referendum (2012) as well as targeted initiatives for example, separated children, children detained in adult prisons, and bullying. Consultations often involve a programme of visits by the Ombudsman. There is also evidence of some good practice projects that use film and news media to engage children in expressing their views about current news items including those put forward as being important for themselves (for example Stamp Media in Belgium and Television Channel M2 in Hungary). Consultation is in itself a \u2018low\u2019 level form of participation as it solely involves sharing a view in response to issues and questions determined often by adults. However, there are times when sometimes consultation may have a significant influence for example in national youth surveys or through Ombudsman consultations, for example in Finland with the \u2018We believe in you tour\u2019 that seeks the views of children with experience of welfare services and alternative care. Equally this evaluation has highlighted initiatives that are about supporting children to speak out but not in response to adult agenda. ",
        "Evaluation of legislation, policy and practice on child participation in the European Union (EU) March 2015 107 A second type of good practice related to children having a say are those that are driven more by the need to promote children\u2019s voices and experiences. For example \u2018Hear our voices\u2019 and Listening to visually impaired children in Spain to promote the voices of children with learning difficulties; \u2018What do you think' in Belgium which support vulnerable children giving their views on their situation; Voices against violence in Scotland; and \u2018Young Developers\u2019 in Finland. Young Developers is a Helsinki-based group of young people (aged 13-20) with experience of child protection services who communicate their views and experiences of child protection services and lobby politicians and decision makers. Young Developers received one of the three Ministry of Justice Democracy Awards (in 2012). A further type of example involves those initiatives that seek to promote the voice of the child as an act of democratic development rather than solely as form of consultation. For example \u2018Have your say\u2019 in the Czech republic (\u201cKecejme do toho\u201d) that seeks to promote structured dialogue with young people with the aim of creating a nationwide inclusive platform for youth participation at national level with connections also to the European level. It helps young people to express their opinion on public issues connected to their lives. The project helps to shape discussions about the hot topics among young people and communicate the outcomes of discussions to the public sphere e.g. politicians, civil servants, civil society and media. It seeks to empower the role of young people in society and also promote the principles of democracy, social dialogue and youth participation. (See also examples under participation in practice below). The Youth Council of Slovenia also makes extensive use of structured dialogue as a method of consultation with young people. 4.6.3 Child-friendly interviewing Key to effective participation is the ability of the adult to build a relationship with the child and listen respectfully to what they are saying. Whilst not constituting an act of participation in itself, preparing adults for enabling children to participate effectively is essential. The project below is one of a small number of examples of good practice in training adult professionals in child friendly interviewing (see also Nobody\u2019s Children Foundation in Poland, Survivors in Finland and the Cedar Foundation user involvement project above. Listen to the Child (Bulgaria) coordinated by Social Activities and Practices Institute (SAPI), an NGO active on the national level, has created a model for child-friendly interviewing in legal procedures (children as victims of crime) with special emphasis on raising the competence of professionals (judges, prosecutors as well as social workers) who interact with them. In addition SAPI provides a specialised mobile team for hearing child participants in legal proceedings, 11 specialised interviewing rooms for children and a set of standards. 4.6.3.1 Participation in practice In contrast to participation initiatives that are focused on children inputting into adult controlled decision-making, there is an emerging body of evidence where children are able to take responsibility for decisions and actions in response to their own needs. These occur in situations characterised by the incorporation of a culture of participation into the everyday practices and functioning of organisations. Whilst this ethos is widely incorporated into educational pedagogy in many countries especially in early years as part of children\u2019s education and development, in other sectors and settings children may not be encouraged and supported in self-determining actions. The distinction here is between having a mechanism for children to participate and having an overall culture of participation throughout the organisation. In the latter, participation is a fundamental principle embedded in the organisation\u2019s culture and practices. The examples in this section illustrate participation as a process of children taking increasingly more control over everyday decisions and processes at an individual level as well as a collective or institutional level. ",
        "Evaluation of legislation, policy and practice on child participation in the European Union (EU) March 2015 108 Individual empowerment/active roles A number of countries (for example BE, EE, LU) refer to the way in which participation and empowerment are fundamental values in youth work where young people are supported in participating fully in decisions within the youth work setting (for example Chef de Bar or Co- Pilote projects in Luxembourg). This is also resonant with the examples in the following section where children play an active or lead role in local community projects. This ethos is also reflected in the work of SOS children\u2019s village, specifically in Greece concerning the implementation of Quality4Children Standards for out-of-home child care, three of which refer to the participation of children during the admission process, during the care-taking process and during the leaving-care process. A further SOS Children\u2019s Village initiative concerns Individual development plans in Lithuania where children take part in developing their individual social care plans to cover all life situations. The child is involved in collaboration with their carer in all phases of preparation, monitoring and evaluation of their individual development plans. Children take decisions together with their carer and therefore participation is collaborative. Democratic development: Developing participatory competence and self determination A further set of good practice examples concern projects and initiatives whose purpose is more long term and focus on the development of participatory competence in children and young people. Ultimately a goal of participation is for all children to be able to take active roles in matters that affect them within a context of organisations and groups that operate according to respect for the principles of rights and active involvement. A number of these examples involve encouraging children to take more responsibility for everyday decisions. For example in the Naruc Crisis centre in Slovakia children who are victims of domestic abuse, violent and neglect and seeking respite for short periods, are involved in making decisions about their everyday living environments as well as decisions after they leave the centre. The ZPMPvSK project supports the development of self advocacy in children with mental health problems. A unique example amongst those reported is the Kan Sjalv (Can do it by myself) project in Sweden 381 , which is a participative cultural and pedagogic project for 0-2 year olds which is developed with small children and then used in provision of early years self-discovery experiences for other children. Some of these initiatives are explicitly focused on participation in terms of seeking the social inclusion of particular groups of children in everyday life contexts for example the UNICEF and Ruhama inclusion project 382 in Romania and Slovakia that seek to integrate Roma children through intercultural education and developing leadership amongst Roma children. In Spain the Occupados en Contruie 383 (Busy building) program promotes the acquisition of skills and abilities in family, school and neighbourhood with children (8-12 years) living in poor neighbourhoods. The approach involves the design of a project that necessitates experiential learning and developing participatory competences in order to participate for example by building shelters for children in the neighbourhood. The Puerpolis social intervention project 384 in Portugal has a similar approach using projects to engage children who have low levels of education but are also isolated in rural areas and therefore have little access to services and cultural activities. In Bulgaria the Cedar Foundation user involvement project 385 seeks to support children with disabilities in realising their right to participate in decision-making through developing communication and by training professionals working with children and youth with disabilities to include these children in all processes of making decisions about their life. The good practice they employ is based on methods for planning with accent on the personality and alternative 381 http://kansjalv-ida.blogspot.co.uk 382 http://www.ruhama.ro/en/ http://www.unicef.org/romania/ https://www.unicef.sk/ 383 http://www.injucam.org/proyectos-estrella/ocupados-en-construir/ 384 http://projectopuerpolis.blogspot.pt/ 385 http://www.cedarfoundation.org/en/ ",
        "Evaluation of legislation, policy and practice on child participation in the European Union (EU) March 2015 109 methods of communication, as one of the ways to protect the rights of the child. Children benefit through realisation of their abilities, self-knowledge, improved communication, greater opportunity for self-expression, newly gained confidence, freedom, self-esteem, changed status in hierarchical links and improved relationships. Developing participatory competences in children is an underlying objective in many participation initiatives. For example the Schooligans project 386 in Greece is primarily an NGO- led initiative to support the expression of children\u2019s views on their own terms. However, by exploring and reflecting on their views and experiences, children engage in collaborative decision making to develop proposals in response to issues raised. Building the boat in Scotland helps young people develop experience in \u2018co-producing policy and in Sweden the Barbro Betaler project in Kungsbacka Municipality focuses on handing responsibility for spending decisions to young people. Democratic schools Many of the most significant examples of developing participatory practice are in education, in examples of democratic schools. Democratic schools are those that are organized and run according to democratic principles and values and as such provide an alternative to mainstream education. 387 One example is the Transparent and Participative School programme in Poland which seeks to implement and promote a model of the school as an open and flexible institution where students participate in community life through democratic processes such as bottom-up projects, cooperation between students, teachers and head teachers, participating in decisions taken by the head teacher, debating new ideas and promoting knowledge about students\u2019 rights. A further example is the \u2018Ateliers de d\u00e9mocratie familiale\u2019 (workshops of family democracy) 388 in France. In this school, children can express their views and participate in decisions together with adults. Collective projects are implemented according to democratic principles. For example, the Escola da Ponte in Portugal is a unique educational model developed over two decades, which includes the participation of children (6-16 years) as a basic principle. It is organised according to a unique logic of pedagogic and institutional organisation, within which students participate in mutual learning. Each student is author and actor of their own educational pathway; enabling active participation in the process of knowledge construction as well as full involvement in the processes of school decision making at all levels. The school agenda is therefore shaped by children. Dialogue, debate and democracy Some good practice examples revealed in the research for this study promote young people\u2019s participation in democratic processes such as public debate and dialogue with adults. For example Youth council national youth debates in the Netherlands are seen as one of the most successful methods for youth participation. Dialogue days are used in Finland to evaluate services at a local level and involve young people discussing their experiences of services with decision-makers. The Democracy Campaign of Schleswig-Holstein in Germany provides a foundation for child and youth participation and is based on the assumption that public authority decision making needs to be balanced by direct participation in communities. 386 www.theschooligans.gr 387 For further discussion about democratic schooling see Fielding, M. and Moss, P. (2011) Radical education and the common school: A democratic alternative. London: Routledge. 388 http://meirieu.com/ECHANGES/legal_atelier_democratie_familiale.pdf ",
        "Evaluation of legislation, policy and practice on child participation in the European Union (EU) March 2015 110 Peer to peer projects Some of the best examples of good practice concern children providing peer to peer support. In Rome, Italy, an outreach peer group support for unaccompanied migrant children many of whom are engaged in child labour involves providing peer to peer materials on the rights of child labourers developed by the peer workers. Navrat in Slovakia also uses a peer to peer approach to provide mentoring support for children coming from institutional care into foster care. This work has included older children and young people producing a \u2018Book of Life\u2019 to support children in foster care as well as providing counselling. Local projects with children A key aim in any participation initiative is for children to increasingly take higher levels of responsibility in addressing issues that affect them. One of the ways that this often happens is through child-led action. This may involve campaigns and lobbying, but also through undertaking projects. Commonly this happens through projects to improve schools or communities. This type of participation is commonly undertaken as part of the Child Friendly Cities (e.g. DE, ES, LU, PT and SI). At the smaller scale of the school the Bientraitance resilience network 389 in Bulgaria is a project run by the NGO SAPI working in four schools in three cities to support children (7-12 years) to decide how to improve their school environment, in a way that promotes their development. A Center for Citizenship Education in Poland project is a further example of good practice in children\u2019s participation in which students prepare and undertake projects about local school issues. These centres are now incorporated into school curricula and are recognised for their role in developing a sense of self agency in students. These projects have a dual purpose; first in communicating the views, experiences and issues of importance to adults; and second in providing an opportunity for young people to develop skills and competences of active citizenship. In Romania two good practice examples involved developing \u2018leadership\u2019 capacity amongst Roma children, and a project using art to help integrate young Roma children in schools. The Puerpolis social intervention project 390 in Portugal is a further example of a project to promote inclusion and participation of young people in rural areas. The project involves a range of activities which themselves foster participation of young people in planning and joint decision making with adults with an emphasis on encouraging self-determination amongst young people. Child and youth inspections Involving children and young people in monitoring and evaluation roles can be a powerful way of influencing policy and practice. The Inspectieteam Jeugdzorg Q4C \u2013 Institutional care youth inspection developed by the Stichting Alexander (Alexander Foundation) non-profit research and advice bureau in the Netherlands 391 , specifically involves young people in institutional care settings undertaking the inspection of their own institution. Teams of eight young people conduct research with children in institutional care about key issues such as their experiences of the quality of their care and ideas for improvements which are then presented to the board of the institution. They then advise the staff and professionals about the improving of the policy. 389 http://www.sapibg.org/proekti-socialni-deinosti/1436-bientretans-mreja-na-rezilians 390 http://projectopuerpolis.blogspot.pt/ 391 http://www.st-alexander.nl/ ",
        "Evaluation of legislation, policy and practice on child participation in the European Union (EU) March 2015 111 The Youth Inspection Team \u2018Check It Out\u2019 in South Tyneside, UK 392 involves 12 young people undertaking inspections of youth service projects. Young people decide which inspections they are going to carry out, provide one week\u2019s notice and undertake the inspection. Young people provide a grading according to five levels of award (bronze to platinum) and write a report based on their inspection. The inspection team then go back two months later and go back through what they have looked at. As soon as the report is done a meeting is arranged with the youth service management. Young people present their findings about what is good and bad and the youth service manager has two weeks to reply. Any strategic issues can be taken up by the youth service manager and if necessary can be taken further within the local authority. The inspection team is recognised by the local authority but most action is taken by the youth service. 4.6.3.2 Supporting actions The final category of good practice examples were not necessarily concerned with participatory processes but with actions that support or promote children\u2019s participation. These include Information, advice, support and advocacy; education promotion and awareness-raising of children\u2019s rights and participation; and professional training. Information, advice, support and advocacy Many of the good practice examples here involved advice support and advocacy in legal settings. For example Children\u2019s counsellors in court proceedings in Austria 393 ; Free legal advice to young immigrants in France on their rights and obligations regarding their participation in decisions concerning their requests for asylum or residence on French territory; and Legal assistance in Luxembourg for children in family court proceedings. The 'Children Welfare' organization, assessor scheme 394 in Denmark similarly provides advocacy support for children in care proceedings including informing the child on their rights and supporting the child in putting their views forward. The National Survivors group 395 in Finland started as a group providing peer activities, but now works with the Ministry of Social Affairs and Health and the Children\u2019s Ombudsman in an advisory capacity. Survivors works at a local, national and European level with Power4Youth (the youth led organisation of the International foster care organisation), in which they meet regularly and have contributed to recommendations to the European Commission. The Survivors group has adopted 54 recommendations, mainly relating to peer activities and to youth participation, many of which have been or will be implemented at government level by legislative and policy changes. Another type of good practice is SpunOut 396 in Ireland which is a Youth led NGO working with young people (16-25 years) across Ireland to provide information and advice on a variety of youth issues including participation, seeking young people\u2019s views and advocates for young people\u2019s views to be heard and taken into account. 392 Percy-Smith, B.

        "Evaluation of legislation, policy and practice on child participation in the European Union (EU) March 2015 112 Education, promotion and awareness raising concerning children\u2019s rights & participation There are a significant number of good practice projects that focus on awareness raising through promoting children\u2019s rights and participation, including some focused specifically on particular groups such as children with a disability (Bulgaria) and children with an intellectual disability or visual impairment (Spain). This can involve education and awareness-raising around children\u2019s rights and participation either with children or with adults or public awareness campaigns. The PHARE education campaign on children\u2019s rights 397 in Romania for example seeks to both educate children and families as well as train professionals in children\u2019s rights and participation, A Child\u2019s World (Austria) and We Play for Our Region (Hrajeme o n\u00e1\u0161 kraj) 398 (Czech Republic) both seek to promote children\u2019s rights and participation in local and regional governments and services by increasing awareness through the direct participation of children and young people in decision making processes. Some of the good practice examples concern education and awareness-raising for and about specific groups of children. For example the UNICEF \u2018What do you think\u2019 project focuses on educating vulnerable children about their rights to freedom of speech and participation working with unaccompanied migrant minors, children in hospital settings (including psychiatric care), children in poverty and children with a disability. The Cedar Foundation user involvement project 399 with children with disabilities in institutional care focuses more on self-knowledge within a framework of rights rather than rights and participation per se. A particular subset of good practice examples concerns children\u2019s participation with respect to the media. Schooligans in Greece 400 for example uses different media to help children learn about rights and democratic schooling, whereas the Easy to Stop it project 401 in Italy is focused on young people\u2019s use of the internet as a participation medium. In most of these cases adults are the educators. The UNICEF Junior Ambassadors 402 project in Slovakia however provides a good example of children taking a lead role in educating children about their rights in schools. Professional training One of the key challenges facing children\u2019s participation is the lack of understanding amongst professionals about how to engage children effectively. As such there are a small number of supporting actions involving provision of training for professionals. These include Listen to the Child in Bulgaria 403 coordinated by the NGO Social Activities and Practices Institute (SAPI) and Nobody\u2019s Children Foundation in Poland 404 who both provide training for judges, prosecutors, forensic psychologist and social workers in child friendly interviewing of children as victims of crime in legal procedures. A Child\u2019s World 405 in Austria provide training for a broad range of professional and people working in communities as part of a wider remit of promoting children\u2019s rights and participation. Some of the examples provided concern specific groups of children such as the Cedar Foundation in Bulgaria who provide training for professionals to promote new ways of including children with disabilities in all processes encompassing decisions about their life; and Survivors in Finland who train social workers on how to work and communicate with young people in foster care.

However there are some good practice initiatives that are relevant to particular sectors or settings and particular groups with examples predominantly in education and care settings. The former primarily geared towards child development and enhancing children\u2019s abilities as competent social actors; the latter focused largely on improving the well-being of children in care. 4.6.5 Revised good practice criteria At the outset of this study, Lansdown\u2019s (2011) framework for good practice was adopted and subsequently developed in light of secondary review of good practice frameworks. These included International Save the Children Alliance Practice standards for child participation 407 , the UNCRC, the Council of Europe recommendations and Hear by Right standards 408 . Whilst there is some consistency across these criteria the task of developing good practice criteria is complicated by the particular purpose criteria are developed for. Many of the good practice standards focus on conditions for participation such as ensuring children know why they are participating, that participation is voluntary and they are free from any risk, with emphasis on ensuring a child friendly environment. Others emphasise the importance of training for adults, that systems and structures are in place, and that children are supported. These are all important; however, the evidence in this evaluation highlights the importance of participation as a process of learning and action with others rather than exchange of information; focusing for example on how children are involved, how power is shared, the quality of the relationships with adults and the roles children take. Some of the most interesting examples of good practice are about children taking responsibility for their own decisions as well as in providing education and support through peer to peer work with others; where children and adults are engaged in mutual learning to reframe the quality of relationships and decision making as a collaborative endeavour; or through child led projects in schools and neighbourhoods. This section reviews good practice criteria in light of evidence emerging in this study. The first source of evidence is the responses concerning measures of meaningful and effective participation presented within this report. Secondly, submitted evidence of good practices in this study are subject to critical assessment in light of the initial framework of principles and criteria for good practice in Annex Two . Below is a revised framework of good practice that emerges from critical review of the evidence identified above in relation to the good practice criteria provided at the outset of the study. 407 A set of standards and practical guidance, including a Toolkit, designed for Save the Children staff working internationally on country programmes; to build meaningful child participation into all stages of the programme cycle.

In particular it highlights dimensions of effective practice which vary across different forms of participation and across sectors and settings. There were some contexts that emerged as being more conducive to effective participation than others. These included local level day-to-day contexts such as schools, care settings and local neighbourhoods. The findings also discuss different elements that contribute to effective practice. A range of good practice examples are provided from across EU countries that exhibit good practice criteria for example that demonstrate impact or influence; where children take an active role (rather than as passive respondents); where children are able to participate collaboratively in conjunction with adults; where children are able to meaningfully shape and influence the agenda; where participation involves empowering children and young people in terms of building capacity for self-determining autonomous decision making and action; where participation addresses structural disadvantage and exclusion; where there is a focus on a quality of relationships with adults; and where a participation initiative is part of a whole system connected to wider governance processes rather than isolated one off activities. Poor practices were also discussed based on evidence provided, where there is a lack of integrity in the way children have participated or where children\u2019s views have not been take account of at all.

        "Evaluation of legislation, policy and practice on child participation in the European Union (EU) March 2015 115 5.0 Impact and benefits of children\u2019s participation within Europe Key messages Impact on policy and practice \uf0b7 The overall picture is that children have a valuable role to play in influencing policy, and have shown ample competency to do so with appropriate support. The question of scale is a critical one, however, and the most direct and visible changes are found at local level; in schools, in youth-councils and small-scale local planning decisions. At regional and national levels, participation is contingent to a greater extent on the existence of formal tools and mechansims. \uf0b7 The most commonly found examples of national policy impact relate to children\u2019s participation in developing youth strategies or action plans, and raising awareness of policy issues through child-led research, or via children\u2019s forums or parliaments. These impacts are usually achieved via timebound consultative participation, and predominantly through lobbying, consultative events and research. Children have sometimes also been directly involved in appointing Ombudsmen or other officials. \uf0b7 The higher levels of impact at a local policy level is largely understood to be because of the wider array of structures and opportunities that exist, but also because local initiatives are closer to the everyday realities of children\u2019s lives which bring children and adults together in a setting that is meaningful to them. This context for participation reflects the importance of intergenerational dialogue. \uf0b7 There is some indication that children\u2019s participation has had an impact on changing attitudes and has led to more demand for asking children\u2019s opinions in schools and child welfare services. The national authorities are also becoming more aware of children\u2019s rights. This overall trend is more apparent within countries where there is a longer tradition of democratic rights. \uf0b7 A common way in which children have an impact in practice is through them being consulted on their own care plan or with regard to school procedures, including via student council activities. A few examples were found where children\u2019s participation has been more permanently institutionalised, and children have influenced practice on a larger scale. These examples relate to participatory inspection arrangements within the field of children\u2019s social care and child protection (UK and Sweden). \uf0b7 Patterns across sectors and settings suggest there is more participation and therefore increased chances of impact in some sectors than others. These include education (mainly through school councils), care (through participation in care planning), youth work projects, and local planning (especially through consultations on neighbourhood developments and recreation). \uf0b7 Despite the positives, there is still much variation in how child particiaption is implemented between different Member States. Key variables influencing impact include the political will of regional and local administrations; capacity and capability of professionals working with children, and the existence of appropriate dialogue mechanisms for sustaining a critical mass of activity. There is a common view across countries that decision-making is still too oftren dominated by adults. ",
        "Evaluation of legislation, policy and practice on child participation in the European Union (EU) March 2015 116 Evidence of benefits for children \uf0b7 The personal and social benefits of child participation are well documented, and include improved confidence, self-esteem, and practical or problem-solving skills. Particiaption is also associated with children\u2019s civic and social responsibility and cultural awareness. On the other hand, the benefits of the individual child\u2019s right to be heard within legal and administrative proceedings are less widely publicised. They typically follow a \u2018compensatory\u2019 model; intervening to protect children who are vulnerable due to a diminished legal status. \uf0b7 The study underlines the difficulty of evidencing the benefits of participation within more everyday interactions, and outside of the context of specific \u2018participatory projects\u2019. In many cases, respondents from the country mapping talked about the benefits of participation based on outcomes that were inferred or observed, rather than measured empirically \uf0b7 Children often realise the immediate benefits from the processes associated with participation, such as having new experiences, holding responsibility, making connections with other children and adults, and the enjoyment of taking part. However, there is also a clear link between children successfully exercising their right to be heard, and tangible improvements to their status or personal circumstances. Examples include: \uf0a7 improvements to children\u2019s health and wellbeing as a result of participation in planning their healthcare or medical treatments \uf0a7 children influencing the outcome of judicial or administrative proceedings relating to their care or custody; and, \uf0a7 children protected from harm as a result of professionals listening and taking action in the event of reported abuse or harm. \uf0b7 Aside from the benefits for society as a whole where policies, practices and processes are participative and respectful of the rights of the child, the benefits of effective participation are not restricted to children, and adult participants often also gain from having a better awareness and understanding of children\u2019s competences. Where this is the case, children sometimes find that they are given more frequent opportunities to participate in the future. \uf0b7 The study also shone a light on poor and ineffective practices, however, and found that measures intended to facilitate children\u2019s particiaption are not universally successful. Even in schools or where dedicated structures exist for children to participate, such as youth forums, children\u2019s views are not always heard, and their suggestions are not taken into account in decision making. Monitoring and evaluation of participation \uf0b7 There is a lack of systematic monitoring by EU Member States to provide an accurate assessment of the impact of children\u2019s participation at a national level. This is despite the availability to Member States of numerous monitoring and assessment frameworks and quality standards. The majority of monitoring and evaluation therefore tends to happen within individual projects and organisations, and through the CRC \u2018shadow\u2019 country reports. \uf0b7 There is clearly a high priority to improve the frequency and quality of monitoring systems at the level of Member States in order to more accurately capture the outcomes and impacts of child participation.

        "Evaluation of legislation, policy and practice on child participation in the European Union (EU) March 2015 117 This chapter reviews the practice dimensions of children\u2019s participation in greater detail. It starts by examining the extent to which children have been able to routinely affect changes to policy and practice; the principal ways in which this has been achieved; and the challenges for measuring and attributing the impacts. The chapter then looks at the variables that affect the degree of influence children are able to exert over adult decision-making, and the benefits of participation for children and young people themselves. 5.1 Impact on policy and practice The overall picture is that children have a valuable role to play in influencing policy, and have demonstrated ample competency to do so where they have been effectively supported. As we go on to consider, however, the question of scale is a critical one. The most direct and visible changes are found at local level, where children participate for example in their spare-time organisations, in school, in youth-councils and in local planning and development consultations. At regional and national levels where there is greater distance from children\u2019s day-to-day lives, the abililty to exert an influence is contingent to a greater extent on the existence of formal tools and mechansims, and impacts are inherently more timebound. 5.1.1 Impact of participation on policy at a national level The main examples of national policy impact relate to children\u2019s participation in the development of youth strategies or action plans, and raising awareness of policy issues through child-led research, or representations from children\u2019s forums or parliaments. These impacts are usually achieved via timebound consultative participation. Children\u2019s impact on national policy changes tends to happen predominantly through lobbying and consultation events, although some examples were also found of child-led research. In one such example from Italy, peer-to-peer researchers trained by an NGO provided a fresh perspective on the issues facing child labourers, resulting in a set of recommendations 409 . 409 Save the Children Italia, Io Partecipo Tu Partecipi.

        "Evaluation of legislation, policy and practice on child participation in the European Union (EU) March 2015 118 The following table highlights some notable examples of policy influence at a national level. Table 5.1 Examples of impact of children\u2019s participation on national policy Children\u2019s participation in the development of the National Children\u2019s Strategy in Ireland \uf0b7 Children were consulted on the development of the National Children\u2019s Strategy 2000-2010 Our Children \u2013 Their Lives 410 . The consultation was the first of its kind in Ireland. It is clear from the published Strategy that the views of the children had a direct impact on the Strategy. It is also widely recognised that the consultation had a powerful impact on all those (statutory and non-statutory) involved in the development of the Strategy. The first of three national goals adopted by the Strategy was that: \u201cChildren will have a voice in matters which affect them and their views will be given due weight in accordance with their age and maturity.\u201d The children also put issues on the national policy agenda that had previously not been a priority, including play, recreation and children\u2019s concern for their environment. The Comhairle na n\u00d3g (Youth Councils) structure which were established under the Strategy has been successful at a national and regional level. The Luxembourg Local Youth Action Plan \uf0b7 Around ten of the 100 local communities (municipalities) in Luxembourg participated in the development of the local youth action plan. The local youth action plan (as an instrument) has the potential to be very effective. However, it is strongly dependent on implementation within respective municipalities (and the individuals involved). As a result some communities are very satisfied, whilst others have had disappointing results with the plan. A key issue in bringing about impact is that local authorities in Luxembourg are rather small structures, lacking follow-up structures and staff in place to sustain the positive launch of a youth action plan and a lack of operational ideas how young people can be better involved. Participation in Leaving Care policy in Wales \uf0b7 Children leaving care were involved in driving leaving care policy through the \u201cWhen I\u2019m ready scheme 411 \u201d which provides foster care beyond the age of 18. This pilot project was driven by young people leaving care feeding back that they were not ready to leave care at 18 years old. A member of the Welsh Assembly Government listened to the young people and wrote a private members bill. This is currently being piloted and is due to come into force across Wales in April 2014. 412 A further way in which children are able to influence decisions at a national level is in the recruitment of staff in some countries. For example, in Cyprus where children on the Pancyprian Coordinating Committee for the Protection and Welfare of Children (PCCPWC 413 ) were involved with the Children\u2019s Parliament in recruiting the Children\u2019s Ombudsman. This is also a common practice across the UK and is often mirrored at regional and local levels. Despite these examples, however, the study found that good practices are by no means the norm and that children often have fewer opportunities to directly influence wider Government law-making, over-and-above \u2018soft law\u2019 measures pertaining to the children and youth sector. In many countries the stakeholder evidence indicates that children are not always heard and their influence is limited 414 . 410 Department of Health and Children (2000), The National Children\u2019s Strategy: Our Children \u2013 Their Lives , Dublin: Stationery Office http://www.dohc.ie/publications/pdf/childstrat_report.pdf 411 When I am Ready scheme article: http://www.bevanfoundation.org/blog/when-i-am-ready/ 412 [Voices in Care Cymru consultation; http://www.bevanfoundation.org/blog/when-i-am-ready/]. 413 http://pccpwc.org/en/Children%20Parliament.html 414 Mota (2009).

        "Evaluation of legislation, policy and practice on child participation in the European Union (EU) March 2015 119 Even in north European countries with a strong democratic tradition, children have limited opportunities for making their voice heard within national policy decision making 415 . In the UK where there is a well-developed commitment to participation in legislation, policy and many areas of practice, studies reveal that benefits from participation may be more significant for children\u2019s development than impacts on policy per se. 416 \u201cThere are good results in terms of sharing meanings and acquiring knowledge, good results also in terms of having fun and developing meaningful peer relations, but less good results regarding decision-making.\u201d 417 (Country Expert, Italy) 5.1.2 Local policy impacts Impact on policy is the most evident at a local level, and commonly takes the form of action by children and youth councils to initiate, or exert an influence over the development of local action plans. For example, in Croatia the Children\u2019s councils in Opatija have an active influence on local decision making (see good practice example in chapter 2.2.4). The higher levels of impact at a local policy level is largely understood to be because of the wider array of structures and opportunities that exist at a local level, but also because local initiatives are closer to the everyday realities of children\u2019s lives which bring children and adults together in a setting that is meaningful to them. This context for participation therefore strongly reflects the need for intergenerational dialogue in affecting change. In some cases this greater scope for achieving policy impact at a local level is also due to the greater emphasis on devolved regional administrative structures as is the case for example in Austria. The following box provides examples of children\u2019s participation influencing change at a local level. Santos (2012) \u2013 Glances of children in residential care about their rights - http://repositorium.sdum.uminho.pt/handle/1822/20087?mode=full&submit_simple=Mostrar+registo+em+formato+c ompleto 415 In July 2012 the media company Retriever (a supplier of media monitoring and tools for editorial research, media analysis and corporate information) published a report on children in media together with UNICEF Sweden, Save the Children Sweden and BRIS (another large child-rights organisation in Sweden) where they had analysed 1300 articles concerning children and in very few of them children were heard. 416 Welsh Government commissioned a study into the impact of participation in Wales on 2010. The research highlighted a number of benefits in terms of personal development such as improving presentation skills, but there was less evidence of impact. Children fed back that they did not receive a lot or quality information concerning what difference their involvement made [York Consulting on behalf of Welsh Assembly Government, 2010] 417 A study in 2003 evaluating 50 children\u2019s projects involving participation funded by Law 285 ",

The main aim was to develop processes of child participation to be included in the daily urban planning of the municipalities in the project. A future aim is to share best practices with other municipalities. An example of how the project worked involved the redesigning of a local square. Several meetings were undertaken with children aged 15-17 at a public youth club nearby, and they discussed together with the architect how the main square could be remodelled. They came up with several ideas that were included in the final planning. Wales \u2013 Young people\u2019s service audits \uf0b7 \u2018 We Want 2 Hear - Young People\u2019s Participation Audit for and by Marginalised Young People project\u2019 delivered by Swansea Local Authority. This project involved young people auditing the support they received from social care service. The young auditors were supported to take part and at the end of the project wrote and delivered a presentation of their findings and recommendations to the Children\u2019s Commissioner for Wales. 419 The case studies above highlight a direct and active form of participation with children working together with, rather than being consulted by, adults. In this way children are able to have a direct impact into change processes. However, this evaluation found that \u2018 indirect impacts\u2019 from children\u2019s participation were more common. \u2018Indirect impacts\u2019 refer to the representation of children\u2019s views in policy making rather than the direct participation of children themselves. 5.1.3 Indirect impacts on policy Although there are fewer cases where children have been actively involved in directly influencing policy, there are \u2018indirect\u2019 impacts that have been identified for example through children\u2019s views being represented by a professional or agency, through advisory or lobbying roles or changing the attitudes of adult professionals as a result of children\u2019s participation 420 . \u201cChildren\u2019s participation at least has an influence on the discussion that goes on\u2026 for example ministers and government representatives have met with children\u2019s groups and have an interest in the views of children, but whether this has led to changes in policies and laws is not known.\u201d (Country Expert, Finland) Children\u2019s participation has indirect impacts on policy in three main ways. i) Through protesting and lobbying For example in the Czech Republic in 2011 protests by students against the introduction of the state graduation exam led to a change in exam format. And in 2012/13, secondary school students in South Bohemia protested against the installation of a communist counsellor for schools in the regional government and gained high levels of public support to block the move. 418 Trafikverket, \u201cIt gets important when it\u00b4s for real\u201d (Det blir viktigt n\u00e4r det \u00e4r p\u00e5 riktigt) http://www.trafikverket.se/Foretag/Planera-och-utreda/Samhallsplanering/Tatort/Barn-och-unga-i- samhallsplaneringen/Hant-i-projektet/Det-blir-viktigt-nar-det-ar-pa-riktigt---redovisning-av-slutrapport-23-januari/ 419 http://www.childoneurope.org/issues/child_participation/5_UK_Ear%202%20The%20Ground_A1-4.pdf 420 See also Percy-Smith (2009) Evaluation of participation plans in two Children\u2019s Trusts: Lessons from year two.

In Slovakia, a national consultation of children by UNICEF informed the National Action Plan although it did not have a direct influence on policies. In Cyprus, the Youth Board enjoys mainly an advisory role, but it also has jurisdiction to implement youth-related programs following an approval by the Council of Ministers 421 . The National Youth Council of Slovenia published proposals in July 2014 to improve the situation of young people in Slovenia in the period 2014 \u2013 2018. This included concrete recommendations and solutions for: employment, education, housing, youth organizing and youth participation in Slovenia. iii) By having their views communicated through an advocate or representative The French and Flemish ombudspersons in Belgium (Kinderrechtencommissaris and D\u00e9l\u00e9gu\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9ral Droits de L\u2019enfant 422 ) have, through their work, influenced several decisions of their respective parliaments. In Malta too, for children in care, decisions at a macro level are influenced by children through the mediation of adults \u2013 and also through the workings of the Commissioner for Children. And in an open meeting of children held by the Children\u2019s Ombudsman in Greece, children raised the issue of the procedures relating to the change of school environment that some children face as a disciplinary measure. The Ombudsman took into consideration the children\u2019s views and proposed to the Ministry of Education improvements in the procedures. In Austria, the coalition of child rights NGOs, under the umbrella of the child\u2019s rights network have also been influential in promoting discussion between the civil society and policy makers at different levels (federal, provincial and municipal) about how to facilitate child participation with the consequence that there is a slowly growing understanding and acceptance of child participation among decision-makers. In this way children\u2019s organisations play an important role in bringing about change in policy but also in changing attitudes to children\u2019s participation. Despite lower levels of impact from children\u2019s participation in some countries, there is an indication the picture is changing, although mainly at a local level. \u201cIn Poland local youth councils work mainly in the sectors: culture, education, social aid, charity, sport\u2026 because of [a] growing number of activities in area of child participation the practice is slowly changing \u2013 children are considered more capable and competent.\u201d (Child Ombudsman, Poland) One of the ways the picture is changing is through awareness raising and moving towards normalising participation for example through encouraging dialogue and engagement and achieving a greater level of realisation that children should participate in decisions that affect them. \u201c[In Finland] there are several national forums, which are managed by public foundations, where children and young people can discuss political themes. These are the National Youth Parliament clubs, meetings in Parliament House, the Finnish Children\u2019s Parliament (virtual and real participation), the annual Meeting of Local Youth Councils (virtual and real participation) and the Child and Youth Forum of the Finnish National Board of Education. These forums have attracted several children and young people keen to discuss the many issues in their lives. Their main benefit has been the creation of a genuine dialogue between children, young people and adults.

Also at the national level authorities are well aware of these rights. However as the example above demonstrates this has tended to be in countries where there has been a longer tradition of democratic rights. 5.1.4 Impacts on practice Many decisions at a local level happen in the context of practice and involve changes to the environment in which practice happens. A common way in which children have an impact in practice is through them being consulted on their own care plan or with regard to school procedures, including via student council activities. Some examples are provided below. Table 5.3 Examples of impact of children\u2019s participation in practice Cyprus \uf0b7 Through a joint action involving Children\u2019s Parliament and Student Council\u2019s in Cyprus an amendment to punishment rules in schools was brought about. \uf0b7 The immediate response of the Ministry of Education to the Children\u2019s Parliament\u2019s suggestion in Cyprus resulted in improving a number of school buildings to enable access for children using wheelchairs. Lithuania \uf0b7 In Lithuania, the Pupil\u2019s Union campaigned to limit the number of final exams taken by school pupils, which were reduced as a result of the action. Latvia \uf0b7 In Riga, the Pupils\u2019 Council expressed their views on healthy life-styles and leisure time activities, which have improved leisure time possibilities in Riga and conditions at school. Slovenia \uf0b7 Children\u2019s participation in Slovenian early years settings is effective at the level of professional/child interaction with children\u2019s views taken account of in the daily process of kindergarten routine and learning processes. However, children have less influence on wider decisions about the kindergarten such as the building and organisational issues 424 . Romania \uf0b7 In Romania, there are some local projects, developed by NGOs in which young people succeeded to have an impact on the local level. In one of the community development projects of the Ruhama Foundation 425 the groups of young people have identified problems, formed Initiative Groups, attended local council meetings, then made proposals. For example, young Roma people proposed there should be an emergency medical night service in Tinca. There are now three emergency physicians. UK \uf0b7 The Hear by Rights/Practical Participation team in the UK have created a \u201cWhat\u2019s Changed Stories\u201d website which allows anyone to submit a story about change as a result of child participation activities. There are over 80 stories grouped under different categories including: community action; environment; housing; play; and things to do. Many of these stories of change are at a local level. 423 Finland National report: First cooperation cycle of the EU Youth Strategy 2010-2012 http://ec.europa.eu/youth/policy/national_reports_2012.htm 424 Rutar, S.

        "Evaluation of legislation, policy and practice on child participation in the European Union (EU) March 2015 123 A few examples were found where children\u2019s participation has been more permanently institutionalised, and children have therefore been able to influence practice on a larger scale through the planning and inspection of public services. These examples relate to participatory inspection arrangements within the field of children\u2019s social care and child protection (UK and Sweden). The following case study example is from Scotland (UK). Table 5.4 Good practice example: Children\u2019s participation in social care inspections (UK, Scotland) The Care Inspectorate for Scotland is the official body responsible for inspecting standards of care in Scotland and regulates and inspects 14,000 care services. The inspections are conducted using the framework for Joint Inspections of Services for Children and Young People, which includes 22 quality indicators mapped to the national outcomes framework for children and young people 426 . Since 2012, the Inspectorate has trained and supported young people with direct experience of care and / or social work services to participate in social care inspections in the capacity of \u2018Young Inspectors\u2019. These individuals work alongside the adult inspectors, and perform the following tasks 427 : \uf0b7 interviewing senior managers and chief executives \uf0b7 exploring corporate parenting and the involvement of children and young people in policy and service development \uf0b7 examining strategic plans from a young person\u2019s perspective; and, \uf0b7 speaking to young people and observing practice The young people bring insights from their previous experiences of the care system, and provide additional skills and competences when it comes to speaking with other young people who are currently using social care services; providing feedback and making recommendations. As the Care Inspectorate Head of Inspection commented: \u201cThe power of a young inspector asking chief executive questions about how they are carrying out their work can\u2019t be underestimated\u2026 They come at issues in a different way to professional inspectors and can relate better to young people. If they can\u2019t understand a particular issue or how a decision came about, how will children using the service?\u201d Comments from several of the Young Inspectors included that: \u201cThe most important part was speaking to children and young people who were receiving care services, to get their opinions. I was able to convey their thoughts and my own observations to the team who incorporated them in their reports. It was encouraging to see that certain areas of care were improving\u201d \u201c You see the results\u2026 that\u2019s the best bit about it\u2026 you see the changes that are being made [to services]\u201d The inspectorate has received positive feedback from young people who previously served as young inspectors, many of whom have since moved on into paid employment. 426 Getting it Right for Every Child (GIFEC) is a child-centred and rights-based framework, which is focussed on the experiences of the child\u2019s journey from pre-birth to 18 years: 427 Bruton, A., and Happer, H.

        "Evaluation of legislation, policy and practice on child participation in the European Union (EU) March 2015 124 Good practices such as the one given above provide a showcase for what can be achieved, and help to demonstrate the benefits of effective participation for improving services in addition to the immediate benefits for children as participants in the decision-making process. 5.1.5 Trends across sectors and settings Patterns across sectors and settings suggest there is more participation and therefore increased chances of impact in some sectors than others. These include education (mainly through school councils), care (through participation in care planning), youth work projects, and local planning (especially through consultations on neighbourhood developments and recreation). In some instances, children were able to inform local planning decisions, although usually on a small scale and relating to the design or layout of school buildings or playgrounds. Rarer examples can be found of children directly informing urban planning on a larger scale, including Empoli in Italy where children inputted to the design of the city plan and the layout of public open spaces 428 (For further information on sectors and settings see Chapter 3 ). In addition to general trends across all countries; there is also a variation between and within countries. In some countries such as Spain, Germany, Italy and Austria this is due to variations in approaches and commitment to participation between municipalities 429 . The response from Italy however, suggests that \u201cFragmentation of policy implementation across regions hides a richness of good practice locally\u201d 430 . Participation is strongest at local level, since it is closest to children and young people. At a more local level some responses suggest that participation and impact are dependent on individual professionals. This is especially the case in schools where the effectiveness of participation depends on the commitment of individual teachers. There seems to be little difference in these trends between sectors and settings covered by legislation and those not covered. 5.1.6 Variables influencing impact In spite of the trends discussed in this section, there is variability in the implementation and therefore impact of participation within sectors and countries. \uf0b7 Political factors - the scope to achieve an impact is largely influenced by the political will of regional and local administrations. Participation depends quite fundamentally on supportive local stakeholders. For example in Slovakia an example was given of public participation involving many children and young people (15-18 year olds) in a town which prepared parallel proposals for the municipality, but when the mayor (who was very supportive of this process) changed, all the work stopped. \uf0b7 Capacity and capability of professionals working with children - particularly on the level of involvement of the staff working with children (teachers, city officials, social workers, socio-cultural professionals, coaches, etc.). The lack of capacities, resources and low salaries of staff make children\u2019s participation very much dependent on the existence of an institutional framework within which to develop participation and a team approach of staff working in different contexts. 428 Francis, M. and Lorenzo, R. (2002) Seven Realms of Children's Participation. Journal of Environmental Psychology , 22, pp.157-169. 429 In Germany with regard to playground planning, it is possible to directly transfer Article 12 of the CRC into the \u201cGemeindeordnung\u201c which is the legal basis for local governments and dependent on regional decisions to involve children in matters that affect them. It therefore differs among regions.

Even with the existence of opportunities and structures for children\u2019s participation children may not be aware of these and are often not attracted to participate in official or formalised processes without the support and guidance of professionals, instead preferring the informality of a familiar face or setting. This lack of formalised mechanisms was raised as a particular challenge by stakeholders: \u201cChildren\u2019s participation is only effective to a small degree in influencing, in a direct way at least, change in policy and practice at national and local level since we lack mechanisms by which children can talk directly to policy makers.\u201d (NGO Representative, Greece) \u201cSince there have been very rare occasions when children have been consulted for the purpose of legislation and policy one may argue that children\u2019s participation has not been very effective\u201d.

This is echoed by children who perceive decision making as being too adult-led 431 , and in some cases it is argued that participation is manipulated for adult interests. Even where there are structures for hearing the voice of the child, children\u2019s views may be heard but are not taken into account. For example in Germany, evidence suggests that 80% of the decisions of youth parliaments are immediately rejected at federal level. Similarly, in the Netherlands only 30% of young people said they had access to decision making at a national level in connection with recreational issues. The Scottish \u2018Being Young in Scotland \u2019 bi- annual survey in 2009 indicated that 30% of young people felt that politicians generally do not listen to young people. 432 In Spain at local level there are a range of participation mechanisms, although there are very few cases of municipalities that put in practice the proposals made by children, despite the large number of municipalities signed up to the Child Friendly City Initiative. 5.2 Evidence of benefits for children The personal and social benefits to children of participation are well documented within the research literature, and have been evidenced through various empirical studies. On the one hand, children\u2019s particiaption in public life through participatory democratic activities (youth councils and consultative projects) is associated with improved levels of confidence, self- esteem, and practical or problem-solving skills 433 . These activities are also associated with children\u2019s civic and social responsibility, cultural awareness, and their development of competences for later life, sometimes including technical skills gained through experience of peer research or municipal planning 434 . Recent EU studies in the \u2018youth\u2019 field have echoed these findings 435 . On the other hand, the benefits of the individual child\u2019s right to be heard within legal and administrative proceedings are less widely covered within the literature, and have typically followed more of a \u2018compensatory\u2019 model; intervening to legislate or develop policies where children are identified as vulnerable due to their diminished legal status. 431 See for example Italy country study and evidence from child peer research in this evaluation, 432 http://www.youthlinkscotland.org/webs/245/file/Final%20BYIS%20Repor(a).pdf 433 Lansdown, G.

        "Evaluation of legislation, policy and practice on child participation in the European Union (EU) March 2015 126 The research carried out of this study concurs with the literature, but also underlines the difficulty of evidencing the benefits of children\u2019s participation within more everyday interactions with adults, and outside of the context of specific individual \u2018participatory projects\u2019. In many cases, respondents from the country mapping talked about the benefits of participation based on outcomes that were inferred or observed, rather than measured empirically: \u201c Undoubtedly child participation has benefits for children and there is much evidence on that in the international bibliography. It promotes their initiative and skills of communication and argument, enhances their sense of responsibility and their self- confidence and prepares them for citizenship. But child participation in order to be beneficial for children needs preparation and understanding of democratic processes, of rules and limits.\u201d (Country Expert, Greece) \u201cThe main benefit is to have a sense of self-agency and sense of responsibility for their life that children can learn. Children with disabilities mostly do not have those senses.\u201d (Country Official, Poland) 436 Available evidence supports these assertions by revealing that children see the benefits of participation more in terms of the process rather than outcomes of participation. For example, in the UK an empirical study involving evaluation of participation in two local authority Children\u2019s Trusts 437 reveals that young people place more value on the process of taking part and immediate personal and social benefits rather than outcomes in terms of contributions to decision making. Benefits identified by young people from participation included: \uf0b7 their own personal achievement, learning & development \uf0b7 new experiences \uf0b7 making connections with people \uf0b7 having responsibility \uf0b7 realization of their own abilities \uf0b7 having control over their lives and making informed choices \uf0b7 making things happen / making a difference \uf0b7 dialogue / mutual communication and understanding \uf0b7 being respected and feeling their contribution has been valued \uf0b7 just being involved /taking part / joining in \uf0b7 opportunities and time to do things / having fun Similarly in the Puerpolis social inclusion project (Portugal) 438 impacts and benefits were monitored in terms of changes to children\u2019s self-esteem, self-confidence and respect for other people's opinion. Within this project one example concerned how a girl in an institutional care setting asked to talk with the judge in order to share with her some important decisions about her life, as a result of developing her own competencies to be a protagonist in decision-making about matters that affected her. In other examples found though the study, there was a clear link between children\u2019s views being heard and acted upon, and subsequent outcomes for children. In Austria, for example, \u2018children\u2019s counsellors 439 \u2019 are made available to children aged 5-14 in proceedings regarding custody or parental divorce. They have a statutory role in offering information on judicial processes and rights to children and supporting them in making their wishes heard. 436 Member of the Committee of Experts on the Persons with Disabilities by the Ombudsman and the Commission for Social Dialogue on Disability 437 Percy-Smith, B.

        "Evaluation of legislation, policy and practice on child participation in the European Union (EU) March 2015 127 An evaluation of the programme highlighted that children\u2019s requests were incorporated into the judicial decisions in over half of cases. This example illustrates both the importance of monitoring and evaluation in evidencing the benefits of child participation, and also the benefits of children\u2019s views being acted upon \u2013 in this instance effective participation helped to ensure an influence over legal proceedings that would have an impact on the child\u2019s future. A study by the National Children\u2019s Bureau in the UK found that involving children in the production of pre-sentence reports through the use of the \u2018Asset\u2019 juvenile assessment process resulted in pre-sentence reports that young people felt were fair, positive and enabling. A similar link can be found between children\u2019s participation in the planning of their health treatment or service provision, and the subsequent benefits in terms of improved personal health and wellbeing. The following examples from the UK and Slovakia illustrate this point. Table 5.5 Good practice examples: benefits from children\u2019s participation in the planning of service provision Stay Well Self-Management Project, Scotland The Stay Well Self-Management Project 440 was run in Scotland by Action for Sick Children Scotland (ASCS). The project aimed to help young people with a range of long term illnesses to cope better with their conditions by taking part in a self-management programme of workshops which ASCS developed and delivered in collaboration with young people with long term conditions. Over 50 young people with long term conditions participated in the programme. Feedback from the young people, their parents/carers, health professionals and teachers was extremely positive. They described very significant increases in the young people\u2019s self-confidence, communication, social inclusion, and their understanding of how to live more healthily with a long term condition. Children experiencing domestic violence: \u017dilina, Slovakia \u017dilina, Slovakia, houses a crisis centre for children victims of domestic violence, abuse and neglect. Children are placed due to a court order or after an agreement with the parents or guardian. Children can be placed from 3-18 years old, but most of them are 8-12 years old. Throughout the process of being in the crisis centre children are in dialogue with their care takers and all the staff in the crisis centre. Both staff and other children in the centre are involved in explaining to new arrivals what the daily routine in the centre is and where they will go to school, Children can have a say on the room they live in and how they would like to decorate it. Children are consulted on decisions about where to go after the centre. If their wishes cannot be granted this is explained to them. All workers (including catering staff) receive annual training on how to communicate with children who have experienced abuse. Interviewees from the centre felt this process empowered the children, who became capable of speaking openly about their feelings. Another example concerns the benefits of participation for children and young people with disabilities in alternative care, and the results achieved by an NGO programme in Bulgaria. 440 http://www.ascscotland.org.uk/default.asp?page=56 ",

They use alternative methods of communication and planning, with this group who are often passive users of social services, which rely on social workers\u2019 views, excluding service-users from decision-making processes. The aim is to guarantee the child\u2019s right to participation set out in Article 12 of the UNCRC. Outcomes for children include: \uf0b7 Better understanding of themselves and their lives, higher degree of self-knowledge \uf0b7 Increased awareness of the present, its positive and negative aspects, what they can do and what challenges them, and what makes them happy or afraid \uf0b7 Improved communication and, at the same time, greater opportunity for self-expression \uf0b7 Going the long way to defining oneself - who am I, where do I come from, what do I want to accomplish, placing the foundations of planning with the actual person in focus \uf0b7 Increased confidence, freedom and self-esteem \uf0b7 Changed status in hierarchical links in the small community of the social services and alternative care setting Child participation has also been acknowledged as a mechanism for safeguarding children against abuse or harm. In the UK (England), an inquiry by the Children\u2019s Commissioner into child sexual exploitation in gangs and groups 442 found that children who had been victims of abuse consistently reported having raised the alarm with professionals, but said that they had not been listened to or taken seriously. In response to the findings of the inquiry, the Commissioner has led on the development of the \u2018 See Me, Hear Me \u2019 framework 443 , which aims to embed child participation within children\u2019s social care practice. As the child-led projects undertaken for the study demonstrated, the benefits of effective participation are not restricted to children, and adult participants often also gain from having a better understanding and awareness of children\u2019s competences. The example of the child-led project in Newstead in the UK illustrates this very effectively, whereby the staff members expressed surprise at the decision-making capabilities shown by young children (4 year olds), and recommended that children be given more frequent opportunities to participate in educational decisions at the early years centre, that staff training should be revised accordingly, and that children should be given an opportunity to contribute to the design of an area of the centre. Further information on this case study example can be found at Section 7.3. The study also shone a light on poor and ineffective practices, however, and found that measures intended to facilitate children\u2019s particiaption are not universally successful. Even in schools or where dedicated structures exist for children to participate, such as youth forums, children\u2019s views are not always heard, and their suggestions are not taken into account in decision making 444 These findings sound a more cautionary note and show the dangers of complacency, where child participation is insufficiently embedded at a practice level 445 . 441 www.cedarfoundation.org/Participation-Project-HRDP/book_ENG.pdf; www.cedarfoundation.org/Participation- Project-HRDP/Guidebook%20on%20Project.pdf 442 http://www.childrenscommissioner.gov.uk/info/csegg1 443 See Me, Hear Me : Framework for Action, Chapter 2, Final Report of The Office of the Children\u2019s Commissioner\u2019s Inquiry into Child Sexual Exploitation in Gangs and Groups (CSEGG) http://www.childrenscommissioner.gov.uk/content/publications/content_743 444 Research in Croatia has shown that more than one quarter of secondary school students think that in their schools their opinion is not taken into consideration (Miharija M. i Kurid\u017ea B.

Evidence of how effective child participation has been is limited to judgement by a few experts in the field (mainly civil servants). The expert opinions are quite contradicting, some consider child and youth participation very influential, others rate is as insufficient and not real.\u201d (Country Expert, Estonia) A clear message from this evaluation is the lack of official systematic monitoring and evaluation of the effectiveness of child participation/Article 12 UNCRC. Evidence from 22 of the 28 countries in the study indicates the absence of standardised mechanisms for monitoring and evaluation (AT, BE, CY, DE, DK, EE, EL, ES, FI, FR, HR, HU, IT, LI, LU, LV, MT, PL, PT, RO, SI, SK). Instead monitoring and evaluation tends to happen internally within specific projects or participation initiatives (e.g. annual monitoring of a children\u2019s parliament 446 ), independent research 447 or through the work of civic bodies such as the ombudsman, commissioner for children or NGOs. In addition there is evidence that some government departments undertake a monitoring role although this tends to be for the purpose of monitoring a wider departmental policy such as child protection 448 or youth policy. 449 These are discussed further below. 5.3.1 Tools and approaches All countries have an obligation to report to the Committee for the Convention on the Rights of the Child on the implementation of the UNCRC and some countries do use participation frameworks and standards as discussed below. Yet in spite of these provisions, this evaluation highlights a widespread perceived lack of standardised systems and procedures for monitoring and evaluating participation. As a result monitoring and evaluation tends to be dependent on the initiative of individual actors, agencies (especially NGOs) or projects and research and evaluation studies undertaken by academics. The most commonly mentioned approaches to monitoring and evaluation are as follows. \uf0b7 Surveys and questionnaires: These tend to be the most commonly reported methods for monitoring and evaluating the effectiveness of participation (see for example CY, DK, IT, LT, MT). For example in Italy, a survey on child participation was organised by PIDIDA 450 involving a sample of 22,000 children. Cyprus reported that children were consulted about the deficiencies in implementing Article 12 UNCRC. 451 of children and youth in Croatia.

The Department of Children and Youth Affairs in Ireland undertakes regular evaluations of the Comhairle na n\u00d3g (youth councils) and Dail na nOg (youth parliaments). It also published \u201cAn Audit of Children and Young People\u2019s Participation in Decision-Making\u201d in 2011 452 and the Youth Council monitors sectors covered by municipalities through its \u2018effectiveness\u2019 committee. In Luxembourg the work of the National Assembly of Young People is evaluated regularly. 453 \uf0b7 Research and evaluation studies: Academic and independently commissioned research and evaluation studies play an important role in maintaining a picture of participation in different countries. These tend to be for the purpose of adult agenda with some observers (BE) stating that findings are often not fed back to children. Whereas in some countries research studies on participation are frequent (e.g. FI, UK), other countries (e.g. CZ, Pl) reported that national studies are sporadic or rarely undertaken with the suggestion that this was the result of having a national research agenda for children and young people. Some examples include: Evaluating and researching young people\u2019s participation in public decision making (Kirby 2002) in the UK; guidelines developed by the State and NGOs, Young Voices \u2013 How to involve children and young people in your work (2005) in Ireland 454 ; and a study commissioned by the Observatoire de l\u2019Enfance, de la Jeunesse et de l\u2019Aide a la Jeunesse (OEJAJ) 455 in Belgium (2009) that developed an inventory of participation evaluation instruments. Other studies had a more general focus about the lives of children and young people (see for example the national governmental longitudinal study of children \u2018Growing up in Ireland\u2019 456 and study on the wellbeing of youth in Luxembourg) 457 . Research programmes were also noted at an EU level, for example a number of country responses highlighted the EU Youth in Action 458 programme. \uf0b7 Reports of State Parties and Shadow reports on the implementation of the UNCRC: See for example Ministry of Family in Luxembourg annual report to the UNCRC 459 . \uf0b7 Guidelines and audits: Some NGOs have developed their own evaluation processes (for example, SOS Children\u2019s Village) 460 . \uf0b7 Children\u2019s commissioners and ombudspersons: Commissioners and ombudspersons undertake an important role in evaluating and promoting the rights and well-being of children.

Although most of this type of monitoring is undertaken by appointed professionals, in some cases this has involved young people. \uf0b7 Youth led inspections: Stichting Alexander (Alexander Foundation) 462 in the Netherlands developed a method (Q4C) over 10 years ago to involve the youth themselves in the inspection of their own institution. This involves a formal assessment including recommendations provided to the board and staff of the institution. Although this method is not used in every institution, it has been widely applied. \uf0b7 Individual pedagogic interactions: some country responses reported that in good pedagogic practice the practitioner is able to monitor closely the participation of individual children and youth through everyday interactions (e.g. Estonia 463 ).

The main task of the Observatory is to systematically study and monitor the situation and welfare of children in all areas of their lives.

Sweden \uf0b7 The Ombudsman for children and the Swedish National Board for Youth Affairs have responsibilities for monitoring policy. One of the most common instruments for evaluation of participation at a local level is the so called LUPP Survey (Local Follow-Up of Youth Policy) provided by the Swedish National Board for Youth Affairs, that enables municipalities to monitor young people\u00b4s perception of their lives.

Based on available evidence the UK is a notable exception and appears to lead the way in monitoring and assessment frameworks for quality and effectiveness, for example with the national Kitemark scheme in Wales 474 , The Ask First 475 standards in Northern Ireland and Hear by Right standards in England 476 .

A key part of the Kitemark scheme is the Young Inspectors. The Young Inspectors conduct an assessment visit to an organisation or service against the participation standards and decide whether to award the Kitemark 477 . Examples of standards used in other countries include: \uf0b7 Standards for Interviewing Child Participants in Legal Procedures, Social Activities and Practices Institute (SAPI) 478 , Bulgaria. \uf0b7 The Quality4Children standards 479 for children in care in Greece although not widely used. \uf0b7 In Sweden the Ombudsman for Children and Statistics Sweden (administrative public agency), developed a set of indicators (Max18) that is now widely used at a national and regional level to monitor and evaluate the government\u2019s child policy. \uf0b7 In Austria the Working Group on Participation/ARGE Partizipation 480 also established general standards for participation and published a folder called \u201cEvaluation in participation of children and youth / Evaluierung in der Kinder- und Jugendbeteiligung \u201d 481 . A number of countries identified principles and guidelines issued by international and European agencies and organisations such as the Norwegian Refugee Council, the World Health Organisation (WHO), the European Asylum Support Office (EASO), the Fundamental Rights Agency (FRA), UNICEF 482 and the Hague Convention on the protection of children and co- operation in respect of intercountry adoption as useful measures of quality and effectiveness. The evidence in the wider evaluation also suggests that Council of Europe recommendations have been useful for some countries though these were not always referred to in the context of monitoring and evaluation. 5.3.3 Quality criteria and measures of effective/meaningful participation The majority of countries report that there are no commonly accepted official \u2018quality\u2019 and \u2018effectiveness\u2019 measures for participation. Many countries however provided a range of perspectives on what measures and criteria they felt were most useful for assessing meaningful and effective participation. \uf0b7 Impactful: This relates to where children have influenced decisions and outcomes. Impact is interpreted as \u201cPractical implementation of children\u2019s suggestions, when the adults listen to children, respect their views and include them in decision making\u201d (Croatia). Impact is also viewed in terms of the design of programs that bring answers to the specific needs of the children. The effectiveness of participation in achieving impact depends on \u201cthe extent to which adults transfer children\u2019s opinion into policies or programs\u201d (Spain). Impact is also interpreted in terms of \u201cshifting or challenging perceptions and misconceptions\u201d (Lithuania). 477 see: http://www.participationworkerswales.org.uk/standards/kitemark-inspection.aspx.

        "Evaluation of legislation, policy and practice on child participation in the European Union (EU) March 2015 135 \uf0b7 Quality of relationships: Impact and outcome are often seen as the most important criteria for effective participation, yet the evidence suggests that it is often the process of participation that is most important for children (see above). Trust was mentioned as the most important aspect for effective participation and where children feel there is an equal partnership. In particular the quality of the relationship with the adult, where children felt there was genuine cooperation and inclusion (\u201cwhen adults are working together with children and not for children\u201d Croatia); and whether they felt they are being really listened to and have their contribution valued and taken seriously . \u201cThe quality of participation is seen when the trust between staff and child is developed and when the child starts to open up and share their experience, their wishes and opinions.\u201d (Practitioner, Lithuania). \u201cThe moments for participation must allow for sufficient amount of time, and the possibility to build up a relation of confidence and responsibility. The training of all social workers on participation is therefore essential.\u201d (Country Expert, Spain) \uf0b7 Self-determination and autonomy: Although participation is often understood in terms of contribution to decision making, some respondents identified the extent to which \u201cchildren have influence over their own life and their own case\u201d (Professional, Denmark). This was felt to be especially important in relation to neglected or abused children. Another response from a stakeholder in Greece identified an important criterion in the ability of children to develop participatory skills. The emphasis on interpreting participation as children developing their agency was further reflected in a quote from a director of a care service in Portugal: \u201cWe established a dynamic that everyone knows that he/she is an active agent. Efficacy is assessed by the ability of each to integrate this process, the capabilities they reveal in what concerns their active involvement. All are encouraged\u2026 acquired skills and the revealed autonomy are, for us, the most important signs. There is always an adult that is responsible for monitoring this process.\u201d \uf0b7 Children being informed: For participation to be effective children must be fully informed. This is important to ensure children are prepared appropriately for participation; that they are happy about why they are participating; and receive feedback from the outcome of their participation: \u201cChildren need empowering through total information; the children will effectively be capable of participation and also take their responsibilities \u201d (Professional, Spain). Children should be able to understand and accept why decisions were made or not (Academic, Denmark). Participation of children in the adult decision-making group is considered effective since it helps children to understand both the rationale of decisions and the processes that need to take place and thus more easily comply with the decisions, for example in placing children in care. \uf0b7 Involvement in all stages: In the youth field in Belgium, a universal criterion for assessing the value of a youth work project, organisation or environment is the presence of participation of young people in management decisions at all stages of the decision making cycle. \uf0b7 Embedded in organisational practice: Direct participation can only be realised effectively if it is embedded in existing structures that support children. In the context of children in poverty in Belgium, evidence highlights that more vulnerable children encounter difficulties with the \u201cestablishment\u201d and consequently may not \u201cparticipate\u201d when asked to do so if child friendly practices are not in place. First, a relation of ",
        "Evaluation of legislation, policy and practice on child participation in the European Union (EU) March 2015 136 confidence must be built (e.g. with a teacher, with a youth worker); second, the participation must be mutual \u2013 what will I receive out of it when I participate; and third, the realisation of the direct participation should be structurally anchored in organizational systems and processes. 5.3.4 Challenges with monitoring and evaluation A key challenge for monitoring and evaluation mentioned across many countries is the lack of adequate data. This in turn is a product of not having an implementation framework against which good practice criteria, positive attitudes and a lack of understanding about what participation involves can be monitored. \u201cNeither social attitudes, nor the regulatory framework & strategic documents have created enough conditions for \u201cquality\u201d and \u201ceffective\u201d child participation.\u201d (Country Expert, Austria). In the Netherlands a dilemma in evaluation was raised in terms of recognising differential experiences for different groups of children, for example non-western migrant youth in contrast to the \u2018elite middle class youth\u2019 who tend to participate more than other groups 483 . In this respect, legislation is seen as being important for monitoring and evaluation, because if there is no legal framework and therefore no legal obligation for participation of non-western migrant youth, there is no official evaluation that may provide data on its effectiveness. A further dilemma is that quality criteria can vary according to the children in question. In Slovenia for example legislation recognises that, for children with disabilities, achieving goals, emotional impact and response, degree of cooperation and involvement with the wider group and children's inclusion in learning and social activities are seen as important criteria for effective participation in the everyday context of the school or kindergarten, rather than just having a say in decision making 484 . This was also echoed in the context of Bulgaria. \u201cWe learn whether the children with intellectual difficulties are satisfied from the fact that they made an individual decision via direct contact with them, via emotions expressed by them in mime, gesture or sound.\u201d (NGO Worker, Bulgaria). In Spain, it was noted that the effectiveness of the different forms of participation also varies according to the child\u2019s age. Structured forms of participation are more likely to be effective for older children whilst, for younger children, participation in informal leisure and educational activities that focus on developing participatory attitudes and skills may be more effective. Some countries reported that participation was insufficiently well developed to be able to evaluate it. For example, as is the case with the Aveiro Chid Friendly City initiative in Portugal. \u201cIn the city hall of Aveiro we haven\u2019t yet enough experiences of children\u2019s participation in order to assess efficiency and quality\u2026\u201d (Child Friendly City Officer) A further dilemma is the result of diverse interpretations about what participation involves. One perspective from Greece suggested that monitoring and evaluation is difficult because \u201c quality and effectiveness in participation in most cases is not related to particular standards but is subjectively interpreted according to the fulfilment of objectives that each professional or institution sets \u201d 485 . 483 Winden, de, P., Beets, G., Brakel, van den, M., Knoops, K., Mooren, van der, F. & Miltenburg, van, T.

        "Evaluation of legislation, policy and practice on child participation in the European Union (EU) March 2015 137 5.4 Conclusion This section has provided some insights into the extent to which children\u2019s participation brings about changes to policy and practice, and the benefits to children. The evidence suggests that where there is the commitment and will of individual professionals, children can play an important role in bringing about changes in practice in everyday settings, and where effectively supported children can competently inform national decision-making and contribute towards policy debates. Impacts from participation are more likely in sectors and settings such as local planning, education and recreation. At a national level they are most commonly found within policy and strategy development relating to services for children and young people, but less often within policy areas of wider national significance such as crime or justice. Overall, the evidence highlights that children's participation is more likely to have an indirect influence through advocates representing children\u2019s position or through consultation rather than direct involvement in decision making, which is still seen as being the preserve of adults. This is in spite of the existence in many cases of legislation that requires professionals to take account of children's perspectives. Moreover, there is a consistent message that children don\u2019t feel listened to and that decision making is still too often dominated by adults. This chapter has also highlighted some of the complexity in assessing the impact and outcomes from participation as a result of different understanding about what participation involves, varying interpretations about what counts as \u2019impact\u2019, and whether children participate directly or whether their views have an indirect influence on decision making. It is apparent that monitoring and evaluation tends to happen within projects and organisations, whereas in contrast there is a general lack of systematic monitoring and evaluation of participation at a national level by official institutions. This is in spite of the availability of monitoring and assessment frameworks and quality standards. There is clearly a high priority to improve the frequency and quality of monitoring systems at the level of Member States in order to more accurately capture the outcomes and impacts of child participation.

        "Evaluation of legislation, policy and practice on child participation in the European Union (EU) March 2015 138 6.0 Barriers to effective participation, enabling factors, and priorities for further action Key messages Barriers to effective participation \uf0b7 Major problems exist with the implementation of legislation and the realisation of child participation in practice. The study showed that there is a limited understanding and skillset amongst professionals in many different sectors and settings across the EU about how to enable effective participation. Many services and organisations do not have systems or procedures in place to enable the participation of children as a matter of course. \uf0b7 A lack of public awareness about rights to and benefits of children\u2019s participation and restrictive cultural attitudes in relation to children\u2019s place in society represent barriers in many parts of the EU. Participation is often afforded low political priority by official institutions within Member States. This in turn has contributed towards a lack of resources and capacity, and an over-reliance on NGOs to ensure that obligations for Article 12 are met in full. Enablers for child participation \uf0b7 Despite often deep-rooted practical and cultural challenges to realising children\u2019s participation, it is possible to draw out a number of \u2018enabling\u2019 factors that have created the conditions for effective participation to take place. These include: 1. Integrated policymaking between national Ministries whose portfolios impact on children 2. Championing of child rights the level of municipal governance and leadership 3. Financial support for NGOs in monitoring and promoting child rights, including Article 12 4. Campaigns and awareness-raising to improve public attitudes towards children 5. Providing mechanisms for structured dialogue and debate with children in the context of key national regional or local policy or funding decisions affecting children 6. Measures by Governments to support the participa t ion of vulnerable or under- represented groups 7. Training in participation for teachers, social care and health professionals 8. Making effective use of monitoring and evaluation tools and resources, such as child rights impact assessments 9. Recognising and rewarding good practices; and, 10. Educating children about their rights, and equipping children with the skills to design and implement their own research on issues affecting their lives Priorities for further action \uf0b7 There was a general consensus that the priority for most EU Member States is to improve implementation of existing legislation relating to Article 12, rather than to introduce new laws. This might be achieved through: more effective remedies when rights are abused, the utilisation of standards and monitoring frameworks, training for professionals who work with children, and public awareness-raising about the benefits and relevance of child participation. \uf0b7 Notwithstanding these issues, there was a perceived need for some further legislation to strengthen the participation rights of specific disadvantaged or vulnerable groups of children, such as Roma, children with disabilities, asylum seeking and refugee children, and young children. Legislative gaps were often found to be specific to individual Member States; relating to exemptions or restrictions to the ratification of Article 12, and / or age restrictions. ",
        "Evaluation of legislation, policy and practice on child participation in the European Union (EU) March 2015 139 6.1 Barriers to effective participation 6.1.1 Lack of awareness, knowledge and skills One of the most frequently mentioned barriers relevant to all countries was the lack of knowledge, skills and understanding about participation amongst children and young people as well as adult professionals. For example research shows that children living in Warsaw residential care institutions are not aware of their rights and have no clear ideas about the concept of child participation. In a further example, from the Netherlands, the concept of child participation was so abstract, that they could not associate it with everyday life situations. 486 \u201cThere are no rules as to how to do this. This means that the approach varies drastically and can include anything from asking youth NGOs for advice all the way to organising youth led projects. The challenge has therefore been, and will continue to be, to share knowledge and information on how to apply child participation and sharing good practices where possible.\u201d (Country Expert, Netherlands) It seems quite clear that without public education and awareness raising and training for professionals, the realisation of participation in practice will be restricted regardless of legislation. Even in countries where a culture of children\u2019s participation is well established such as Finland or the Netherlands, key adults such as teachers and social workers are identified as lacking the necessary knowledge and skills. This is largely in relation to professionals, but also with respect to parents and the public at large. In some cases this is reflected in a basic lack of knowledge and awareness of children\u2019s rights and participation, but in most cases concerned professionals not having the training and skills in making participation a reality. \u201cPrejudices of adults about children\u2019s participation form a barrier; sometimes children\u2019s interests and adults' interests are not the same and conflict with each other ...sometimes problems arise because the adults are not aware of the importance of participation.\u201d (Children\u2019s Centre Director, Portugal) Evidence from this evaluation suggests that participation is often understood in simple terms as \u2018voice\u2019 (Cyprus); or more generally about engaging children (Netherlands), especially those who tend not to participate such as quieter children (Finland), children in care (Lithuania); or as \u2018child friendly\u2019 ways of working with children. This finding applies primarily to frontline practitioners working directly with children but also to managers and political leads (Denmark). The latter also at best often view children\u2019s participation as being restricted to \u2018children\u2019s issues\u2019 such as parks and recreation or youth projects rather than providing for opportunities for children to contribute to wider local governance concerning all issues (Luxembourg). As a result, the effectiveness of participation appears to depend not just on legislation but also crucially on individual professional attitudes and knowledge (DE, FI, and LT), varying across sectors and settings (Luxembourg) and evident especially in schools (LU, and LT). This has particular implications for providing opportunities for children to be educated in their rights and gradually develop the skills of participation. Indeed a number of countries report that children often don\u2019t even know they have a right to be heard (DE, ES, and HR). For example, research in Croatia shows that 50% of children, in a sample of 503 children, aged eight to nine, have never even heard of the rights of the child. 487 486 Studenckie Ko \u0142 o Naukowe Bada \u0144 Marketingowych \u201eChi Kwadrat\u201d (2012).

        "Evaluation of legislation, policy and practice on child participation in the European Union (EU) March 2015 140 Many adults, even professionals, when asked about child\u2019s rights, are still focused on responsibilities and duties. This is consistent with evidence from some of the child peer research projects in this evaluation, for example in the UK, where despite sophisticated knowledge and theory amongst academics and professionals, many children are not aware of their rights. Taken together, recognition across all countries of the lack of awareness, knowledge and understanding about participation rights and benefits has led to the need for training for professionals to be identified as one of the most significant findings of this evaluation. 6.1.2 Cultural attitudes and barriers Children\u2019s participation is based on notions of the \u2018competent\u2019 child with agency. Yet, evidence suggests that there are still widespread views in most European countries that adults \u2018know what\u2019s best\u2019 for children. \u201cA mentality still persists according to which the adult is the expert in all matters of the child\u2019s life. Participation is not a routine yet; more special programmes would be needed to challenge mentalities.\u201d (Romania, Government Minister) In part this is a result of a lack of education and understanding about participation and rights, but also (partly due to the lack of professional education and training) the result of countries being slow in adopting new social attitudes to children in line with contemporary theories of childhood 488 which see children as possessing agency and competence rather than as human being in early stages of development lacking ability. This is especially the case with regard to vulnerable and minority children such as Roma who experience structural and social discrimination and prejudice (EL, RO) and children with disabilities who face particular barriers. In some cases the reported evidence suggests that when children are heard/express their views they are not taken seriously, or worse, adults view children as simply not capable or trusted to make decisions (BE, CY, ES, FR, and FI). Consequently the position of legislation, policy and practice is still focused predominantly on child protection with limited understanding of the role of participation in realising those rights for children. In some countries (CY, EL, ES, and FR) however, cultural barriers to participation are the result of wider social cultural influences, in particular the continued prevalence of a paternalistic culture which sees children as objects of parental rights rather than rights holders in their own right. \u201cThe general attitude is still the one in which the child\u2019s opinion is seen as an obstacle in \u2018adult\u2019 decision-making. There are some evident cultural barriers, especially within the family and more predominantly in families with foreign origins. As parents generally lack the information on the rights of their children, the predominant attitude within the French society is that of not duly taking the child\u2019s opinion into consideration. This is also due to the fact that, as in most southern European and Latin societies, French society is still very much based on the authority of adults in general.\u201d (Country Expert, France) Giving children a voice is therefore seen as a threat in terms of parents fearing they will lose their power (BE, NL, CY), but also to cultural traditions of parents providing for their children. Such a mindset reinforces the predominance of adult authority (FR) and barriers to children\u2019s participation. In some cases children are mentioned as being an obstacle to adult decision making. 488 James, A. & Prout, A. eds. (1990) Constructing and reconstructing childhood, Routledge Falmer ",
        "Evaluation of legislation, policy and practice on child participation in the European Union (EU) March 2015 141 \u201cAdults appear to be afraid that respect and effective implementation of the children\u2019s right to express their views would undermine their authority over them. Another difficulty arising from the general perceptions of the Cypriot society is the prevailing view that, by giving children spaces to express their opinions and views adults provide the basis for children to question any limits rather than allowing children to be well informed and participate effectively in matters affecting them. There is, therefore, a need for adults to be trained to respect the right of the child to be heard and participate.\u201d (NGO representative, Cyprus) Analysis of the situation with respect to vulnerable children highlights a prejudice which affects professional attitudes and practices with respect to these children. \u201cThe most important challenge is to ensure professionals working with vulnerable groups such as asylum seeking children are well trained on children\u2019s rights and the participation rights of children. It is important to shift a way of thinking from child protection to children\u2019s rights/children\u2019s participation.\u201d (NGO representative, Finland) More broadly in many societies the lack of a culture of participation in society at large and a lack of civic education for children, especially with respect to children\u2019s rights (EL, ES, FR); the lack of a human rights policy (LT); and the lack of a social norm of \u2018speaking out\u2019 means that children\u2019s participation lacks a strong foundation to provide a context for children to gradually develop the skills of participation (CY, FR). This is particularly the case in some countries in Eastern Europe . The impact of cultural influences is also gendered in some cases. For example with Roma groups for whom the role and expectations of girls is a major restriction to their active participation and expressions of free agency. 6.1.3 Structural/contextual issues: availability of opportunities and mechanisms In spite of Article 4 of the UNCRC that calls for State Parties to put in place mechanisms for implementing children\u2019s rights, there is a significant lack of appropriate arrangements to enable the effective participation of children . The Hear by Rights standards in the UK 489 set out a useful framework for developing the necessary arrangements for effective participation in terms of strategies, systems, structures, staff, skills and knowledge, style of leadership and shared values. There are four issues arising from the evaluation concerning provision of the necessary context for participation. First, there is a lack of a variety of opportunities for children to participate . Whilst in most countries some kinds of structures do exist for participation such as children\u2019s councils or parliaments, the remaining organisational standards are often lacking. This means that participation lacks a wider culture of participation in which to develop. This is important for participation to be effective and have impact. \u201cPublic participation of children face many obstacles, mainly related to the lack of political will of the authorities, scarcity of comprehensive solutions and institutional mechanisms to facilitate the practice of children's participation and knowledge of existing forms and tools to promote the implementation and monitoring of the activities. The idea of public participation of children is still not adequately reflected in the strategic documents defining the tasks of the state in the context of the development of civil society .\u201d 490 489 Badham, B. and Wade, H.

Participation of children can bring new ideas and input and people need to be informed about this. However, it is difficult to change the attitude of formal actors in Finland. Now it is something one \u2018must\u2019 do, but this does not mean it is part of their daily attitude\u201d . (NGO representative, Finland) Second, many countries (for example BE, CY, DE, FR), highlight how the culture and structure of organisations and services are not conducive to children participating effectively with respect to existing governance arrangements. Many see this as a result of a lack of appropriate organisational and systemic mechanisms and operating frameworks to facilitate participation effectively (HR, DK, LU, EL). In spite of pupil councils being a common feature in many schools, a number of countries highlight education specifically as a sector where the culture, structures and systems in place are not conducive to children\u2019s active involvement in decision making, nor in providing opportunities for learning and development about participation (DE, ES, and EL). \u201cIt is not enough to have the legislation in place we also need to incorporate an understanding concerning children, their right to participate and the fact that when making decisions that are often radical in the child\u2019s life, the child\u2019s perspective is very important. Bottom up approach hasn\u2019t worked, we now need structural measures.\u201d (Academic, Denmark) To a large extent this is a result of professionals lacking an understanding of what participation involves in practice and therefore lacking the knowledge of how to create a participatory system. \u201cThere is a lack of legislation, where frameworks are in place it is interpreted variably as professionals are not clear what participation means. Children may have a voice/be consulted but their voices may not be heard in decision making. Professionals lack skills and training in what Article 12 CRC means and what it involves.\u201d (Academic, Denmark) A further important contextual factor concerns the lack of resources and time to involve children (Belgium and Greece) as a result of practitioners being overburdened with excessive caseloads (Denmark) and teachers with insufficient time (Finland). A number of responses indicated that professionals see it is generally quicker to take decisions among adults, without involving children. One respondent (Greece) identified job insecurity as a barrier for professionals developing participation. \u201c The caseworkers\u2019 work pressure has also been mentioned as a barrier for child participation. The caseworkers have many demands to meet and child participation can sometimes be experienced as time-consuming.\u201d (Academic, Greece) Third, evidence suggests that at the level of inter-personal communication between professionals and children, child friendly practices are not in place or being readily used in many sectors. This not only undermines possibilities for participation, but also has negative impacts on children\u2019s well-being. This is particularly evident with the most vulnerable groups such as refugees and asylum seekers, children in out of home care, children in judicial proceedings and children with disabilities. In Bulgaria a local NGO (SAPI 491 ) is involved in developing training for judges working in family courts on child friendly practices in the context of children speaking out in judicial proceedings. 491 Social Activities and Practice Institute ",
        "Evaluation of legislation, policy and practice on child participation in the European Union (EU) March 2015 143 Fourth, in many countries, in spite of legislation, support for realising effective participation in practice is of low political priority (EL, IT, LT, LU. SL) reflecting lack of political will (Spain). Accordingly a number of countries mention a lack of adequate resources being allocated to promoting and supporting participation as a barrier. A common situation in many countries is for legislation to be drawn up at national level, but then implementation being left to professionals on the ground, but without resources and political commitment to ensure it is effectively implemented and policy goals relating to participation realised. This is especially the case in countries with decentralised governance structures (AT, BE, DE and IT) which gives rise to fragmentation in implementation . In such instances devolution of powers leads to occasions where there is disparity between regions in terms of either funding allocations or the depth of relevant legislation. In Austria most of the L\u00e4nder continue to have divergent standards on certain age limits and definitions for terms such as children and adolescents. Similarly in Germany legislation is often divergent between regions. Research in Northern Ireland (2011) investigated the barriers to effective government delivery for children highlighting that despite children being consulted more the outcomes are often not reflected in the implementation of strategies policies and plans 492 . Suggestions are that this is due to the prevailing paternalistic culture across most countries and the view that children are not capable and adults know best. \u201cInterviews in Estonia revealed a general understanding that children are not considered as fully capable of assessing and deciding things which touch them, or are relevant for them. Even if children should have the right to express their opinion, then adults often do not take their opinions into account. ... As a result of such attitudes, the actual involvement pattern of children is seen as rather modest. However, children\u2019s position in Estonian society is going through a change toward more engagement from an early age\u201d. (Country expert, Estonia) One suggestion from the evaluation is that this is due to a lack of knowledge, skills and awareness about participation and a lack of will to accept children\u2019s views (seen as wishes). However, there were also suggestions that this was simply due to the lack of policy on children\u2019s participation to support the effective implementation of legislation and that politicians manipulate participation for the purpose of their own agenda without a genuine commitment to children\u2019s participation. At the level of organisations themselves, impact from children\u2019s participation depends on the management and the professionals involved in identifying international standards and seeing how far they can be implemented in their own institutions. There are examples of institutions that have incorporated child participation practices into their operation to a lesser or larger extent. For example SOS Children\u2019s Village in Greece have been involved in piloting the Quality4Children standards 493 and for this reason they were involved in personnel/children training and supervision procedures. 492 Dr Bronagh Byrne and Professor Laura Lundy Queen\u2019s University, Belfast commissioned by the NICCY, 2011, \u2018Barriers to Effective Government Delivery for Children in Northern Ireland.\u2019 493 The standards were developed by SOS Children's Villages, IFCO and FICE to improve the quality of care for children and young people. The standards were developed using a participatory \u2018story-telling\u2019 approach, with over 500 children and young people from across Europe contributing their views and experiences to inform the development: http://www.quality4children.info/navigation/show.php3?id=2&_language=en ",
        "Evaluation of legislation, policy and practice on child participation in the European Union (EU) March 2015 144 6.2 Enablers for child participation A number of common enabling factors were found throughout the study. These include: \uf0b7 A proactive role for NGOs in advocating for child rights \u2013 although official bodies have a central role to play in ensuring that Article 12 is implemented, NGOs have been prolific in championing child rights, by developing approaches that are grounded in an understanding of what works with different groups of children. In Bulgaria, for example, SAPI have led on training of practitioners in justice and settings through their \u2018Listen to the Child\u2019 national programme. Conversely, some Member States have been hindered by the lack of an established NGO infrastructure, as is the case in Lithuania. \uf0b7 Campaigns and awareness-raising, to improve public attitudes towards children \u2013 culture change has been a key part of implementing Article 12; particularly the need to challenge negative or overly paternalistic attitudes towards children\u2019s roles within society. Approaches have ranged from public awareness campaigns to the use of intergenerational dialogue between children and adults. \uf0b7 Providing mechanisms for structured dialogue and debate with peers \u2013 providing regular opportunities for children to express and discuss their views with their peer group is an important part of the participatory process and can further help to build competence for effective civic and social participation. Examples range from pan-EU citizenship programmes, to the use of internet and social media, such as the peer-led SpunOut.ie website for children and young people in Ireland. \uf0b7 Providing opportunities and support for intergenerational learning to take place \u2013 a trusting and open dialogue between children and adults is essential for effective participation. Whilst this is true of all aspects of children\u2019s lives, conferences and children\u2019s parliaments can be particularly impactful as they make these interactions visible, and facilitate collective learning (between groups of adults and children). \uf0b7 Measures to support the participation of vulnerable or under-represented groups \u2013 children are not homogenous as a group, and a targeted approach is required to engage children who are marginalised from more traditional youth structures (such as forums and councils). Developing tailored forms of participation for specific vulnerable groups, such as children with disabilities, migrant children and care leavers can help to achieve participation on \u2018their terms\u2019. The national network of Children in Care Councils (CICs) in the UK (England) provides one such example or Children\u2019s Champions Boards such as in Renfrewshire Scotland. \uf0b7 Providing child friendly spaces and environments \u2013 the study found numerous examples of children taking an active role in the co-design of school buildings, and the planning and design of parks and playgrounds to make them more accessible and child friendly. Also within the justice and care sectors, child participation has sometimes been assisted by providing child friendly interview rooms, or making special adaptations to courts and detention centres. \uf0b7 Training for teachers, social care and health professionals \u2013 a shared understanding of what child participation means and how to ensure that children are heard is aspired towards within many countries. Embedding child rights in teacher training; developing rights-based Higher Education courses, and providing specialist training for psychologists, social workers and judges all have a role to play in embedding the child\u2019s right to be heard within all spheres of public life. The Teacher Training Houses in Romania provide an example of in-service training. \uf0b7 Making effective use of monitoring and evaluation \u2013 the use of monitoring can help to demonstrate the value and benefits of child participation. This can range from the evaluation of specific projects, to the inspection of services for children. The Care Inspectorate in the UK (Scotland) undertakes inspections of children\u2019s social care settings using a rights-based framework, whilst Child Impact Assessments are widely used as part of the Child Friendly Cities Initiative (CFCI). ",
        "Evaluation of legislation, policy and practice on child participation in the European Union (EU) March 2015 145 \uf0b7 Recognising and rewarding good practices \u2013 encouragement is sometimes needed to convince official institutions or other organisations to value child participation. In the UK (Wales), the Participation Standards and Kitemark scheme provide(d) official recognition for organisations promoting children\u2019s participation 494 , whilst Child Friendly City status affords similar recognition and kudos to municipalities, for their work in relation to children\u2019s rights. \uf0b7 Educating children about their rights, and empowering children as researchers \u2013 children\u2019s understandings of child participation are not always well developed, and awareness-raising is important to inform children of their rights and to make participation relevant and meaningful to them. The literature suggests that empowering children from a young age \u2013 including within early childhood education and care settings, is important to help them understand and develop skills for participation 495 . The \u2018Mosaic\u2019 approach 496 offers a well-established model for conducting research with children under five years of age. Other projects, including the work led by the Child-to-Child Trust within this study, have developed children\u2019s skills as action researchers. We further build upon these enabling factors in Chapter 10 of this report, where a set of practical guidelines for children\u2019s participation (refer to Table 10.2 for further details on these guidelines). 6.3 Priorities for further action The chapter has considered the challenges that exist for realising the effective participation of children in practice, and some of the enabling factors that have helped to remove barriers (whether legislative, practical or cultural). The next section considers the additional (future) measures that stakeholders felt were necessary to affect social and cultural change; including the potential role of further legislation. 6.3.1 Making legislation more effective A common response across countries is that legislation is not the most important driver of change, instead changes are needed in practice involving cultural change, awareness raising and training, support for implementation and monitoring: \u201cTeachers, social workers, people who work with children have consultation and dialogue with children, but they don\u2019t recognise that as participation and they don\u2019t need any legislation for that. They enable children\u2019s participation without legislation. Participation is very much connected with the culture, tradition, image of the child. Legislation is not the most important condition for the child participation. But legislation gives support to the teachers (and others who work with children and youth) to recognize opportunities for child participation.\u201d (Country Expert, Slovenia) 494 http://www.participationworkerswales.org.uk/consortium-unit.aspx 495 Pugh, G., and Selleck, D.

        "Evaluation of legislation, policy and practice on child participation in the European Union (EU) March 2015 146 The general focus for changes to legislation is on making amendments to ensure the effectiveness of existing legislation rather than additional legislation, for example by including specific articles regarding the child participatory rights in existing laws (see for example Croatia) 497 . Similarly in Spain the view is to correct inconsistencies and limitations in the Spanish legislation where child rights are limited to children of a certain age and do not refer to specific groups of children or sectors where this is needed. Evidence from Austria highlights substantial changes that are needed to address weaknesses in existing legislation, although respondents argue this would require political will to change legal regulations, for example, the Austrian immigration law, Aliens Police Law, and the rights of non-Austrian citizens. In most cases legislation to promote children\u2019s participation is located within wider legislation concerned with children and families or in a particular sector, for example as a means of safeguarding and promoting the rights of children in out of home care. For example in Bulgaria a need for change in Family Law was identified that focuses on the parents\u2019 obligation to inform and consult the child and secure his or her access to suitable information and consultation in order to help him/her form his/her own views and opinions and to guarantee every child\u2019s right to participation. In Italy, where the last report on the implementation of the National Plan for Childhood emphasises the urgency to translate participation as a general principle into specific and concrete national, regional and local policies and acts 498 , this has not materialised. For example in the justice system, a systematic comprehensive legislation regulating the right of the child to be heard in civil, administrative and criminal proceeding is still missing despite the existence of specific provisions. 499 i) Overarching legislation on children\u2019s participation Some countries (SL, HR, and MT) identify that there is a need for general overarching legislation specifically focused on children\u2019s participation which covers all sectors and which provides a definition of participation and defines relations between care, provision and participation. For example Malta identifies the enactment of a Children\u2019s Rights Act which would have specific provisions to improve children's participation such as: standards backed by law; identification of vulnerable children; 500 increased role for NGOs with vulnerable children such as runaways; provisions for support and training and the setting up of a National Commission on child policy and strategy). In the UK, one practitioner argues for the whole of UNCRC to be embedded into UK Law as one Act rather throughout piecemeal contribution to legislation in different sectors. Other suggested legislation includes ensuring there are structures for children\u2019s participation set out in legislation such as the mandatory setting up of youth councils in Northern Ireland as a result of NICCY (Northern Ireland Commissioner for Children and Young People) recommendations. In Germany reducing the voting age is seen as an important contribution to developing a culture of participation in society. 497 Specific articles regarding the child participatory rights should be listed in following Croatian laws: Law on Health Protection; Asylum law; Sport Law; Media Law 498 Synthesis report on the outcomes of the monitoring of the III National two-years Plan of action and interventions for the protection of rights and the development of individuals of developmental age adopted with DPR 21 January 2011 499 Comitato sui diritti dell'infanzia, Cinquantottesima sessione 19 settembre - 7 ottobre 2011.

        "Evaluation of legislation, policy and practice on child participation in the European Union (EU) March 2015 147 While legislation will not of itself create changes in culture and practice, it does provide the imperative for change and support the advocacy to build in resources, training, structures, M&E etc. It also allows for greater accountability to and for children\u2019s participation rights. ii) Guidance and support measures A third set of legislation and / or policy development that is needed focused on guidance and measures to support implementation, for example through education and awareness raising amongst professionals, but also as a lever to strengthen the statutory foundation for regulation and monitoring of participation. There is an overriding emphasis in the focus for new legislation on vulnerable children who lack any basis for participation. These include children with disability (Belgium), children in alternative care (BG, EL, LV), Roma (EL, SK) and children left behind (Latvia). iii) Legislation targeted at specific groups and settings In some cases recommendations for legislation and policy change to promote participation involve addressing the wider context of children\u2019s lives, in particular those growing up in poverty, as this was seen to limit possibilities for participation (Estonia). For example the evidence from Greece highlights how current national policy focuses on enrolment in primary schools, however, for Roma children, a stronger focus on improving secondary school attendance as well, would be beneficial for the development of Roma children so that they have greater possibilities in developing leadership, as well as contributing to local or national policy decisions (Greece). Other sectors and groups where the need for legislation was identified includes: children in court settings, schools, children in care, children with a disability and asylum seekers and refugees. (See chapter 3 for further details). 6.4 Additional measures Whilst some legislative changes are needed across different countries and sectors, the main focus of responses concerned support for implementation, with a focus on local and community levels. 6.4.1 Support with implementation \u201cAt the present stage of development of the country, there is no pressing need to adopt additional legislative acts. Instead there is a need to implement already existing legislation and policies.\u201d (Country Expert, Estonia) \u201cThere is no big need for additional legislation change, more needed is change in practice and in interpreting and using existing legislation\u201d (Country Expert, Poland) For some countries (CY, LV, SE) focusing on implementation at a local level needs to involve the appointment of a local champion to ensure national actions for children\u2019s participation are included in local government action plans, and support (in terms of methods and approaches) for the realisation of those plans. In Slovakia, IUVENTA 501 (Slovak Youth Institute) and the Association of Towns and Villages lobby to link local strategies to the new National Action Plan on children\u2019s rights. 501 IUVENTA - Slovak Youth Institut is a state organization directly managed by the Ministry of Education, Science, Research and Sport of the Slovak Republic.

        "Evaluation of legislation, policy and practice on child participation in the European Union (EU) March 2015 148 A number of specific recommendations concerning measures needed to improve and support implementation of legislation concerning procedural guidance are identified. For example concerning participation in juvenile courts 502 (see for example Luxembourg), training, resources and standards for monitoring. 6.4.2 Procedural guidance Targeted actions aimed at introducing or reinforcing procedures which promote children\u2019s participation in institutions and/or organisations hosting or providing services to children could expedite a change to procedural guidance. Such actions must be undertaken both in the field of education and in child protection with the aim of strengthening and deepening the democratic process and the proper education and training of the professionals involved. At the same time procedures for the participation of children should be promoted at community level and local government in general. \u201cThis does not require new legislation but better specification, preparation and support of the implementation, evaluation and feedback and a more effective system of consequences.\u201d (Children\u2019s Rights Advocate, Greece) \u201cIt would be necessary to establish a national organisation responsible for regulating a system of regional policy coordination and establishing a system of minimum standards and good practices exchange, since participation is different in each region.\u201d (Country Expert, Spain 503 ) Stakeholders interviewed in Ireland and Austria argued the need for ensuring that any legislation and guidance is supported by measures making available appropriate resources, in particular peer led activities. 6.4.3 Training Training for professionals is identified across most of the countries in this study and is a key issue to be addressed in realising participation. This needs to involve increasing awareness and understanding about children\u2019s rights and participation but also requires professionals working with children to develop skills of participatory practice and integrating the values and principles into their everyday practice. This includes how to engage, listen and talk with children to better understand their situation, and develop respectful relations with children as well as knowing how to support and facilitate different opportunities for children to have their say and be actively involved. Training is identified as being needed for all people who are involved in children\u2019s lives but especially for judges, doctors and other health care professionals. \u201cThere is no need for more legislation. To implement legislation it is important that social workers are educated enough to implement that legislation, to have not just knowledge about the legislation, but mostly empathy through supportive interaction with children, and be able to listen and understand children\u2019s situation.\u201d (Practitioner, Slovenia) 502 This legal background applies to juvenile courts in Luxembourg (own translation): \u201cWhatever the age of the child or the reason for his summoning before the juvenile court (see Ch.10 Sect.1) it is always understood in its opinions and explanations, even without the presence of his parents or his legal representative if it is in their interest. The court is not obliged to follow the will of the child. It takes only judge and measures to promote the welfare, conservation and education of the minor. (L. 10. Aug. 92 art. 1, 12, 23, 29). The juvenile court may even take \" a measure of custody, preservation or education specified in Article 1. Law of 10.8 92 towards any minor who asks for his help and assistance where this is necessary in the interest of the minor .\u201d 503 General country report findings ",
        "Evaluation of legislation, policy and practice on child participation in the European Union (EU) March 2015 149 \u201cThere is no need for additional legislation change. The most important thing is to train adults, parents and professionals about children right to participate and teach them how to do it, how to encourage children to participate, how talk to them \u2013 to start to treat youth seriously and listen to what they say.\u201d (Practitioner, Poland) Advocates are identified by one country (Poland) as being needed to support children in custody. Often the child does not have the right to information, does not know how the procedure is conducted and lacks statutory representation. Training needs can be understood as involving: a) the individual practitioner and her or his relationships with children, b) the institution or system within which they work and how it needed to be designed to ensure it is receptive to and informed by the perspectives of children and c) the role of the practitioner as an advocate of children\u2019s rights to be heard \u2013 using the experience of listening to children to seek to influence public policy accordingly. 6.4.4 Educating children about their rights In addition to training professionals, some countries (AT , DE, DK) identify the importance of educating children about their rights as explicitly mentioned in the constitution (Germany) but also in terms of the UNCRC (DK) so that they can really know their rights and be able to use them. This is fundamental to children\u2019s participation as it is not possible to exercise rights if one does not know one has them. This is echoed in findings from Belgium, where the main focus needs to be on ensuring the development of a children\u2019s rights culture in practice 504 . A number of responses suggest this should best happen in school. In particular more attention needs to be paid to finding out from children who don\u2019t participate e.g. at risk groups and for under 12s meaningful ways for them to participate (Netherlands). 6.4.5 Standards and monitoring The evaluation evidence shows a clear lack of monitoring and evaluation of children\u2019s participation. Many countries hence identify the need for monitoring, in particular at a central level, but also minimum quality standards for all sectors (Greece). One suggestion is for a body which will monitor child participation in all sectors, on local and national level (Romania). Another is for more research evidence on how child participation is being implemented. National standards and monitoring are important in particular for coordinating implementation across regions (Spain and Austria). In addition to monitoring, some countries identify the need for sanctions for violation of child participatory rights of children in alternative care (e.g. Croatia). Effective monitoring is also needed at the European level in particular with regard to implementation of Directives and Recommendations and in European projects. The issue of translating Recommendations (i.e. the Council of Europe Recommendations) into national language should be considered. 504 UNICEF Lundy L., Kilkelly U., Byrne B., Kang J.

        "Evaluation of legislation, policy and practice on child participation in the European Union (EU) March 2015 150 6.4.6 Measures to support social and cultural change A common theme from the evaluation is that implementation of participation does not depend on the extent to which specific legislation has been developed or not. Instead respondents in many countries argue for the need for cultural change as a more favourable context to develop participation. \u201cMentality change is the most important factor that would push the State to act differently and promote child participation in all sectors and situations. Legislation alone cannot really bring change, if adults are not willing to accept children as \u201cfellow citizens\u201d with equal rights. Recognising children as citizens is essential and lowering the voting age (similar to the practice in Austria) is the first step .\u201d(Cyprus) \u201cIt is important to start change with facilitating public debate about human rights, what they mean, how they were developed and for what reasons. Then it is more likely that more favourable conditions would be created for protection of child rights including right to participation.\u201d (Lithuania) To help bring about cultural change, public education is identified as being needed. For example through information and awareness-raising about children\u2019s rights and participation to improve understanding about the benefits of involving children (France and Italy) and develop a culture of participation; as attitudes cannot be changed by laws (Austria). Generating higher public acceptance for child / youth participation in school councils is not widely acknowledged yet. 505 Two country responses suggest elevating child participation as a topic in the media given the role of social and entertainment media in people\u2019s lives (Austria and Estonia). Another suggests the need for measures to raise parents\u2019 awareness for children\u2019s participation which could be implemented by professionals from childbirth (Austria). Another view is that making the general public aware of children and young people\u2019s right to participate is a massive task (UK, Wales). Campaigns and public education was identified specifically as being important in relation to minority groups such as the Roma (Slovakia) for whom it was felt that legislation would not help promote their participation because of the discrimination they experience, but also because due to their culture they are not used to consulting with children. For this group it is important to work with the parents as well. 505 This is illustrated by the case of a student committee president who was excluded from class for three days, after having publicly initiated a manifestation at school. The incident triggered off heated debate among members of the national parliament in LU.

        "Evaluation of legislation, policy and practice on child participation in the European Union (EU) March 2015 151 6.5 Conclusions This chapter has outlined the barriers and challenges in realising the effective participation of children in practice. These are shown to be largely concerned with the absence of appropriate structures and processes in organisations, public service and governance systems. This set of constraints is in turn due to lack of clear understanding amongst professionals about how to enable children\u2019s participation, but also a lack of political commitment to support professionals to put measures in place. This results in a lack of resources and capacity to support implementation of participation in practice. We also examined the possible enablers for supporting child participation, and found that \u2013 perhaps as might be expected \u2013 many of the enabling factors were the inverse of the barriers summarised above. The country level research indicated that participation is assisted when national Ministerial strategic decision-making is joined up and coherent, and when municipalities take a lead to champion child rights. The existence of transnational networks such as the Child Friendly Cities Initiative has also acted as a catalyst for change, whilst NGOs have often played a central role in keeping momentum for child rights. Beyond these factors, the use of public awareness campaigning and structured dialogue; training, and targeted measures for vulnerable or under-represented groups of children emerged as being key factors. The chapter underlines that further legislation is not always the solution to these barriers, and that other measures can improve the effectiveness of existing legislation; through more effective monitoring and remedial actions. The chapter also shows the importance within many Member States of cultural change, awareness raising and training. This includes training for children, to ensure an awareness of their rights and knowledge of how to put participation into practice. ",
        "Evaluation of legislation, policy and practice on child participation in the European Union (EU) March 2015 152 7.0 Children\u2019s understanding and experiences of child participation Key messages Children\u2019s understanding of \u2018child participation\u2019 \uf0b7 The majority of the participants in the child-led research projects felt strongly they should have a say in key decisions that concern them, despite a lack of consensus about what \u2018participation\u2019 should mean. In practice, however, participation was nearly always experienced as being most tangible and meaningful when viewed in the context of everyday interactions, whether at home, in school, or in the community. Children\u2019s experiences of participation \uf0b7 Children\u2019s experiences of participation can be broadly divided into issues where they have some decision-making authority (e.g. over their dress, choice of friends and free time activities), issues where they have limited decision-making (e.g. over choice of school, time spent watching TV, choice of doctor), and areas of shared decision-making (e.g. over room decorations, home rules, trips, and food). \uf0b7 Experiences were found to vary for individual children, depending on their living circumstances, location, and individual factors (e.g. age, gender, ethnic background, disability). In general, children do express themselves in the family, but they often have to acquiesce when parents or carers disagree with them. \uf0b7 In most cases children have more input to everyday (shorter-term) issues, and less to \u2018serious\u2019 (longer-term) issues. This may reflect both the unwillingness among some parents to involve children in issues that they don\u2019t think concern them, and/or a desire to protect children from information and experiences parents feel they may find distressing. \uf0b7 Certain groups of children drew attention to significant gender differences, largely based on cultural and religious norms, with girls in particular experiencing tension between their lives outside the home, and the restrictions they faced when at home. \uf0b7 There was considerable concern over the extent to which children and young people participated in decisions regarding their education. Although children tend to make their choice of school in conjunction with adults, they often described feeling pressurised to accept the choice of their parents or carers. Although some positive examples of participation were mentioned, children often criticised teachers for not taking time to listen to students, or for asking for their opinions but not taking them into account. \uf0b7 Although children\u2019s experiences of health services were mixed, a common view was that opportunities to participate in decisions about their care were limited. Many children said that in practice doctors usually talk to their parents and ignore them, and often children are not aware of what support and activities are on offer or how to access them, \uf0b7 Children generally reflected positively on their experiences of fostering and residential care in the two projects that addressed these issues. However significant areas of concern were around lack of confidentiality of data, and lack of involvement in decisions about whether to place a child in foster care, the choice of placement location, and the child\u2019s relations with their biological parents. There was significant criticism of other mechanisms specifically designed to encourage children\u2019s participation. Students\u2019 Councils, although considered useful by a number of young people at least some of the time, were regarded by others as being largely invisible, unrepresentative and/or ineffective. ",

The evidence is drawn from a set of participatory research projects that were conducted through a series of partners within five EU Member States (Croatia, Greece, Netherlands, Poland, and the UK). The projects aimed to reflect children\u2019s \u2018lived experiences\u2019 of participation within their everyday lives \u2013 rather than treating them as the \u2018objects\u2019 of research, as has often been the case traditionally, they saw them as young citizens with rights to be respected. The chapter begins by exploring various definitions of \u2018child participation\u2019, by examining what the term meant to the child participants. It then explores the children\u2019s experiences of participation in practice, highlighting both children\u2019s participation in different types of decisions, and different levels and spheres of participation, including: family, education, other services, and structures for children in fostering and residential care. 7.2 About the child-led projects This section provides a brief summary of the overall research approach for the child-led strand of the evaluation. Eleven partner organisations, working with children and young people from a range of sectors and settings, used peer research as the predominant method for facilitating the participation of children in the study. In total, the partners worked with 111 children (aged under 18) training them as peer researchers, and a further 630 who participated as research respondents through interviews, focus groups, or surveys. Overall, the child peer researchers had a significant degree of involvement in, and responsibility for, all aspects of a project, from overall research design, to developing research questions, data collection, analysis, reporting and dissemination. However the extent of their involvement varied between projects, depending on factors such as the ages and backgrounds of the children, the timing of projects in the school year, and the precise research tools identified for each project.

They also led on the production of a formal report on each project\u2019s activities; however children contributed, to varying degrees, to aspects of the report (e.g. writing or co-writing sections of the report; commenting on draft reports; making recommendations on the key issues arising). Following completion of project activities, \u2018intergenerational meetings\u2019 were held in two of the five countries involved. At the meetings, the child peer researchers communicated the findings from the research they had undertaken to key adult stakeholders in that country, providing opportunities for discussion and reflection on the learning and on how to take forward the findings. The following table gives a brief overview of each of the projects from the child-led strand, and describes the activities that took place. Detailed explanation of the methodologies used is described in Annex Five. Table 7.1 Overview of the projects for the child-led strand of the evaluation Partner Organisation Member State Description Office of the Children\u2019s Ombudsperson Croatia Conducted a peer-led survey of children's participation in decision- making at school . Written questionnaires were distributed between April and June 2013 among 214 students (12-18) in classes sampled from elementary and high schools in five areas of the country. The survey was organised by eight peer researchers from the Young Advisors Network to the Office of the Children's Ombudsperson. SOS Children\u2019s Villages Croatia Focus groups explored the extent to which children and young people living in the social care system participated in decision making processes. It involved eight peer researchers - three boys and five girls aged 13 to 16 \u2013 and 40 respondents aged 12-17. Most of the children who took part in the research were separated from their biological families for various reasons, including different forms of abuse and neglect. DND Opatija Croatia Children from two kindergartens; school children from 7 to 13 years old from two elementary schools, and a group of 17 year old high school pupils: 105 children and young people in total. Six child peer researchers (three male and three female, from 13-17 years old) led the work, and devised the methods to be used (group discussion, interviews, drawing, story with questions). Office of the Children\u2019s Ombudsman Greece Two two-day meetings (\"Days of Dialogue\") were organised in Thessaloniki and Athens, attended by 48 young people aged 13 to 18, from 14 different areas of the country. Among them were young people from minority ethnic or foreign backgrounds, young people living in institutions and young people with disabilities. The meetings included group discussions with young people on selected topics plenary sessions and evaluation. An \u2018intergenerational meeting\u2019 was held to discuss the findings, attended by 12 of the young people, staff from the Ombudsman\u2019s Office and representatives from various ministries and youth institutions.

        "Evaluation of legislation, policy and practice on child participation in the European Union (EU) March 2015 155 Partner Organisation Member State Description Roots Greece Roots worked with two groups of children in Athens: children from a multicultural school, and children from the Filipino Community. The first group were mainly asylum-seekers who had recently entered the country with at least one family member; the Filipino children were born and raised in Greece. Children were encouraged to participate in groups discussing various themes, including children\u2019s rights and participation. Twelve peer researchers were involved (aged 12-17) and 49 respondents. Youth and Human Rights issues (YOHRI) Netherlands Nine girls and eight boys (aged 13-18) from varied cultural backgrounds acted as peer researchers. They decided to focus on the theme of the participation of refugee children, and carried out interviews, took photographs, analysed results and wrote articles. A questionnaire developed by the group was answered by young people in a number of asylum seeking centres. Overall, the project engaged with 40 child asylum-seekers. The peer researchers worked with a facilitator/photographer/designer to produce a magazine reporting on their findings. At the end of the project an intergenerational meeting was held where the peer researchers presented their work to 100+ professionals and the municipality of Amsterdam. SOS Children\u2019s Villages Poland This project involved children growing up in the SOS Children\u2019s Villages Bilgoraj (aged 10-14); young people in a residential facility in Koszalin (aged 15-17); and children in two community centres in Bukowa and Karlino (aged 10-17). Twenty peer researchers were trained in research methods, developed research tools, and carried out face-to-face interviews with 43 respondents. Somali Development Group UK This research explored the views of Somali children and young people aged 11-17 years on their ability to participate in key decisions about their lives since coming to the UK. Six children volunteered to be peer researchers, and following training they carried out audio or video interviews, based on questions they had designed. Twenty interviews fitted the criteria of being aged between 11-17 years and living less than three years in the UK and these were used for the subsequent data analysis. Off the Record UK Young people were recruited for this project from the Mentality group, composed of young people aged 13-21 who have experienced mental health difficulties. The group explored young people\u2019s experience of participation within mental health services. Following training, two researchers conducted a combination of questionnaires, focus groups, and one-to-one interviews. The views of 26 respondents were analysed for the final report. Newstead Children\u2019s Centre UK Newstead offers nursery education for children aged two, three and four years. This project investigated the theme of \u2018transitions to primary school\u2019, and how young children reflected on their experience of participation at the centre. The project was planned in partnership with the children, and with the involvement of a pre- existing \u2018children\u2019s committee\u2019. The data collection involved the four year old children carrying out peer exit interviews, with adult support. Overall, 21 children were interviewed by 12 peer researchers. Black Young Carers UK Ten young carers (eight female and two male) were trained in peer research so that they could research the needs of a wider group of young carers. The peer researchers developed questionnaires and focus group questions, and held a citywide event to reach \u2018hidden\u2019 young carers. The peer researchers interviewed 22 young people aged 11-18. ",

This was acknowledged in the very positive comments of children and young people about their experiences of participating in the various projects undertaken for this study (see below). These echo the benefits described by Lansdown (2002) 506 that children link to increased participation \u2013 including acquiring new skills, building self-esteem, and contributing to making the world a better place. For example, the children from SOS Children\u2019s Villages in Croatia highlighted gains in self- awareness, commenting that through participation in the research \u2018we have learned a lot about ourselves and our peers, and have become smarter and more mature\u2019. A girl (16) who took part in the project by the Greek Children\u2019s Ombudsman stated that she had \u2018 discovered elements of myself\u2019 and that participating was \u2018a life lesson\u2019 . She had also thought more deeply about the subject, made new friends, and \u2018opened up\u2019 in new ways. Other children were clear that they had improved their communication abilities. A child from SOS Children\u2019s Villages in Poland argued that they had learned a lot about conducting interviews and gained in the process: \u2018The conversations were fun and I feel the others also liked talking to me. I feel better at talking to people now\u2019. Many of the children commented on their development of research skills. Another child from SOS Children\u2019s Villages in Poland stated \u2018 I got to know something new about carrying out an interview. And I worked with a dictaphone\u2019. She also reflected on the fact that \u2018 sometimes the issues were difficult to discuss\u2019, but that she \u2018could help my peers solve some difficult problems\u2019. Similarly, children from the Opatija project in Croatia commented that \u2018 we learnt new methods of research; we improved our communication skills\u2019. Moreover, they noted that the skills they had learnt had wider relevance as \u2018participation is a very important process in our lives\u2019 . 506 Lansdown G.

        "Evaluation of legislation, policy and practice on child participation in the European Union (EU) March 2015 157 Figure 7.4 Young researchers conducting a focus group with elementary school children, Opatija, Croatia Several of the children stressed the importance of their findings and expressed the hope that the knowledge gained would help to improve the lives of children more generally. As children from the Child Ombudsperson project in Croatia argued: \u2018Maybe these results will help in contributing to better child participation and more serious understanding of children\u2019. A boy (17) from the Greek Children\u2019s Ombudsman\u2019s project highlighted the need to develop specific recommendations arising from their work: \u2018it is really important that young people, who are not acquainted with each other, have gathered here and can now talk and make proposals.\u2019 One of the researchers from the Black Young Carers project in the UK also identified that taking part in the project had strengthened their desire to campaign on the issues they cared about: \u2018I now have fire in my belly to get out there and get young carers\u2019 voices heard and work to get young carers who don\u2019t realise they are young carers to get their voices heard as well\u2019. Overall, the congruence of the positive views that were expressed by children and young people in reports and evaluation forms is striking. Other research has also suggested that the benefits from gains in research skills are transferable to other aspects of children\u2019s lives (Kellett, 2006) 507 . The views of adult staff members in the projects were generally similar to those of the children and young people. The co-ordinator of the Somali Development Group in the UK argued, for example, that learning from this experience had helped the peer researchers to feel more confident about conducting research: \u2018As they became more experienced with the questionnaire subject matter, they were able to relax more when questioning to gain more meaningful responses by exploring the depth of answers given.\u2019 On a wider scale, he stated that they \u2018enjoyed being part of something relevant to their community and being able to help by enabling others to express themselves \u2019. The Off the Record report (UK) notes that despite the numerous challenges that were encountered, \u2018it was clear that the research skills and confidence of the young people involved developed a great deal throughout this research project\u2019. This was also true of the young people in the Black Young Carers Project (UK). Whereas at the beginning of the project the group found it very difficult to find their voice, with support the project \u2018found a positive reinforcing cycle in the young carers gaining confidence through participation, which in turn enabled them to participate more\u2019 . These sorts of experiences were reflected in feedback from Croatia and other countries. 507 Kellett, M.

        "Evaluation of legislation, policy and practice on child participation in the European Union (EU) March 2015 158 The report of the Children\u2019s Ombudsman in Greece highlighted children\u2019s eagerness to have discussions with peers, their will to express their opinion, their seriousness and responsibility. According to the report, conversations flowed freely, and some researchers managed to coordinate the group discussions exceptionally well, probing responses effectively and involving all participants on an equal basis. Participants showed interest in listening to different experiences from other peers, schools, areas and environments, and showed respect for the opinions of others. Ultimately, young people were satisfied at being able to express their opinions freely. As well as benefits for the children involved, the projects gave rise to interesting findings and helped to flesh out a more rounded picture of children\u2019s lives. They also provided very useful insights for the adults who were involved, in particular by challenging their perspectives of the competences of the children they worked with. This was most evident in the project carried out with very young children (4 year olds) at Newstead in the UK. This project involved exploration of children\u2019s feelings and thoughts of \u2018transitions\u2019 (i.e. children joining the children\u2019s centre and children graduating from the centre to primary school). Following extensive preparation through discussions and meetings, the child researchers undertook data collection through \u2018exit interviews\u2019 with their peers. The report records that \u2018the child peer researchers were very pleased with themselves and enjoyed taking turns, interviewing, filming and taking photos\u2019. Moreover, a staff member commented \u2018I have learnt a lot. The children\u2019s level of capacity surprised me and all the staff\u2019. Reflecting on the research process, the research findings, and the children\u2019s overall experience, the staff recommended that children need more opportunities to participate in the educational decisions of the early years centre, that staff training should address children\u2019s competence and how to ensure their voice is heard, and that opportunities should be provided for children to influence the design of an area of the children\u2019s centre. This reflects the findings of other attempts to actively engage very young children in participatory research. For instance, the Mosaic approach developed by Clark and Moss in the UK involves children under 5 taking responsibility for guiding a researcher around \u2018tours\u2019 of their nursery and for recording the visit (either by photograph, audio recording or drawings). Putting together the results from this and other research tools has led to improved understandings of children\u2019s interests and concerns (e.g. about children\u2019s private spaces within the nursery, and the need to involve children in planning the use of external play areas). It has also undermined professional assumptions about young children\u2019s capabilities 508 . 7.3.1 Children\u2019s understanding of \u2018child participation\u2019 Various definitions of \u2018child participation\u2019 have been developed at international level. The UN Committee on the Rights of the Child (UNCRC) has used the term to describe: \u2018\u2026 processes, which include information-sharing and dialogue between children and adults based on mutual respect, and in which children can learn how their views and those of adults are taken into account and shape the outcome of such processes .\u2019 509 508 Clark A., \u2018Developing and Adapting the Mosaic Approach\u2019, in Clark A., Flewitt R., Hammersley M., Robb M., (2014) Understanding Research with Children and Young People, Open University/SAGE 509 UN Committee on the Rights of the Child, (2009), General Comment no. 12 on the right to be heard. ",
        "Evaluation of legislation, policy and practice on child participation in the European Union (EU) March 2015 159 The Council of Europe has similarly defined participation as being: \u2018..about individuals and groups of individuals having the right, the means, the space, the opportunity and, where necessary, the support to freely express their views, to be heard and to contribute to decision making on matters affecting them, their views being given due weight in accordance with their age and maturity\u2019 510 . The child-led research projects showed that \u2018participation\u2019 is not a term which all children and young people are familiar with. Indeed, the young people in different projects interpreted \u2018participation\u2019 in different ways. For example, the Greek Ombudsman\u2019s report states that: \u2018young people comprehend the meaning of participation solely as an expression of their opinion - orally or in writing - and they find it difficult to think of other ways to participate (e.g. in cultural or other activities)\u2019 . By contrast, the young people from the Somali Development Group interpreted \u2018participation\u2019 as meaning \u2018activities outside the home\u2019 and felt that they participated through political discussions and debates, sporting activities, and activities organised by mosques. Interestingly, the young people from Off the Record (UK) also thought that participation meant \u2018taking part in some sort of event with other people\u2019 , but more subtly \u2013 and echoing the definition of the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child - they also understood participation as \u2018a process of involvement with others, as opposed to simply having a say or taking part in making decisions\u2019 . They went on to reflect that having a voice, and that voice being listened to, was very important to them \u2013 and that this didn\u2019t happen enough. Moreover, by having a say in decisions that affect them they would feel more involved within their community. Several of the projects highlighted that children and young people\u2019s understanding of participation was clearly influenced by their age. For instance, the 17 year olds from Opatija in Croatia interpreted participation as involvement in formal activities, such as the Children's City Council and Children Forum; this may have been affected by the fact that they knew (or had been themselves) members of these bodies. Children from 10-13 years saw child participation as respect for children's rights and their ability to decide (although younger members of this age group did not appear to fully understand what was meant by a \u2018right\u2019 to participate). Children from 7-9 years felt that participation meant socialising, playing, helping parents with household activities, and caring for the elderly and disabled in their community. It can be anticipated that understandings of participation are also affected by the other identity issues that may combine with age, such as gender and disability. But unfortunately, the data presented in the reports is insufficiently nuanced to enable comparisons of, say, the different perspectives of boys and girls of \u2018participation\u2019. In the same way, it would be interesting to explore the differences between the perceptions of children with or without disabilities. For our partners, these different interpretations of the meaning of \u2018child participation\u2019 were more than just individual assessments of an abstract concept. These understandings influenced the ways in which the research projects were framed and conducted. This can be seen, for example, in the kinds of questions that young people chose to ask, and the kinds of responses that they then received. For some children, it was easier to reply to a practical question such as: \u2018do you know some of the activities in which you can participate?\u2019, rather than a theoretical question such as: \u2018Is your voice heard in key decisions affecting your life?\u2019 510 Recommendation CM/Rec(2012)2 of the Committee of Ministers to Member States on the participation of children and young people under the age of 18, https://wcd.coe.int/ViewDoc.jsp?id=1927229&Site=CM ",
        "Evaluation of legislation, policy and practice on child participation in the European Union (EU) March 2015 160 7.3.2 Children\u2019s experiences of participation The partners addressed children\u2019s experiences of participation from two perspectives, which are considered in turn below. First, the report by SOS Children\u2019s Villages in Poland provided a useful typology of children\u2019s decision-making; issues where children and young people had some decision-making authority; issues where children and young people had limited decision- making; and areas of shared decision-making. (This is similar to the framework developed by Lansdown 511 , which explores issues where children have \u2018no influence\u2019; \u2018limited influence; \u2018moderate influence\u2019, or \u2018comprehensive influence\u2019 on decision-making). Second, partners explored different levels and spheres of participation, including the family, education, service provision, mechanisms to support children\u2019s participation, and fostering and residential care. Types of decision-making Among the partner projects, various frameworks were developed for analysing children and young people\u2019s experiences of participation. One of the most comprehensive was set out by SOS Children\u2019s Villages in Poland, who explored both the types of decisions taken by children and young people, and the contexts in which they take place. According to their findings, the majority of their respondents not only took decisions (i.e. were given permission to do so), but also made choices (i.e. took action) on a range of issues. They emphasised that decision-making was inseparably connected with the responsibility for one\u2019s choice. Moreover not all decisions bore the same significance: \u2018choices of temporary nature do not pose a problem to the respondents, unlike life choices, which change or strongly affect one\u2019s life. The latter require knowledge, reason and experience, which are acquired with age\u2019. However, they also noted that every respondent could recall a wide spectrum of experiences, so the same interviewees referred to cases of influencing decisions affecting their lives and to moments of being deprived of choice. \u2018If you raise a child to be competent in making decisions, it makes their future easier. Decisions are inherent in life \u2013 no matter if it is the choice of school or of a life partner\u2019. Girl, 16, SOS Children\u2019s Villages, Poland \u2018My parents took all decisions on their own and I didn\u2019t like it. I don\u2019t want to be the only one to decide, but I would like a chance to voice my opinion\u2019. Girl, 14, SOS Children\u2019s Villages, Poland \u2018Children can influence decisions that relate to them and cannot decide on things that concern adults\u2019 . Girl, 13, SOS Children\u2019s Villages, Poland This research also went on to develop a useful typology of the different kinds of decisions that children and young people faced. These included: \uf0b7 Issues where children and young people had some decision-making authority: Here the children and young people focused largely on dress, the choice of friends, free time activities, as well as one\u2019s room decorations, emphasising that the above aspects of life shape a person\u2019s identity (\u2018 My dress shows who I am\u2019. Girl, 14). Most answers revealed that the choice of friends and the ability to spend time with them was of the utmost significance to the respondents \u2013 and any attempts on the part of parents or carers to limit this privilege were considered to threaten the child\u2019s freedom ( \u2018No-one can tell me who to make my friend, it is my private matter\u2019. Girl, 16). Although many of the young people (over 13s in particular) reported their friends to be the trusted parties with whom they discussed problems and life choices and whose advice they sought, many also expected to receive support in decision making from their parents, relatives or carers, especially when life decisions were involved. 511 Lansdown G. (2011) A Framework for Monitoring and Evaluating Children\u2019s Participation ",
        "Evaluation of legislation, policy and practice on child participation in the European Union (EU) March 2015 161 \uf0b7 Issues where children and young people had limited decision-making: Some children and young people are able to take some decisions independently, whereas others have to defer to their parents or carers. The most prominent decisions in this category were choice of school (and extra classes), and time spent watching TV or using the computer. The children who reported lack of influence e.g. on the amount of pocket money or the choice of holiday destination, pointed to low household income in their families (\u2018 I don\u2019t have a say in setting my pocket money because my mum doesn\u2019t earn enough. To provide for the family she needs to control the money closely\u2019. Girl, 15). Children do not participate in the choice of their GP, which poses a problem for some of the interviewees as they do not feel at ease when examined by a doctor of the opposite sex or are simply unwilling to discuss their ailments with a specific individual. Generally, however, they would not wish to change the involvement of their parent or carer in medical issues since it makes them feel more secure. \uf0b7 Areas of shared decision-making: Children and young people did not report lack of influence on relevant decisions (e.g. about room decorations, home rules and duties, trips, and groceries) (\u2018 I share the room with my sister so I do have a say but we have to agree on the choice\u2019. Girl, 15). In practice, they participated in everyday choices made at their homes, schools or day care centres (\u2018 In my family we all agree on the menu\u2019 . Girl, 14). Democratic methods of negotiating decisions (e.g. debate, vote or group survey) were highly appreciated by most, regardless of the extent of the compromise they had to make. On finding majority choices incompatible with their individual preference, some felt deprived of influence and decision-making power; as the report noted: \u2018this suggests the needs of children whose ideas were \u201coverruled\u201d should be appreciated and ensured at least partial fulfilment\u2019 . The research conducted in Poland suggests that children expect support, attention and advice from their parents and carers but provided on the basis of partnership not age hierarchy, and without decisions taken on an adult\u2019s whim: \u2018It is necessary for a young individual to be heard attentively and able to voice their observations and preferences, even if they seem irrelevant to an adult. Fears and anxieties treated seriously and allayed ably, without discrediting choices or forcing opinions (\u2018I am older and I know better what is good for you\u2019) enable the young to appreciate the influence they have over their lives\u2019 . 7.3.3 Levels and spheres of participation Family and school are probably the most important sites for considering children\u2019s experiences of participation. Not all the projects in this study explored the extent of children\u2019s participation in family matters, but we give some examples below. Other levels and spheres of participation are then explored further. 7.3.3.1 Family According to the research conducted by the Children\u2019s Ombudsman in Greece, the general feeling is that children do express themselves in the family. But when parents (or those responsible for young people) disagree with them, children usually have to give in. However it depends what issue is being considered, and there are differences between experiences: \u2018I feel good when my opinion is heard.\u2019 (Boy, 14) \u2018Very simply, the authority (i.e. parents) makes decisions.\u2019 (Girl, 16) \u2018Every time I express my opinion, I get in a quarrel.\u2019 (Boy, 16) \u2018I wish my opinion counted more.\u2019 (Girl, 14) ",
        "Evaluation of legislation, policy and practice on child participation in the European Union (EU) March 2015 162 \u2018My opinion is heard in more \"painless\" decisions, on daily issues (e.g. excursions, events, activities). There are of course the usual points of friction (e.g. lessons, free time, what time to return when going out in the evening).\u2019 \u2018They do not pay attention to me about the more serious issues which do not concern me directly (e.g. financial, politics, the crisis) because they think I am young or because they do not want to sadden/stress me. Also they will not listen to me about issues regarding relationships/friends (e.g. do not approve of a romantic relationship).\u2019 \u2018Our parents subconsciously get messages across to us from a young age (e.g. for choosing a profession), therefore when I then express my opinion it is totally affected by them. It's me speaking, but in essence it's not me.\u2019 (Girl, 16) Some young people have discussions with their parents and their opinion is always heard. \u2018They ask me, they take me into account, we decide together. I convince them after a discussion. They advise me and we always find a solution\u2019 . But some young people say their opinion is not asked and is not taken into consideration even about issues which concern them directly: \u2018They consider me immature and young. Because they are adults, their opinion is superior to mine. My opinion does not count for my parents. Power decides.\u2019 Children from the Somali Development Group in the UK felt that they had some voice within the family, but generally parents made decisions, and most of the children had had their own decisions overruled by parents. As one boy put it, \u2018I make decisions but the final say is with my parents.\u2019 Significant gender differences existed, however, largely based on cultural and religious norms. Boys commented that they had more of a say in decisions than girls. Girls noted a tension between their lives outside the home, and the restrictions they faced when at home ( \u2018I cannot go out on my own like my brothers\u2019) . They reflected on traditional notions of appropriate roles for girls and women, a downgrading of the importance of education for girls, and over-protective parenting. One girl commented, for example, that having strict parents meant lack of choice and \u2018having to follow orders\u2019 , rather than being consulted. Another girl highlighted that her parents had \u2018grown up in environment where girls do not have rights, so are struggling with this.\u2019 7.3.3.2 Childcare and education Childcare and education are key spheres where is it important to strengthen children\u2019s ability to express opinions about matters affecting them. As the Report of the Office of the Children\u2019s Ombudsperson in Croatia argued, it is essential to raise awareness of the advantages of identifying key issues and solutions through dialogue between children and adults over the traditional approach under which children are \u2018 silenced and excluded from decision-making\u2019. In the case of Newstead in the UK, the very young age of the children involved meant that the methods were unique and were developed by the adult staff, but carried out by the children over a four week period. The research sought to gain insight into the reflections of the twenty four-year-olds departing the centre; what has been important, what has been relevant, how much they feel listened to, and their overall experience at the centre. In partnership with the Centre\u2019s \u2018Children\u2019s Committee\u2019 512 , the supervising adults decided to introduce a new member to the nursery, \u2018Juliette Bear\u2019 (a teddy bear bought via the internet, whose identity the young people then helped to create). Juliette Bear provided a catalyst for discussions around feelings and thoughts of \u2018transitions\u2019 (i.e. children joining the children\u2019s centre and children graduating from the centre to primary school). 512 A representative group of children of all ages and abilities. This committee meets regularly to explore their views decisions such as destinations for annual outings, resources to be purchased, reviewing management ideas and influence policies ",
        "Evaluation of legislation, policy and practice on child participation in the European Union (EU) March 2015 163 Figure 7.5 Juliette Bear with a child at Newstead project, London The staff then organised a meeting to introduce the children to a camera and camcorder; demonstrations were given on how to use both gadgets and each child was given time for a practice run. A special lunch meeting was held for the children\u2019s committee to agree their roles and responsibilities and to devise questions for the interviews. The staff initiated discussions about the different research roles, explaining their purposes and what each entailed. The children then carried out \u2018exit interviews\u2019 (interviews with children who were leaving the nursery that term), based on picture prompts supplied by the supporting adult to accompany the questions. Initially there were concerns among staff that it would be hard for 4 year olds to express their views about participation, and that the children might struggle to engage with the research process. In practice, the children\u2019s experiences of participation in this project were very positive. As the report states: \u2018The children appeared to gain a great sense of pride through deciding on their roles in this project, selecting the type of teddy bear and carrying out the research. \u2019. \u2018The child peer researchers were very pleased with themselves and enjoyed taking turns, interviewing, filming and taking photos\u2019 \u2026 \u2019we were astounded at their confidence and competence in using camcorders and cameras so effectively but this is presumably integral to their lives\u2019. Although the report indicates that no reliable data was collected from the children on their attitudes to participation, some positive outcomes from the project are described in section 8.3. The report also records the beneficial effect of enabling children\u2019s participation : \u2018The enthusiasm children showed when making decisions on this project compared to their apathy when they were told to carry out a task clearly reveals how participation can have a positive impact\u2019 . The report by SOS Children\u2019s Villages in Croatia highlighted in particular issues relating to choice of school. The majority of the children in this report stated they were able to participate in decisions over the choice of their school; a minority stated that they participated too, but the adults tried to pressurise them into choosing the \u2018best\u2019 school for them \u2013 even if the child didn't agree. In most cases, however, children collaborate with adults in the choice of school. As the children from the SOS Children\u2019s Villages in Croatia stated: \u2018We take part in deciding in which school we will go to, together with our parents, who suggest to us the possibilities and explain the good and bad sides, and at the end we choose what we want and choose the school ourselves.\u2019 Having said this, the children were concerned that adults failed to participate sufficiently in the process of learning and monitoring school performance. Generally, they felt adults start to take an interest only when the child\u2019s performance gets significantly worse. In their view, adults should be more involved from the beginning of the education process. ",
        "Evaluation of legislation, policy and practice on child participation in the European Union (EU) March 2015 164 The issue of school choice prompted similar responses to those from Croatia from children and young people in the Polish report. In general, it appeared that choices were made by young people in conjunction with advice from parents and other trusted adults. As one boy (aged 16) put it: \u2018 I discussed the choice of school with one man from the village [from the staff] whom I trust. He is able to influence my choices.\u2019 Another girl (aged 15) stated that her foster carers initially rejected her choice and wanted to persuade her to go to their preferred school, however with the help of friends and a worker at the children\u2019s village, she was able to attend the school she wanted to. In some cases, however, young people are allowed to make decisions in relation to their education on their own: \u2018 My aunt wants me to decide on my extra classes, in the village or in town. She doesn\u2019t force me to do things. It wouldn\u2019t make sense.\u2019 (Girl, 16) Discussions organised by Off the Record in the UK revealed that education is the most important place children and young people wish to have a say. But in practice, education was not mentioned as one of the places young people actually did feel that they had a say and policy changes were criticised for not involving young people (\u2018Government changes to the educational system rarely ask for the views and opinions of the young people that their decisions will be affecting.\u2019 ). One of the biggest issues concerning participating in schools was adults not listening to students, or alternatively, asking for children\u2019s opinions but not taking them into account. Yet children acknowledged that school councils and students\u2019 unions sometimes do help to provide a voice with and for them. In the survey of 214 students carried out by the Office of the Children\u2019s Ombudsperson in Croatia, 54% rated their experience of participation in school as \u2018good\u2019, while 35% rated it as \u2018unsatisfactory\u2019. The majority felt that they were regularly encouraged to express their views on school-related issues, but their involvement in school decision-making had not resulted in any significant change. A little less than half of the children and adolescents surveyed said that their expressed opinions mostly produced a positive outcome. They reported they felt personally encouraged and motivated \u2013 and that they were given the opportunity to make a difference (e.g. by introducing healthy changes in school meals), organise extracurricular and after-school activities for students (e.g. a school chess tournament) or influence decisions that affected them (e.g. choosing a school field trip destination). However most respondents also highlighted serious negative effects \u2013 for example, disciplinary sanctions include warnings, reprimands, failing grades - from expressing views and opinions that were in conflict with those of a teacher ( \u2018Even when I express my opinion, nobody takes the time to consider it. Instead, we get bullied by teachers\u2019). A small number of respondents associated negative effects with their peers (e.g. being laughed at or frowned upon). Ultimately, it was felt that the extent to which children were able to participate in school depended on the approach of individual teachers ( \u2018Some get annoyed when students express their views, and the others give them due consideration\u2019 ). In general, the children and young people consulted in the report by the Children\u2019s Ombudsman in Greece tended to have a very negative view of participation within the education system. Children's needs and learning potential were not taken into consideration and many children stated that school \u2018has no respect at all for our opinion\u2019 . Moreover teachers \u2018do not listen to us even in procedures affecting us directly\u2019 (e.g. excursions, participation in teachers' associations). In practice teachers do not encourage the participation of all students and marginalise some of them, particularly on the basis of the children having a different nationality or ethnicity. Teachers are said to have no desire or time to listen to the opinions of children and often intimidate them. Punishment is often the first recourse for teachers, instead of discussion. Only some schools have a friendly environment and no atmosphere of intimidation. In some, but not all schools, there were also positive examples of participation, especially in group projects (e.g. bands, health education), where children were able to speak freely and learn to communicate. ",
        "Evaluation of legislation, policy and practice on child participation in the European Union (EU) March 2015 165 A range of opinions were expressed about Student Councils in schools across the five research locations of the Office of the Children\u2019s Ombudsperson in Croatia. Some felt that the Council was beneficial to all students as it enabled them to get involved in school governance and better influence decisions affecting their education. Others suggested the Council either had a modest influence, or that it was useless because its members met to discuss irrelevant issues: \u2018school-led initiatives, school plays and musicals, school field trips etc., instead of addressing the real issues and problems facing students at school\u2019 . Some answers also suggested that students were not provided with sufficient information about Council activities, either by teachers or the student members themselves. The report of the Children\u2019s Ombudsman in Greece was also critical of the mechanisms. Student Councils were highlighted as a negative example of children's participation (\u2018I never turn to them\u2019; \u2018their opinion is not really heard\u2019) , due to the way they function and the way their members are selected. It was argued that in the majority of cases they do not help or convey children's opinion but the personal opinion of their members (\u2018What is tragic is that we ourselves vote for our worst representatives\u2019) . 7.3.3.3 Other services Given that children and young people have limited experiences of other service provision, such as the police service, local authorities, and health services, it is unsurprising that few views were expressed about these. Nevertheless, the report of the Children\u2019s Ombudsman in Greece concluded that it was obvious that the realisation of the right of participation in fields such as these was \u2018extremely deficient\u2019 and that \u2018in the few cases young people have the opportunity to express their opinion it is not taken into consideration\u2019 . This was illustrated by a range of comments from young people in the report. Police service/courts In relation to the police, some young people from Greece highlighted incidents of serious mistreatment: \u2018We've seen aggressive behaviour from the police to children. Let alone helping or listening to adolescents.\u2019 (Boy, 17) \u2018Two kids from our school, who have had some behaviour problems, but have never gone to extremes, were caught by the police during a football game and then told us how hard they were beaten up at the police station until their parents arrived to get them.\u2019 (Boy, 17) Local authorities The young people consulted by the Greek Children\u2019s Ombudsman were also critical of local authorities: \u2018Last year at the 15-member Students' Council the whole school decided to ask for the enlargement of the yard. We applied to the municipality, but did not receive an answer. This year, we sent another application, but we still haven't heard from them.\u2019 (Girl, 15) Other requests made by children that had been ignored by local authorities were also mentioned (e.g. in relation to getting a playground, provision of a bicycle lane, cleaning up the city). The report records \u2018They were not taken into consideration and children never received an answer\u2019 . ",
        "Evaluation of legislation, policy and practice on child participation in the European Union (EU) March 2015 166 Health services Whilst some Greek children said that doctors explained to them what was going on when the issue concerned them, most said that doctors usually talk to their parents and ignore them: \u2018 You are not heard, you literally do not exist in places like that. It's really weird because you might be needing help. It was as if I didn't exist.\u2019 (Boy, 17) \u2018When you visit a doctor, he/she usually turns and speaks to your parents and ignores you, as if you don't exist.\u2019 (Girl, 15) \u2018At a difficult time last year I had to contact a hospital. When they realised they were talking to an adolescent they made fun of me and told me I have no idea what I'm talking about, that I'm exaggerating and that they need to speak to an adult. But there was no adult around at the time and I urgently needed an ambulance. Then in hospital I was treated with the same rudeness. And when later I asked for a complaint form to fill, they refused to give me one and told me 'what do you know of hospitals!\u2019 (Boy,17) A contrasting opinion was heard from the young people in the Off the Record project in the UK. Overall, they felt that opportunities to participate were best in services (but perhaps this reflected their own experience of mental health provision). Nevertheless, these positive experiences were not unanimous; one young woman described how her issues were not taken seriously by her doctor, who \u2018started to talk to me as if I was a child\u2019 . Young people from Off the Record also stated that the services available are not well known and not well publicised (\u2018 They are good when you hear about them.\u2019 ). Ignorance about what was available in terms of service provision generally was an issue too for the young people in the Black Young Carers project (UK). Many were not aware of who to talk to, despite identifying opportunities when they had wanted to talk to someone and get support \u2013 and this was particularly true for young male carers, who seemed to find it more difficult to voice their needs. The report confirmed that \u2018the research shows that young people are often not aware of what support and activities are on offer or how to access them, let alone how to have a say in what services should be provided or how. \u2019 7.3.3.4 Fostering and residential care Among the partners, SOS Children\u2019s Villages in Croatia and Poland both addressed children\u2019s experiences in relation to foster and residential care of various types (e.g. community, village, family, home). Children and young people from the project in SOS Children\u2019s Villages in Croatia suggested their experiences were mostly positive. The majority of children said that they were able to participate in various ways in decision-making and planning through mechanisms such as communal meetings or opinion surveys. However one significant area of concern for the Croatian children within the social care system was confidentiality of data. The children claimed they were never asked, for example, which aspects of their personal data should be written in school records. Most of them did not have any experience of being involved in privacy issues, and adults made all decisions about this area . The children highlighted situations where adults used the child\u2019s life story to generate a sympathetic response from teachers, without the child's consent or asking the child whether they wanted their private information to be revealed in this way. Although some children were not bothered by such practices ( \u2018Nothing is important to me because everybody knows everything about me\u2019) , the majority were ( \u2018We wish to be asked which of our personal data they can tell others\u2019). ",
        "Evaluation of legislation, policy and practice on child participation in the European Union (EU) March 2015 167 In Croatia the issue of confidentiality is a very important one for the children and young people in the care system, and it is not respected enough. Whilst some actions and decisions are taken within a legal framework, \u2018 it is still important to emphasise that the interest of the children should be above everything else, and that it should at least be explained to them what information about them have to be revealed, so they can express their thoughts and feelings about this.\u2019 In Poland the issues related to decisions about whether to place a child in foster care, the choice of specific foster location, and the resident\u2019s relations with their biological parents. Commenting on their lack of influence on relevant decisions, many children referred specifically to the moment of placement (see below): \u2018When I was placed in the children\u2019s home I couldn\u2019t choose whether to stay with my mom or not.\u2019 (Girl, 11) \u2018Even if they had asked me, I wouldn\u2019t have known which foster unit to choose. I didn\u2019t know anybody around the place [in the children\u2019s village] but now I am good here\u2019. (Girl, 14) \u2018It happened so fast, one day I was with the foster family and the next day I was placed here [in the village].\u2019 (Girl, 16) In practice, children have little influence on their placement in alternative care. If parents fail to fulfil their roles, other adults (e.g. local authorities) need to ensure the children\u2019s security outside the biological family. The course of the placement procedure depends on adults as well. In response, SOS Children\u2019s Villages Poland have developed a placement policy which recommends, for example, making the child acquainted with the unit and SOS family, or obtaining consent from their family of origin for placement in a specific SOS family. As for the choice whether or not to maintain contact with children\u2019s families of origin, the respondents reported their individual opinion to be crucial, assuming contact was permitted under the court\u2019s order. 7.3.3.5 Participation structures for children A range of specific mechanisms to enhance children\u2019s participation, such as school councils (see \u2018Education\u2019 above), children\u2019s parliaments, and city-wide forums, were referred to by partners. But experiences of and attitudes to these mechanisms varied. A popular example was provided from Croatia by the Opatija \u2018Children\u2019s City Council\u2019; based on Article 12 UNCRC, the Council enables children to express their wishes and needs to adults and to those who make decisions in the city. At their sessions children regularly ask questions of the mayor and chairman of the City Council and they get answers from them on the spot or in written form afterwards. They also present their results and projects. Every year children collect opinions from other children in the city about the needs of children for budget proposals, and they make proposals for the city budget; part of which includes children. They also have their own small annual budget of around \u20ac1600 for conducting a competition for projects for children. In contrast, the report of the Children\u2019s Ombudsman in Greece concluded that \u2018the institutions established with the very aim to promote the expression of opinion, democracy and the participation of children, do not fulfil their mission (e.g. Students' Councils, the Youth Parliament) and create a feeling of frustration. \u2019 Instead it was felt that participation in teams, projects and other activities reinforced the feeling of children's participation and empowered them. Young people also felt that the Children's Ombudsman was an institution that helped them express themselves and resolve their problems. ",
        "Evaluation of legislation, policy and practice on child participation in the European Union (EU) March 2015 168 7.4 Children\u2019s attitudes towards participation Here we highlight some of the attitudes of children towards participation that have not been addressed in the previous sections. It should be noted that, in practice, there is some overlap between what children say their experiences of participation are, and their expressed attitudes towards participation. Among the young people questioned by Off the Record in the UK, the vast majority felt that it was very or extremely important to have a say in decisions that affect them. In fact, only one young person asked did not feel that it was important at all. Many of the young participants agreed with the statement: \u2018It\u2019s my life. It\u2019s okay for people to try and guide me, but if I\u2019m not given the chance to make mistakes, when am I ever going to really learn and become the person I am. \u2019 They felt that education was the most important area where they would like to have a say, followed by decisions about relationships and medical decisions, and then decisions about service provision. The young people in the Black Young Carers project emphasised how happy, proud and satisfied they were when they felt they had been heard (\u2018 It takes a weight off my shoulders.\u2019). Given the often \u2018hidden\u2019 nature of the issues faced by young carers, the report highlights how they feel less stigmatised and isolated when they are valued and listened to. Among the Opatija respondents in Croatia, high school students would like to have their voices heard more. They were familiar with some forms of children's participation, but they felt they didn't use them adequately due to the excessive demands of school. They expected adults to encourage them more in participation and organising (\u2018 Young people are not interested in participating by themselves until someone stimulates them to be interested. \u2019) . Compared to high school children, primary school children said there were more activities in which they could participate. Those aged 12-13 said that they could contact organisations such as the Children's City Council (which organizes debates, surveys and other educational and fun activities); whereas children aged 10-11 more often said that they turn to teachers and parents. The answers given by children and young people in response to the questionnaire of the Office of the Children\u2019s Ombudsperson in Croatia suggested that they were well aware of the existence of the right to freedom of opinion and expression. A significant number of respondents believed that children and young people should be allowed to express their opinions in all situations, and particularly in school, as that is where they spend most of their time. They also believed that students should have the right to express their opinions freely without fear of consequences, but there was evidence that students felt the need to choose when to speak up and when not to. As one put it, \u2018students should let their opinions be heard as often as possible, but there are certain situations in which it is better to keep your mouth shut because you could only worsen the situation.\u2019 In practice, children and young people felt their views and opinions were not given due consideration. They were dissatisfied with how often their views were sought, the extent to which they had a voice and influence in matters affecting them and how this varied according to the setting and level of decision-making involved. In particular, they did not believe that their views were listened to and valued in the school setting. As the report comments: \u2018They do not see themselves as full and equal participants in the decision making processes that affect them; they feel that children's participation is reduced to a mere formality, a fairy tale for the gullible \u2013 a guaranteed right in theory, but not in practice.\u2019 ",
        "Evaluation of legislation, policy and practice on child participation in the European Union (EU) March 2015 169 The children and young people in the research by the Children\u2019s Ombudsman in Greece described a range of feelings that they experienced about participation in different contexts. Within the family, for instance, children highlighted on the one hand positive feelings - contentment, satisfaction, security, and feelings of understanding and support - when parents listened to their opinions. One child also stated that \u2018They always do whatever they do for our good; what they think is the best for us\u2019. On the other hand, children also pointed to negative feelings \u2013 anger, bitterness, and tantrums \u2013 when they believed they were not heard, and argued that they were often the ones to compromise. One said \u2018I feel that even though I expressed my view it was not respected. Even if I say something, it won't matter\u2019 . Another felt resigned to not being heard ( \u2018I know they won't listen to me, therefore I ask for nothing\u2019 ). Ultimately, the children agreed that whether their opinions were taken into consideration depended to a great extent on their age and the importance of the subject. In relation to school, opinions tended to polarise. On the one hand there was sometimes disappointment and feeling of injustice and anger ( \u2018\u2026because they always believe teachers and not us; students are always punished; our opinion does not count for them.\u2019). On the other, there was joy whenever it seemed teachers took students views into account. There was also respect and recognition of teachers who were close to students and listened to and cared for them. And there were feelings of active participation when students were treated as team members. Ultimately, the children\u2019s attitude and participation in class and at school often depended on the teacher\u2019s attitude ( \u2018If a teacher is indifferent, insults kids, does not teach, children will get used to this. Whereas when a teacher makes the lesson interesting, kids will participate and hold their interest for the following classes.\u2019 Girl, 15) Some of the respondents from SOS Children\u2019s Villages in Croatia claim they are able to participate to a sufficient extent in their community/village/family/home. But other children are more critical, arguing that, for example, house rules are made by the adults, and are not flexible. Or they want to sleep at a friend's place during the weekend, but they cannot, because this is not authorised in their file. In most cases these Croatian children want to participate more in all decisions that affect them, and believe that their opinions should be heard and respected more by the adults. In relation to education, they claim that their participation is adequate and that they have the required support. For them, it is important to have a quiet room for studying to be able to complete their education. They also think it is important that they participate in the selection of their future school, and that the adults should not put too much pressure on them about this, nor should they make decisions instead of the children. In relation to confidentiality, it is important that their personal data are not shared without their consent and that the things which they want to stay private really do stay private. The majority of the participants within the care system claim that all data about them are public, and that too many people know too much information about them. All the young people interviewed by the Somali Development Project (with one exception and one abstention) felt that they have a \u2018voice\u2019, and have rights in the UK previously denied to them in Somalia. They could have opinions and give opinions freely and in a democracy were entitled to be respected for their opinions and had to learn to respect the opinions of others. Girls felt more empowered than boys, even though their culture restricted their rights as a whole. Many girls commented on their freedom in UK and one stated she had no problems wearing her \u2018hijab\u2019. Girls more than boys expressed how school generally, and individual teachers in particular, had supported them to develop their voice. One commented \u2018I learned I had a voice through education and discussions.\u2019 Another said that \u2018Teachers have helped me and encouraged me to develop \u2018my voice.\u2019 ",
        "Evaluation of legislation, policy and practice on child participation in the European Union (EU) March 2015 170 The research by Yohri found that most refugee children - and especially the young ones - felt that in the Netherlands they were listened to attentively by their parents, friends, teachers and COA (Asylum-Seekers Reception Service) employees. The young children especially felt COA helped them well, and they liked the activities and school. However, some of the older children were less satisfied and even angry at their situation (\u2018 The asylum procedure has eaten me alive physically, emotionally and psychologically. They have played and moved me around like a ball.\u2019 ). The fact that they had to live with insecurity about their asylum status and experience lengthy legal procedures made some of them feel as if they were not listened to at all. The different views between age groups may, however, be connected to different understandings of the phrase \u2018listened to\u2019. According to the report, most of the younger children interpreted \u2018listened to\u2019 as meaning that their opinions were heard in class, by COA and they were loved by their parents and friends: people in their close living circle. By contrast, some of the older children explained \u2018listened to\u2019 as not being ignored during the asylum procedures, and being granted the right to stay in the country. ",
        "Evaluation of legislation, policy and practice on child participation in the European Union (EU) March 2015 171 8.0 Children\u2019s views on addressing the barriers to participation Key messages Obstacles encountered by children \uf0b7 Barriers to effective participation were described in terms of personal factors, such as lack of confidence and fear of making the wrong choice (sometimes combined with too wide a range of choices). This lack of capacity was often related to the attitude of adults towards the young and it is important for adults to help children develop maturity and develop decision-making skills (SOS Children\u2019s Villages, Poland). \uf0b7 The negative or indifferent attitudes of adults towards children and young people were thought to be a major factor holding back their participation, although fear of negative peer reactions was also widespread. Some children described how adults often assume they know best, or give tokenistic attention to young people\u2019s views (Off the Record, UK). \uf0b7 Others noted that the interaction with adults is poor; adults sometimes betray children\u2019s trust, and there is lack of a culture of discussion in families and schools (Office of Children\u2019s Ombudsman, Greece). Teachers were not always thought to consider children and young people\u2019s views, but instead to impose their own (Office of Children\u2019s Ombudsperson, Croatia). \uf0b7 Practical barriers were significant. Children and young people described how adults rarely devote sufficient time to listening to them. Language difficulties can undermine self- confidence; sometimes meaning that children cannot say exactly what they want, or can result in their marginalisation. Cultural and religious factors can also hinder participation for some children and young people, particularly girls (Somali Development Group, UK). Living with insecurity (e.g. for migrant and refugee children) can also make participation more uncertain and fragile (Roots, Greece; Yohri, Netherlands). Solutions proposed by children \uf0b7 Factors regarded as critical to improving relations and communication between children and adults included good relationships and trust. For young people in a range of residential settings (in Poland), good relations with carers and trust and time devoted to children were considered key to promoting effective decision making. Similarly, parents should provide children with opportunities to participate from a young age an appropriate environment for this to happen (Greek Children\u2019s Ombudsman). \uf0b7 Young people felt they should be informed about forthcoming decisions a reasonable amount of time in advance, and would also like more opportunities to raise issues directly with decision-makers (Off the Record, UK). They believed that mental health professionals should be provided with specific training on how best to engage young people in their treatment and care, and this should be carried out by young people themselves. \uf0b7 Listening on the part of teachers and other professionals should be improved. Young people thought that support and encouragement was needed from adults (e.g. teachers, other professionals, and parents) to create the conditions for meaningful participation in decision- making (Office of the Children\u2019s Ombudsperson in Croatia). \uf0b7 Teachers should take account of their proposals for improving lessons, and pay particular attention to encouraging all students to express their opinions (Greek Office of the Children\u2019s Ombudsman). It was also proposed that there should be more coverage in the media about events for young people and greater efforts to publicise young people's views. ",
        "Evaluation of legislation, policy and practice on child participation in the European Union (EU) March 2015 172 Children\u2019s experiences of participating in the project \uf0b7 A range of outcomes were reported and/or observed for children who took part in 11 participation projects including: improved self-confidence; greater competence at undertaking research; and enjoyment in self-expression and in debate. Participants showed interest in listening to different experiences from peers, different schools, areas and environments, and showed respect for the opinion and personality of others. Ultimately, they were satisfied at being able to express opinions freely. \uf0b7 There were problems with: lack of motivation among young people; ambivalence about the relevance of \u2018participation\u2019 in situations where basic needs and rights were not felt to be met; lack of time to complete the project effectively; and specific difficulties relating to the methods. \uf0b7 Training was very useful in explaining the concept of \u2018participation\u2019 and its relevance to children and young people. But this understanding was not shared by all groups, particularly when \u2018participation\u2019 seemed a distraction from other everyday concerns. For example, in the Roots project, children in the multicultural school in Athens were keener on practical skills training (e.g. on getting a job to support their families) than on training in participation. \uf0b7 Developing appropriate research tools, particularly on the complex issue of participation, proved difficult for some of the children and young people. In some cases, it was hard to strike an appropriate balance between the need for the projects to respond to the study objectives and the desire to give children autonomy over the issues they wanted to explore. Learning points from undertaking peer research with children \uf0b7 At the outset, children and young people should be provided with full information in an accessible form about any proposed study and the role of a peer researcher. The design of research projects needs to consider carefully the circumstances in which peer-to-peer research may be effective and where it may not. \uf0b7 Appropriate preparation and training is essential for all children and young people who will act as peer researchers. It is important to take time to explore the skills and interests of each individual child and tailoring their involvement in the project accordingly. Effective peer research also requires that a sufficient amount of time is allotted for tasks to be completed, and the \u2018pacing\u2019 of activities must be actively managed and supervised by adult staff throughout the duration of the project. \uf0b7 The environment within which peer research takes place is always critical, and must provide an appropriate setting where the work can be easily conducted in conditions of safety and security for all the children and young people involved. \uf0b7 For peer research to be successful, all adults involved - co-ordinators/organisers/facilitators - need to have an understanding of and commitment to what is involved, the demands that it will place on them and their time, and be flexible enough to respond to all the issues that arise. \uf0b7 The process of peer research becomes more meaningful to children and young people if they can see there is some tangible outcome for their efforts. Children and young people should be supported to overcome their difficulty in making specific and realistic proposals for change. ",
        "Evaluation of legislation, policy and practice on child participation in the European Union (EU) March 2015 173 8.1 Introduction The second of the two chapters presenting the evidence from child-led strand of the evaluation focuses on the obstacles children encounter when attempting to participate, and solutions that children propose to address their lack of participation in different settings and contexts. The chapter concludes by considering the project processes, describing the nature and extent of child participation within the projects, children\u2019s views of their experiences, challenges encountered in the projects, and learning points. 8.2 Obstacles encountered by children Children encounter a range of obstacles when attempting to participate in decision-making, including individual factors, adult attitudes, lack of time, language issues, culture and religion, and lack of security. Many of these were found to be common across a number of the partner projects, even though they took place in very different contexts. Interestingly, only one of the partner reports (SOS Children\u2019s Villages Croatia) mentioned cutbacks as a result of the financial crisis, which had had the effect of limiting young people\u2019s involvement in certain activities. 8.2.1 Individual factors Some of the barriers are a result of personal factors, as the report from SOS Children\u2019s Villages in Poland pointed out. Diffidence and fear of making the wrong choice were suggested by the interviewees as major obstacles children and young people faced when attempting to make decisions. Too wide a range of choices was reported as problematic, with respondents sometimes unable to select between options. The interviewees also emphasised that decision making entails taking responsibility for the choices, which often deters young people from trying. Having said this, some of these factors appear to relate to the attitude of adults towards the young. The report went on to argue that: \u2018It is most important to prepare children for maturity, talk to them and teach the art of making choices, let alone to cultivate good relations between the young and their carers. If a family does not set a good example of discussion, negotiation, or compromise, and the children are not even granted minor influence on daily matters, they will be afraid of taking decisions in future and will not consult the adult.\u2019 In the survey carried out by the Office of the Children\u2019s Ombudsperson in Croatia, \u2018children and young people believed that they themselves, their characters and their traits might just be the biggest obstacle they face when it comes to expressing their opinions and participating in decision making\u2019 . The report went on to suggest that children and young people came to realise some of the main obstacles to their participation were factors such as shyness, timidity, insecurity, lack of motivation, low self-esteem, a lack of information, and ignorance of children's rights. Some of these factors were also central to the particular experience of young people in the research for the Black Young Carers project in the UK. Half the young carers found shyness the main barrier to their participation. Young carers were very clear that they felt unable to talk to adults that they didn\u2019t know and trust. Yet often they had to tell their story to lots of different professionals, such as teachers, youth workers and social workers. One young person felt that every time she talked about her caring responsibilities, she was somehow being disloyal to her parents whom she cares for. ",
        "Evaluation of legislation, policy and practice on child participation in the European Union (EU) March 2015 174 It also appears that young people feel that their age is a barrier in itself ( \u2018No-one cares if you\u2019re under 16\u2019. Girl, 15, UK) This was confirmed by interviewees from SOS Children\u2019s Villages in Poland, who commented that the prevailing opinion was that the older the child or young person was, the more informed their choices would be ( \u2018Age strongly affects our ability to take decisions; the older you are, the more experience you have\u2019. Girl, 15) The report notes that the respondents\u2019 observations refer to the circumstances of foster care, where the residents have to mature fast \u2013 and at the age of 18 they become self-reliant (unless they extend their education) (\u2018 I would like to make my own decisions. I am already old enough, especially that I am in foster care. In the end, we mature faster than in standard families.\u2019 Boy, 16). Nevertheless, it is also important to acknowledge that children develop at different paces, and that age must be set alongside issues of maturity. As the report on the activities with young children at Newstead put it: \u2018On this project some children\u2019s advanced levels of emotional development allowed them to have the assertiveness and articulation to participate, while other children did not have these qualities and thus participated less\u2019 . The reports of SOS Children\u2019s Villages in Poland, and the Office of the Children\u2019s Ombudsperson in Croatia, also both highlighted that children and young people may encounter difficulties in making decisions within peer groups. In these cases, fear more generally or fear of being ridiculed, low status in the group hierarchy and group pressure are major factors deterring young people from expressing their opinions openly. 8.2.2 Adult attitudes One of the most commonly cited barriers to participation was the attitudes of some adults. For example, young people interviewed for the Off the Record report in the UK argued that the negative attitudes of adults were problematic (\u2018 adults assume they know best\u2019 , \u2018lack of respect for young people\u2019, \u2018adults often give token attention, but dismiss young people\u2019s views as trivial\u2019, \u2018when I disagree with something, I may voice my opinion but it can be ignored and the decision is made whether or not I agreed - even if it may sometimes be regarding me\u2019 ). Sometimes too many adults got involved in an issue at the same time, or they did not listen, or they made the wrong assumptions. \u2018Adults are one of the key difficulties young people face in trying to participate, mainly because of negative attitudes adults seem to have about young people and their ability to participate\u2019 . Moreover, not one person asked felt that the mental well-being needs of young people were listened to and understood and comments were overwhelmingly negative here ( \u2018As I have mental health issues, often decisions are made without my input\u2019 ). These young people all had firsthand experience of mental health issues and their responses were therefore based on their experiences of their treatment. The report of the Greek Children\u2019s Ombudsman concurred that a significant obstacle to children\u2019s participation was the negative or indifferent attitude of adults. This can be related to the often poor quality of relationships and / or interactions between children and adults, the ways in which adults sometimes betray children\u2019s trust, and the lack of a culture of discussion in families and schools. SOS Children\u2019s Villages in Poland cited a range of linked factors, such as children\u2019s supposed \u2018inexperience\u2019, the belief that adults always know better, and misunderstandings and poor communication. In the research of the Office of the Children\u2019s Ombudsperson in Croatian schools, it was reported that teachers' indifferent and arrogant attitude, rigid methods and anger may prevent children and young people from expressing their opinions; teachers do not give due consideration to their views, but instead impose their values and force their opinion on students. However, mistrust and fear of negative peer reactions was also a factor. ",
        "Evaluation of legislation, policy and practice on child participation in the European Union (EU) March 2015 175 A more mixed picture was evident among the children from Opatija in Croatia, and opinions appeared to vary according to age. High school students stated that they would like adults to involve them more often in decision-making. Some of them thought that adults were primarily responsible for young people\u2019s non-participation, because they were not interested in their views ( \u2018Adults will not listen to us because they say we have not yet matured\u2019). This then caused apathy among young people who felt that nothing would be achieved by participating. High school students also believed that they could not change the attitudes of adults if the adults themselves could not do so and did not want to. Younger participants were less critical of adults. Children aged 10-13 involved in the Children's City Council thought that adults from the City Council took them seriously. But they were concerned that some adults were not informed about children's issues and didn\u2019t know about their activities. Some also didn\u2019t want to answer questions posed by children during interviews. Responses were more positive among younger children (aged 7-9) who generally felt that parents and teachers did listen to them. However, they also gave some reasons why adults sometimes don't listen to children (\u2018 They don\u2019t listen to us because they are talking on cell phones \u2019; \u2018 My dad doesn\u2019t listen to me because he is constantly on the computer or he goes to play water polo. \u2019). 8.2.3 Other reported barriers 8.2.3.1 Lack of time Lack of time was a barrier repeated in several reports. On the one hand, it was often stated that many young people are overloaded with commitments and studying for school. This interferes with their ability to participate in relevant fora, and when young people want to participate they sometimes don\u2019t have time (Opatija). It was also argued that adults sometimes didn\u2019t or wouldn\u2019t make sufficient time to listen to children ( \u2018parents' weariness, wrong/bad time to have a conversation, lack of time for an easy-going discussion due to parents' work, indifference, power\u2019 , report of Children\u2019s Ombudsman in Greece). Lack of time was a particular concern for young people from the Black Young Carers project in the UK. They had very short amounts of time to themselves and generally they wanted and needed to catch up with their education, and then to be involved in leisure activities with their friends. However many young carers also felt guilty or worried when they were away from the people that they cared for, and this often prevented them from participating in the activities they wanted to. Being out at school all day was a worry for them too and they felt bad about going out later in the day. Time issues are particularly relevant when working with young children, especially because time is a difficult concept for young children to understand. Staff in the Newstead project observed that the children\u2019s level of participation was affected heavily by the time allocated for particular activities. For example, allowing the children to devise the research questions themselves took much longer than the one session that had been allocated for it. Waiting for interviews to take place was also very challenging as the children sometimes lost patience and interest and then didn\u2019t want to participate. 8.2.3.2 Language issues Some projects highlighted the ways in which inability to speak the main language in a particular country impacted negatively on young people\u2019s ability to participate. For example, young people interviewed by the Somali Development Project (UK) cited language barriers as one of the main obstacles they faced. Sometimes, language difficulties both undermined self- confidence and meant that the young person could not express themselves how they wanted. In other cases, it was the parents\u2019 lack of English skills that resulted in the young person missing school in order to support them. ",
        "Evaluation of legislation, policy and practice on child participation in the European Union (EU) March 2015 176 Similarly, young refugees interviewed for the Yohri report (Netherlands) stated that sometimes people didn\u2019t listen to them properly because they did not speak Dutch. But this was not always the case; others said that Dutch nationals did make special allowances in this area (Afghan girl, 13: \u2018Dutch people listen to me very well. For example, they are quiet until you stop speaking.\u2019 ) . The most clear-cut example of how language could either be an obstacle or alternatively a factor that enables participation came from the Roots project in Greece. In the multicultural school, communication amongst everyone participating was a problem. Most children could hardly speak Greek or English, and amongst themselves they spoke different languages. The facilitators and some of the teachers were bilingual (Greek and English) but could not speak any of the children\u2019s languages of origin. Whilst a couple of children refused to speak English and left the group as they felt they were wasting their time, some children found ways to break the language barriers by helping each other. In some cases children asked another child to translate into their native language. They all agreed that helping each other understand made their participation stronger. In contrast, the children from the Filipino community were fluent in three or maybe four languages. They all attended Greek schools and spoke Greek fluently and they were all fluent in English and their parents\u2019 language as well as others. The report on this research commented: \u2018We ended up with a mixture of Greek and English and between them they also used Filipino. We encouraged them to speak whatever language came naturally to them, especially when they had their own groups and the facilitators did not participate. We observed that they used all three languages as a mix. This made their participation fluent since if they did not remember how to say something in one language they immediately said it in another. They even helped the facilitators by translating to us whenever needed. This made everyone in the room, facilitators and children, feel included in the group \u2019. 8.2.3.3 Culture and religion For some partners, the different cultures of the children contributed to a significant communication barrier to their participation. In the Roots project, for instance, due to cultural issues, girls were less eager to speak and participate than boys were. They were more introverted and needed plenty of encouragement from the facilitators to speak up in the group. In the case of the multicultural school, one of the facilitators concluded: \u2018 The two girls coming from countries that have serious social, religious problems, could not understand what it is like living in a democratic state and having the right to life and protection, as they have experienced utter deprivation in their countries. They believed that stating their opinion could get them \u201cin trouble\u201d with the authorities and participating in groups made them \u201ca target\u201d for the authorities or other groups\u2019. When talking about their rights some of the children compared them with their culture: \u2018children\u2019s rights are ok, but in everyday life we find many opposite behaviours\u2019 . A typical example was a girl from India, whose mother was afraid for her safety and did not let her go out of the house without an escort. As a result a teacher escorted her home after school and someone had to also escort her to the afternoon sports activity (basketball practice). The group tried to help her participate when she requested that the project be done at the activity room of their school; all students agreed to her request. ",
        "Evaluation of legislation, policy and practice on child participation in the European Union (EU) March 2015 177 Cultural differences also impacted on children interviewed for the Somali Development Group, who felt that religious and cultural differences prevented them from having a voice. In some cases children stated that parents' lack of understanding about rights in the UK had restricted them as children. Again, boys had more input into decisions than girls \u2013 although ultimately parents made most of the decisions and had the final say. Some children expressed frustration about their lack of involvement in decisions, and one thought that British children are more involved in decision-making within their families. 8.2.3.4 Lack of security Lack of security was mentioned as a significant obstacle in several reports, particularly those of Yohri (Netherlands) and Roots (Greece). The situation of the children from the multicultural school in Athens was particularly worrying, and is symptomatic of a wider issue. According to the Roots report, they had been raised and live now in a very unstable environment. Most of them had arrived in Greece recently after travelling in extremely dangerous and hazardous conditions to get there. Most did not have residence status, making them feel unsafe and insecure about their lives and their futures. They lived in poverty and went to schools that were like prisons. The report concludes: \u2018They are a group of children from different cultures, trying to survive in a completely alien culture to them all, in Greece. They did not seem used to participating in group activities. Additionally participation in discussions seemed like a completely new experience for them. Stating their mind was difficult and expressing themselves seemed like something no one ever asked them to do before.\u2019 The situation of the children from the multicultural school was far more fragile than that of the children from the Filipino community. Even so, it was not easy for the Filipino children to participate in groups with people they didn\u2019t know well. As a result, \u2018they all said that they felt more comfortable to participate in discussion amongst their peers or at home. Within their community they feel safe to be themselves, making participation easy for them.\u2019 8.3 Solutions proposed by children Children and young people proposed a range of solutions to address their lack of participation. These included efforts to improve relations and communication between children and adults; more information and more opportunities to have a say and raise issues directly with decision- makers; more (and better) listening on the part of teachers and other professionals; better publicising of children\u2019s views in the media; and measures to build security for migrants and refugees. Some stated how they thought that relations between adults and children could in general be improved. As the report from Opatija (Croatia) put it, \u2018Children want to be more engaged themselves. They also believe adults should help them in participating, and that children should have more conversations with adults and listen to adults more so the adults will listen to them\u2019. Interestingly, children did not feel that the responsibility for making changes rested solely with adults. Younger children said that \u2018If they behave better towards adults, adults will listen to children more\u2019 . Whilst there may be some truth in this, it is nevertheless important to remember that adults ultimately have more power to both set the framework for family relations and to influence how interactions are negotiated. One might speculate that if children believe they should take more responsibility for \u2018behaving better\u2019; this may in some ways reflect their relative powerlessness vis-\u00e0-vis adults. ",
        "Evaluation of legislation, policy and practice on child participation in the European Union (EU) March 2015 178 Some deeper insights were proposed by the children interviewed in Poland. They identified a range of factors they felt enhanced children\u2019s participation in decision-making, especially in their relations with parents and carers. These included: \u2018In-depth and frank discussions, considering the range of possibilities, compromising, suggesting alternative solutions, devoting time, openness, developing trust, a trusted person, consulting peers, awareness of one\u2019s preference, and appropriate age.\u2019 The report went on to state that young people consider good relations with carers, trust and time devoted to children to be the key factors promoting effective decision making: \u2018A young person treated seriously is self-confident and shows a strong belief in his or her ability to make the right choices. Partnership and mutual respect inculcated in children results in young people with positive self-image and competence to take good decisions.\u2019 The report concludes that communicating openly and volunteering one\u2019s opinions should be appreciated and practiced both by young people and adults: \u2018 To help children in making decisions one should be open, show different solutions, suggest achievable options, and most importantly \u2013 talk to the young a lot.\u2019 (Girl, 15) \u2018I would like adults to know about children\u2019s ideas because we are often right.\u2019 (Girl, 11) \u2018To help children make decisions adults have to talk to them a lot, (\u2026) ask about their passions and interests, and listen.\u2019 (Girl, 15) \u2018I always state whether I like a suggestion or not. If one is not frank, it invites problems.\u2019 (Boy 16) In response to the frustrations about their lack of participation, especially in decisions about their care, young people from the Off the Record group (UK) felt they would like to have more of a say and for their views to be taken seriously. In particular, young people felt they should be informed about upcoming decisions a reasonable amount of time in advance, so they could participate in them. This would enable them to get their points across and have them taken into account. They would also like more opportunities to raise issues directly with decision- makers. One 18 year old, in treatment for mental health issues, felt that many decisions relating to her treatment were made without her input: \u2018I would just like adults to explain (validly) why they are making this decision and for me to have more right to veto so they have to give more consideration.\u2019 More positively, a case study was cited of a young person who was given some responsibility over their own care, which made them more willing to cooperate. As the report put it: \u2018They were not left alone to decide and were given the appropriate support when making the decision. In addition, having the opportunity to make their own decision meant that the young person was aware of what was going on and not left in the dark. Young people feel frustrated by people making decisions for them and not being kept informed; even if a decision must be made in the person\u2019s best interests, this should be fully explained to them which it appears does not happen enough\u2019. As a solution, young people believed that mental health professionals should be provided with specific training on how best to engage young people in their treatment and care; contrary to current training, this should be carried out by young people themselves, drawing upon their own experiences. Finally, it is clear that young people in this project did not feel adults took their views seriously; indeed stereotypes of young people prevented them from expressing their views and being heard. ",
        "Evaluation of legislation, policy and practice on child participation in the European Union (EU) March 2015 179 For the young people from the Black Young Carers project (UK) it became apparent that they really do look to adults outside of their family for support and encouragement. With the exception of one or two, all the young carers seemed to be looking for an adult mentor who they could go to at any time for advice and guidance. They wanted one point of contact who could help them access their needs, be a shoulder to cry on, and advocate on their behalf with other agencies such as schools and social services. The young people in the study by the Greek Children\u2019s Ombudsman provided a range of suggestions for improving participation. In relation to the family, they suggested that parents should give their children opportunities to develop their self-confidence and participate from a young age. Decisions should be \u2018 discussed in a friendly environment, with understanding, reason, conversation, agreement, space and time \u2019. In school, teachers should not only be concerned with the curriculum, the regulations and the timetable, but should also take account of students' proposals for improving lessons and their delivery. They should also pay particular attention to encouraging more reticent students to express their opinions. They also indicated there should be more coverage in the media about events for young people and more opportunities should be given to publicising young people's views. More time should also be provided for initiatives and actions taken by young people. \u2018I think we should participate in various groups and show that we are also active citizens, or participate in social solidarity actions as for example gather clothes, food, medicines for those in need. This is already being done at our school\u2019. (Girl, 15) In Croatia, children and young people surveyed by the Office of the Children\u2019s Ombudsperson suggested several strategies to overcome the obstacles. These included: creating the conditions for meaningful child and youth participation in school decision-making; information- sharing and dialogue between children and adults based on mutual respect; support and encouragement from adults (e.g. teachers and other school-based professionals, parents, decision-makers in education and the society as a whole); acknowledgement of children and young people\u2019s advice and assistance; and teaching adults about children's participation rights. They suggested that students themselves needed to learn to persist in their efforts to exercise their right to participation, and should familiarise themselves with their participation rights. They should also get organised in Student Councils and other student representative bodies ( \u2018Students should organize efforts to make their voices heard\u2019). Some of these conclusions were echoed in the comments of the peer researchers in the SOS Children\u2019s Villages research, also in Croatia. They stated, for example, that \u2018lectures or lessons about children's rights should be conducted in every school, since there are many children who are not familiar with their rights and the protection of these rights.\u2019 The research by Somali Development Group highlighted the importance of living in conditions of security, if children and young people are going to be able to participate effectively. Many children stated that they had a harder life before coming to UK. They commented positively about the availability in the UK of free health care, and girls in particular mentioned the benefits for them of free education. Having said this, in some cases children stated that parents lack of understanding about \u2018rights\u2019 issues in the UK had restricted their participation. One suggestion was for discussion groups or forums to be established so that parents and children could explore these issues together. Although refugee children and young people in the Yohri research also stated that their circumstances were relatively good in the Netherlands - and better than in their own country - most of them lived in fear of being expelled. This undermined the extent to which they felt able to participate in various spheres. Whilst their primary \u2018solution\u2019 was for children to have the right to stay in the Netherlands, they also wanted asylum procedures to be shorter and fairer; and for asylum-seeking children to be treated in a more \u2018friendly\u2019 way. More practically, they proposed improvements in their conditions so they would have better places to live. ",
        "Evaluation of legislation, policy and practice on child participation in the European Union (EU) March 2015 180 The younger refugee children wanted to have the opportunity to participate in more fun activities, like swimming, soccer, games and also more classes. Given the young age of the children involved in the Newstead project, it was not considered realistic that they would themselves propose solutions. But based on the project and children\u2019s reactions to it, staff concluded that a number of changes should be introduced to the functioning of the early years centre. For example, the \u2018Settling In\u2019 information for parents will be amended to reflect the key learning points brought about by the children\u2019s comments with Juliette Bear, and will also include a section for the parents to discuss with their children. Whereas in the past exit interviews with leaving children have been conducted by adults alone, these will now be redesigned so that \u2018the exit interview process from henceforth will belong to the children; they will have the opportunity to make decisions on the location, create the questions, ask the questions, film the interview, and photograph the interviewee\u2019 . It is also intended that a dedicated staff training session will focus on the role and philosophy of the children\u2019s committee. Although these may seem like small-scale changes, together they reflect a subtle change in philosophy towards an approach which is more focused on child participation. 8.4 Intergenerational meetings Bringing children together with adults to engage in dialogue, reflection and inquiry is a central feature of any good participatory process. Following completion of individual project activities, intergenerational meetings were organised in the Netherlands and Greece. In the Netherlands, Yohri prepared their intergenerational meeting at a prior evaluation meeting, where the young researchers learned how to formulate their main findings into key messages, and practised their presentation skills. At the intergenerational meeting, they then presented the research results in their magazine to about 100 professionals from youth care institutions and the municipality of Amsterdam. This was followed by a plenary discussion on the topic of the participation of all children. Since the group felt more at ease on the individual level, they mingled afterwards with attendees to discuss their experiences. Although Yohri did not formally measure these results, the children\u2019s verbal feedback showed that the experience had built their confidence and that the audience were receptive to what they had found. The intergenerational meeting set up by the Children\u2019s Ombudsman in Greece was preceded by a day where 15 young people exchanged views regarding the conclusions of the research and prepared an impressive list of detailed questions. Next day, the intergenerational meeting was attended by 12 young people who had shown particular interest, as well as a range of adults who hold important positions of responsibility regarding decision making on children's issues 513 . 513 Those invited to participate were: the General Secretary for Youth, the General Secretary for Welfare, the Director of Secondary Education of the Ministry of Education, the Head of the National Commission of Human Rights, the Director of the Department of Mental Health and Social Welfare of the Institute of Child Health and the Public Prosecutor of Juveniles in Athens. ",
        "Evaluation of legislation, policy and practice on child participation in the European Union (EU) March 2015 181 During the meeting, the findings from the research by the young people were presented by them, and they had the opportunity to address questions to adults about the ways in which the right to participate was addressed in various fields. The meeting itself was a considerable success, and ideas were developed about further activities. As the final report of the Children\u2019s Ombudsman put it: \u2018The duration scheduled (i.e. two hours) proved to be insufficient as young people wanted to discuss many issues and the adults participating were equally eager and contributed immensely. Young people stated they were satisfied they had been able to communicate with the adults invited to the meetings and understand the way they think and act, depending on the role, the responsibilities and the personality of each one. Furthermore, ideas were exchanged about future activities and cooperation of the agencies aiming to improve the monitoring of welfare institutions, the advancement of children's and young people's access to support services, the support of Roma children's socialisation, etcetera\u2019 . The young people themselves were equally positive about the outcome (see comments in box below): Table 8.1 Outcomes from an intergenerational workshop \u2013 Children\u2019s Ombudsman project, Greece \u2018 Intergenerational communication was of course a bit different than I expected, but still it's the first time for all of us and quite a different experience than the ones in our usual daily routine... I feel genuine joy for the meeting and the discussion with dear friends from the Ombudsman\u2019. \u2018 I would like to express my enthusiasm for this meeting, which really pleased me so much! Apart from meeting new people - which was definitely a very interesting part - and the exchange of views with peers, we had the chance to sit at the same table with adults having important positions relating to children. I was impressed by their willingness (at least of most of them) to listen to our views. I was also surprised by the fact that even though they had a heavy work programme, they dedicated time for us and accepted to listen to us. I believe we needed a lot more time, but again I'm sure lots of positive things came up! I feel very lucky\u2026\u2019. (girl, 15) \u2018 Apart from the fact that I was given the chance to make new acquaintances, we had to confront people older than us and exchange views. I was very much impressed by the willingness of most of them, if not all, to answer our questions and try to help us. I believe this meeting was the first step in order to realise whatever has been discussed previously\u2019 (boy,15).

        "Evaluation of legislation, policy and practice on child participation in the European Union (EU) March 2015 182 8.5 Challenges encountered in the projects While feedback from children and staff was very positive in the majority of the projects, some challenges were encountered. 8.5.1.1 Problems with motivation One challenge mentioned by several projects was the lack of motivation, or sometimes the loss of motivation, of some young people during the project. Off the Record (UK), for example, found it challenging to motivate children and young people to take a lead in the research: \u2018Young people were positively encouraged to take part, but most young people turned this opportunity down.\u2019 In part, this appeared to be due to the project coinciding with the exam season and then the summer holiday period, but the report also suggests it was due to lack of interest too. Whilst this represents the extreme end of the scale among the projects, even those that were very successful in engaging young people noted some level of drop-out. 8.5.1.2 Ambivalence about participation The training most projects ran appears to have been very useful in explaining the concept of \u2018participation\u2019 to children and young people, and its relevance to their lives. But this understanding was not shared by all the groups, particularly when \u2018participation\u2019 seemed a distraction from other pressing everyday concerns. This was most evident among the children in the multicultural school in Athens (Roots, Greece). In the first meeting with the children, they were more eager to participate in a lesson on how to find a job than a discussion where they had to have an opinion and participate. After talking with them the coordinators said they realised that the children and young people wanted the project to change into something more \u2018practical\u2019 for them, and needed some goals in order to have a reason to participate. For some children and young people addressing other more pressing concerns in their lives (e.g. lack of food, security or immigration status) also meant that they had limited interest or time to take part in peer research. The Roots project (Greece) also commented: \u2018the lack of energy from the lack of food led to less active participation as time went by\u2019 . 8.5.1.3 Lack of time A widespread theme coming back from the partner reports was lack of time to carry out the project effectively. Given the considerable time that was required to identify partner organisations and contract them to carry out project activities, many of the projects began too late in the school year (April/May). As a result children and young people had less availability, or had more school commitments that had to take priority over participation in the projects. By the time the exam period was over, they were tired and less willing to take on new activities. Clashes with exams were a key issue, for instance in the UK. \u2018Young people are still learning to manage their time and often take on tasks that they are unable to stick to, despite their best intentions. Their lives are often very chaotic, with volunteering competing for attention with studying and managing friendships\u2019 . They rightly conclude that workers need to be very mindful of this, and explore with young people realistic deadlines, tasks and goals. ",
        "Evaluation of legislation, policy and practice on child participation in the European Union (EU) March 2015 183 8.5.1.4 Issues in the research process A range of issues arose with the research process itself. The children and young people involved had, in the vast majority of cases, no previous experience of carrying out research and were learning new skills as the projects progressed; this made the research process challenging. Developing appropriate research tools, particularly on the complex issue of participation, was difficult for some of the children and young people. In some cases, it was hard to strike an appropriate balance between the need for the projects to respond to the objectives of the overall study and the desire to give children and young people autonomy over the issues they wanted to explore within the given framework. Conducting individual interviews effectively requires skills such as active listening, probing responses, staying focussed on the topic, and ensuring the discussion flows. Even though children and young people were usually able to practice interviewing in the training and workshops provided, it was unsurprising that sometimes they found it hard to stay on track. The report from SOS Children\u2019s Villages in Poland noted that there was a temptation to compare opinions and exchange views, especially when the participants found the issue a strongly emotional one. Focus groups were also challenging to manage and steer. The peer researchers had difficulty coordinating the discussion and allocating the available time fairly among the different thematic areas (Greek Children\u2019s Ombudsman). The researchers also struggled to formulate questions in their own words, based on the interview schedule they had been given beforehand. Some participants found it hard to focus on the subject and quite easily strayed from the question. The settings for interviews and focus groups were appropriate in most, but not all, cases. Yohri (Netherlands) suggested that if they had conducted focus groups in a more formal setting, like a class room or youth club, the young researchers might have been able to secure more interviews. Roots (Greece) had to abandon plans to interview at a Roma camp, when security problems became a concern. They also worked in a multicultural school, where the poor environment created significant psychological stress, and violent and racist incidents were commonplace; this negative climate undoubtedly made it much harder to complete the research. Finally, since peer research was new territory for several of the projects, some staff tended to underestimate at the start the importance of their role and the time they would need to devote to it. In particular, it appears the data analysis and writing up phases were accorded insufficient attention in planning the project. ",
        "Evaluation of legislation, policy and practice on child participation in the European Union (EU) March 2015 184 8.6 Learning points The child participation research undertaken by the partners leads to a range of learning points: \uf0b7 At the outset, children and young people should be provided with full information in an accessible form about any proposed study and the role of a peer researcher . This will enable children to express an informed view on whether they want to take part in the project and to discuss any uncertainties or concerns they may have. A good example was provided by SOS Children\u2019s Villages in Poland, where each local coordinator held a briefing on the project and participation principles, including information about the project objectives, the commitment required, and training and support available. \uf0b7 The design of research projects needs to consider carefully the circumstances in which peer-to-peer research may be effective and where it may not . Projects should make sure that motivation is provided for participants; and that young people find the chosen topic of participation accessible and concrete and relevant to their lives. \uf0b7 Appropriate preparation and training is essential for all children and young people who will act as peer researchers. This should be thorough enough to cover different research methods, skills in conducting interviews, and using media equipment. It should also address the feelings and emotions that children may experience, and pay attention to issues of safety and support. Children should be given the opportunity to practice skills and build their confidence through games and role play. Background information and knowledge about children\u2019s rights should also be included, tailored to the particular topic of the research. The training needs to be appropriate for the age and developmental stage of the children involved. \uf0b7 Peer-to-peer research will benefit from taking time to explore the skills and interests of each individual child and tailoring their involvement in the project accordingly . Whilst some children may be very effective interviewers on a one-to-one basis, others may be better at leading groups, and or carrying out specific tasks associated with the project (e.g. analysing data, taking photos, making posters). Project co-ordinators and organisers need to be sensitive to the potential contributions that each child can make, whilst seeking to ensure personal and skill development for all. \uf0b7 The environment within which peer research takes place is always critical, and must provide an appropriate setting where the work can be easily conducted in conditions of safety and security for all the children and young people involved . This includes addressing issues of access to suitable participants and addressing access and safety concerns. \uf0b7 Effective peer research requires that a sufficient amount of time is allotted for tasks to be completed. The \u2018pacing\u2019 of activities must be actively managed and supervised by adult staff throughout the duration of the project. Peer research projects involving children and young people in formal education should be conducted in the early or middle part of the school year to avoid exam period clashes. \uf0b7 For peer research to be successful, all adults involved - co- ordinators/organisers/facilitators - need to have an understanding of and commitment to what is involved , the demands that it will place on them and their time, and be flexible enough to respond to all the issues that arise. \uf0b7 Quality peer research \u2013 and good research generally - will take account of \u2018equalities\u2019 issues, and the impact of factors such as age, gender, race, disability, and sexual orientation on the research process and findings . ",
        "Evaluation of legislation, policy and practice on child participation in the European Union (EU) March 2015 185 \uf0b7 The process of peer research becomes more meaningful to children and young people if they can see there is some tangible outcome for their efforts . In this study, for example two \u2018intergenerational meetings/workshops\u2019 were set up so that the peer researchers could engage directly with professionals and others who were in a position to make decisions relating to the issues they addressed in their research. Whilst this requires additional preparation on the part of the partners and the peer researchers, their experience suggests that there are significant gains to be made from establishing processes of this kind and they should be replicated. Such meetings should be of sufficient length that issues can be explored fully, and informal and small enough that young people feel able to contribute actively and are not overawed. \uf0b7 Children and young people benefit greatly from extending formal and informal opportunities to get to know each other and exchange views about topics of interest. This was viewed positively by several projects, particularly when children and young people were brought together who would not otherwise meet, either because of their living situation or location. Whilst not the primary objective of peer research, it is often a by-product of it. \uf0b7 The capacity of children to participate in peer research - even those who are very young - is impressive . More than one project noted that peer research can help to foster democratic values in children. \uf0b7 \u2018 Rewards\u2019 can be helpful in encouraging children and young people to complete tasks and to thank them for their participation. An appropriate reward will depend on the particular context of each project. In one project, partners took children on outings of the children\u2019s choice, in other projects they gave children small gifts, such as pens or notebooks. Whatever the approach, rewards tended to be well-received. \uf0b7 Children and young people should be supported to overcome their difficulty in making specific and realistic proposals for change . In the projects undertaken for this study, children and young people were often able to identify problems they faced and were very critical of existing institutions and approaches towards them but less able to suggest solutions. In part, this appears to reflect the fact that although the children and young people in the projects were invited to propose solutions, they did not have any power to implement these. \u2019Imagine\u2019 (the Lennon song) is about peace and dreams. Just imagine if everyone respected children\u2019s rights and if all children had the right to say their opinion and all children could participate, and maybe grownups could listen...\u2019.

        "Evaluation of legislation, policy and practice on child participation in the European Union (EU) March 2015 186 9.0 EU-level actions on child participation, and evidence of their effectiveness Key messages \uf0b7 The Rights of the Child is a relatively \u2018young\u2019 policy area for the European Commission, and embedding child participation has required a perceptual shift and additional resources dedicated to this policy area. The appointment of an EU Coordinator for the Rights of the Child, and the creation of a European Forum for the Rights of the Child were widely viewed to be important measures \uf0b7 The review found a range of EU laws and policies including a focus on the child\u2019s right to be heard. Both the 2006 and 2011 Communications include a specific section on child participation, echoing Article 12 UNCRC. The Commission's 2013 Recommendation on Investing in Children 514 embeds child participation within the Europe 2020 Strategy, albeit without indicators to measure progress. Several pieces of EU legislation also include reference to a child\u2019s right to be heard, including the Brussels IIa Regulation 515 , Dublin II Regulation 516 , Directive 2011/36/EU on preventing and combating trafficking in human beings and protecting its victims 517 , and Directive 2012/29/EU establishing minimum standards on the rights, support and protection of victims of crime 518 . \uf0b7 Beyond legislation, EU institutions have made significant progress in promoting awareness, and are beginning to move towards building up their experience of direct child participation activities. Most examples of child participation activities have taken the form of consultation, through research with children, conferences, and stand-alone participation- focused projects. There is also a growing body of child friendly information available on a range of issues, including active participation. \uf0b7 NGOs and children\u2019s networks play a significant role in driving EU level participation, by facilitating contact with grassroots networks and organisations; advising decision-makers; developing their own models of good practice, and undertaking campaigning and advocacy work. NGOs have also provided an important point of engagement with vulnerable groups of children. \uf0b7 NGOs were mixed in their opinions on how well EU institutions are doing in this area. Most recognised the progress that has been made in establishing an agenda for the Rights of the Child and Article 12. A need was identified to improve channels for cooperation between the European Commission and NGOs, and to make EU policymaking more accessible.

        "Evaluation of legislation, policy and practice on child participation in the European Union (EU) March 2015 187 \uf0b7 Despite these developments, the rights of the child remain significantly overshadowed by EU legislation, policy and programmes in the \u2018youth\u2019 field. This has resulted in some disparities in the support for participation on the basis of age. The 14 to 16 year old age group have benefited to a greater extent than younger children from the significant resources invested in this policy area. 9.1 Introduction This chapter provides an overview of EU-level activities to support child participation. It begins by outlining how key EU institutions have addressed child participation in legislation and policy, including networking and awareness-raising. It highlights examples of child friendly information and participation in practice. The next section evaluates the overall picture of progress in EU institutions, identifying barriers to child participation as well as enablers. This is followed by a specific focus on the role of NGOs as a driver for child participation at the European level. Some of the most promising examples of practice both by EU institutions, and by European level NGOs, are showcased in boxed text throughout the chapter. These cover work to support child participation, in terms of legislation, policy, programmes and projects, as well as direct participation activities. 9.2 Overview of child participation in EU legislation and policy The rights of the child is still a relatively \u201cyoung\u201d policy area for the European Commission, and one which since 2006 has received increasing recognition and begun to progress towards becoming more embedded within policymaking. Child participation, as well as a distinct area of responsibility for a team in the Fundamental Rights and Rights of the Child Unit within the Directorate-General for Justice and Consumers (JUST), it is also a cross-cutting theme for all policy areas, which has been described as \u201c quite a major perceptual shift \u201d 519 for the Directorates-General to take on board. The following subsection explores this process, based on evidence from EU stakeholders, who are officials working for the EU institutions, as well as from wider stakeholders from European level NGOs (see interviewee lists in Annex One). 9.2.1 European Commission policy and EU legislation Major actions undertaken by each of the relevant European Commission Directorates-General are now considered in turn. These include a range of legislation and policy containing either a specific commitment to funding or to activities, or a general commitment to support participation and take account of children\u2019s views. 9.2.1.1 Directorate-General for Justice and Consumers (JUST ) The Directorate-General for Justice and Consumers (JUST) has promoted child participation across the Commission including through inter-service cooperation, as well as developing some key policy documents and legislation. The first official Commission document relating to child participation was the 2006 Communication: \u201cTowards an EU Strategy on the Rights of the Child\u201d. It refers to Article 12 UNCRC and commits to \u201c gradually \u201d including children in all consultations related to their rights and needs. 519 Information collected from EU stakeholder ",
        "Evaluation of legislation, policy and practice on child participation in the European Union (EU) March 2015 188 \"The Commission will promote and strengthen networking and children\u2019s representation in the EU and globally, and it will gradually and formally include them in all consultations and actions related to their rights and needs.\" 520 While the Communication does not focus specifically on child participation, it recognises the need to communicate more effectively with children, which paved the way for increasing child friendly information (as seen below). The Communication is seen by some as \u201ca big step \u201d which \u201c laid down some basic strategy \u201d on child rights and set a mandate for further action on consultation, but also as \u201c too broad and too abstract \u201d. 521 It set in motion inter-service cooperation, created the position of a Commission Coordinator for the rights of the child, and established a European Forum for the Rights of the Child, which has provided an ongoing structure for championing child rights and child participation issues, albeit with relatively little direct involvement of children. The Eurobarometer surveys in 2008 522 and 2009 523 captured the views of 10,000 15 to 18 year olds across all Member States, and found that the greater children\u2019s awareness of their rights, the less satisfied they were about their opportunities to exercise them. A follow up qualitative Eurobarometer in 2010 524 found a need to boost EU action in the areas of bullying, sources of support and vulnerable groups. The results of the Eurobarometer studies have been used to \u201c strengthen the case \u201d for children\u2019s participation with other Directorates-General, and fed into a second Communication from the Commission, the EU Agenda for the Rights of the Child in 2011 (EU stakeholder). Table 9.1 EU institutions practice example: EU Agenda for the Rights of the Child (2011) 525 Referring directly to Article 24 of the Charter on Fundamental Rights 526 , the EU Agenda focuses on \u201ca number of concrete actions in areas where the EU can bring real added value, such as child-friendly justice, protecting children in vulnerable situations and fighting violence against children both inside the European Union and externally.\u201d It aims to reaffirm the commitment of EU institutions and Member States to concrete achievements in protecting children\u2019s rights, and for EU action to be \u201cexemplary\u201d in respecting the rights of children set out in the Charter and the UNCRC. There is a section promoting further action on child participation and awareness raising activities, with an explicit focus on the need to consult and \u201clisten to children\u201d. \u201cFull recognition of the rights of the child means that children must be given a chance to voice their opinions and participate in the making of decisions that affect them. Article 24(1) of the Charter requires the EU to take children's views into considerations on matters which concern them in accordance with their age and maturity.\u201d 520 4.7.2006 Communication Towards an EU Strategy on the Rights of the Child.

        "Evaluation of legislation, policy and practice on child participation in the European Union (EU) March 2015 189 The EU Agenda for the Rights of the Child is seen as having provided a more tangible basis for action than its predecessor. Inter-service coordination has contributed towards key pieces of recent legislation (described below), including those relating to victims of trafficking, victims of crime, and the Dublin Regulation in relation to asylum applications, as well as the Recommendation \u201cInvesting in Children - breaking the cycle of disadvantage\u201d 527 . The Directorate-General for Justice and Consumers (JUST) has pushed hard to include more of an emphasis on children\u2019s perspectives and their right to be heard under Article 12: \u201cA lot of this is attributable to the work of the [Fundamental rights and rights of the child] Unit \u2026 the daily bilateral contact with inter-service staff\u2026 emphasising the Charter of Fundamental Rights, Article 24 and CRC. The Charter can be used as an entry point to CRC, which all Member States have ratified.\u201d (EU Stakeholder) EU stakeholders generally thought that the level of coordination within the European Commission had improved in recent years with regard to children\u2019s rights more widely, and child participation issues specifically. An expert meeting relating to the Dublin Regulation (No 604/2013) 528 was given as an example, although involvement from NGOs that represent children does not necessarily mean involvement of children themselves. \u201cSlowly but surely we are getting results\u2026 other Directorates-General are coming to the [Fundamental rights and rights of the child] unit as a source of expertise, behind the scenes. [\u2026] NGOs and international organisation contributed to policy discussions on the child's right to be heard. And encouraging directorates to speak with NGOs that do represent children is a big step\u201d. (EU Stakeholder) There were a range of views from wider NGO stakeholders, including a call for a greater focus on the exchange of good practice, and bringing practitioners together. Some were more critical about how well the inter-institutional aspect of the Commission works in relation to child participation: \u201cThere is not enough exchange between the European Commission initiatives and those of the European Parliament. And even less with the Member States.\u201d (NGO representative) Some NGO stakeholders praised the efforts of the unit (see below on cooperation with NGOs); while another suggested that the scale of influence could have been greater if situated in the context of social exclusion work in the Directorate-General for Employment, Social Affairs and Inclusion (EMPL). One described the European Forum for the Rights of the Child as a useful platform, for example, in 2012 and 2013 when it looked at child protection systems, with participation emerging as a particular theme from the debate. Another portrayed the Forum as a missed opportunity to listen to children\u2019s views on matters affecting them. \u201cThe EU institutions should be an example. At the annual Forum on the Rights of Children\u2026 it is always quite disappointing because there is not any child participation. It needs a process to feed in children and young people\u2019s views.

        "Evaluation of legislation, policy and practice on child participation in the European Union (EU) March 2015 190 The participation of individual children in settings such as criminal proceedings, trafficking and asylum has been included in key recent legislation. Extensive provisions are made for children who are victims of crime, including specific guidance on the right to be heard, in the 2012 Directive \u201cestablishing minimum standards on the rights, support and protection of victims of crime\u201d 529 Article 1 sets out its primary objective, to enable individual children to participate, by promoting a child sensitive approach, and Article 10 contains the right to be heard. Article 1: \u201cThe purpose of this Directive is to ensure that victims of crime receive appropriate information, support and protection and are able to participate in criminal proceedings. [\u2026] A child-sensitive approach, taking due account of the child's age, maturity, views, needs and concerns, shall prevail.\u201d Article 10: \u201cMember States shall ensure that victims may be heard during criminal proceedings and may provide evidence. Where a child victim is to be heard, due account shall be taken of the child's age and maturity.\u201d The Brussels II Regulation 530 also includes key provisions on the child's right to be heard. The current review of Brussels II is likely to lead to a strengthening of those provisions. Child participation has featured in a number of the more recent studies commissioned by the European Commission, including the emphasis placed on child participation in the current study. The \u2018Study to collect data on children's involvement in criminal, civil and administrative judicial proceedings\u2019 531 had \u201ca big focus on children\u2019s rights to be heard\u2026 it will be shining the spotlight on the data gaps, the legislation gaps, and the policy gaps\u2026 raising the bar, Europe- wide\u201d , which is where there should be real added value from the involvement of the Directorate-General for Justice and Consumers (JUST). Many of the indicators developed through the study are aspirational in nature (especially outcome indicators which need to reflect the outcomes for children), and will challenge Member States to report against them. It is hoped that this will ensure greater transparency. The EU\u2019s competencies mean that it cannot dictate about child participation to national, regional and local level authorities, but it has some leverage in terms of deciding the priorities for funding programmes, such as ESF and other structural funds. Through the Rights, Equality and Citizenship Programme (formerly the Fundamental Rights and Citizenship Programme and the Daphne III Programme) the Directorate-General for Justice and Consumers (JUST) has funded several examples of participation mentioned in this chapter. It has also sought to ensure the implementation of Article 12 is embedded in all rights of the child projects, e.g. on capacity-building for practitioners. Priorities set on projects on violence against children seek to ensure the involvement of children, so that projects are implemented with children, not only for children. Feedback from European NGOs suggested that this is \u201c very, very competitive, so tends to go to bigger institutions and universities, rather than children and young people led NGOs\u201d .

Projects highlighted by stakeholders as examples of the EC promoting participation through the FRC funding programme include the Children\u2019s Rights for All project 532 run by Inclusion Europe, which develops support mechanisms to increase the participation of children with intellectual disabilities in decision-making, school or leisure activities. Beat Bullying 533 , is delivering a European project, funded by the Directorate-General for Justice and Consumers (JUST) through Daphne, with six countries, offering mentoring and counselling in schools and youth groups, and online. School aged children complete two days training in schools then run the peer mentoring service in schools, and they can also mentor other young people on the project social network. They promote \u201c digital citizenship\u201d: \u201cWe promote it as a voluntary opportunity and personal development opportunity. We use the term social action, to mean a sense of being able to change their environment and their world.\u201d (NGO stakeholder) 9.2.1.2 Directorate-General for Education and Culture (EAC) The Youth policy and programme Unit in the Directorate-General for Education and Culture (EAC) is responsible for the implementation of the EU Youth Strategy (2010-2018) as well as for the implementation of the non-formal and informal learning opportunities in the field of youth in the new Erasmus+ programme (2014 \u2013 2020) and in its predecessor the Youth in Action programme (2007-2013). The EU Youth Strategy identifies Youth Participation as a field of action, with a focus on democratic life, such as voting for EP elections, and on civil society. 534 A key action is the Structured Dialogue 535 involving consultations with young people and youth organisations at all levels in Member States, and at EU Youth Conferences organised by the Presidency countries to gather feedback on the identified priority (see boxed text example below). Within the framework of the EU Youth Strategy, European Youth Weeks are organised every 18 months or 2 years and include a broad range of events and activities targeting and involving youth. A recent Study on Youth Participation in Democratic Life 536 aimed to look at the strengths and weaknesses of youth participation, to formulate policy recommendations to enhance participation. A number of methods were used to engage young people aged 13 to 30 in the study, including a Facebook group. A key conclusion from the study is that young people are willing to participate but the lack of availability of tools and systems can serve as barriers.

        "Evaluation of legislation, policy and practice on child participation in the European Union (EU) March 2015 192 The Youth in Action programme supported young people\u2019s projects mostly for the 15+ age group, which is seen as having a positive impact (see also example of Children\u2019s Voices Against Poverty in section below): \u201cThe focus is on including as many young people as possible to feel part of something bigger, the European platform. Even if they are not heard at a national level, they can be heard on the European level. This is bottom-up and very empowering. 538 . (European NGO stakeholder) European NGO stakeholders have suggested widening the target age range to provide funding similar to Youth in Action for younger children\u2019s participation activities, which is harder to find. There is a reported need to more closely align policies and programmes for children with those for youth. The new Erasmus+ programme will continue to support the successful formats of activities from the past and has widened the age range for eligible participants in order to allow the participation of young people from 13 years onwards. 9.2.1.3 Directorate-General for Employment, Social Affairs and Inclusion (EMPL) The Directorate of Social Policy Europe 2020 drafted the Recommendation \u201cInvesting in Children - breaking the cycle of disadvantage\u201d, adopted in February 2013 as part of the Social Investment Package, which proposes a long-term social strategy to help overcome the current crisis and to strengthen the capacity of individuals. One pillar of the Recommendation deals with children\u2019s rights and specifically the right to participate 539 . This calls on Member States to step up their activity on participation, by putting in place mechanisms that promote children\u2019s participation in decision making that affects their lives. Stakeholders reported some disappointment that participation is the only one of the three key themes not to have a corresponding set of indicators. The wording goes further than much legislation nevertheless: Table 9.3 EU institutions good practice example: Recommendation \u201cInvesting in Children - breaking the cycle of disadvantage\u201d (2013) 540 \u201cEnable and encourage children to express informed views, ensuring that those views are given due weight and are reflected in the main decisions affecting them: \uf0b7 Use and further develop existing tools to involve children in the running of services such as care, healthcare and education, as well as to consult them on relevant policy planning through mechanisms adapted to their age; \uf0b7 Support the involvement of all children in existing participation structures; reach out to and support the participation of children from disadvantaged backgrounds; \uf0b7 Encourage professionals working with and for children to actively involve them, raising awareness of related rights and obligations; \uf0b7 Implement the child\u2019s right to be heard in all justice-related decisions and promote child- friendly justice, in particular by giving children effective access to court and judicial proceedings.\u201d A European NGO stakeholder described the Recommendation as a \u201c departure for the EU \u201d in terms of recognising the problem of child poverty, and from a rights perspective. It addresses the right to education and the right to access to support for children in care or coming from care, which is reported to be the first time that this target group have been mentioned. It was highlighted as an example of strong partnership with child rights NGOs. 538 http://ec.europa.eu/youth/index_en.htm 539 http://ec.europa.eu/social/main.jsp?catId=1060&langId=en 540 http://europa.eu/epic/about/index_en.htm ",
        "Evaluation of legislation, policy and practice on child participation in the European Union (EU) March 2015 193 \u201cWe\u2019ll see how it\u2019s adopted at national level. Nothing major has come of it. But it\u2019s about principles and ideals, a real boost for organisations advocating at an international level. It highlights the good partnership between [NGOs] and rights platforms in Europe \u2026 It\u2019s not about participation per se, although it is an element, but it is what underlines participation.\u201d (NGO representative) As EU stakeholders begin to build up experience of this area, many lack confidence and are wary of tokenistic attempts. When asked for examples of relevant work, stakeholders cite examples of participation in activities in different sectors such as sport, recreation and cultural activities, which have no links to decision-making. They also point to generic work on children and young people, which does not include any child participation, suggesting limited understanding of what is meant by the term. In developing the Recommendation, the unit themselves have not involved children directly, and as the bulk of their work has been more traditionally focused on work, employment, welfare benefits, this is a new angle for the Directorate-General for Employment, Social Affairs and Inclusion (EMPL), who commented that they were \u201cnot sure active participation fits with the work we do\u201d. There is some evidence of some related work, such as involving children in a Presidency conference in 2012, although stakeholders recognise that this was \u201c symbolic \u201d as it was a high level meeting so not realistic for children to be actively involved. 9.2.1.4 Directorate-General for Migration and Home Affairs (HOME) Stakeholders generally consider that awareness of the rights of the child and levels of interest in child participation are strong in EU legislation pertaining to asylum, migratin and home affairs. For example, the Directive (2013/33/EU) \u201claying down standards for the reception of applicants for international protection\u201d emphasises the need to act in the best interests of the child. According to Article 23, Member States should assess these, taking \u201c due account\u201d of four factors including \u201c the views of the minor in accordance with his or her age and maturity.\u201d 541 The same wording about assessing a child\u2019s best interests is included in Article 6 on \u201c Guarantees for minors \u201d, within the recent Dublin Regulation (No 604/2013) 542 . The Directive \u201c on preventing and combating trafficking in human beings and protecting its victims\u201d, pays particular attention to the child\u2019s best interests, \u201cin accordance with the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union and the 1989 United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child\u201d. When assisting child victims, Member States should take \"due account of the child\u2019s views, needs and concerns with a view to finding a durable solution for the child.\" They should adopt a child-rights approach in initiatives to strengthen policy to prevent trafficking, including research, information, awareness-raising and education (Directive 2011/36/EU). 543 541 DIRECTIVE 2013/33/EU OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL of 26 June 2013 laying down standards for the reception of applicants for international protection (recast).

        "Evaluation of legislation, policy and practice on child participation in the European Union (EU) March 2015 194 The Child Sexual Abuse and Exploitation Directive, adopted in December 2011 includes provisions on protection of children, on the rights of children to be provided with appropriate support, counselling and treatment (during court proceedings), as well as awareness-raising. It for example requires that the specific actions to assist and support child victims in enjoying their rights under this Directive are undertaken following an individual assessment of the special circumstances of each particular child victim, taking due account of the child\u2019s views, needs and concerns. (Art 19.3). Article 20.3 also sets standards for interviews with a child in criminal porcedings to ensure that the child's right to be heard can be exercised in the best possible way: a) interviews with the child victim take place without unjustified delay after the facts have been reported to the competent authorities; b) interviews with the child victim take place, where necessary, in premises designed or adapted for this purpose; c) interviews with the child victim are carried out by or through professionals trained for this purpose; d) the same persons, if possible and where appropriate, conduct all interviews with the child victim; e) the number of interviews is as limited as possible and interviews are carried out only where strictly necessary for the purpose of criminal investigations and proceedings; f) the child victim may be accompanied by his or her legal representative or, where appropriate, by an adult of his or her choice, unless a reasoned decision has been made to the contrary in respect of that person. DG HOME closely monitors the implementation by Member States of their obligations under the directive. 9.2.1.5 Directorate-General for the Environment (ENV) The Directorate-General for the Environment (ENV) is not represented in the inter-service group at the Commission, and an EU stakeholder commented that although a lot of their legislation takes account of children\u2019s needs, children and particularly children\u2019s participation, are rarely named in legislation, especially older legislation. They publish a lot of information for children on recycling and cartoons (see below), although the relevance of this to child participation is limited. There was consultation on social justice and the environment in 2013, which the Directorate-General for Justice and Consumers (JUST) was supporting, in which they aimed to get children onto the agenda. 9.2.1.6 Directorate-General for Health and Food Safety (SANTE) A recent proposal (2012/0192) for a new regulation on clinical trials emphasises the need to adapt the consent procedure to the age and maturity of children. Article 31 sets out special conditions for clinical trials on minors which as well as asking for a legal representative, include the following: \u201c(b) the minor has received all relevant information in a way adapted to his or her age and maturity, from professionals trained or experienced in working with children, regarding the trial, the risks and the benefits; (c) the explicit wish of a minor who is capable of forming an opinion and assessing this information to refuse participation in, or to be withdrawn from, the clinical trial at any time, is duly taken into consideration by the investigator in accordance with his or her age and maturity.\u201d; 544 544 2012/0192 (COD) Proposal for a REGULATION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL on clinical trials on medicinal products for human use, and repealing Directive 2001/20/EC.

The Commission's work on mental health has focused on children as a theme, and parents and teachers are a target for information and consultation together with children\". 9.2.1.7 Directorate-General for Communications Networks, Content and Technology (CNECT) The Digital Agenda for Europe 545 is a flagship initiative under Europe 2020, the EU's strategy to deliver smart sustainable and inclusive growth. As part of the Digital Agenda, the Commission published a Communication 546 outlining a European Strategy for a Better Internet for Children The strategy proposes a series of actions grouped around the following main goals: stimulate the production of creative and educational online content for children as well as promoting positive online experiences for young children; scaling up awareness and empowerment including teaching of digital literacy and online safety in all EU schools; create a safe environment for children through age-appropriate privacy settings, wider use of parental controls and age rating and content classification; and combat child sexual abuse material online and child sexual exploitation. The Commission works with Member States, industry and civil society to implement this strategy, in particular the Safer Internet Programme 547 aims to empower and protect children online, by setting up Safer Internet information Centres, comprising awareness centres, helplines and hotlines (to report child abuse material). The SICs work with national youth panels whose representatives then take an active part in the annual Safer Internet Forum meeting (see below), which are run by European Schoolnet. 9.2.1.8 Commission Representations in the Member States An important role of the Commission Representations is to engage with citizens directly in each Member State, and to inform them about the role of the EU, with children and young people, sometimes described as a main target group. The Commission Representation in France has communications staff who have regular contacts and established partnerships with youth organisations, including youth councils, and they suggest that other Representations have staff who focus only on working with children and young people. Contact with children and young people undertaken by EC Representations is often via schools and a range of initiatives, some of which offer opportunities for child participation. Activities include resources such as a million \u201c Passports to the EU \u201d given to children, schools competitions and role play sessions. EC Representations across Europe are involved in \u2018Citizens\u2019 Dialogues\u2019, where children come to talk to a Commission representative, with two organisations, Bite the Ballot and EUouth. The Back to School programme involves European civil servants returning often to their own school, to answer children\u2019s questions, and listen to their views. In the UK, 30 schools work with classes in preparation for a popular \u201cMock Council of Ministers\u201d, where two representatives from each school take on the roles of different Member States, in an initiative run with the British Council. An adult representative from the initiative reported that: \u201c\u2026everyone raves about it who takes part. And there\u2019s a spin-off effect. There may be 60 people taking part but two or three times that many are involved in discussions so it has a wider impact. \u201d 545 http://ec.europa.eu/digital-agenda/ 546 European Strategy for a Better Internet for Children, Communication from the Commission to the European Parliament, the Council, the European Economic and Social Committee and the Commitee of the Regions - COM(2012) 196 final.

Stakeholders working for the Representations understood their role as promoting \u201c Participation through different sectors in society- healthcare, education, rights \u201d (EU official) through EU awareness activities, events, school visits and publications aimed at children. The EC Representation in Romania undertook 93 school visits for the \u201cEurope, Our Home\u201d campaign, part of the European Year of Citizens, informing more than 2700 pupils and 100 teachers on European issues in the first semester of 2013. The campaign received 3726 different visitors to its website 548 and 1375 likes on Facebook during this period, as well as 60 local press items about the school visits. One official argued that the Representations\u2019 work to inform children about the EU could support any potential participation opportunities, in the same way as other \u2018child friendly information\u2019. A further official referred to games, quizzes and competitions explicitly aiming to inform children about how to exercise their rights. \u201cIt depends if you take a narrow view of participation or a bigger view. We do lots of work helping young people to engage with the EU, so we\u2019re not saying \u2018what do you think?\u2019, but we\u2019re preparing them for when they do want to engage, so they know what they are engaging with\u2026 Participation is not our remit, but we do the groundwork, getting children ready so they know what to do when they are asked to participate .\u201d (EU stakeholder) Only eight of the 28 Representations agreed to contribute to the study (BG, FI, FR, MT, NL, RO, SK, and UK), and several more responded that they lacked the relevant knowledge and information required to answer the questions about child participation practice by the Representations and other EU institutions. 549 One passed it on to a national children\u2019s network to complete. This evidence supports the finding that there is a low level of awareness of child participation among some EU stakeholders. 9.2.2 Policies of other EU institutions 9.2.2.1 European Parliament EU stakeholders reported that the European Parliament is seen to be doing a lot of work in terms of being \u201copen\u201d to groups of children to attend certain meetings, although the level of child participation is unclear. One example is \u201cThe Pirate Party\u201d, involving children and young people from different Member States.

        "Evaluation of legislation, policy and practice on child participation in the European Union (EU) March 2015 197 9.2.2.2 Committee of the Regions (CoR) The Committee of the Regions (CoR) undertakes some work relating to children\u2019s rights more widely, although there was little evidence reported of addressing child participation per se. One of the commitments of the CoR is to mainstream child rights in all activities, and it has an annual dialogue with the Fundamental Rights Agency. The CoR have published some opinions on child rights, for example, at the 20th Anniversary of the Convention of the Rights of the Child in 2009 there was a meeting specifically focused on child rights. 550 In 2010, the COR issued an opinion (2010/C 267/10) on the Rights of the Child recommending that: \u201c Local and Regional Authorities fully exploit existing structures facilitating cooperation and the exchange of best practice in the field of the rights of the child. In this respect, innovative measures to promote cooperation and more effective partnerships between LRAs across different EU Member States should be supported at European level\u2019 . 551 This particular opinion was led by the Commission for Citizenship, Governance, Institutional and External Affairs (CIVEX), which sits with COR, and covers child rights, alongside justice, home affairs and fundamental rights. One of it\u2019s members is a special correspondent for children. More recently, CIVEX underlined the importance of consistently observing the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child with regard to the reception of asylum-seekers, refugees, migrants and unaccompanied child refugees (Opinion issued on 3-4 December on the efforts to promote genuine solidarity on a real European migration policy). 552 CIVEX have also held roundtable discussions with UNICEF on Child Friendly Cities 553 , as well as conducting study visits in a range of relevant areas (such as the right to education from early childhood 554 ). 9.2.2.3 European Economic and Social Committee (EESC) The EESC adopted an opinion on the EU Agenda for the Rights of the Child in 2012, supporting the work of the Commission regarding child participation: \u201cProper participation by children in the preparation of decisions concerning them and in the evaluation of programmes is necessary; it would also be useful to measure their satisfaction and evaluate their opinions.

        "Evaluation of legislation, policy and practice on child participation in the European Union (EU) March 2015 198 In the daily work of the EESC, other relevant examples of work concern youth participation (in this case, the focus was on secondary schools, ages 15-18) and a recent event run by Europe Integration Forum on the integration of migrant children, 556 which produced a summary report. 557 The new president of the committee asked young people for ideas of what topics should be the focus of his new mandate. This was done by consulting with schools. 9.2.3 EU Agencies 9.2.3.1 Fundamental Rights Agency The Fundamental Rights Agency (FRA) of the EU have done a mapping of regulations on ethical approval, relevant authorities and informed consent for involving children, across ten EU Member States, in order to facilitate child participation work by other teams within the FRA and the results are available online 558 . In 2013 and 2014 FRA interviewed children in nine Member States on their experience of the justice system. The research results will be published in 2015. 9.2.4 Participation in practice at EU level 9.2.4.1 Types of participation and child-friendly information Similarly to the approach taken in the mapping of activity at a country level, EU level actions have been identified and grouped into different types of participation drawing upon the guidance developed by Lansdown (2011): consultation, collaboration and child-led activity. However, in looking at EU level activity, an additional category of activity was also commonly found. Specifically the mapping exercise and stakeholder interviews have highlighted a wide range of awareness raising and information giving activities undertaken by the European Commission, characterised by the provision of child-friendly information. Reflecting on the available literature, this activity is not directly child participation. However it does reflect an aspect of participation in General Comment 12 of the Committee on the Rights of a Child 559 which defines participation as a process which includes information sharing, so we examine this activity here. 9.2.4.2 Child-friendly information from EU institutions The following table highlights examples of child-friendly information, which are explored further in the subsection below. Two categories of this type of activity emerged: child-friendly information to help children and young people understand what participation is and how they can get involved; or to raise awareness about EU citizenship more generally. In this sense it can be viewed as a mechanism that potentially facilitates the process of participation across other levels (consultation, collaboration and child-led). Most common, however, was the provision of child friendly information which appeared to serve the sole purpose of raising awareness in relation to specific themes such as health or environment. 556 http://www.eesc.europa.eu/?i=portal.en.events-and-activities-european-integration-forum-9 557 http://ec.europa.eu/ewsi/UDRW/images/items/static_38_194129951.pdf 558 http://fra.europa.eu/en/news/2014/looking-how-eu-member-states-involve-children-research 559 UN Committee on the Rights of the Child's General Comment No 12 (2009) on the right of the child to be heard.

        "Evaluation of legislation, policy and practice on child participation in the European Union (EU) March 2015 200 Figure 9.1 Screen shot from Kids Corner website A part of the portal is the website on the rights of the child, , with content split into age categories for the 0-12 and 13-18 age groups, for which they have received positive feedback from child participation academics and from children themselves. The website also included some child- friendly summaries of EU legislation. An EU stakeholder commented that some of the child friendly content on such sites has been too static and has not been updated on a regular basis, and that whilst the intentions were positive, the content was too general to meaningfully engage children. It was acknowledged that more needs to be done to engage with children via social media and mobile technologies, but the European Commission has not had the resources for this work. A popular approach to raising awareness, is websites aimed specifically at children, many of which have been collated on the Kids Corner web page. Views from NGO stakeholders were mixed: \u201cThe European Commission has recognised its vital role in making EU-related information child-friendly and accessible and has made considerable steps in that direction. Kids\u2019 Corner is a platform that shows great promise and would be extremely beneficial if it gets widely popularized and spread around more topics and ways to share or create content. EU institutions should step beyond access to information \u2013 information is crucial for meaningful child participation, but is just the beginning.\u201d (NGO representative) \u201cIf a child sees infantile pictures, this is not appropriate. And the website needs to be monitored\u2026 does it help? Is it used? [Child participation] needs to be implemented in local surroundings by NGOs who work with those children, not by putting EU legislation in child language\u201d (NGO representative) Common across these websites is a colourful design and use of illustrations that would be attractive to children. The information is provided in a format that is intended to be easy to understand and there are often interactive elements in the form of educational games. On a similar theme and often accessible through these child friendly websites, are a range of publications targeted specifically at children. Similar to the websites, they seek to provide information to children about a range of issues from general information about the EU and its institutions to specific issues such as healthy eating in a format and design that is accessible and attractive to children.

        "Evaluation of legislation, policy and practice on child participation in the European Union (EU) March 2015 201 Figure 9.2 Examples of publications targeted at children Produced by the Directorate-General for Communication (COMM), the Let's Explore Europe booklet is aimed at 9 to 12 year olds, gives an overview of Europe and explains briefly what the European Union is and how it works. It is available as an online publication and in hard copy. A Directorate-General Energy story book published in 2005 about climate change. Other examples include providing EU legislation in an easy to read format and language 562 . The Commission has produced a range of easy to read versions of legislation across a range of policy areas including human rights, education, training, youth and sport; culture; and environment. These versions are not, however, specifically targeted at children. \uf0b7 The use of other media formats for providing information are also evident as potential ways to deliver child friendly information. Examples of animation and short films were found as a way to deliver information to children: \uf0b7 Directorate-General for the Environment (ENV) \u2013 \u201c Tommy and Rosy\u201d : A short animated film that uses cartoon characters to focus on how to respect the environment as well as each other 563 . \uf0b7 European Parliament (EuroParl TV): A series of online DVDs about different aspects of the European Commission and issues that affect young people 564 . A key issue of these materials is the extent to which they are directly promoted to children or specifically how their existence is made known to ensure children are able to benefit. One route used commonly is to provide child friendly materials to teachers or other professionals who work with children to use as resources, for example: \uf0b7 Directorate-General for Health and Food Safety (SANTEO) \u2013 Consumer classrooms: Child friendly materials on consumer issues for use with children e.g. quizzes, lesson plans with separate materials for children aged 12 to 14 and 15 to 18 565 are available for teachers through this website. \uf0b7 Europa \u2013 Teachers' Corner - This website specifically brings together material produced by various EU institutions in order to help children learn about the European Union and its policies. Resources are available for teachers of different age groups of children, specifically under 9, 9-12, 12-15 and 15+ years. \uf0b7 Directorate-General for the Environment (ENV): Teaching notes provided for all the online stories disseminated by the Directorate-General for the Environment (ENV). 566 562 http://europa.eu/legislation_summaries/index_en.htm 563 http://tommy-rosy.eu/ 564 http://www.europarltv.europa.eu/en/young-parliament/backstage.aspx 565 http://www.consumerclassroom.eu/ 566 http://ec.europa.eu/environment/pubs/children/children.htm ",
        "Evaluation of legislation, policy and practice on child participation in the European Union (EU) March 2015 202 In other cases, materials are available to support a wider initiative. The Tasty Bunch website launched by the Directorate-General for Agriculture and Rural Development (AGRI) in 2011 was part of a wider campaign to support healthy lifestyles amongst children. An accompanying road-show toured schools across several Member States. The extent to which children themselves have (if any) input in their design and development of any of these materials and activities was not clear. Interviews with staff from the units that host and promote these websites and publications have explored this and in some cases suggested that children\u2019s involvement has been informal and ad hoc, for example, children of staff working in the relevant units have given feedback on materials. This was the case for the Tom and Lila series, a series of books produced by the Directorate-General for the Environment (ENV). For the materials aimed at 15-17 year olds on Climate Change, there was limited child involvement in design and production. Instead, Geography teachers at European schools in Brussels were contacted to ask for feedback on a previous publication and how this could be updated; although the intention was to involve some children from these schools once specific content is being designed (this project is currently on hold because they were in between contracts with publications contractors). This example seems typical of the approach, as teachers are targeted to assess likely content/uptake rather than children themselves. The decision to target children seems relatively ad hoc too, and there is no ring-fenced budget for child-friendly publications within the Directorate-General for the Environment (ENV). In the past, other communications activity has had a focus on children which was acknowledged as been due to the personal interest/priorities of Commissioner Wallstrom (2000-2004) who was very keen to have children\u2019s involvement in Green Week, an annual awareness raising communication initiative. Typically activities included art competitions/poster competitions and winners attended Green Week conference to receive prizes. \u201cChildren were pushed to the side\u2026 Every year we look ourselves at priorities and audiences that need to be targeted\u2026 I try to do something each year linked to kids but this year it hasn\u2019t been possible due to being between contracts and as we wanted to see if the App took off.\u201d (Directorate-General for the Environment (ENV)) Measuring impact of child friendly materials is most often in terms of demand. Continued high demand for the Tom and Lila books and other child-friendly materials is perceived as evidence of their success. The number of languages in which materials are available is seen as influencing the demand, in the experience of the Directorate-General for the Environment (ENV). 9.2.4.3 Consultation by EU institutions Looking at potentially higher levels of participation, the mapping of EU activity found examples of individual services undertaking consultation exercises with children. These have included both time limited research exercises to gather children\u2019s views on specific issues as well as general calls to feedback views through websites. Examples of both types of consultations are in the table below. What is less clear from the mapping exercise to date is the extent to which this consultation is a two-way process. There is little evidence of any feedback of the results being given to the children that were involved in the consultations. It should be noted that consultations with children must conform to the National Code of Conduct Practice and other relevant national legislation regarding informed consent and confidentiality. For example, Eurobarometer opinion polls are carried out in accordance with the ESOMAR guidelines 567 . 567 The guidelines do not impose a de facto minimum age restriction for opinion polling, but they do set out principles to ensure that high ethical standards are upheld; that interviewing is appropriate to the ages and cognitive abilities of ",

        "Evaluation of legislation, policy and practice on child participation in the European Union (EU) March 2015 205 9.2.4.4 Collaboration activities by EU institutions There is some evidence of collaborative exercises amongst the participation-related activities delivered by or on behalf of EU institutions. Looking at the different stages of the policy/programme cycle, the collaborative activity at EU level was characterised most commonly as children being involved in the feeding back of results. The most common way this was delivered was the involvement of children in a final conference or seminar presenting the results of a project. In other examples, the specific role children played was sometimes difficult to establish to accurately identify the specific stage and contribution they made. For example, the Directorate-General of Employment, Social Affairs and Inclusion (EMPL) involved children alongside other stakeholders in several meetings/workshops undertaken as part of the process to design the fifth pillar of the Recommendation on \u201cInvesting in Children: breaking the cycle of disadvantage\u201d. As part of the EU funded Youth in Action programme, links were made between a European anti-poverty meeting, and a children\u2019s meeting, which included vulnerable groups collaborating with youth workers and a graphic designer, and led to a publication of their opinions being delivered to the adult meeting. There is no evidence about how far their views were listened to. Table 9.6 EU programme and European NGO practice example: Children\u2019s Voices Against Poverty (2012) As part of a Youth in Action project, children from five Member States met to discuss poverty and social inclusion. They produced their own magazine, Speak Up Against Poverty, which they distributed at a European Investing in Children meeting during the Cypriot presidency. The project was run by PCCPWC, funded by the Cypriot National Agency for the EU Youth in Action programme. Other examples have been established of children being involved at earlier stages of the policy/ programme cycle. For example, the Directorate-General for Health and Consumers (SANCO) (2009) Be Healthy, Be Yourself Conference 573 was attended by 200 children and 300 adults from across Europe as the first event of the Be Healthy initiative. During the event children contributed to the discussions which sought to identify the key issues and priorities for the programme going forward. Positively, in this example, the children were invited to a pre event, facilitated by the European Youth Forum which sought to give them the confidence to express their views during the main conference. The EU Youth Conference 574 , is part of the Structured Dialogue 575 , organised by each EU Presidency country to identify policy priorities through debates between youth (organisations) and policy-makers. Consultations with young people and youth organisations at all levels in Member States, and at EU level involve older children as well as young adults. Consultations with young people and youth organisations at all levels in Member States, and at EU level may involve older children as well as young adults. National Working Groups have been set up and Member States have expressed their willingness to enhance the transparency and visibility of the process and monitor its follow-up.

        "Evaluation of legislation, policy and practice on child participation in the European Union (EU) March 2015 206 Table 9.7 EU institutions and European NGO practice example: Structured Dialogue This consultation is structured in terms of a series of themes and events where young people 577 can discuss the agreed themes with EU policy-makers and politicians. A range of events and activities at a national and local level are also organised within the same process. The European Youth Forum is a key player in the Structured Dialogue, with its Vice-President acting as chair of the European Steering Committee and the European Youth Forum providing its secretariat. It has also promoted better recognition and quality of non-formal education by youth organisations and organised activities linked to the 2011 European Year of Voluntary Activities Promoting Active Citizenship. The Youth Partnership 578 (YP) between the Directorate-General for Education and Culture (EAC) and Council of Europe has been running for 15 years, and focuses on the training of youth workers, specifically \u2018multipliers\u2019 (train the trainer), research and knowledge transfer. There are various elements of participation activities, including the focus on citizenship and training youth to become trainers themselves. The Youth Partnership has an Advisory Group 579 which gathers the principal youth organisations, to contribute towards defining its objectives and activities. The YP commissioned some research which should provide potential evidence of consultative activity with children. However, the age range of the respondents has varied depending on the subject and focus of the research which in turn is dependent on when it is defined that children become active in youth cultures and youth organisations. Other initiatives include elements of children collaborating in participation activities, taking on specific roles and responsibilities, as well as influencing the development of a project. An example from the Directorate-General for Health and Food Safety (SANTE) is an online platform to prevent eating disorders, Pro-youth 580 , targeting 15-25 year olds. Young people have been involved in its development and are trained to deliver interventions. 9.2.4.5 Child-led activities with EU institutions The mapping of EU activity has found little evidence of child led activity supported by the European Commission or other EU institutions, apart from through its funding programmes. One potential example that falls under this category is the encouragement of children to organise their own events through programmes such as Spring Day. 581 This annual grant scheme provides financial support for events that focus on the European theme of the year. Insufficient evidence is available on the specific projects funded and the application process to robustly assess the extent to which this does facilitate child-led activity. 9.2.5 Evaluation of progress and challenges for child participation at EU level 9.2.5.1 Progress in changing expectations The low response rate from some EU officials who were invited to contribute to the study also implies that some institutions do not see child participation as relevant to them. However, on the other hand, evidence from EU stakeholders who agreed to take part shows acceptance of the principle of child participation, albeit with less detail on how to achieve this. It has been suggested that this progress is part of a wider tendency towards improving child participation among different stakeholders. 577 It is important to note that these activities may involve older children but also participants outside of the definitions of children 0-18. Limited information is available to determine specifically the extent and scale to which children 0-18 are involved. 578 http://youth-partnership-eu.coe.int/youth-partnership/training/index 579 http://youth-partnership-eu.coe.int/youth-partnership/about/managementstructures.html 580 https://www.proyouth.eu/home.html 581 http://ec.europa.eu/malta/youth/schools/spring/index_en.htm ",
        "Evaluation of legislation, policy and practice on child participation in the European Union (EU) March 2015 207 \u201cFirstly, we\u2019re observing increased global attention towards children\u2019s participation. There\u2019s a growing momentum - it mobilises stakeholders from all levels and sectors, it increases investments in the field and builds the capacity of professionals and communities. Secondly, there\u2019s an accelerating wave of educational approaches, forms and programmes both in formal and non-formal education that focus on the concept of participation as a major factor forming the nature of modern individuals and societies alike.\u201d (NGO representative) Several EU institutions highlighted above have made significant progress in developing legislation, taking account of work done by others gathering the views of children when drafting legislation, promoting awareness and networking, and are beginning to move towards building up their experience of direct child participation activities. Most examples are of consultation via studies, presence at conferences and specific stand-alone participation-focused projects. However, there are increasing expectations that EU institutions should not only invite children to events and conferences, but encourage them to participate more fully, and feel they have an important role to play. According to a positive assessment by an EU stakeholder, there is a perceived trend of increasing young people\u2019s involvement in decision-making, for example, that has developed over several years. There is some evidence of children\u2019s views influencing policy development, for example when captured through studies such as Eurobarometer, but little other indication that their views are acted upon. There are therefore very few examples of practice that meet good practice criteria about being meaningful, sustained and collaborative. Some EU stakeholders themselves identified the issue of a lack of expertise across the Commission for overseeing meaningful participation, which is linked to the issue of the Commission structure, mentioned below. Wider stakeholders such as NGOs operating at European level, who support children to take part in the participation opportunities that exist, offered mixed feedback on their experiences. They recognise the progress in accepting the principle of child participation, but have yet to see this being realised in practice, and express some frustration with the particular lack of collaborative opportunities, with children who attend meetings, \u201cjust commenting on a process\u201d. \u201cThe EU generally accepts that they should be heard, but is not acting on their decisions and opinions\u2026 Sometimes it is more tokenistic\u2026 It looks good, to the public, to include children, for example, people of different ages in a photo doing activities together. When children dare to say things that adults don\u2019t, or that are politically incorrect, it can be quite disconcerting to really listen. I can\u2019t see any progress made in actually implementing children\u2019s participation within the EU institutions.\u201d (NGO representative) One stakeholder praised the efforts of the Fundamental rights and Rights of the child unit at the Directorate-General for Justice and Consumers (JUST), and the involvement of European level NGOs, but underlined the need to lead by example and for guidelines on how to include children and feed their views into programmes. \u201cI would say despite the best intentions, it is a bit tokenistic. From the [NGO] perspective, if you think about what level [of implementation there is]. Certain programmes such as Youth in Action and Erasmus Plus clearly state that young people should be able to [participate]. This is very, very good, but it doesn\u2019t state how young people are to feed in\u2026the Directorate-General for Justice and Consumers (JUST) is quite active in pushing it [the agenda]. Lots of people are happy with [their work].\u201d ",
        "Evaluation of legislation, policy and practice on child participation in the European Union (EU) March 2015 208 \u201cThe [Fundamental rights and rights of the child Unit] is very happy to meet people. We have input. They have done a lot but have a lot more to do, particularly in defining what they want from child participation. I\u2019d love to see some form of participation with organisations, to include the children\u2019s ombudsman. Develop a set of guidelines to really include those children\u2019s voices, and how. And practise what they preach too\u2026 This might be idealistic but it is most problematic at national levels. We need to bring in national stakeholders, not preach down.\u201d (NGO representative) There is a perceived need to go beyond ad hoc project based opportunities and develop mechanisms for sustained participation by children in processes that contribute to EU decision- making. \u201cIt is very unlikely that young people will sit with a representative from the Council of Regions and someone from the Directorate-General for Employment, Social Affairs and Inclusion (EMPL) to hammer out a decision\u2026but there should be some kind of strategy [to improve this]\u201d. (NGO representative) 9.2.5.2 EU stakeholders\u2019 understanding of child participation When asked for examples of relevant work, many EU officials cited examples of participation in activities in different sectors such as sport, recreation and cultural activities, which have no links to decision-making. They also pointed to generic work on the theme of children and young people, which does not include any child participation, suggesting limited understanding of the term. The lack of understanding appears to be a key explanation for why EU institutions lack confidence in developing meaningful appropriate participation activities that go beyond stand-alone studies, ad hoc project based activities, or tokenism. This is compounded by a lack of political will, as well as by the other barriers included in this section. The active involvement of children in policy and legislation requires separate structures, the setting up of child protection policies, and so forth, obviously takes time. The staffing and time constraints imposed on officials to deliver draft legislation or define policy and these are real and significant barriers to the design and integration of any meaningful child participation strands. Legislative processes are relatively rigid and there are no mechanisms to factor in child participation. There are calls from a European NGO stakeholder for specific guidelines that set minimum standards in order to avoid attempts that are seen as tokenistic, which could have a positive impact in the same way as inclusion of Roma voices is seen as having improved. A European NGO stakeholder cited a clich\u00e9, where young people are showcased, rather than involved in decision-making, for example, with one Roma child and one disabled child, who have 15 minutes on stage and have their photos taken. DG Justice and Consumers (rights of the child) specifically refrains from involving children in a tokenistic manner and states that the results of this study will help inform policy development in this regard. \u201cThere is a need for guidelines as to what we mean by participation. It has to come from the EU in partnership with NGOs, who can organise on their own national level to raise awareness. Then funding would be made available and as with Roma participation, which has really taken off, this would lead to a more inclusive voice. We need minimum standards as it falls below that minimum, to just showcase children and young people and just be there. We need to have something concrete to take to the social ministries and say let\u2019s try and do something. It doesn\u2019t cost much, it\u2019s the political will. ",
        "Evaluation of legislation, policy and practice on child participation in the European Union (EU) March 2015 209 \u201cThe same as most policy documents now, they all have a message that you should include child participation without saying how. [\u2026] But we have already established the importance of child participation\u2026 How do we make it meaningful and inclusive? The Directorate-Generals for Justice and Consumers (JUST), Employment, Social Affairs and Inclusion (EMPL) and Education and Culture (EAC) all have a big role to play in defining how we do it.\u201d (NGO representative) An example was given of existing guidance for the de-institutionalisation process which states the need to involve children who are institutionalised, but without being specific, which could be problematic, for example, if a 15 year old has been in an institution for ten years, with everything done for them, and their opinion has never been asked before. Linked to a lack of understanding, some stakeholders felt that negative attitudes remain about children\u2019s capacity to understand the work of decision-makers and to participate, especially for younger age groups. For participation to meet good practice criteria, it should be meaningful and relevant, which raises legitimate concerns about the kind of material children should be expected to take an interest in. Paternalistic values can be a barrier, and there may be a risk that parents and families feel threatened or excluded from processes \u201cChildren are used to keeping their opinions for themselves and rely heavily on adults\u2019 permission and approval. When combined with unreformed school systems, such attitudes create an extremely aggressive attitude towards opinion and inclusion environment. Parents, once they give their consent to let their children participate, are often excluded from the programmes, but without recognizing them as key stakeholders and partners, we are significantly hindering the whole process.\u201d (NGO representative) 9.2.5.3 Lack of formal participation mechanisms EU stakeholders recognise that there is currently a gap in terms of formal mechanisms for child participation in EU institutions\u2019 decision-making: \u201cWhere we have come under criticism is for children physically participating in European Commission business.\u201d (EU Official) A need is recognised in embedding the child participation culture at two levels of EU work, to have more direct contact with children, and to embed child participation in funding programmes \u2013 this is already been done in the Rights, Equality and Citizenship Programme. The Council of Europe has developed a co-management structure to support youth participation. This is seen by some stakeholders as a potential model for the EU to adapt and adopt. \u201cThe Council of Europe is more progressive than the EU. For example, part of the core management system includes a Youth Advisory Council, on youth related issues that deals with all questions about funding and youth policy. So all decisions are made together. The Youth Advisory Council collaborates with a group from the CoE in decision-making\u2026 We have campaigned for the EU to have a similar system, with the European Youth Forum as they are now discussing the next 7 year funding programmes.

Without working channels for people to communicate and meet \u2013 the second logical step if information is sufficient, the participation of children will remain a commitment on paper.\u201d (EU Official) 9.2.5.4 Commission structures and processes There are clear procedures for EU decision making and the various steps to be completed and these rules do not include child participation. It is therefore even more difficult to respect children's participation rights, where there is no established process, remit or corresponding resources to do so. One of the main challenges is that the Commission is not organised in such a way as to make the children\u2019s participation straightforward. \u201cAs an institution, we [The European Commission] are far removed from children, although we fund activities that are focused on them.\u201d (EU Official) The legalistic and often long-winded nature of Commission processes are seen as making it more complicated to involve children in EU decision-making, for example, the need to go through multiple drafts, and impact assessment boards. Where children do input ideas for content or even style and design of materials, the Commission is liable to veto material that does not fit usual expectations of a Commission document, causing EU stakeholders to feel concerned about the need to manage children\u2019s expectations about the limits of their influence. A Commission representative identified that the centralised communication system can also be a barrier, when it would be more useful to have the resources and the flexibility to respond to what schools want in terms of \u201cpeople visiting to talk to children \u201d providing child-friendly information sessions about the EU, which \u201creally enthuse people \u2013 more than an essay on why they like learning languages.\u201d Overall, consultations with stakeholders from a number of the Directorates-General suggests that the more limited activity at this level is partly due to perceived issues of logistics and the practicalities of the Directorate-General Units, which would make it difficult to work directly with children without having established links with networks or groups of children. As a result where activities were evident these were typically more localised and facilitated through existing structures or networks of children. A stakeholder from the Directorate-General for Communications, Networks, Content and Technology (CNECT) reported that it is not easy to mobilise two children from each EU country to attend the Youth Panels and annual youth meetings held before each wider Safer Internet Forum. \u201cChildren aged 11-17 cannot simply travel alone, so there are logistical implications, as they sometimes travel with parents.\u201d Another practical barrier is that much EU funding requires co-financing, which is difficult for activities that would be truly child-led, especially for vulnerable groups and anyone who is not part of membership organisations with fees. A European NGO stakeholder suggested that \u201cf or other groups who don\u2019t have that resource, but have the capacity\u201d, such projects should be exempt from finding that 25% funding. An alternative suggestion was to let children and young people document the number of hours they put in as their contribution. 9.2.5.5 Language and media used to engage children A stakeholder from a Commission Representation argued that the challenges of engaging children are linked to wider challenges of engaging citizens, but exacerbated by cultural differences between EU personnel and the population.

The Commission and their counterparts are far from the work of organisations on the ground\u201d. (NGO Representative) 9.2.5.6 Inclusive participation A major barrier to EU institutions developing good practice in child participation is the challenge of ensuring that such activities include vulnerable groups of children, those of different ages and children who are not already part of organised groups. The main outstanding gaps in child participation work from the perspectives of some EU stakeholders were: poverty and those at risk of violence; children with disabilities; children in institutional care, which is a current focus of European structural funding; younger children, an area where the work of the Commission as regards child participation is heavily criticised externally. EU stakeholders and NGOs recognise that a key challenge is how to reach non-organised young people, as youth organisations are a key route to access young people but on average only 10% of all Europe\u2019s young people are reported to participate in or be members of an organisation: \u201cIt will always be a challenge to reach children who don\u2019t have a voice\u2026 to overcome a lack of representativeness\u201d. (EU Official) \u201cDemocratic youth-led organisations that are very established are all well and good, but inclusion is an issue\u2026 We\u2019re not hearing the categorical voice of young people. The European Youth Parliament wants to include [a wider range of young people], but can only make contact though other similarly organised youth organisations and groups.\u201d (NGO Representative) \u201c[Participation] is difficult to do with excluded children, to bring them in\u2026 At the other end of the social spectrum are children who have had a more privileged life, an education and family support.

        "Evaluation of legislation, policy and practice on child participation in the European Union (EU) March 2015 212 There was a call to respect the wishes of children from groups such as care leavers or Roma, who may not necessarily wish to be identified with these groups. There is seen to be a lack of appropriate mechanisms to engage certain groups. \u201cFor the most vulnerable and excluded children, it is only possible to re-integrate with very good methodologies. So it is almost a dream to get them to participate in processes to change policy; even at a local level\u201d. (NGO Representative) On the other hand, several key NGOs whose core work is with vulnerable groups have had some success in involving vulnerable children, showing that with the right approach and expertise, it can be possible. \u201cThere are links with child poverty and wellbeing as we always try to involve disadvantaged groups\u2026 We launch a call through member organisations every time we\u2019re asked to participate. We stress that we\u2019ll give preference to children from disadvantaged backgrounds.\u201d (NGO Representative) Child victims of trafficking are very high on the agenda, with the EU strategy tackling children as a priority with very strong legal framework. The current financial situation in many EU countries is seen as affecting children\u2019s rights, with participation, often seen more as a luxury component of progress, rather than as an investment in the future. Institutions tend to keep their resource for more pressing matters which slows the overall process. We now go on to look at the role of NGOs operating at European level in relation to child participation work. 9.3 The role of NGOs as a driver for EU level child participation work 9.3.1 Key NGO perspectives on child participation The role of NGOs as a driver for child participation work emerges as an important finding at EU level, as well as in individual Member States. NGOs contribute in a number of ways, which can be seen as three main groups of activities that are direct cooperation with EU institutions\u2019 participation activities, seeking to influence EU participation work through advice, advocacy, research and training; and, thirdly, by developing their own models of participation practice which act as good practice examples. Examples of key large NGOs, with European regional offices as well as work going on in Member States, include SOS Children's Villages 582 , which works with children in care or leaving care, and Save the Children. Eurochild 583 is a network of organisations and individuals working across Europe to improve the quality of life of children and young people. They define child participation as in Article 12 from the UNCRC \u201cmaking that right something that all children can enjoy. We need to create the conditions, structure and awareness for that to happen.\u201d IFM-SEI 584 is an international umbrella organisation for child and youth-led movements, where children and young people are involved in all levels of decision-making, from their local groups to the world congress. Member organisations educate children about their rights often through peer education. In their view, children can participate in a meaningful way in political decision- making processes, or in the life of their community and family. 582 http://www.sos-childrensvillages.org/ 583 http://eurochild.org/ 584 http://www.ifm-sei.org/ ",
        "Evaluation of legislation, policy and practice on child participation in the European Union (EU) March 2015 213 This means not just being listened to, but having their opinions taken into account, and being properly informed about the participation. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t make sense to just say to children in the street \u201chey, what do you think about this new street\u201d, without more information. It is not just about being consulted, they need to have ownership to be doing things for themselves, organising their own spaces and activities.\u201d 9.3.2 NGOs\u2019 support for EU participation activities NGOs cooperate directly by enabling children to undertake participation activities with EU institutions, as well as delivering programmes with a participation element, funded by the Commission. They occupy a key linking role, positioned as they are between decision-makers, and work on the ground with children, that is often undertaken by national level organisations, which are part of a larger NGO, a European level network or umbrella organisation. An EU official commented that the European Commission funds projects that work via intermediaries to engage with children, including work around bullying and children with disabilities, or capacity-building for judicial and other practitioners (e.g. staff providing alternative care). Two more main structures for supporting participation across Europe are the European Youth Forum 585 and the European Youth Parliament 586 . Both these organisations have young people representatives across European countries. The European Youth Parliament has a national committee of young people in each Member State while the European Youth Forum draws on national youth forums. Both these structures appear to be strong in terms of providing forums for young people to express their interests and are a key mechanism for different units of the European Commission to involve children their work. 9.3.3 NGOs\u2019 advocacy role In an advocacy role, for example, as partners participating in steering groups, NGOs encourage EU institutions to prioritise child participation. A Child Rights Action Group (CRAG) is a loose network including Eurochild, Save the Children, Scouts, European Youth Forum and other NGOs advocating on children\u2019s rights in Brussels, who are pushing for children\u2019s participation. In November 2013, they adopted a Manifesto for Children\u2019s Rights for the 2014 European elections, 587 among others, to urge parliamentarians to be aware of the importance of child participation and include funding for it as an integral part of programmes. 9.3.4 Awareness raising by NGOs NGOs contribute to raising awareness within EU institutions about child participation in a range of ways including research and advocacy. EU officials have highlighted the importance of research and data collection to complement EU work, for example, when implementing the EU Agenda for the Rights of the Child. Raising awareness of child participation and networking among relevant organisations are seen as key aspects of NGOs\u2019 role. \u201cAs an umbrella organisation, much of the work is not directly with young people, we work with trainers and group leaders to increase their capacity and give them space to reflect on how to increase children\u2019s rights. We use a Council of Europe child friendly version of the Recommendation on Child Participation for training which is more understandable for children as well as for adults.\u201d (European level stakeholder, NGO) 585 http://www.youthforum.org/about-2/ 586 http://www.eypej.org/area.3.About-EYP.html 587 http://childrightsmanifesto.eu/ ",
        "Evaluation of legislation, policy and practice on child participation in the European Union (EU) March 2015 214 Some NGOs undertake or commission research studies to raise awareness of certain aspects of child participation, for example, the Children\u2019s Rights for All projects run by Inclusion Europe to investigate the implementation of the UNCRC in respect of this vulnerable group among children with intellectual disabilities. The EU contributed funding for this study under the Daphne III programme 588 . It found that that across Member States, children with intellectual disabilities are hardly ever provided with the opportunity to express their views, leading to a more focused 2013 study of participation \u2013 the Hear our Voice project 589 , funded under the Fundamental Rights and Citizenship Programme. The European Network for Children of Imprisoned Parents 590 is involved in child-friendly justice issues, and seeks to boost awareness for this vulnerable group. It was involved in research on COPING (Children of Prisoners, Interventions and Mitigations to Strengthen Mental Health) with over 700 children in four Member States over three years, which received FP7 Framework funding 591 . Groups of young people participated in the launch conference, and their recommendations were presented as part of the general recommendations. 592 9.3.5 Examples of good practice developed by NGOs Some NGOs have developed models of good practice in child participation, which provide examples of how to turn some of the principles, values and concrete actions that feature in their campaigns, into a reality in the context of their organisations. The experience of developing their own work informs their role as a driver for EU-level child participation. Their structures and remits mean that most of the challenges for EU institutions developing meaningful inclusive practice outlined in the previous section do not apply in the same way to NGOs. However, the basic challenge remains of how to involve all groups of children in decision-making that is usually dominated by adults, within the aspects of NGOs work that are often professionalised. They too have their own language and culture in their internal structures that requires a perceptual shift to open up to children\u2019s involvement, where it is deemed appropriate. This section examines a few key innovative examples, which could be used for benchmarking, without claiming that they have all the answers. 9.3.5.1 Child participation in conferences Conferences are often seen as a prime opportunity to involve children, but also present risks of tokenism and alienating children through the process of trial and error. The Eurochild annual conference in 2013 opted for a specific mixture of consultation, collaboration and child-led elements, having learned from the experience of children leaving open workshops in the past, \u201c because they were not engaged and it didn\u2019t suit them.\u201d There was emphasis on the importance of making sure that children and young people know what to expect in each of the opportunities to participate that are outlined in the boxed text below. 588 http://inclusion-europe.org/images/stories/documents/Project_CRC/Results/European_Report/EN.pdf 589 http://www.childrights4all.eu/ 590 http://childrenofprisoners.eu/ 591 http://www.eurochips.org/images/1374138579.pdf 592 http://www.eurochips.org/documents/1363703427.pdf ",

It\u2019s not practical for them to draft [a Recommendation], but if they\u2019re not happy with something, it won\u2019t pass.\u201d 9.4 Conclusion This chapter has outlined some achievements and some barriers to participation in the EU institutions. Several EU institutions have made significant progress in developing legislation, promoting awareness and networking, and are beginning to move towards building up their experience of direct child participation activities. Most examples are of consultation via studies, presence at conferences and specific stand-alone participation-focused projects. EU institutions have developed child friendly information online and in other formats, about a range of issues, including active citizenship and participation. The chapter has also highlighted the experiences of European NGOs, their views of participation in the EU, and their expectations from the EU. The experience of NGOs developing their own models for child participation informs their role as a driver for EU-level child participation, as a key partner, facilitating contacts with child participation networks and organisations, as well as undertaking campaigning and advocacy. 593 http://eurochildannualconference2013.org/ 594 The International Youth Council is made up of national and local young representatives from SOS villages and other settings aged around 15-23, to complement the organisational structure, to make children and young people\u2019s voices heard and be inclusive.

        "Evaluation of legislation, policy and practice on child participation in the European Union (EU) March 2015 216 Their structures and remits mean that most of the challenges for EU institutions developing meaningful inclusive practice do not apply in the same way to NGOs. While structural barriers are likely to remain, it seems there is some room for improvement in terms of awareness and expertise. When asked for examples of relevant work, many EU stakeholders cite examples of participation in activities in different sectors such as sport, recreation and cultural activities. However, there are not many examples involving children in decision-making. They also point to generic work on children and young people, which does not include any child participation, suggesting limited understanding of the term. In addition to the structures and processes of policy-making, the language and culture of EU institutions can act as a barrier, requiring a perceptual shift to further open up to children\u2019s involvement, and make sound assessments of where it is deemed appropriate to undertake child participation activities. Mainstreaming child participation could entail making such assessments a more routine part of the process. Progress has been made in legislation and attitudes, with recognition of the need for child friendly communication and occasional consultation. The groundwork for its further practical application has been laid through successful experiences of ad hoc project based opportunities. Although developing mechanisms for sustained child participation in processes that effectively contribute to EU decision-making may be currently unfeasible, there is scope to further develop models of good practice on how to include children, and for the Commission to aspire to lead by example. The EU is also well placed to support participation efforts by Member States and NGOs, for example, through funding programmes and promoting good practice. ",
        "Evaluation of legislation, policy and practice on child participation in the European Union (EU) March 2015 217 10.0 Conclusions and recommendations This final report has presented the detailed findings from an evaluation of legislation, policy and practice on child participation in the European Union . In the previous chapters, we first set the background context for the study; the aims and methodology. We then reviewed the findings from the country mapping, to establish the legislative frameworks that exist across the EU28 relating to Article 12 UNCRC, and the key issues affecting their implementation. The subsequent chapters went on to examine the practice dimensions of child participation; examining in turn the main forms that participation has taken; the nature and extent of potential \u2018good practices\u2019, and the evidence for impact and outcomes. We then provided a detailed account of the child-led strand of the study; examining children\u2019s views of what participation means to them, and how the barriers documented through the research might be addressed, before turning to consider the actions that have been taken at EU level. In this final chapter, we reflect on the key findings from the study, related to the objectives and requirements from the TOR, and we offer some overall conclusions from each strand. We then go on to present and explain a series of recommendations for policy and programme development. Finally, we draw together the evidence from the study to present a set of practical guidelines for implementing children\u2019s participation. 10.1 Conclusions from the country mapping 10.1.1 The legislative response to Article 12 UNCRC The study has shown that the legal provisions for implementing Article 12 UNCRC vary considerably across the EU . Whilst the overall level of recognition of UNCRC and its supporting institutions was generally high, the accompanying legal frameworks have been slower to become established. Comparatively few Member States have reflected Article 12 within their National Constitution, and only a handful of countries have instituted a comprehensive Children\u2019s Act or Code. In a few exceptional cases, Article 12 remains absent from the majority of key national legislation, with no evidence that General Comment No. 12 of UNCRC 595 has influenced policy development in a meaningful way. Overall responsibility for implementing child participation has typically rested with a number of different official bodies and institutions at a national level. Just under half of Member States had appointed a dedicated Children\u2019s Ombudsman or Children\u2019s Commissioner at the time of writing, although this would seem to be an expanding area, with some countries having recently extended the powers of their existing Ombudsman to provide and expanded remit for monitoring children\u2019s rights. Their role across the EU has been very significant in mobilising resources and conducting independent reviews and research. In most countries, a number of separate ministries can be identified with oversight of the majority of policies and programmes relating to children and young people. Responsibilities are rarely defined in terms of \u2018child participation\u2019, however, and this usually forms part of a wider remit for citizenship and youth activities. There is also very limited evidence for a cross- Government agenda for child participation within the EU, which has emerged in recent years for other related policy areas (such as child poverty prevention). This is perhaps surprising, and would seem to represent a potential gap; especially given that Article 12 UNCRC as both a substantive right, and a basis for the realisation of all other rights. 595 UN Committee on the Rights of the Child's General Comment No 12 (2009) on the right of the child to be heard.

        "Evaluation of legislation, policy and practice on child participation in the European Union (EU) March 2015 218 10.1.2 Structures and networks Nearly all countries have also seen the development of children\u2019s participatory structures and networks. Most have followed a conventional representative democratic model, with children and youth councils at national and local levels and children and youth parliaments at a national level; with varying degrees of involvement in the equivalent adult decision-making structures,. NGOs have been consistently active in promoting participation, playing a lobbying and advocacy role as well as building capacity through training and awareness-raising. Much trail- blazing of children\u2019s participation has also taken place at a municipal level, where authorities working individually or as part of a network have shown leadership in this area. The Child Friendly Cities Initiative and the Children\u2019s Town Councils movement are two prime examples. 10.1.3 Budgets for participation The visibility of budgets for child participation was generally found to be poor , with none of the EU28 having set in place a designated \u2018children\u2019s budget\u2019 at a national level, and the majority of expenditure remaining within other national budgets. One of the criticisms was a perceived lack of accountability for expenditure, which has avoided a wider debate about under-resourcing for the whole area of practice development. Funding for programmes with a child participation element has often fallen between the overlapping areas of \u2018children\u2019 and \u2018youth\u2019 provision, with the latter usually understood to cover young people from the ages of 14-25. This would seem to reflect that much child participation activity has originated from a citizenship and cultural agenda, rather than necessarily being rights-based and linked directly to UNCRC. 10.1.4 Implementing policy and legislation A gap between legislation and practice continues to present one of the major barriers to realising children\u2019s participation. Even in countries where apparently comprehensive and binding legal frameworks exist; implementation has often been gradual and complex, with Article 12 taking force alongside other areas of child rights legislation and the establishment of national child protection systems. The various interpretations of Article 12 imposed by Member States have sometimes had the consequences or excluding particular groups of children by way of their age or status. For example children under the age of 10 or 12 remain excluded from certain provisions within Member States where this is considered below the age of competence. Moreover, the capacity for professionals who work with children to assess their competence to participate was found to be considerably lacking at a local level within the EU, and it is evident that systematic training and professional development has not always kept apace with legislation. Compounding this situation, many services and organisations do not have systems or procedures in place to enable the participation of children as a matter of course, or to monitor and review their work in this area. A further challenge relates to enforcement . Very few countries have set in place a framework for assessing compliance with Article 12 or imposing remedies. Article 12 is still relatively untested in case law , and its implementation has been much slower to be realised in sectors of high political importance where the legal framework is clearly established. The status of asylum seeking children is a notable example, where Member States have often given primacy to immigration law over child rights. Healthcare is another sector where the implementation of Article 12 has had to navigate the arena of medical ethics and codes of practice, and where progress on the ground \u2013 particularly for decisions beyond those affecting individual care \u2013 has been slow. These legal barriers are also cross-cut by the issue of public acceptance and political will . Throughout the study, it was evident that children\u2019s participation is widely viewed as a \u2018soft\u2019 policy area, and that there is an insufficient appetite in most countries for more substantial investment. ",
        "Evaluation of legislation, policy and practice on child participation in the European Union (EU) March 2015 219 Children\u2019s participation has also been lacking in the monitoring of Article 12, with assessments often being adult-initiated and led. A promising model used in several countries is that of training \u2018young inspectors\u2019 to participate on an equal footing as adults in holding services to account, although these examples have tended to be small scale. Child Rights Impact Assessments have also been trialled in some countries; with the aim of future-proofing new policies with a potential impact on children\u2019s lives. These have often originated within the NGO sector or been championed by Children\u2019s Ombudsmen. There would seem to be good potential to further raise awareness and to extend the take-up of these tools and frameworks. As we have discussed within this report, the low levels of children and young people\u2019s participation in political processes in the EU also presents a wider challenge to realising their rights. It must be concluded that greater steps in the political enfranchisement of children (especially with regard to lowering the voting age) goes hand-in-hand with improving the mechanisms for children\u2019s participation in all spheres of public life. 10.1.5 Sectors and settings Coverage of Article 12 and its interpretation has varied across the EU at a sector level. In the main, the child\u2019s \u201cright to be heard\u201d is the most prominent in legislation within the education, justice and child protection sectors, for decisions affecting individual children\u2019s immediate welfare \u2013 adoption, custody or, care proceedings, or where the child is a victim or perpetrator of crime. Similarly within the health sector, the most widespread examples of legislation related to children\u2019s consent to medical procedures. The practice within these sectors was found to be highly varied, however, with some big differences between the participation rights afforded to children within different Member States based on ages and exemptions. Legislation has needed to navigate the tensions between children\u2019s interests and legal guardianship and parental custody. The situation for more vulnerable groups of children such as those with mental health problems or receiving psychiatric care was found to be poorly defined within many countries, whilst children in alternative care settings and children with disabilities were often shown to have fewer participation rights. This was particularly, although by no means exclusively, found to be the case in countries where the deinstitutionalisation of the care sector is still on- going. Child participation was often found to be weakly defined within legislation for recreation and neighbourhood planning . However, a greater abundance of examples of good practice examples were found at a local level, relating to children participating in local planning decisions and in the development of playgrounds, youth spaces or programmes. Again, this highlights the gap between legislation and practice, with many of the strongest examples of children\u2019s participation in their \u2018everyday lives\u2019 being initiated at a local level through schools or community settings. The country mapping found that schools and early education settings provide a key universal point of engagement in social learning with adults. In practice, however, there is an immense variation in the quality and extent of participatory practices within educational settings. Perhaps the pinnacle of this practice is some of the examples of \u2018democratic schools\u2019, where children\u2019s participation is embedded in \u201c everyday pedagogic approaches \u201d, and relates both to individual and collective participation rights. In many schools across Europe, however, children\u2019s participation is focussed principally on formal school structures and committees, and levels of participation in wider decisions relating to teaching and learning, school policies (including for behaviour, bullying and exclusion) remain low across the EU. The non- participation of Roma children in formal education at secondary stage is of particular concern and there are clear relationships between the child\u2019s \u2018right to be heard\u2019 and risk and protective factors for Early School Leaving (ESL).

        "Evaluation of legislation, policy and practice on child participation in the European Union (EU) March 2015 220 10.1.6 Types and levels of participation The study explored the different levels of participation within the EU, using Lansdown\u2019s framework 596 , which distinguishes between consultative, collaborative and child-led practices . As might be expected, consultation has provided the norm for the majority of practice examples mapped through the study. There was a predominance of specific time-bound projects, events or research studies with the aim of eliciting children\u2019s views and experiences to inform change, but largely following an adult-led agenda. Consultative participation was found at all geographical scales, including the EU-wide examples such as the Euro-barometer studies on child rights. Examples of collaborative participation were less widespread, and tended to relate mainly to the design or planning stage of the policy cycle \u2013 for example, through co-design in schools; town planning exercises or some examples of practice from educational and care settings. Child-led participation was rare and tended to relate to leisure time, or civic participation. They highlight the challenges that children face in initiating a dialogue with adults on their own terms. This study suggests that the over-riding priority is to ensure the availability of different forms of participation in all areas of children\u2019s lives. The suitability of particular mechanisms is contextually specific. For example, formal structures such as councils and youth parliaments are the most frequently documented example of participatory practice and yet they often lack engagement with adult decision-making, and are fraught by challenges of ensuring that they are \u2018representative\u2019 (i.e. often being critiqued for engaging the \u2018usual suspects\u2019 of already actively participating children, and not reaching out to other groups of children who are more marginalised). In contrast, examples were identified through the study of a variety of other types of participatory initiatives, ranging from media projects, to democratic development activities. 10.1.7 Measuring good practice Building on Lansdown\u2019s framework, and taking into account other relevant tools 597 , the evaluation team developed a refined set of quality criteria for assessing good practice. These are summarised below. 596 Lansdown, G (2011) A Framework for Monitoring and Evaluating Children\u2019s Participation: A Preparatory Draft for Piloting 597 Including: the International Save the Children Alliance Practice standards for child participation, the UNCRC, and Council of Europe recommendations and Hear by Rights standards ",

Systems and culture of learning and change exist in response to children\u2019s participation 10.1.8 Barriers to child participation An immediate observation from the country data was the lack of understanding of what children\u2019s participation means . Across the study, there was a tendency for respondents to describe examples of good practices in providing services or information to children, or to discuss participation interchangeably with child rights in general. This highlighted several issues. First, it is apparent that the lack of monitoring and evaluation in this field has made it very difficult to raise awareness about what effective participation is and how it should be measured. Second, the study underlined the highly contextual nature of participation. In some Nordic countries, for example, a strong culture of participation has developed somewhat independently from UNCRC and the definitions and reference points are quite different, whilst forms of participatory practice in some Eastern European countries take as their reference point school self-governance and youth groups from the Communist era, which have shaped contemporary practice. ",
        "Evaluation of legislation, policy and practice on child participation in the European Union (EU) March 2015 222 One of the major issues raised by the study, however, relates not just to the fact that there are different understandings of participation, but more fundamentally that there is a lack of understanding amongst professionals and a lack of knowledge and commitment to children\u2019s rights . The country studies underlined the extent to which legislation is only as effective as the training that enables it to be implemented. This is too often viewed as a \u2018social work\u2019 agenda, with front line professionals lacking the time and opportunities to acquire these skills and support the participation of children. Similarly, it is too often taken for granted that educationalists will automatically acquire the expertise through their initial training. The research points towards the importance of affecting change at an institutional level , where most of the existing Kite-mark schemes are targeted in order to embed participatory practices systematically. In practice, it has often fallen to NGOs to fill the gap in appropriate training and standards. Some of the most prominent examples have been undertaken on a multi-professional basis; with social workers, psychologists, judges and other specialists undertaking joint training to develop competences in this area. Training and awareness-raising for children was also raised as a priority. The country evidence showed that if children are to exercise participation rights, they need to understand these and have the opportunity to \u2018try them out\u2019. The experiences from evaluated projects across the EU and reinforced by the child-led strand of the current study is that children have a limited knowledge of child participation, despite the abundant resources that are now available in many countries. Participation is simply not a priority for many children unless it can be made tangible to the everyday issues that affect their lives. This has arguably been one of the key factors underpinning the success of participation within youth work settings and in representative organisations for specific groups (children in care, children with disabilities) \u2013 the existence of a strong \u2018call to action\u2019. Indeed, children\u2019s activism has been found throughout the country mapping, and some of the examples have related to protest groups and direct action. More widely, public attitudes as to how children's roles in the society are viewed have had a constraining influence on child participation in many countries; particularly relating to scepticism about children\u2019s competence, often seen as a result of the legacy of totalitarian rule or traditionally paternalistic attitudes. 10.1.9 Enabling factors The country level research indicated that participation is assisted when national Ministerial strategic decision-making is joined up and coherent, and when municipalities take a lead to champion child rights, working closely with child and youth councils. The existence of transnational networks such as the Child Friendly Cities Initiative has also acted as a catalyst for change, whilst NGOs have often played a central role in keeping momentum for child rights \u2013 particularly where governments have fallen short. Beyond these factors, the use of public awareness campaigning and structured dialogue; training in the value and mechanics of participation \u2013 both for children themselves and for teachers, social care and health professionals, and targeted measures for vulnerable or under-represented groups of children emerged as being key enabling factors. Some of the most effective examples found within the study included multi-professional training and development, to embed a shared understanding of participatory practices across different areas of competence and to break down professional boundaries. The significance of individual professionals carrying out their roles as key workers, mentors or advisers to children and young people should not be underestimated with respect to fostering effective participation. Finally, child participation has been much assisted where good practices have been widely shared. As we have seen, this often goes hand-in-hand with setting in place mechanisms to monitor and evaluate, which remains an area for further development. The study evidence would certainly seem to indicate that greater opportunities for children to participate in undertaking their own research, and developing the skills to capture and reflect upon the challenges to participation, would be invaluable. ",
        "Evaluation of legislation, policy and practice on child participation in the European Union (EU) March 2015 223 10.1.10 Impacts and outcomes This study has show that children have a valuable potential role to play in influencing policy and practice, where there are appropriate dialogue structures in place, and where both adults and children have opportunities to gain the competences needed for effective particiaption. The main evidence of impact relates to participation activities at a local level ( groups of children ), where the benefits are most tangible and measurable. Here, children have often been able to observe and articulate the changes to their everyday lives in settings such as schools, care, and their local neighbourhoods. In some instances children\u2019s particiaption has directly shaped planning decisions on a small scale (such as the redevelopment of public spaces, playgrounds, and children and youth facilities), whilst in more exceptional circumstances children have been supported to play a role in municipal planning processes. Whilst highly relevant, however, these examples often remain distanced from decision making that affects children at a group \u2013 at a \u2018macro\u2019 level. Greater challenges clearly exist at a national policy level ( children as a group ). The most commonly found examples of national policy impact relate to children\u2019s participation in developing youth strategies or action plans, and raising awareness of policy issues through child-led research, or via children\u2019s forums or parliaments. These impacts are usually achieved via timebound consultative participation, and predominantly through lobbying, consultative events and research. Children have sometimes also been directly involved in appointing Ombudsmen or other officials. Nonetheless, there is still much variation in how child particiaption is implemented between different Member States, and real influence over decision-making is often elusive and subject to adult coercion or controls. Patterns across sectors and settings also suggest there is more participation and therefore increased chances of impact in some sectors than others. These include education (mainly through school councils), care (through participation in care planning), youth work projects, and local planning (especially through consultations on neighbourhood developments and recreation). There are, of course, also numerous examples of positive outcomes for individual children , relating to participation decisions affecting their care, education or treatment within justice settings. In the fields of child protection, healthcare and education amongst others, examples were found where children\u2019s right to be heard has achieved direct results for their wellbeing and safety, albeit that these outcomes are infrequently monitored or evaluated in a systematic way. A few examples were found where children\u2019s participation has been more permanently institutionalised, and children have influenced practice on a larger scale. These examples relate to participatory inspection arrangements within the field of children\u2019s social care and child protection (UK and Sweden). Equally, there are sufficient examples to illustrate the negative impact on children\u2019s lives where they have been deprived of liberties, placed in inappropriate care, educationally excluded or suffered from ill health as a result of non-participation. The study concurs with previous research on the subject of participation, demonstrating that meaningful opportunities for civic and social participation provide children with a healthy learning experience that has been shown to develop self-confidence, citizenship skills and pro- social behaviour, as well as fostering positive relationships with adults (through inter- generational dialogue). Children need the opportunity to enquire/explore/play with ideas before demonstrating more tangible gains in competence. Partly reflecting this issue; many of the larger programmes \u2013 especially in the \u2018youth\u2019 field \u2013 have focussed almost exclusively on personal competences associated with the process of participating rather than the end results in terms of changes (to children\u2019s circumstances, services, systems or policies). The evidence supports the findings from other recent studies calling for further research in this area. ",
        "Evaluation of legislation, policy and practice on child participation in the European Union (EU) March 2015 224 Perhaps the single greatest challenge is to counter adult dominated structures of governance with education about children\u2019s participation and rights and a widespread failure to systematically integrate children\u2019s participation into policy making and services in a meaningful way. To do so, however, it is necessary to instate far more systematic monitoring and evaluation systems. A total of 22 out of 28 Member States have no standardised national monitoring on the rights of the child in place at all. The evidence where it does exist has tended to come from specific evaluated programmes; independent research; reports of Children\u2019s Commissioners, and the \u2018shadow\u2019 country reports prepared by UNICEF. This has resulted in a situation whereby judgements about impact rely quite heavily on the subjective views of experts. 10.2 Conclusions from the child-led research The child-led strand provided a central role within the evaluation, in presenting an opportunity to engage directly with children from diverse social and cultural backgrounds through a set of 11 participatory projects in five Member States (Croatia, Greece, Netherlands, Poland and the UK). This work strengthened the evidence base for the evaluation by allowing for a deeper exploration of the research questions, drawing upon the children\u2019s personal experiences of participation, and providing tangible examples both of the inherent challenges of particiaption and of the outcomes for the children and adults who were involved. The design and implementation of the projects also constituted a participatory process in their own right, with the children playing a central role in conceiving the activities and analysing and reporting upon the findings alongside adults from child rights organisations. 10.2.1 Children\u2019s understanding and experiences of \u2018participation\u2019 The child-led projects underlined the value that children place on their right to be heard and to have their views taken into account, irrespective of their background and circumstances. The majority of the children participating in the child-led research projects felt strongly they should have a say in key decisions that concern them , despite a lack of consensus about what the term \u2018participation\u2019 should mean and what this might include or exclude. In practice, however, participation was nearly always experienced as being the most tangible and meaningful when viewed in the context of everyday interactions; at home, in school, or in the community. These findings strongly reinforce the evidence from the country mapping, which also illustrated the importance of participation in children\u2019s everyday lives. The projects elicited a useful working typology of children\u2019s participation in decision-making, ranging from issues where children and young people had some degree of authority (e.g. over their dress, choice of friends and free time activities); to issues where they had limited decision-making (e.g. over choice of school or doctor, time spent watching TV), to areas of shared decision-making with adults (e.g. over room decorations, home rules and duties, trips, and food).. This resonates with the framework developed by Lansdown 598 , which explores issues where children have \u2018no influence\u2019; \u2018limited influence; \u2018moderate influence\u2019, or \u2018comprehensive influence\u2019 on decision-making. Crosscutting these typologies, children and young people\u2019s understanding of participation was also clearly influenced by a range of personal factors and experiences, and according to their age, gender, ethnicity, and disability. The differences according to children\u2019s ages were particularly noticeable , with older children (16 or 17) more likely to interpret participation as involvement in formal activities, such as forums or councils, in which they themselves (or their peers) had participated. In contrast children of 10-13 years were more likely to view participation in terms of respect for children's rights and their ability to decide, whilst those aged 7-9 years commonly described participation in terms of socialising, playing, helping parents with household activities, and caring for the elderly and disabled in their community. 598 Lansdown G. (2011) A Framework for Monitoring and Evaluating Children\u2019s Participation ",
        "Evaluation of legislation, policy and practice on child participation in the European Union (EU) March 2015 225 The projects further underlined the balance that often needs to be struck between individual participation and family roles and responsibilities . Certain groups of children drew attention to significant gender differences, largely based on cultural and religious norms; with girls in particular experiencing tension between their lives outside the home, and the restrictions they faced when at home. In most cases children had more input to everyday (shorter-term) issues, and less to \u2018serious\u2019 (longer-term) issues. This may reflect both the unwillingness among some parents to involve children in issues that they don\u2019t think concern them, and/or a desire to protect children from information and experiences parents feel they may find distressing. This tension between the prerogative for adults to protect children and to afford them opportunities to participate in society was also found within the other strands of the evaluation. The child-led projects revealed particular concerns amongst children regarding the extent to which they are able to participate in decisions regarding their education . Although numerous positive examples were given, children often criticised teachers for not taking time to listen, or for asking for students\u2019 opinions but not taking them into account. Indeed, the research showed that even where schools regularly encouraged students to express their views on school-related issues, disillusionment quickly crept in if students did not observe any changes as a result. Children\u2019s experiences of their teachers varied significantly, but the opinion was often voiced that teachers tended to impose their own values rather than always considering those of the children, and that discipline was too often used as a substitute for discussion or debate. These accounts help to illustrate the importance of building professional skills and awareness for child participation. Indeed, the country mapping arrived at similar conclusions regarding to training and development for teachers, social workers and care workers. There was also a significant amount of criticism amongst the children of structures designed to encourage children\u2019s participation . Student or youth councils, although considered useful by some at least some of the time, were regarded by others as being largely invisible, unrepresentative and/or ineffective for ensuring that the majority of children\u2019s views are heard on issues that matter to them. Perhaps the most positive comments were from the young people in Opatija, Croatia, who were very supportive towards the \u2018Children\u2019s City Council\u2019, set up to enable children to express their wishes and needs to decision-makers. This example illustrates the potential for strong examples of child-led structures, with direct links to adult decision-making, to create more meaningful opportunities for children\u2019s voices to be heard. A number of the examples from the Child Friendly Cities Initiative showed similar outcomes, as we discussed in the mapping strand. 10.2.2 Benefits of the child-led projects for children The evaluation demonstrated that child-led research has a wide range of benefits for the children who are involved , in terms of their own development. This was acknowledged in the very positive comments of children and young people about their experiences of participating in the projects. We saw how children from SOS Children\u2019s Villages in Croatia reported improvements in their self-awareness, and interest in civic and social issues, whilst children from other projects also reported having improved their communication skills and gained practical experience of designing and undertaking research. The child-led projects further underlined how the participants often showed an eagerness to understand and empathise with the circumstances of other children; especially those from different backgrounds to themselves, and to play a part in bringing about positive changes within their community . Children from the different child-led projects sought reassurance that their findings would be heard and acted upon, rather than serving as a tokenistic exercise. The projects also provided very useful insights for the adults who were involved, and challenged their perspectives of the competences of the children they worked with. ",
        "Evaluation of legislation, policy and practice on child participation in the European Union (EU) March 2015 226 All of these findings concur with previous studies, which show that skills gained from participatory action research are transferable to other aspects of children\u2019s lives (Kellett, 2006) 599 , and that effective participation can reinforce children\u2019s confidence and self-esteem (Lansdown, 2002) 600 . There is clearly a case for replicating and financially supporting projects of this kind, which have shown that children can play a much more active role than simply being the \u2018subject\u2019 of research studies. 10.2.3 Barriers to participation and children\u2019s proposed solutions The child-led study reinforced the findings from the country mapping, in showing that children often face multiple barriers to exercising their participation rights . These barriers were described in terms of personal factors, such as lack of self-confidence, fear of making the wrong choice, or in some cases fear of ridicule from their peers or reprimand form adults if children spoke \u2018out of turn\u2019. Cultural and religious factors also hindered participation for some children; particularly girls, whilst one group of migrant and refugee children who took part in the child-led research spoke of how insecurity in their living circumstances made participation more uncertain and fragile, and compounded their fears of speaking out against authority. Cutting across all of these issues was a view that children often have too few opportunities to be heard by adults, and that their views are not taken seriously enough . Some children described previous incidences where they had been let down by adults, which had resulted in a degree of scepticism about the potential for challenging the status quo. The child-led projects also illustrated the learning process that is required for both children and adults to \u2018acquire\u2019 the skills for participation through inter-generational dialogue. The early engagement through some of the projects revealed confusion amongst children about what participation involves. This was coupled with a lack of motivation to dedicate time to the projects, unless the activities were made relevant to their lives. Some children also expressed ambivalence about \u2018participation\u2019 in situations where basic needs and rights were not felt to be met. Taken collectively, the child-led projects indicate that a lack of awareness and understanding of participation (including amongst children themselves) is perhaps more of a barrier than it first appears. Participation was often considered a marginal activity, even a \u2018luxury\u2019, when compared with other challenges in children\u2019s lives (educational problems, bullying, poverty), and tended to be equated quite narrowly with formal \u2018civic engagement\u2019. There would seem to be considerable scope for awareness-raising and education to ensure that more children understand the fundamental basis of the \u2018right to be heard\u2019, as a means for realising all other rights. The Eurobarometer studies on The Rights of the Child (2009 601 and 2010 602 ) perhaps illustrate this point best of all, in drawing attention to the inverse relationship between children\u2019s awareness of their rights, and their satisfaction with their opportunities to exercise these rights. 599 Kellett, M.

        "Evaluation of legislation, policy and practice on child participation in the European Union (EU) March 2015 227 Possible solutions were also directly explored with children through the study, through the child-led projects. These were wide-ranging, and the children\u2019s suggestions included: greater efforts to improve relations and communication between children and adults; more information and more opportunities to raise issues directly with decision-makers (including policy-makers) across a wide range of issues affecting children\u2019s lives; more (and better) listening on the part of teachers and other professionals; better publicising of children\u2019s views in the media; and measures to build security for migrants and refugees. In particular, young people felt they should be informed about upcoming decisions a reasonable amount of time in advance, so they could participate in them. Where opportunities had arisen the past (whether at school, at home or within their community), these often came at a relatively late stage in the process when there was more limited scope to influence the outcome. An improved awareness and appreciation of children\u2019s competence to participate was thought to be part of the solution. Although there was a consensus that relationships between adults and children could be improved in many areas, the responsibility for making these changes was not seen to rest solely with adults. It was widely recognised that this should be a two-way process, and that communicating openly and volunteering opinions should be appreciated and practiced by all, within a safe and supportive environment. The role of family was also considered important, and some thought that parents or carers should give children opportunities to develop their self-confidence and participate from a young age, so that this is normalised behaviour. There was also a strong message from the child-led strand that there should be more coverage in the media about events for children and young people, with more regular opportunities given to publicising children and young people\u2019s views and to counteract stereotypes. This final point echoes with the mapping strand, which found that there was comparatively little child participation activity within the media sector across the EU28. 10.3 Conclusions from the EU level research The final area that was examined for the evaluation was the work of EU-level institutions in relation to UNCRC Article 12. As we have discussed in this report, it is clear that the rights of the child is a relatively \u2018young\u2019 policy area for the EU, and that embedding it, including child participation, across all areas has proven challenging . The study found evidence of activities initiated by different EC Directorates-General, and emerging somewhat organically across different spheres of policy responsibility, with youth programming having provided the most longstanding forum for engaging with young people\u2019s active citizenship and personal development. It would be fair to conclude from this evaluation that the appointment of a Commission Coordinator for the Rights of the Child and the establishment of a European Commission inter- service group on the rights of the child, the creation of a Fundamental Rights and Rights of the Child Unit in DG Justice and the European Forum for the Rights of the child have helped to galvanise these different actions and to ensure a stronger rights-based approach for children aged 0-18 in accordance with UNCRC. The study has highlighted scope for further development, however, with a need to go beyond ad hoc project-based opportunities and develop mechanisms for sustained participation by engaging children in meaningful processes that contribute towards EU decision-making and setting in place better mechanisms for monitoring the effectiveness of the work of the European Commission and other EU institutions in this policy area. A clearer road map is also needed on how to implement the raft of EU legislation reflecting Article 12, and to make this tangible and accessible to grassroots NGOs working in the field. It is expected that the results of this study will inform future policy development. ",
        "Evaluation of legislation, policy and practice on child participation in the European Union (EU) March 2015 228 The European Commission faces the fundamental challenge of being far removed from the everyday lives of children, and perhaps the most direct and impactful contributions that it can make as an institution are to support cross-sector and transnational dialogue; to develop and fund pilot programmes and initiatives, and to continue to promote better data collection . The 2013 Recommendation \u2018Investing in children\u2019 stopped just short of common indicators for child participation at an EU-level, but this step might yet be taken. The Council of Europe framework and indicators also provide a widely available resource, which must be taken into account when considering how and through what mechanism(s) to gather data from EU Member States. 10.4 Recommendations On the basis of the evidence reviewed for this study, we have identified a number of recommendations for policy and practice development. These are presented in turn, below. 10.4.1 Specific Recommendations For EU Member States The first set of recommendations is intended for EU Member States. We have proposed a dual approach, aimed on the one hand at mainstreaming child participation processes and practices across all sectors and policy areas, and building the competence and capacity of practitioners and officials whilst also identifying a role for more targeted projects and pilot activities to provide fertile ground for further testing and innovation in this field, and providing tangible opportunities for collaboration between NGOS and official institutions. Recommendation 1 \uf0b7 To review the consistency with which the child's right to participate has been reflected within national legislation, policy and practice, and to acknowledge and where possible - take action - to address the gaps highlighted by this study. These gaps are country-specific, but include for example: age restrictions within legislation imposed on children\u2019s rights to participate; exemptions or gaps that have compounded the vulnerability of particular groups (e.g. asylum seeking children, children in alternative care and Roma children), and gaps in geographical or sector coverage. Recommendation 2 \uf0b7 To consider the merits of establishing a national cross-government strategy and / or action group for child participation, with representation from all key Ministries. This approach acknowledges the status of child participation as a right that underpins all areas of public life, and the emergence of similar cross-Government structures or forums corresponding with other areas of policy in some Member States, such as child poverty reduction. Such an action group might have a role in championing a cross-sectoral approach. Recommendation 3 \uf0b7 To consider introducing mechanisms for embedding child participation across all policy areas and sectors, through capacity building for practitioners The study has underlined that child participation is a shared priority, and that professional knowledge and competence regarding the child\u2019s right to be heard should not be restricted to a narrow field of children and youth work, but should rather extend to other areas of public life (municipal decision-making, health, housing and so forth). This mainstreaming approach requires a stock take with regard to the effectiveness of different professional training and development frameworks, and - potentially - investment in new or strengthened measures. ",
        "Evaluation of legislation, policy and practice on child participation in the European Union (EU) March 2015 229 Recommendation 4 \uf0b7 To consider providing financial support for programmes and initiatives addressing the priorities highlighted by this study, and based on Article 24 of the Charter and Article 12 UNCRC (including General Comment No. 12), with a view to the subsequent mainstreaming of approaches that prove their effectiveness. These programmes might include: 1. Actions to develop cross-professional training and awareness-raising in the field of child participation, with a focus on developing and embedding good practices / pedagogies, and sharing tools, frameworks and packages of continuous professional development. 2. Actions to support the transnational exchanges of professionals, children and young people , to facilitate the transfer of knowledge and good practice between Member States. 3. Actions to support the development of infrastructure for children\u2019s participation ; where there is evidence of a shortfall in capacity at a national or regional level. 4. Actions to develop public awareness-raising or media campaigns with the objective of challenging stigma or stereotypes surrounding child participation, and with inbuilt monitoring and evaluation to review the effectiveness of such campaigns. 5. Actions to fund pilot projects ; especially those that: demonstrate the potential to achieve collaborative and child-led participation; demonstrate the potential to raise levels of participation for vulnerable groups; especially children in alternative care, children with disabilities, or children facing discrimination due to their gender, race or sexuality; and, are designed and led by children and young people, with the appropriate support from child rights organisations, academics and / or public bodies 6. Actions to develop frameworks or tools to improve levels of accountability by public bodies and / or organisations in relation to children\u2019s participation. These actions should demonstrate backing by official bodies, and demonstrate evidence that they will be implemented in such a way as to improve children\u2019s participation rights based on Article 12. Potential examples include: Child Rights Impact Assessments, Child or Youth Inspector Initiatives and Kite-marking schemes. 7. Actions to undertake empirical research to establish the impact of child participation . 10.4.2 Specific Recommendations for the European Commission The second set of recommendations is intended for the European Commission. Recommendation 5 \uf0b7 To reflect upon and discuss the study findings with EU officials, Member States, NGOs, Ombudsmen and representatives from national children\u2019s councils and parliaments. The publication of this study provides, as intended, an important opportunity for the European Commission to bring together a wide range of stakeholders at an EU and Member State level, and to take stock of the progress that has been made with implementing child participation in the EU, supported by research evidence. The European Commission might therefore consider organising discussions with stakeholders, and initiating debate in other ways. ",
        "Evaluation of legislation, policy and practice on child participation in the European Union (EU) March 2015 230 Recommendation 6 \uf0b7 To consider the merits of developing training and awareness-raising for EU officials on child rights including child participation based on the Charter and UNCRC. The report has highlighted the range of promising work initiated by different EU institutions to strengthen children\u2019s rights, but has also shown that child participation is understood and implemented in different ways. An inter-service programme of training and awareness-raising, grounded in the Charter and UNCRC would add value by ensuring greater clarity and consistency across the range of work that is undertaken by EU officials, including those working in the fields of \u2018children\u2019 and \u2018youth\u2019 policies respectively. Recommendation 7 \uf0b7 To review future EU initiatives, to ensure that child participation is factored into their design and implementation as a crosscutting theme Child participation underpins all other child rights. As such, it would be beneficial for the European Commission to identify a suitable mechanism to ensure that child participation is taken into account for EU-level initiatives on a cross-sectoral basis (i.e. across all areas, ranging from environment, to education, transport, housing and sustainable development, and so forth). This would ensure that children and young people\u2019s views are heard and acted upon at the stage when these policies are designed and developed, as well as being factored into their implementation. This requires a more systematic approach than consultation via surveys and events, and might include the participation of children in advising upon the implementation, monitoring and evaluation of policies so that the Commission is held accountable to children\u2019s views throughout the policy cycle. This approach is very much consistent with the Lansdown monitoring framework 603 . Examples might include: \uf0b7 Establishing new Structural Dialogue mechanisms, such as an EU-level children and young people\u2019s consultative group(s) with representation from different EU Member States, to be consulted at key points during the design and development of new initiatives, and providing their views through any subsequent independent evaluation. This would provide a clear and visible mechanism for ensuring accountability. \uf0b7 More widespread use of Child Rights Impact Assessments in relation to EU policy- making, so that the effects of policy decisions on children are fully taken into account. To ensure that such a mechanism was participatory, the Impact Assessment would need to include an appraisal by children and young people and not solely by adults. Recommendation 8 \uf0b7 To accompany future EU-level recommendations or directives that include reference to child participation with additional practical guidance; to ensure that there is a consistent understanding of what child participation entails, and how to ensure its effective implementation. A consistent message from the study is that, where legislation has been passed with a child rights dimension or where policy directives have been issued, these are often experienced as remote and bureaucratic by organisations and services working directly with children. This situation would be improved if future EU-level recommendations or directives that include reference to child participation are accompanied by practical guidance for implementation, and are supported with appropriate media or public information campaigns, with specific target groups in mind. These groups might include public officials, professionals who work with children, and children and young people themselves. 603 Ibid. (2011) ",
        "Evaluation of legislation, policy and practice on child participation in the European Union (EU) March 2015 231 10.5 Practical guidelines for children\u2019s participation The following table sets out some practical guidelines for institutions operating at an EU, national, regional and local level. These guidelines are presented as a check-list to help create the necessary conditions for realising children\u2019s participation, based on the evidence gathered through the study. They should be read in conjunction with the Framework for Monitoring and Evaluating Children\u2019s Participation developed by Lansdown (2011), which is has been extensively piloted internationally 604 ; the participation \u2018principles\u2019 from the Council of Europe Recommendation 605 , and the relevant legislative, policy and programme documents within individual Member States. General Comment No. 12 606 of UNCRC provides detailed guidance for governments and other stakeholders on how to implement Article 12 within legislation, policy and practice; including within individual settings. An accompanying resource guide 607 is also available for General Comment No. 12. Table 10.2 Practical guidelines for child participation EU level Suggested guidelines for official institutions of the EU a. Promote further cooperation between individual EU institutions to share research and practice evidence for children\u2019s participation, and to foster a mutual understanding of what constitutes effective participation. b. Ensure that UNCRC Article 12 is fully understood and valued across the European Commission, and that children\u2019s participation is a crosscutting theme for the work of individual Directorates-General. c. Consider the role of publicity and communications campaigns in the work of the European Commission as a means of providing targeted messages about children\u2019s participation rights, including the issues faced by specific vulnerable groups of children (e.g. Roma, migrant children and children with disabilities). This might entail drawing attention to contexts in which children\u2019s voices are not heard, and to include a focus on vulnerable and marginalised groups of children facing even more acute problems in accessing their participation rights, to raise awareness and promote debate. d. Ensure continuing cross-sector collaboration between EU institutions and international child rights organisations, and maintain suitable forums to give this work focus. National level Suggested guidelines for national Governments of EU Member States National government and legislation a. Review and withdraw any reservations to UNCRC Article 12 that prevent its full implementation within national law, including any specific age limits in respect of a child\u2019s right to be heard. b. Review and seek to address any areas of policy where the participation rights of specific groups of children (e.g. unaccompanied migrant children) are constrained by existing legislation and take action if necessary. 604 Available at: http://resourcecentre.savethechildren.se/library/framework-monitoring-and-evaluating-childrens- participation-preparatory-draft-piloting 605 Council of Europe Recommendation CM/REC(2012)2 of 28 March 2012 of the Committee of Ministers to member States on the participation of children and young people under the age of 18: https://wcd.coe.int/ViewDoc.jsp?id=1927229&Site=CM 606 Available at: http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/crc/docs/AdvanceVersions/CRC-C-GC-12.pdf 607 Available at: http://www.savethechildren.org.uk/resources/online-library/every-childs-right-be-heard ",

This list is not exhaustive. Annex Two: Good practice in children\u2019s participation Austria Welt der Kinder / A Child\u2019s World 608 is an NGO set up in the province of Vorarlberg which aims at promoting children\u2019s rights and children\u2019s participation in local and regional government and services. It receives strong support from, and works in close collaboration with, the province\u2019s Department of Families ( Familienreferat der Vorarlberger Landesregierung ). The work of A Child\u2019s World is a mix of project development, training and training on-the-job as well as coaching for people working in communities. The NGO also works on deepening training in methods of child participation; networking with NGO\u2019s; collaborating with schools, think-tanks and fora of shared learning. An annual conference \u201cChildhood and Society\u201d, from 2014 and a biennial conference, Childhood, Youth and Society is planned, with a strong focus on participatory approaches. Examples of participation have included: children taking part in developing questionnaires that are aimed at exploring children\u2019s environment; children\u2019s conferences; theatre workshops; children\u2019s caf\u00e9; and Plant- for-the-Planet (environmental training for children, organised by children). A Child\u2019s World has trained facilitators in 12 communities, from very small ones with only 3000 habitants, to cities of 40.000 habitants. The results were displayed to decision-makers, which improved political support. The NGO finds that inviting children for cooperation and participation creates a positive dynamic amongst the children, with their parents and in neighbourhoods and communities. This contributes to a cultural change. www.weltderkinder.at Children\u2019s counsellors in custody proceedings / Kinderbeistand provides advocacy and support for children in difficult family situations at court 609 . Children from age ten onwards must be heard by the judge in civil justice proceedings (parental divorce). Younger children also might be heard, which is usually done by other professionals (e.g. psychologists, social workers, youth authorities). Children who have reached the age of 14 have a proper legal status, rights to request information and rights of appeal. One of the most important legislative changes was the establishment of a children's counsellor in custody proceedings ( Kinderbeistand ), enshrined in the Children\u2019s Counsellors Act ( Kinderbeistand-Gesetz) . This is a specifically important measure with regard to children\u2019s participation in the framework of custody proceedings after parental divorce. It provides children from five up to 14 years of age in proceedings regarding parental custody and right to personal contact, with a children\u2019s counsellor. If circumstances so require and under the premise of their approval, children\u2019s counsellors are also provided for 14 to 16 year olds. The children\u2019s counsellor gives the child a voice, helps the child to articulate their thoughts, and supports children emotionally and legally. The children\u2019s counsellor is considered to have \u201cmouthpiece function\u201d for the child. Children (or their parents) do not have the right to involve a children\u2019s counsellor by themselves; this measure has to be ordered by the judge (either because the parents express their wish to do so, or because the judge estimates this measure as helpful for the child), but there is no obligation through legislation to provide a children\u2019s counsellor. There are so far large differences in provision between the nine Austrian provinces. 608 www.weltderkinder.at 609 http://www.coe.int/t/dghl/standardsetting/childjustice/Austria%20child%20assistant%20mode l_engl.pdf ",

It is fully run by the pupils themselves, involving direct participation by children and recognised by the minister. Since 2000 it has been subsidised by the Ministry of Education. The association participates, among others, in the Flemish Education Council. The Flemish Youth Council (FYC) 611 is the official advisory body of the Flemish Government on all matters concerning children and young people. This means that all Flemish Ministers have to ask the Flemish Youth Council for advice whenever they want to make a decision that will have consequences for children and young people. It also means that the Flemish Youth Council may give advice of its own accord, if policy makers forget to ask for advice or when the FYC deems it necessary. The council is composed of 24 youngsters. Since 2013 it has been supported and integrated under \u2018Ambrassade\u2019 which is an organisation of 35 civil servants that work to support youth, youth information and youth policy. Stamp Media 612 (BE ) is a press agency run by young people (16-26) that expresses the view of young people on the latest news in the world. It has run news bulletins every month since May 2008. Reporting is done by young people themselves. It aims to reflect the point of view of young people, particularly on issues where their opinion is important and does not penetrate mainstream channels. Vertical poverty consultation 613 with children from poor backgrounds and education authorities is enshrined via a legal framework in Belgium. In contrast to indirect forms of participation, \u2018vertical poverty consultation\u2019 involves children from poor backgrounds participating twice a year with the minister of a policy domain, through the structure of the Network against Poverty. Vertical poverty consultations are rooted in the decree on the fight against poverty (FL, 2003) which is explicit about the participation of the poor in anti-poverty policy development. It is based on a realisation that though parents are consulted, they may have very different concerns. \u2018What do you think\u2019 614 is a UNICEF project whose aim is to promote children\u2019s right to freedom of speech and right to participation with vulnerable children. It is a long-term project where the process is considered to be as important as the outcome. Children are questioned on their opinions on issues that are relevant to their vulnerable situation and asked to indicate what is relevant and important to them. This project involves the genuine participation of children; through collaboration and shared realisation with adults. The project has been in existence since 2002. The groups involved include: (unaccompanied) migrating minors/refugees, (2004); children in hospital, including psychiatric care (2006); children with disabilities (2007); children in poverty (2010); children giving opinion on all sectors (2009) with the aim of providing input for the 2010 report on the rights of the child for the UN.; and children talking on the theme of equal chances in school (which was planned for 2013). 610 http://www.scholierenkoepel.be 611 http://vlaamsejeugdraad.be/ 612 http://www.stampmedia.be/ 613 http://www.vlaandereninactie.be/en/topics/poverty-child-poverty 614 http://www.unicef.be/nl/page/project-what-do-you-think ",

Bulgaria The Bulgarian Children\u2019s Council consists of child members who have developed a mechanism for child participation. The Children\u2019s Council has been set up with the State Agency for Child Protection since 2003. It consists of 35 representatives of children from the country\u2019s all 28 administrative regions and non-governmental organizations for disadvantaged children. The Children\u2019s Council is a consulting body to the SACP Chair and its main function is to represent the child viewpoint on policies and questions in the context of Art. 12 of the UNCRC.\u201d The council is formed by selecting a representative for an administrative area who is up to age 18. He speaks on behalf of the children of that area. The Children\u2019s Council includes students, as well as children from specialized institutions, from minority ethnic groups and children with disabilities. The Council meets several times a year with the help of an SACP expert team that creates the link between the children and institutions as well as helps set up and conduct meetings. User involvement of children with disabilities in alternative care - An NGO called the Cedar Foundation 616 runs a project focused on the involvement of children with disabilities in alternative care as a step towards complete social integration . Due to difficulties in communication, and negative views of the rights and abilities of children with disabilities, adults customarily make decisions for children with disabilities or learning difficulties therefore excluding children from participating in decisions about matters that affect them. The aim of the project is to train professionals working with children and young people with disabilities in new ways of including their clients in all processes and encompassing decisions about their life. The good practice they employ is based on methods for planning with emphasis on alternative methods of communication, as one of the ways to protect the rights of the child. Children benefit through realisation of their abilities, self-knowledge, improved communication and greater opporutnity for self-expression, newly gained confidence, freedom, self-esteem, changed status in hierarchical links and improved relationships. Listen to the Child 617 coordinated by Social Activities and Practices Institute (SAPI), an NGO active on the national level, has created a model for child-friendly interviewing of underage participants in legal procedures (children as victims of crime). The model has special emphasis on raising the competence of professionals who interact with them. They also provide specialist support and child friendly interview spaces.

The Democracy Campaign is based on the assumption that public authority decision making needs to be balanced by direct participation in communities. The building blocks of the democracy campaign in Schleswig-Holstein include: developing policies and providing materials for participation; legal anchoring of participation; financial support; training and preparation for participation. 625 http://pakolaisapu.fi/en/our-work-in-finland/tukiverkko.html 626 \u2018 Child and Youth Participation in Finland: A Council of Europe policy review\u2019 , Council of Europe, Strasbourg, 2011 627 http://anacej.asso.fr/ 628 http://meirieu.com/ECHANGES/legal_atelier_democratie_familiale.pdf 629 http://pel.lachapellesurerdre.fr/wordpress-pel/?cat=24 ",

Children\u2019s participation in playground design/planning - The participation of children when building a new playground or similar projects is already the norm in Germany. While there is no legal obligation, it is very common across the country. Implementation processes differ. The more local the decision making process, the more participation for children exists. For example in Stuttgart the \u201c Kinderforum \u201d together with the \u201cStadtplanungsamt\u201d promote the participation of children in decisions on how the city should look, how to renovate and to build. Participation occurs on a specific day per year where children are invited to present their ideas. Children are supported by pedagogues in their schools to develop their ideas and to present them during this day. About 80% of the proposals of children are successful. Small things are changed quickly; bigger projects need about 1-3 years. Participating children are aged between 5 and 13 years. Struktwieter Dialog (Ger) supported by the Ministry of youth aims to inform and exchange on children rights and child participation and to inform on European issues on child participation. The Nationaler Aktionsplan broadened the debate and gave greater awareness to the importance of children rights. Kinder und Jugendreport (child and youth report) was undertaken with the contribution of children. It is a reflection of the situation in Germany and helps to tackle future issues.

Learn about your rights\u201d conference in 2012). It aimed to explore democracy in schools, exchange ideas and formulate suggestions. The children gave their personal experiences, discussed with experts ways to defend their rights and proposed solutions for a more harmonic, democratic and creative daily co-living in their school environment. At the end of the conference, a set of proposals was voted upon. Children collaborate with teachers in the planning and organisation of activities and are highly positive about the initiative. The Quality4Children Workshop 631 was developed by SOS Children\u2019s Village to prepare the implementation of the Quality4Children Standards for out-of-home child care (for ages 5-18 years) in Europe.

Pupil unions are in regular contact with decision makers about issues concerning school as well as city wide issues such as transport. The participation takes place at various decision making stages. Often pupils are consulted regarding the legislative proposals but also take part in the ministerial working groups and therefore contribute to the development of proposals themselves. They also aim to influence change through meetings, lobbying, dissemination of information through press, public campaigns, participation in working groups, and through written papers.

Any young person with an interest in entering into a debate with real politicians can enter into a provincial debate competition. When they participate, they receive training in debate and presentation skills. The winners of each provincial debate go through to a next round to compete at national level. The national debate takes place with real politicians. The debate contains subjects important to the youth and is widely disseminated in the media. This popular event has taken place since 1996 although no evaluation has been conducted for over ten years. The municipalities considered the debate an integral part of their participation policy, but were not able to attribute the debate to wider participation results. This was partly due to the fact that most municipalities had only just started to develop participation policies. Based on non-evaluation documents and interviews, the debate is considered one of the most successful methods to generate interest in participation of youth Inspectieteam Jeugdzorg Q4C \u2013 Institutional care youth inspection developed by the Stichting Alexander non-profit research and advice bureau 651 , the Inspecionteam Youthcare Q4C, involves young people in institutional care settings in the inspection of their own institution. Teams of 8 young people conduct research in their institution and particularly on the quality of care and the ability to improve the quality, from the perspective of the client. The results are presented by the youth to the board of the institution. They then advise the staff and professionals about the improving of the policy. The teams are trained and supervised by staff from Stichting Alexander. The teams learn in a structured and effective way to look at the care with their own quality norms. Dutch Youth Council 652 is the most visible form of youth participation in the Netherlands. Their activities include; the Annual award for the municipality with the best youth participation activities; Annual Youth Debate; and the annual selection for a youth representative in the UN. The NJR is consulted on all policies concerning children and young people and participates in the development of new policies. The NJR is sufficiently funded to be able to be sustainable and ensure a high involvement and well-rounded role in these processes, however it only involves young people aged 12 and up. The Youth Council and its role in policy is just as important as the municipal participation plans. Whereas the Council may influence policy with a large impact, the local plans allow individual children to think along with the developments in their neighbourhood. Several research projects have been undertaken to identify good practices at local level. The Youth Institute has gathered (some of) these good practices and distributes them amongst practitioners via an online database.

Portugal Escola da Ponte is a unique educational model developing over two decades, which includes the participation of children (6-16 years) as a basic principle. The impact of their work led to the Ministry of Education to recognise a special status, with different operating conditions of regular schools in order to enforce its model of teaching and learning. It is organised according to a very unique logic of pedagogic and institutional organization, involving projects and team work. There are no regular classes with one teacher for each class or a distribution of students by years of schooling, instead students work in heterogeneous groups, within which students participate in \u201cmutual learning\u201d. Learning is in \"open areas\" according to principles based on rights, citizenship and active participation. Each student is author and actor of their own educational pathway - enabling active participation in the process of knowledge construction. Children who enter school for the first time are immediately involved in the processes of decision making, so at the beginning of the school year all students together, organize the school: organisation of working groups, choice of \"teacher-tutor\", introduction of self-planning, etc. It is also the time of election to the Board of Assembly, the highest decision-making body for students, in which participates all students, staff, parents, trainees and other researchers and visitors. For this election, students are organized into lists, composed of ten elements of all the years of schooling (even younger) and gender equality. Then there is an election campaign, with debates, presentations, etc. It ends with voting and election of the different elements. In weekly assemblies, matters proposed by students are discussed and voted. The school agenda is therefore shaped by children. There is a bi-weekly plan, which contains individual tasks and also tasks across the whole school. It is designed by children with the tutor-teacher (chosen by them) and is the baseline document from which each student chooses him/her daily activities, the Day-Plan. 654 http://fdn.pl/en 655 http://www.civispolonus.org.pl/ 656 http://www.ceo.org.pl/ ",

The project had two objectives: i) to empower families and parents in Romania through the provision of information on their responsibilities in relation to their children which arise from this law and other international conventions and ii) to train professional groups whose activities are related to children, or may have an impact on their lives, such as: social workers, doctors, teachers, priests, policemen, lawyers, judges etc. to develop their capacity to implement effectively the new legislation. One of the major achievements of the project was the development of six targeted learning manuals. The manuals have a special chapter regarding children\u2019s participation. The manuals are not generic to all professional groups nor are they theoretical but bring best practice examples and set out concrete actions professionals can take to implement child friendly practices in their specific profession. The project also used the training of trainers approach creating a network of over 200 trainers across the country, with impacts on Child Protection training and improving local inter-institutional partnerships for children rights promotion. An impact for children was the creation of SPUNE! (Say it) Children\u2019s Council which produced the first-ever comprehensive report by the children of Romania on the observance of child right and was included as an official, unedited annex of the official Report to the UN Committee for the Rights of the Child in October 2007. Locally, the local SPUNE teams stimulated the involvement of over 30,000 children through the carrying out of 150 child-initiated actions nationwide (e.g. organisation of debates, production and distribution of information materials, drawing contest, charitable / humanitarian actions, etc.) to increase understanding among children of what child rights mean for them.

        "Evaluation of legislation, policy and practice on child participation in the European Union (EU) March 2015 269 N\u00e1ruc Crisis centre for children victims of domestic violence, abuse and neglect 664 -- Children are in the crisis centre for a maximum of 3 to 6 months due to a court order or after an agreement with the parents or guardian. Children can be placed in the centre from 3-18 years old, but most of them are 8-12 years old. Throughout the process of being in the crisis centre children are in dialogue with their care takers and all the staff in the crisis centre. In the beginning staff (care takers, social workers) are building up trust with the children. Existing children in the centre have active roles explaining what the daily routine in the centre is, where they will go to school etc. Children can have a say on the room they live in and how they would like to decorate it. When children leave the centre the staff consult them about their wishes on where they want to go. Due to their daily contact with the children, they know what the children like, their emotions, experiences, etc. They do discuss their future lives and try where possible to cooperate with the parents or family (if non-abusive). Staff try to make it possible for the children to go back to their families and therefore work closely with the families and parents. All workers receive specialist training and training is organised every year for all staff of the centre (including cooks, etc) on how to communicate with children who have experienced abuse. Children can affect the decisions affecting them about where to go to out of the centre; they are listened to and taken seriously. If their wishes cannot be granted this is explained to them. ZPMPvSK: self-advocacy for mentally disabled people 665 was a project undertaken with four partner organisations working with mentally disabled people in Poland, the Czech Republic, Hungary and the Slovak Republic (ZPMPvSK) in 2012. The project aimed to support the development of self advocacy by developing the competences of professionals and self advocates, raising public awareness and supporting the development of self advocacy. It sought to empower children with mental health problems. Navr\u00e1t: children in foster families 666 - this is an NGO focussing on children moving from institutional care into foster families. Uses the peer-to-peer principle, teenagers from one region support teenagers from another region through a kind of mentoring support, where young adults support teenagers in foster care. Weekend sessions were organised for the young adults in order to become junior counsellors on issues such as social and legal protection of children. 17 young people wrote a book for children in foster families (\u2018The book of life\u2019), which included information on what it is important to take into account and to empower children to become more self-confident and more able to speak about painful experiences and suggested solutions. In 2013, Navr\u00e1t organised a weekend session to consult children and young people (14-21 years) who experienced the child protection system as experts to suggest solutions which could change the system for social workers, psychologists, therapists, but also for teachers who teach children from difficult family circumstances. The young people involved were very satisfied with the opportunity to participate and have their voices heard; for many of them it was the first time they were asked about some topics. Navr\u00e1t also organised a public hearing for 11 young people from foster families who talked to 50 professionals from different Slovak institutions. They formulated 13 suggestions for professionals, which were presented to the public and the ombudsman and disseminated to appropriate institutions. The hearing resulted in a big reaction from the ombudsman and organistaions raising awareness about problems of this target group and undertook appropriate research (including IUVENTA).

        "Evaluation of legislation, policy and practice on child participation in the European Union (EU) March 2015 270 The National Action Plan on children\u2019s rights is currently being written with the active involvement of children. A committee on children and youth was created within the Ministry of Social Affairs, working on a policy document on children\u2019s rights, which also involved the Youth Council. This committee created another committee of children of 6-8 years old who contributed to these policies and in this way children were integrated in public policies. Children\u2019s parliaments 668 - a specialist version of children\u2019s parliaments has been formed composed of representatives of children in children\u2019s homes. Four of these regional parliaments currently exist. Slovenia Children\u2019s parliaments 669 are an executive body of association of school pupils. School parliaments consist of pupils elected by association of school pupils. The children's parliament is based on Article 12 UNCRC\". As early as 1990, children in Slovenia proposed to establish a forum to discuss their problems with adults. Adults responded positively and thus children\u2019s parliaments became a part of the Slovenian educational and social practice. In October 1990, children from primary schools around Slovenia (105 children from 44 local communities), after discussions at all levels (schools, local government), entered the Slovenian Parliament and as a group of the youngest citizens offered the highest representatives of the state and its authorities their opinions, suggestions and criticisms. The organisation of primary school pupils (from 6 to 15 years old) in a school parliament is provided by Slovenian Association of Friends of Youth, whose activities are carried out in schools. All primary schools organise school Children\u2019s' Parliament which consists of class representatives. Discussions are on the level of the schools, local communities and the state. Children\u2019s' Parliaments are also organised on regional and national level. Children\u2019s Parliaments are seen as the highest level of participation with children\u2019s suggestions influencing decision making at the national level. Representatives from the state government come to the state parliament and listen to the children, where children once a year discuss the topic that they choose to discuss at this year. Pupils/students present the chosen topic at the national meeting which takes place in the Big Hall of the National Assembly, and in the presence of representatives of Ombudsman, Ministry of Education and Sport, National Education Institute and others. Children's parliaments have to consider the conclusions of previous children's parliaments; and representatives of the government have to report on the progress of implementation of the decisions. Some of the recommendations of the children's parliaments realised fully or in part include: school for parents, TOM telephone free 24 hours a day for children in need, organising safe points (places, institutions) in the cities for children which they need information or protection, information leaflets and brochures for child victims of abuse and certain other communications from the field of leisure and ecology. This was one of the first such experience in Europe, pioneering the search for forms of children's participation in society, without any previous role models in the world and without the recommendations of international organizations, such as we have today (UN, Council of Europe, EU). General upper secondary school councils ( GIMNAZIJA ) and technical and vocational schools : General upper secondary schools also have school councils which include student representatives, who decide upon, among other, complaints concerning obtaining or losing a student status. There are also associations of students which have the same function in technical and vocational schools. In accordance with the rules on the code of conduct in secondary schools, schools must ensure the basic conditions for the work of association of students (facilities and the necessary information). Student representatives also participate in Quality Assurance Commissions, which monitor and establish the quality of educational work. 668 \u2018 Child and Youth Participation in the Slovak Republic: A Council of Europe policy review\u2019 , Council of Europe, Strasbourg, 2012 669 http://elearning-events.dit.ie/unicef/html/unit1/1_6_8.htm ",
        "Evaluation of legislation, policy and practice on child participation in the European Union (EU) March 2015 271 There is also a Commission for the Protection of Students\u2019 Rights, whose its members are appointed by a school council. The association of students works in accordance with its own rules and normally meets outside school hours. Upon agreement of the association of students, head teachers may nominate a mentor for the association. The teachers council, parents council and school council consider proposals, opinions and initiatives communicated by the association of students and inform it about their own positions at least once a year. Students can also organise an association of students. The association is led by a committee which consists of all home-classes representatives. The association organises out-of-school life and activities and considers issues related to educational work and management, and communicates its proposals to school bodies. Student organisation of Slovenia High school students can also join student associations. Associations of students at an individual high school appoint students who become members of the parliament of the School Student Organisation of Slovenia (SSOS). The SSOS aims to: improve the material position of students, enforce and protect the rights of students, ensure the cooperation of students in extra-curricular activities, strengthen and spread the influence of students on the curriculum, learning process and the ways of assessment of knowledge in high schools, improve the quality of relationships in high schools, improve the provision of information and the impact of students on the civil society, ensure school democracy, sovereignty and equality in high schools, and defend equal opportunities for all, defend and strengthen the impact of students on issues related to their material and spiritual growth. In addition to the Presidency, the SSOS also consists of the Council, etc, and liaises with the Student Organisation of Slovenia. Structured dialogue as a method of consultation with young people: Youth Council of Slovenia (MSS) is an association of national youth organisations that are committed to achieving the autonomy of young people. MSS is (through the Office for Youth) in charge of the implementation of the structured dialogue in Slovenia. Structured dialogue as a method of work which the Youth Council of Slovenia has used for more than five years in the field of young people (form 15- 27), actively seeking the views of young people on subjects that are important for them and at the same time seeking to improve the situation of young people in Slovenia. The aim of the structured dialogue is to identify the needs of young people in local communities due to lack of communication between young people and decision-makers, and the desire for greater involvement of young people in the decision-making process. Structured dialogue in the field of youth is an instrument by which young people, youth organisations and youth councils and researchers in the field of youth are actively involved in the political dialogue, with those responsible for youth policy. Its purpose is to enable young people to express their opinions and to formulate measures to support policy decisions, which are then easier for young people to identify with them and take them for legitimate. After those structured dialogues, young people follow the progress of the implementation of their comments, and they have contact with decision making bodies. ",
        "Evaluation of legislation, policy and practice on child participation in the European Union (EU) March 2015 272 Sweden BBIC (Barns behov i centrum) Children in care 670 The National Board of Health and Welfare (Socialstyrelsen) is the governmental agency in charge of giving the municipalities their licenses for starting to work with the BBIC system. Thereafter the municipalities (and their social services) are the responsible for the process. The National Board also conducts voluntary spot-checks with the purpose of controlling the quality of the implementation of the system in the municipalities. BBIC is one of the most important mechanisms for making the voice of vulnerable children heard in Sweden. It is not obligatory; however 285 out of 290 municipalities are adhered to this system. It is a quality-system that contains methods for research, planning and evaluation of children in social care. The main aims are: \uf0b7 To strengthen the status of the child (based mainly on the UNCRC) \uf0b7 To enhance and improve the collaboration around the child, between parents, networks, care givers and social services \uf0b7 To contribute to a better legal security for children and parents \uf0b7 To systemise the work of the social services with the objective to improve monitoring and evaluation of handling and treatment In all phases the best interest of the child as well as the child\u00b4s right to express his/her opinion should prevail, at any stage within the social care system. The child is asked if she/he wishes to state their opinion at all meetings or contact points. There are also templates and protocols for interviewing the child. One of the most important outcomes is that the child\u00b4s perspective is seriously and is systematically documented and taken into account. In the district of Rinkeby-Tensta in Stockholm, the BBIC approach is well developed and is highly mainstreamed throughout the work of the social services. The child rights perspective among the social workers has enhanced and improved the possibility for the children to have their say. \u201cIt gets important when it\u00b4s for real\u201d (Det blir viktigt n\u00e4r det \u00e4r p\u00e5 riktigt!) \u2013 this project was developed between 2010 and 2012. Two national governmental agencies Trafikverket and Boverket developed processes of child participation to be included in the daily urban planning of the municipalities and share best practices with other municipalities. It concerned issues such as traffic, housing, play, and the environment. Children from 2 to 17 years old living in six municipalities took part. All work was done in relation to preschools or schools and the children participated from the planning stage to the final evaluation. The project has worked especially well in the municipality of Borl\u00e4nge (www.borlange.se). Children from two different schools participated (aged between 6-15 years old) over a period of 2-3 years. The children and their teachers worked closely with the department of urban planning at the city council, with the architects, as well as with Trafikverket and Boverket. Outcomes from the project informed the urban development plan. Feedback was arranged whereby the children were able to comment on the result of the joint planning. Since this pilot study the methods have been refined into a democratic model urban planning. 670 http://www.childcentre.info/projects/institutions/dbaFile12713.pdf ",

BOIU\u2019s activities include: \uf0b7 The Ombudsman oversees consultative activities regarding children\u00b4s participation. One of the main achievements is a regional road map for fulfilling the UNCRC in the region (in force 2013-2017). \uf0b7 Local hearings have been organised on numerous occasions with children aged 13-17 share their opinions with stakeholders, politicians and other organisations. This forum is called M\u00f6tesplatsen (Meeting point).

(www.boiu.se/motesplatsen) \uf0b7 Din r\u00f6st (Your voice) was developed and run in 2013 in schools with children aged 10 to 12. The theme of the workshop has been the UNCRC and the possibility for children to state their opinion and make a difference in society. (www.boiu.se/dinrost) \uf0b7 Local planning with small children was achieved in the remodelling of an area in Uppsala (\u00d6stra Sala Backe). When the park K\u00e4llparken was planned the city council, BOIU, and children (and teachers) from a preschool near the park, worked together on the re- design process. Three meetings took place with 11 children aged 5 to 6. Firstly the children looked at models of how the area was planned to be, they also talked about what they liked to do in a park (and outside in general). In the last session the children painted images of how they would like the park to look like and these painting will be exposed in relation with the whole remodelling project. \uf0b7 The Magazine Word is led by an editor at BOIU but the editorial staff are mostly young people 16-19 years old studying at some of Uppsala\u00b4s high schools, they participate in the production of the magazine and also in the planning of future projects.

A method called Talking Mats (\u2018samtalsmatta\u2019 in Swedish) was used and the children were asked to tell about what they liked and didn\u00b4t like at the centre, if they knew why they were there and what they would like to tell other children that entered for the first time. This all led to information to be distributed to children entering this kind of short time care centres.

They learn about the UNCRC and then they work on promoting their ideas, through annual road-maps. This initiative started in 2011 and this year the third group just ended their work. The final reports include everything from critique towards the local government since they think they\u00b4ve been listened to, and ideas on new projects and methods of participation 675 . The project arranges two referendums each year where children and young people living in Kungsbacka can vote on the propositions presented by other children and young people.

They organise conferences and training and work closely with social services all around Sweden. They also have workshops where children of all ages can come and meet with others with the same experiences. Maskrosbarn wrote a report in 2011 on what kind of support children want from society (especially regarding school, social services, drug care and psychiatric care), the report was produced in collaboration with 50 children and young people aged 13-19 living in families with complex needs. One outcome was the development of two checklists to be distributed to all of Sweden\u00b4s 290 social service administrations, and to be published. The first checklist is about the response and reception of the child at the social services, and it builds upon Article 12 UNCRC.

        "Evaluation of legislation, policy and practice on child participation in the European Union (EU) March 2015 299 Method Statement The methodology for the study was divided into three main strands, culminating a comparative analysis and synthesis of the study data to prepare the final report and individual country fiches. All methodological tasks were overseen by the core study team, comprising of representatives from Ecorys, the University of the West of England, and the Child-to-Child Trust. The three strands were: a. Country Mapping b. EU Level Research c. Child-Led Research The activities undertaken for each strand are now described in turn. Country Mapping This strand of the study involved data collection and associated tasks to map legislation, policy and practice in the EU28. A network of 28 country experts was recruited prior to commencement of the study to provide local expertise and access to achieve effective completion of the data collection. All country experts participated in a briefing between 22 nd February 2013 and 8th March 2013. This was to ensure that the mapping of the situation in each Member State was approached in a consistent manner, and that the individuals undertaking the work have a shared understanding of the study aims and methodology. To achieve the required balance of scope of coverage (sectors and settings) and depth of coverage (level of understanding of the main issues, modes of participation, and the situation in specific settings / for specific groups of children), the country mapping exercise was divided into two Phases: \uf0b7 Phase I aimed to understand the overall situation for children\u2019s participation within each country, by identifying the main national legislation and policy directives, as they apply to Article 12 of UNCRC, and the structures and mechanisms that exist to implement them. It examined tools and resources available to support participation in different sectors. \uf0b7 Phase II aimed to undertake an examination of the situation for children\u2019s participation in specific settings and for key groups of vulnerable children within each country, sampled from the lists identified in the Terms of Reference. This phase sought to provide a deeper understanding of the policy and practice dimensions of children\u2019s participation, for the settings and groups in question, and to elicit examples of potential good practice. The various strands of evidence gathered by country experts were used to complete a country fiche template. Final versions of these templates have been edited and made available as study outputs. A total of 331 interviews were conducted across the 28 MS during phases I and II, and a wide range of documents was reviewed. A full list of the stakeholders consulted is provided within this report. ",
        "Evaluation of legislation, policy and practice on child participation in the European Union (EU) March 2015 300 Phase 1 This stage of the mapping exercise required a combination of desk research and documentary analysis, alongside interviews with key national level stakeholders. Specifically the following tasks were undertaken by correspondents in each country: \uf0b7 Country experts began the task with a desk-based review of key national policy and legislative documents that have been used to implement Article 12 UN Convention on the Rights of the Child. \uf0b7 Interviews were also undertaken with key stakeholders from relevant national authorities and child rights organisations. The profile of interviews varied between each country, but included: \uf0a7 Overarching ministry / civil servant representatives with an overview of children\u2019s rights \uf0a7 Ombudsperson \uf0a7 Leading academics \uf0a7 NGOs e.g. national children\u2019s charities and specific participation organisation Coverage of Phase 1 of the mapping Overall arrangements within each country \uf0b7 National legislative/policy framework (including definitions and budget/financing) \uf0b7 Tools, measures, processes and scope \uf0b7 Council of Europe Recommendation \uf0b7 Implementing legislation and policy \uf0b7 Structures and children\u2019s networks \uf0b7 Implementation in practice/on the ground \uf0b7 Cultural attitudes towards children\u2019s participation \uf0b7 Impact Phase II Phase two followed a similar methodology, but focussed on a specific sample of settings and vulnerable groups. The country experts reviewed the emerging findings from Phase I of the country mapping to identify a shortlist. The short-list should be made based on the following criteria: 1. Evidence that these settings / groups are of high priority in your country (i.e. based on the focus afforded to these groups within policy / scale or level of need), and / or 2. Evidence that the policy or practice arrangements for supporting children\u2019s participation for these groups of children / settings are particularly well developed or show potential good practice. The phase II research involved a much more selective review of documents for the chosen settings and vulnerable groups, including specialist legislation, research reports, programme documents, and specific participation practice guides or tools, where these are found. Supplementary interviews were conducted with key stakeholders with expert knowledge of the chosen settings and vulnerable groups. The included: \uf0b7 Ministry representatives with a specialist remit for the setting / groups in question (e.g. a Ministry of Education policy manager for children in local authority care) \uf0b7 Specialist NGO representatives (e.g. a senior representative from an NGO specialising in support for children with a parent in prison, etc.) \uf0b7 Workforce organisations (e.g. sector bodies, Trade Unions) ",

During the fieldwork, the 28 country experts were closely monitored by members of the core team, who received weekly updates on their progress. The project manager discussed weekly the most relevant issues and difficulties encountered in the various countries. EU-Level Research In parallel to the country level research, a comparable mapping exercise was undertaken to examine actions at an EU Level. The scope of the evaluation included work undertaken by the EU on child participation; covering activities activity undertaken by the Commission (including the Commission Representation Offices in the Member States), the European Parliament, the Council of the EU, the Committee of the Regions and the European Economic and Social Committee. An additional set of interviews was undertaken with \u2018wider\u2019 stakeholders. These were organisations and individuals involved in child participation activity at an EU level or across several Member States. As such these interviews were conducted as a separate strand to identify and explore potential examples of good practice in child participation outside of the work done by Member States. A total of 23 in-depth interviews were conducted for this strand. Complementary desk based research was undertaken to identify, gather and review documents and resources involving child participation released by EU institutions. ",
        "Evaluation of legislation, policy and practice on child participation in the European Union (EU) March 2015 302 Child-Led Research The child-led strand of the evaluation comprised of the design and implementation of 11 child- led participatory projects, themed on the main objectives of the study. Groups of children and young people were recruited from 5 EU Member States (Croatia, Greece, Netherlands, Poland and the UK); trained and supported to carry out action research with their peers and adults, and to analyse and report on the findings. This work was managed by CtC and supported by in-country child rights organisations. In total, 111 peer researchers and 630 respondents took part.

        "Evaluation of legislation, policy and practice on child participation in the European Union (EU) March 2015 303 Task Lead Process Timescales Child-friendly report of overall study developed by children Child-to-Child, Partner, children, Ecorys Young people from Funky Dragon (NGO in Wales) worked with Child-to-Child to develop child-friendly version of main report through workshops and online forums. October- November At the beginning of the research process, organisations submitted applications to the Child-to- Child Trust stating what their approach would be; these proposals were then amended and agreed in conjunction with the Trust. However in practice the precise manner in which the projects would be conducted \u2013 and how children\u2019s participation would be embedded within each of them \u2013 was overseen by the partner organisations themselves. Recruitment of child participants Identification of peer researchers The Child-to-Child Trust envisaged that groups of 6-8 children (the \u2018peer researchers\u2019) would provide the core for each participation activity, and that this core group would engage a wider group of children as interviewees/respondents. There were 111 peer researchers overall, however the numbers in each project varied considerably (see Table below). Ideally, the Trust sought to identify organisations that already had some experience of peer research, however in the end a range of partners were engaged, only some of whom had previously undertaken any form of peer research. This actually provided an interesting balance between organisations that were relatively familiar with peer research and the methods they could employ, and those that had to learn about peer research as the projects developed. In practice, peer researchers were identified in a number of ways. In some cases, a fairly open application process was set up. The Children\u2019s Ombudsman in Greece, for instance, organized two two-day events during which young people would meet, get acquainted and exchange experiences and views about the thematic fields under research. An invitation was sent electronically to a significant number of young people, teachers/educators and other professionals working with children, and it was uploaded on the website www.0-18.gr. The Children\u2019s Ombudsman also contacted various institutions with which it cooperates (e.g. NGOs, special schools for children with disabilities and schools with a large number of Roma children), suggesting they select some young people as participants. The aim was to involve about 50 young people overall, 10 of whom would then undertake the role of peer researchers. Originally it was planned to have researchers selected by the young people themselves by voting, but as it turned out the young people preferred to just allow individuals to put themselves forward. As a result more than 10 peer researchers were identified and it was then possible to allocate more than one interviewer/researcher to smaller focus groups, working in alternate roles. In other cases, peer researchers were drawn mainly or exclusively from pre-existing groups. In the Netherlands, the Youth Care organization, Spirit, asked children attending their project whether they would be interested to join Yohri\u2019s peer-to-peer research, and seventeen children volunteered as part of their social school internship. In Croatia, potential peer researchers were selected from two SOS Children's Villages and four SOS Youth Facilities. The organisers drafted a short summary of the research with the goals and objectives and defined roles and responsibilities, and asked the pedagogical assistants in the village and educators in the youth facilities to present the summary to all children and young people from ages 12 to 17. Eight potential peer researchers applied, three boys and five girls. Also in Croatia, the Office of the Children\u2019s Ombudsperson selected eight young people from their pre-existing Young Advisors Network, an advisory body of 25 children aged 12-18 set up to provide advice and make recommendations to the Office . Some of the peer researchers came from boarding schools; others lived on islands or in disadvantaged areas; and one was a child with developmental disabilities. ",
        "Evaluation of legislation, policy and practice on child participation in the European Union (EU) March 2015 304 Whereas most projects developed a core group of six peer researchers or more, some struggled to develop or maintain a stable group. In the UK, the Somali Development Group originally identified six children as peer researchers chosen by asking for volunteers who were interested in the research and had time available to take on the project. The peer researchers were recruited and drawn from local schools, mosques and from friends and relatives. One of the peer researchers dropped out leaving two boys and three girls to complete the interviews, but it was hard to maintain commitment from the peer researchers for the duration of the project. Staff from Off the Record (UK) explained the project to one of the weekly meetings of young people with mental health needs (the Mentality group), and then followed up by contacting them by phone, text and email, to encourage their participation. However, most felt that as they had exams coming up, they could not take on any more work; as a result one young woman (aged 16) took on the lead researcher role, supported by another young woman (aged 21) who helped her to carry out tasks such as arranging interviews, creating questionnaires, and facilitating focus groups. The young people from the Mentality project were given smaller tasks, such as giving out questionnaires. Partners were expected to carry out their research with at least 30 children and young people as respondents (excluding the peer researchers). In the event, the majority of the projects surpassed these expectations.

Overall there were 630 respondents under 18 (plus another 30 who fell outside the project criteria, mainly due to their age), but again numbers varied between projects. This depended to some extent dependent on the methods they had chosen. The highest numbers were achieved by the Office of the Children\u2019s Ombudsperson in Croatia, who conducted a survey of 214 elementary and high students aged from 12-16, randomly selected from schools across five areas of the country. The Trust sought as far as practically possible to maintain a balance in terms of including children and young people who reflected different equalities dimensions (e.g. age; gender; race; disability; sexual orientation). Whilst most of the children who took part were in the 15- 17 age range, some were younger. For example, the SOS Children\u2019s Villages in Poland included peer researchers who were aged 11 upwards, and in Croatia from 12-17. The Opatija partner in Croatia identified three groups (17 year olds, 10-13 year olds, and 7-9 year olds); in particular this research led to some interesting conclusions, for example about the different ways that children define \u2018participation\u2019 at different ages. In order to meet the study requirement to address participation among very young children, the Trust engaged the Newstead project in the UK to carry out research with four year olds in a mainstream Children\u2019s Centre; given the age of the children involved, this inevitably involved the development of an innovative way of working, which is described below (see Methods). ",
        "Evaluation of legislation, policy and practice on child participation in the European Union (EU) March 2015 306 The partners were generally successful in recruiting male and female peer researchers and respondents. Of those who broke down figures according to gender, 30 peer researchers were male, and 43 female. Of the respondents where figures are known, 269 were male and 293 female. However, despite this, relatively few comments emerged in the reports that identified the particular influence of gender on children and young people\u2019s experiences and attitudes. Only in the case of the Somali Development Project in the UK (where young women spoke eloquently about the cultural restrictions imposed on them by their families) and Roots in Greece (where girls were more reticent about participating in the project than boys) was significant attention accorded to gender issues. Far fewer participants were disabled, and it appears that only Opatija in Croatia and the Greek Children\u2019s Ombudsman were able to include children and young people with disabilities. Unfortunately, because of these very small numbers it was not possible to draw any useful conclusions in the findings regarding the specific experiences or attitudes of these children, or of the barriers they faced. Whilst the Trust made attempts to engage a project working with young gay and lesbian people in the UK, this contact did not come to fruition. Hence the experience of children from this group is missing, or at least invisible, within the findings. From the outset the Child-to-Child Trust was committed to working with children in variety of sectors and settings and to the development of methodologies to ensure inclusion. Some of the projects were carried out mainly or exclusively with child respondents in mainstream settings such as schools. The Office of the Children\u2019s Ombudsperson in Croatia engaged members of its Young Advisors Network as peer researchers, but they then went back to their own schools in different parts of the country and distributed questionnaires there. The Trust also paid special attention to working with children \u2018in situations of vulnerability\u2019 and therefore approached organisations working with children from a variety of backgrounds. In the end, the partners worked with children and young people who were: \uf0b7 migrants, asylum-seekers or refugees (Yohri [Netherlands], Somali Development Group [UK], Roots [Greece]) \uf0b7 living in foster or residential care (SOS Children\u2019s Villages, Croatia and Poland) \uf0b7 experiencing mental health issues (Off the Record [UK]) \uf0b7 young carers (Black Young Carers [UK]) \uf0b7 from different areas of the country (Greek Children\u2019s Ombudsman, Croatian Children\u2019s Ombudsperson, SOS Children\u2019s Villages in Croatia and Poland) In other cases, special attention was given to including children from a range of disadvantaged groups together. For example, children of foreign or minority origin, young people living in institutions, and children with disabilities were among those selected by the Children\u2019s Ombudsman in Greece, and almost 20% of their participants came from disadvantaged groups. The Children\u2019s Ombudsperson in Croatia ensured that children living on islands or in disadvantaged areas, and children belonging to the Roma minority were also included in their sample. One unusual approach was adopted by Yohri in the Netherlands, who invited the peer researchers to choose amongst themselves the target group they wanted to research. Of various options considered (e.g. children in hospital, children without parents, children in contact with the police, homeless children), refugee children were agreed upon. This was interesting, as in many other peer research projects \u2013 including for this study - children have generally interviewed children from similar backgrounds to their own. ",
        "Evaluation of legislation, policy and practice on child participation in the European Union (EU) March 2015 307 Only in one case did it prove impossible to carry out the planned research at all, owing to the immense difficulties of developing contact with the particular disadvantaged group. The Roots NGO had intended to implement part of their project with Roma children living in a camp in Corinth, Greece, but owing to violent incidents at the camp and in nearby villages it became too dangerous to work there. Moreover, the children Roots had hoped to work with were very upset, and some had to move with their families to other locations. For this reason project staff redirected their focus at the last minute to working with children from the Filipino community in Athens, alongside another group that was already underway in a multicultural school. Induction and training All the partners initiated some induction and training for the children who were to act as peer researchers. But this varied widely in depth and content. For the projects based in Bristol, UK, an initial training workshop was provided in different research methods by providing the opportunity for the young peer researchers to try out different research methods experientially and begin to explore understandings of \u2018participation\u2019. The peer research groups then met on a weekly basis to develop ideas with supporting staff about the questions they will explore, the methods they will use and to build skills in conducting interviews and using media equipment. Off the Record highlighted that \u2018the young people who attended did state that it gave them a much better insight to the research outcomes and methods they could use on this project\u2019 . External research support was provided on a regular basis with subsequent training provided as young people\u2019s ideas started to develop. In contrast, before starting their research, the peer researchers in Opatija (Croatia) had several workshops where they explored the topic of research, techniques and research methods that can be used. After introductory training, they selected the target group and determined who would examine which group: \u2018They selected the methods and techniques that would be used in the study: group conversations, journalism and interviews. They created two sets of questions, one for the younger group and one for the older group of children. Methods that were used in the training were: workshops, power point presentations, brainstorming and role plays. Before conducting the research, the young researchers practiced asking questions through role play\u2019 . The training for the peer researchers from SOS Children\u2019s Villages in Poland and Croatia was also extensive. In the four project locations in Poland a number of workshops and meetings were set up (in one case with a local radio reporter), covering issues such as conducting an interview, communication skills, operating the equipment, and developing interview questions. In Croatia, the training took place in the youth community in Velika Gorica and lasted three days. The peer researchers in Croatia described their experience of the training as follows: \u2018We learned how to avoid anxiety and how to cope with awkward situations, we learned how to be facilitators and co-facilitators, and we learned what would be our tasks during the research. We played different games through which we developed the skills required for facilitation of the focus groups. There were four groups, and each one got one big topic which we elaborated, and about which we asked various questions and answered them. We had test focus groups, in which we played our roles in a familiar environment, helping each other through commentaries, feedback and support\u2019 . ",
        "Evaluation of legislation, policy and practice on child participation in the European Union (EU) March 2015 308 For the Yohri project in the Netherlands, an initial meeting was held (attended by eight girls and seven boys, aged 13 to 15) where the young researchers met each other and learned about: children\u2019s rights, participation, and peer-to-peer research methods, and selected their research target group. They practised interview techniques by role-play and interviewing each other. They wrote the answers down on paper, which was used afterwards as article and research information in a magazine about the research. This was followed by a residential weekend, during which they decided on the specific research methods and focus group locations, and formulated their questions. For the first stage of the Roots project in Greece, the facilitators met with a small group of six children who would become peer researchers, and worked on their understanding of participation and children\u2019s rights. The facilitators asked the children to create their own groups to undertake research with their peers; the children chose to explore the latter\u2019s understanding of their rights. The peer researchers were given the freedom to do this in any way they wanted and were provided them with tools such as cameras, tape recorders, and cards. Given that their research was conducted at two main meetings in Thessaloniki and Athens, the Office of the Children\u2019s Ombudsman in Greece inevitably adopted a slightly different approach to training. All young people \u2013 both peer researchers and interviewees \u2013 took part in similar initial activities to those described above (including ice-breaker games, exercises to establish trust, interview role plays), but the staff also made presentations about the themes the focus groups could cover, including family/alternative care, school, friends, services, and other fields of social life. Following evaluation of the first meeting, further sessions were added to the second, providing more detailed understanding of the right to participation. Those interested in becoming researchers also received a special briefing and directions about the proposed procedure. Research methods The main methods used in the research were questionnaires, individual interviews, and focus groups. A variety of research tools were used to implement the methods. Many of these drew upon tools outlined in the Peer Research Guide produced by the Trust (e.g. group questions, mapping exercises, face-to-face questionnaire, reporter role), but some were developed by the children and young people themselves. Questionnaires are generally well suited to producing statistics, analysing patterns, and highlighting trends, and are usually fairly quick and cheap to administer. They were used by several of the projects. Although they produced some useful material, in most cases the numbers of questionnaire responses was relatively small so it was then hard to develop any robust statistics from the data. Some of the questionnaires also involved a mixture of \u2018open\u2019 and \u2018closed\u2019 questions and this again made analysis more difficult to do. The Office of the Children\u2019s Ombudsperson in Croatia was, however, successful in generating a large number of questionnaire responses. Members of the Young Advisors Network, assisted by adult project coordinators, designed a questionnaire composed of 15 items, divided into four main sections reflecting the overall objectives of the study. The questionnaire was piloted through an online forum with members of the Young Advisors Network, and slightly modified according to their suggestions. The first category of the questionnaire explored issues such as participation in decisions about education; whether children's and young people's views were listened to and considered; whether they were encouraged to express their views on school; the consequences of expressing one's opinion; whether children were given the opportunity to freely express their opinions and participate in educational decision making; and the impact of children's involvement in decision-making (i.e. whether children could effect change in school policy or programmes). ",
        "Evaluation of legislation, policy and practice on child participation in the European Union (EU) March 2015 309 The second explored whether children and young people believed that they should offer their opinions in any given situation; the children's right to be provided opportunities to participate by voicing their opinions and ideas; and the work of the Student Council. The third sought to determine what the most common obstacles to children's participation in school decision making were and what could deter children from expressing their views on school issues. The last category aimed to explore the most common solutions to help children and young people overcome the challenges they faced. Although interviews are more time-consuming to set up and carry out, they are an adaptable format, and enable the interviewer to follow up ideas, probe responses and investigate feelings, which a questionnaire cannot do. The Polish report by SOS Children\u2019s Villages confirmed that \u2018the results of qualitative research obtained through in-depth scenario interviews provided an insight into the reasons for decisions and the motivation of the young people taking them. The data revealed some of the children\u2019s experience and life stories\u2019 . Whilst the training clearly helped the peer researchers to undertake the interviews effectively, there was a sense from the reports that interviewing presented the researchers with a significant challenge. Nevertheless their confidence grew as the project developed and they gained more practice. The Polish report noted that through this research the young interviewers learnt how to develop conversations, enquire and listen actively. As one of the peer researchers put it: \u2018 I think my last interviews were the most successful ones ; I\u2019d never thought that it\u2019s so difficult to listen, just listen without interrupting (\u2026) because I did interrupt my interviewee a few times\u2019 (Boy, aged 16). Focus groups allow for interaction between the group members so that ideas can be developed, but they can be difficult to steer and control. Nevertheless, for the research by the Children\u2019s Ombudsman in Greece, discussions were conducted in groups of five, with a young person facilitating the discussions. Audio recordings were made by the children themselves in order to be able to make better use of the material collected afterwards. Despite the risk of coming up with material that was not directly comparable, the semi-structured group discussions were satisfying for those involved and made it possible to produce a wider range of information. Some of the partners used a combination of methods. Unusually, in the research undertaken by the Somali Development Group in the UK, material was gathered using a variety of media depending on the choice of the interviewee \u2013 either voice recording only, or video camera or handwritten questionnaire. Interviews were drawn up through consultation between the peer researchers and staff, and used to try to ensure some uniformity, however not all children answered all the questions. In some cases the peer researchers struggled to maintain the flow of an interview, particularly when recording was sometimes carried out in relatively noisy locations, such as in the street. For the Yohri research in the Netherlands, the peer researchers adopted the role of reporters, investigating the research participants\u2019 views and experience of participation, and writing up their conclusions in a child-friendly magazine. They were also involved in taking photographs for and designing aspects of, the magazine. Whilst the researchers enjoyed this innovative project and learnt a lot about the experiences of refugees, they appeared to find it difficult to maintain a focus on the primary objective of researching participation. Perhaps inevitably, some of their questions and conclusions tended to highlight the living circumstances of refugees, and differences in the experiences of refugees in the Netherlands and in their countries of origin, rather than their experiences of and attitudes towards participation.

        "Evaluation of legislation, policy and practice on child participation in the European Union (EU) March 2015 310 Ethical issues The Trust expected that adult staff members in each partner organisation would need to hold responsibility for ensuring that high quality was maintained and that ethical standards were adhered to. For example, before they were able to participate in the study, partners were also asked to send a copy of their child protection policy to the Child-to-Child Trust. In a small number of cases, where organisations did not have their own policy, they signed a statement produced by the Trust. A further requirement was that a consent form should be signed by each participating child and that for children aged 16 or under written consent of parents or carers should be gained prior to any involvement in the participatory activity/ies. Partners were also obliged to give both children and responsible adults sufficient information about the project to make informed decisions about consent. The Trust did not have the resources to manage the additional administrative burden that would have resulted from checking the forms for each participating child. Hence this was a process for which the partner organizations took full responsibility. The information from reports by the partners suggests they made strenuous efforts to ensure appropriate consent was gained: \uf0b7 \u2018Written consents on participation and photo documentation record were collected from the participants and their legal carers. The carers were also informed on the project objectives, the voluntary participation rule, and the possibility of resigning at any stage of the study\u2019 . (SOS Children\u2019s Villages, Poland) \uf0b7 \u2018Adolescents and their parents were asked to sign consent forms before the meetings, including information about the research, the participation terms in the meetings, the way the material shall be utilized afterwards (anonymity, consent for photographing and briefing about the use of photos for the action\u2019s publicity). They were also informed that they can leave at any time during the procedure if they wish to do so\u2019. (Children\u2019s Ombudsman, Greece) \uf0b7 \u2018The survey was carried out in accordance with the principles set out in the Code of Ethical Conduct in social research involving children in Croatia, and parental consent was obtained in writing for research participation by minor respondents under 14 years of age; all participants were required to give their written consent to participate in a research study\u2019 . (Office of the Children\u2019s Ombudsperson, Croatia) \uf0b7 \u2018In addition to gaining the children\u2019s verbal consent we felt it was important to explain the project to the parents of the peer researchers and research participants. At a parents\u2019 forum, the centre manager introduced the project and explored the commitment required of the children and how this data will be used. The parents approved of this project and many of them had already heard about the project from their children. A consent form was constructed to gain written consent from each parent and, where possible each child could also mark the form to state their approval\u2019 . (Newstead, UK) \uf0b7 \u2018We did receive written consent forms from each parent or from the participating student themselves that participated\u2019 .(Roots, Greece) In the case of the Somali Development Group (UK), all children who elected to take part consented in writing, however parents were not involved. The project report argued that lack of parental involvement was seen as \u2018giving more validity to the children\u2019s responses\u2019 , but acknowledged with hindsight that this \u2018may have left the project vulnerable to criticism\u2019 . They reiterated, however, that children could withdraw their consent at any time, and that none did so during the project. ",
        "Evaluation of legislation, policy and practice on child participation in the European Union (EU) March 2015 311 It might have been expected that issues of access and consent would be problematic for the Yohri project in the Netherlands, when the young peer researchers wanted to go into asylum centres to interview asylum-seeking children. But in practice this was not the case and the centres were very happy with the interest of the young researchers and enthusiastic to work with them. The young researchers were trained to use the consent form before interviewing and Yohri requested that the COA (the Asylum Seekers Support Service) should have the children and their parents sign the consent form before answering any questionnaires. The asylum centres were also asked whether the use of photography would be a problem before, during or after the research process; one of the centres specifically asked the parents of the children with pictures in the magazine produced from the research for their consent. The director of the other centre felt that photography was only acceptable during the \u2018bike festivities\u2019 \u2013 a project activity. Only a few adults with children who were approached didn\u2019t want to cooperate with interviews, perhaps for fear of any impact on their asylum procedure. The report concluded that \u2018as far as we could tell, the interviewees felt free to answer\u2019 . There were other positive examples of partners taking additional measures to ensure ethical standards were upheld. Although the peer researchers were often named and photographed (with appropriate consents), almost all projects chose to anonymise the identities of respondents in the analysis of their data. Reflecting processes elsewhere, during and after the interviews by children from SOS Children\u2019s Villages in Poland, local project co-ordinators were on hand all the time. In practice attendees sometimes wanted to talk about an interview afterwards, either to express doubts about what had been said, or simply because they felt an urge to discuss the interview and its effectiveness. The overriding principle was that \u2018children and young people were not expected to deal with the issues arising on their own\u2019 . The Roots project in Greece outlined how their facilitators and their helpers (teachers, translators) acted as a support system. In the first meeting they explained to the children what the project was and discussed with them ways of developing it. In subsequent meetings \u2018they were just present and alert to answer or facilitate children\u2019s requests and needs (questions, materials and equipment)\u2019 . The Children\u2019s Ombudsman in Greece made sure that young people were escorted to the places where the meetings were held by their parents or their teachers (and special escorts were available for children from vulnerable groups), so that they could all safely attend meetings in either Thessaloniki or Athens. Child participation within the projects SOS Children\u2019s Villages in Poland described clearly the process of children\u2019s involvement at each stage of the research: \u2018The study engaged children and youth at an early stage of establishing the basic framework. Then the participants were included in the process of developing research tools and a relevant analytic survey. They were also responsible for recruiting study respondents and interviewing them. Finally, they took part in compiling the results by conducting relevant discussions and volunteering their own observations and remarks\u2019. The final report was written by the overall co-ordinator, based on reports by staff from the four Polish locations. Each local group of peer researchers completed the project by developing an accessible children\u2019s version of their individual report. The organisers concluded that the young people who carried out the interviews treated their task seriously and responsibly. The report from Yohri in the Netherlands described in similar terms the young people\u2019s involvement in the project from the start: \u2018Together they chose the target group, the research methods, carried out interviews and took photographs, analysed results and wrote articles. Some of them helped preparing the intergenerational meeting. They participated in diverse workshops and learned several skills \u2019. ",
        "Evaluation of legislation, policy and practice on child participation in the European Union (EU) March 2015 312 These included: knowledge of refugee issues, and of children\u2019s rights and participation; research methods (e.g. brainstorming, interview techniques, role-play); photography; graphic design; analysing results and writing; project research visits; and presenting results. In the end, the young people produced, with the help of the organizers, a well-designed magazine describing themselves, their research and their findings. The final report on the project was written by the adult co-ordinator. The Roots project in Greece was unusual in that they worked with two groups of children \u2013 children in a multicultural school and children from the Filipino community \u2013 and the experience of participation between these groups was hugely different. Interestingly, the organisers sought to measure (by scoring on a scale from 1-5) levels of participation based on factors such as: confidence in speaking up in the discussion; energy of the discussion; the initiatives children took; the flow of the discussions; communication and interaction between children and adults; how they listened and responded to each other; how they shared their academic knowledge or personal experiences; and their commitment to the project. Their analysis showed that, among children in the multicultural school, \u2018participation was passive, discussion did not flow easily and in many cases it was a struggle for children to participate\u2019 . Working with children from the Filipino community was however a completely different experience: \u2018Participation was active, fluent and consistent. The educational level and the familiarity of the children in participating in group activities made communication easy and provided a good quality of participation\u2019 . They concluded that: \u2018The low quality of participation in the first group was clearly due to the low self esteem and lack of confidence that these children had. The source of this is the environment and their background stories. They feel unsafe in their environment and the society they are living in. In contrast, the second group was stronger and more united as a group but also more opened minded and well read. This is due to the fact that the children in this group are more educated and more integrated in the society they live in\u2019 . After talking with the children in the multicultural school, however, the coordinators became aware that the children in the group wanted to have tangible \u201cgoals\u201d from participating that were meaningful to them (discussing future work employment, for example), rather than participating purely for the right to be heard. The children and young people from SOS Children\u2019s Villages Croatia not only undertook all aspects of the research, but they also contributed extensively to the final report with a vivid description of their experiences as researchers. This was unique among the projects; whilst on the one hand it did mean that no separate child-friendly report was produced, including children\u2019s perspectives directly in the formal report raised the status of their reflections, setting them alongside those of the adult co-ordinators. The experience of the children at Newstead in the UK was also positive, but again unique among the projects, given the age of the children (two, three and four years old): \u2018When carrying out the data collection the children were serious, purposeful and embraced their tasks efficiently. Their level of professionalism during the interviews took the supporting adults by surprise. They asked the questions using the visual prompts and listened to the answers often reacting to them by either replying or encouraging a more detailed report, saying \u2018what else\u2019 if the answer was only one word. They appeared to be really interested in each other\u2019s\u2019 replies and when a reply was too brief or not in keeping within the frame of the question the young researchers gave back constructive feedback\u2019 . ",
        "Evaluation of legislation, policy and practice on child participation in the European Union (EU) March 2015 313 The supervising adults noted that they did not need to intervene at any point in the data collection and commented that this was significant on two levels: \u2018Firstly it is common during activities for adults to intervene, and secondly this presented a change in power relations between the children and the adults, with us hovering in the background if needed \u2013 and they portrayed maturity in the manner the interviews were conducted. The children owned the process and were interested in what they were doing\u2019 . Sometimes lack of motivation and other commitments meant that children and young people were less involved for the duration of the project than had been originally intended. Young people in the Off the Record project (UK) were trained, created and distributed questionnaires, arranged focus groups and carried out some one-to-one interviews. However, they were not involved in data analysis of the project to any significant level. This was also the case for other projects, such as the Somali Development Group and Roots. The co-ordinator of Yohri stated that, due to delays in responses to the questionnaires by COA, there was little input to really analyse together, but admitted that \u2018I\u2019m honestly not sure if this group of young researchers would have had the patience to analyse at all\u2019 .

        "Evaluation of legislation, policy and practice on child participation in the European Union (EU) March 2015 336 TERMS OF REFERENCE FOR AN EVALUATION Evaluation of legislation, policy and practice on child participation in the EU 1. I NTRODUCTION The promotion and protection of the rights of the child 712 is one of the objectives of the EU on which the Treaty of Lisbon has put further emphasis. Notably, Article 3(3) of the Treaty on European Union explicitly requires the EU to promote the protection of the rights of the child. Furthermore, the EU explicitly recognised the rights of the child as a fundamental right in the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union 713 , specifically in Article 24. Promoting the rights of the child is also a result of international commitments. The rights of the child form part of the fundamental rights that the EU and the Member States are bound to respect under international and European treaties, in particular the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child (UNCRC) and its Optional Protocols 714 and the European Convention on Human Rights 715 (ECHR). The UNCRC is therefore considered as an essential foundation for the realisation of the objectives of the EU and the fostering of EU values. Protection of the rights of the child is rooted in the values and principles of the UNCRC, ratified by all EU Member States and binding on them. 1.1 Context of the study Article 24 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union guarantees the right to such protection and care as is necessary for the well-being of children. An important principle of the Charter is that when decisions are being made on the best interests of children, children may express their views freely and their views shall be taken into consideration on matters which concern them in accordance with their age and maturity. 712 Children, according to the definition of the 1989 UN Convention on the Rights of the Child (UNCRC), are all human beings below the age of 18 years. They are vested with the full range of rights. 713 Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, OJ C 364, 18.12.2000. 714 UN Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, especially Women and Children; UN Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on the sale of children, child prostitution and child pornography; Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on the involvement of children in armed conflict. 715 Full text available at: http://www.echr.coe.int/NR/rdonlyres/D5CC24A7-DC13-4318-B457-5C9014916D7A/0/EnglishAnglais.pdf ",

The EU Agenda presents general principles to ensure that EU action is exemplary in ensuring the respect of the provisions of the Treaties, the Charter and of the UNCRC with regard to the rights of children. The EU Agenda highlights that full recognition of children's rights includes children's right to voice their opinions and participate in making decisions that affect them. The right of all children to be heard and have their views taken seriously in accordance with their age and maturity is also laid down in Article 12 of the UNCRC. It is one of four rights identified by the Committee on the Rights of the Child as general principles of the Convention, relevant to all aspects of implementation of the UNCRC to the interpretation of all other articles. Apart from being a substantive right, it should also be considered in the interpretation and implementation of all other rights. 717 General Comment No 12 of the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child on the right of the child to be heard provides detailed guidance on how to interpret this right, its implications for governments and other stakeholders, and the legislation, policy and practice that are necessary to achieve its full implementation. This is complemented by a resource guide 718 published in 2011. The term \"child participation\" is broader in scope, arising from the right to be heard, but also other articles of the Convention 719 . It has been used to describe \" processes, which include information-sharing and dialogue between children and adults based on mutual respect, and in which children can learn how their views and those of adults are taken into account and shape the outcome of such processes \" . 720 716 COM (2011) 60 final.

        "Evaluation of legislation, policy and practice on child participation in the European Union (EU) March 2015 338 On 28 March 2012, the Council of Europe Committee of Ministers adopted Recommendation to member States CM/Rec(2012)2 721 on the participation of children and young people under the age of 18. The Recommendation sets out a pragmatic approach for the implementation of Article 12 UNCRC. Given the traditional disempowered status of children, Article 12 of the UNCRC has proven to be one of the most challenging to implement, even though child participation is an important means through which other rights are realised. The rationale for this study is to survey what is done in each EU Member State and Croatia 722 to date and - by promoting good practice - to provide a new impetus to tackle existing barriers to child participation and step up its implementation in the EU as a whole. For examples of different types of child participation in different settings, please refer to the resource guide on General Comment No 12, \"Every child's right to be heard\". 723 1.2 Principles of child participation There are certain principles of child participation arising from international standards. Most of the principles summarised below derive from the Council of Europe Recommendation on participation. 724 \uf0b7 There is no age limit on the right of the child or young person to express her or his views freely.

As children and young people acquire greater capacity, adults should encourage them to enjoy, to an increasing degree, their right to influence matters affecting them. \uf0b7 Particular efforts should be made to enable participation of children and young people with fewer opportunities, including those who are vulnerable or affected by discrimination, including discrimination on multiple grounds. \uf0b7 Parents and carers have the primary responsibility for the upbringing and the development of the child and, as such, play a fundamental role in affirming and nurturing the child\u2019s right to participate, from birth onwards. 721 Available at: https://wcd.coe.int/ViewDoc.jsp?id=1927229&Site=CM 722 For the purposes of this study, references to \"Member States\" in these terms of reference should be understood to include Croatia. 723 Available at: http://www.savethechildren.org.uk/resources/online-library/every-childs-right-be-heard 724 Most principles extracted from Council of Europe Recommendation CM/REC(2012)2 of 28 March 2012 of the Committee of Ministers to member States on the participation of children and young people under the age of 18: https://wcd.coe.int/ViewDoc.jsp?id=1927229&Site=CM ",

S UBJECT OF THE CONTRACT a. Objectives and scope of the study The study will evaluate the existing situation by providing a comprehensive overview of the legal and policy framework for child participation at Member State and EU levels. The study will also provide an overview of particular tools and methods, as well as the impact of child participation. By enhancing knowledge of the reality and potential of child participation in the EU, the study results should comprise a baseline for the participation of children in the development and implementation of actions and policies that affect them both at national and EU level, for individual children, groups of children and children as a group - More specifically, the study will map legislation, policy and practice in the 27 Member States of the EU and Croatia with regard to implementation of Article 12 UNCRC and other UNCRC articles pertaining to child participation. The study will also address cultural attitudes to, and cultural acceptance of, child participation in the various settings. 725 The study will identify any barriers to full implementation of Article 12. The study will also address and identify enablers of child participation. The study will further identify and showcase good practice on child participation in the EU Member States, including at local, regional and national levels, as well as within the EU institutions, which could be used to improve possibilities for participation of children in the design, development and implementation of actions, policies and decisions that affect them. 725 See REQ 4 below on settings in scope of this study.
