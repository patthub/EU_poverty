EDUCATION, SKILLS AND LIFELONG LEARNING EARLY LEAVERS FROM EDUCATION AND TRAINING (% OF POPULATION AGED 18-24) Description: Early leaver from education and training refers to a person aged 18 to 24 who has completed at most lower secondary education and is not involved in further education or training. The indicator is expressed as a percentage of the total population aged 18 to 24. Highlights: In the EU, the share of early leavers from education and training has been falling continuously since 2005. Despite improvements in some southern EU Member States, disparities across EU Member States persist up to now (ranging from 2.8% in Croatia to 19.7 in Malta, 2016).

GENDER EQUALITY IN THE LABOUR MARKET GENDER EMPLOYMENT GAP Description: Difference in the employment rates between men and women aged 20-64. Highlights: The reduction of the gender employment gap seems to be on the right track. On average in the EU, this difference decreased from 15.9% in 2005 to 11.6% in 2016. Yet, the declining trend in the gender employment gap in recent years is to some extent due to a decreasing employment of men (unfavourable development); and not only due to an increasing employment rate of women (favourable development). In 2016, gender employment gaps range from 1.9% in Lithuania to 27.7% in Malta. Figure 4: Gender employment gap Source : Eurostat (tesem060) ",

INEQUALITY AND UPWARD MOBILITY INCOME INEQUALITY MEASURED BY THE QUINTILE SHARE RATIO (S80/S20) Description: The income quintile share ratio or S80/S20 ratio is a measure of the inequality of income distribution. It is calculated as the ratio of total income received by the 20% of the population with the highest income (top quintile) to that received by the 20% of the population with the lowest income (lowest quintile). Highlights: The inequality of income distribution in the EU has increased slightly since 2010, with the richest 20% of the population earning about five times more than the poorest 20%. Additional efforts need to be done to bridge the gap between the \u201chaves\u201d and the \u201chave nots\u201d. Considerable differences are found between Member States, with the income quintile share ratio ranging in 2016 from 7.9 in Bulgaria to 3.5 the Czech Republic.

LIVING CONDITIONS AND POVERTY PEOPLE AT RISK OF POVERTY OR SOCIAL EXCLUSION (AROPE) (% OF TOTAL POPULATION) Description: People are considered to be at risk of poverty or social exclusion if they experience one or more of the following three conditions: \u2022 Being severely materially deprived\u2013with living conditions constrained by a lack of resources as measured in terms of being deprived of four of nine items: unable to afford 1) to pay rent/ mortgage or utility bills on time; 2) to keep their home adequately warm; 3) to face unexpected expenses; 4) to eat meat, fish or a protein equivalent every second day; 5) a one week holiday away from home; 6) a car, 7) a washing machine, 8) a colour TV or 9) a telephone (including mobile phone). This indicator captures absolute poverty in some degree and is measured in the same way in all Member States. \u2022 Living in a jobless household or household with very low work intensity\u2013where on average those of working-age (18\u201359) worked less than 20% of their potential total working hours over the past year, either because of not being employed or working part-time rather than full-time (students are excluded from the calculation). \u2022 Being at risk of poverty\u2013living in a household with an \u2018equivalised disposable income\u2019 (equivalised means adjusted for the size and composition of households) below the at-risk- of-poverty threshold, set at 60% of the national median equivalised disposable income. This is a measure of relative poverty. The total number of people at risk of poverty or social exclusion is less than the sum of the numbers in each category, as many fall into more than one of these categories. Highlights: In 2016, one out of four people in the EU is at risk of poverty or social exclusion. A detailed look reveals that one third of young people aged 18 to 24, one third of people with at most lower secondary education, and two thirds of unemployed people were at risk of poverty or social exclusion.

LABOUR FORCE STRUCTURE EMPLOYMENT RATE (% OF POPULATION AGED 20-64) Description: The employment rate is the percentage of employed persons in relation to the total population in the same age group. Highlights: For the first time since 2008, the employment rate in the EU reached 70% for the working age population (20 \u2013 64 years) in 2015. In 2016, modest or notable improvements in the employment rates were recoded for most Member States. The educational background has a distinct influence on employability, as employment rates are higher among highly-educated persons compared to persons with lower education level.

The unemployment rate is the number of unemployed people expressed as a percentage of the total labour force. Highlights: Unemployment rates differ widely across EU Member States from 4.1% in Germany to 23.6% in Greece, in 2016. Moreover, the impact of the financial and economic crisis on unemployment rates in the Member States has also been heterogeneous, with some Member States showing an increase and others a decrease in their unemployment rate compared to their pre-crisis situation. All EU Member States had higher unemployment rates than Japan and higher or similar unemployment rates to the United States, in 2016.

INCOME, INCLUDING EMPLOYMENT-RELATED REAL GROSS HOUSEHOLD DISPOSABLE INCOME (INDEX 2008=100) Description: The real adjusted gross disposable income of households per capita in PPS (index = 2008) is calculated as the adjusted gross disposable income of households and Non-Profit Institutions Serving Households (NPISH) divided by the purchasing power parities (PPP) of the actual individual consumption of households, by the price deflator (price index) of household final consumption expenditure and by the total resident population. Then the indicator is indexed with base year 2008. Highlights: Since 2005, the real gross household disposable income has shown a mixed trend. In 2015, nine EU Member States - Greece, Cyprus, Italy, Netherlands, Spain, United Kingdom, Austria, Portugal and Slovenia - had less real gross household disposable income compared to 2008.

HEALTHCARE SELF-REPORTED UNMET NEED FOR MEDICAL CARE (% OF TOTAL POPULATION) Description: Self-reported unmet needs for medical care concern a person\u2019s own assessment of whether he or she needed examination or treatment for a specific type of health care, but did not have it or did not seek it because of the following three reasons: \u2018Financial reasons\u2019, \u2018Waiting list\u2019 and \u2018Too far to travel\u2019. The problems that people report in obtaining care when they are ill often reflect significant barriers to care. Medical care refers to individual healthcare services (medical examination or treatment excluding dental care) provided by or under direct supervision of medical doctors or equivalent professions according to national healthcare systems. Data are collected from the \u2018European Statistics of Income and Living Condition\u2019 survey and refer to such needs during the previous 12 months. Data are expressed as percentages within the population aged 16 years old and over living in private households. Highlights: The share of the population reporting that they are not able to meet their medical needs, in particular for financial reasons, showed an increasing trend after the crisis. On average across EU countries, four times more people in low income groups reported unmet medical needs for financial, geographic or waiting time reasons as did people in high income groups (6.4% versus 1.5%).The main reason for people in low income groups to report unmet health care needs was that care was too expensive. Any increase in unmet care needs, particularly among people with low income, may result in poorer health status for the population affected and increase health inequalities. In 2015, the share of the population reporting that they are not able to meet their medical needs ranged from merely 0.1% in Austria and the Netherlands to more than 10% in Greece and in Estonia.
