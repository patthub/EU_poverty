        "6 Mind the Gap: European Research for Combating Inequalities Setting the Scene In the last three decades inequalities in Europe have increased. The combined effects of globalization, technological changes and tax reforms \u2013 in particular reductions in the marginal tax rates for high earners \u2013 have led to a deterioration in the distribution of income and wealth among Europeans. In general, over the past 25 years the 10% highest income recipients in Europe have seen their incomes grow more rapidly than the rest of the population. The trend has not been the same in all Member States. The rise in inequality has been more pronounced in countries which have undergone transitions (Central and Eastern Europe) and in those hit hardest by the economic crisis (Ireland, Greece, Spain and Estonia). Income inequality measured by the Gini coefficient varied by approximately 10 points across Europe in 2012, with the lowest levels of inequality seen in Scandinavian countries and Slovenia and the highest in Spain and Latvia. On average, in 2012 Europeans in the highest (fifth) income quintile earned nearly 40 % of total income, and people in the lowest (first) quintile earned less than 10 %. The situation has been compounded by the recent economic difficulties. During the crisis the real average disposable household income stagnated or fell in most EU countries. However, it was the lower income households that suffered the biggest income losses. As a result, in 2013 16.6 % of the EU-28 population was assessed to be at-risk-of-poverty after social transfers. In five Member States, namely Greece (23.1 %), Romania (22.4 %), Bulgaria (21.0 %), Lithuania (20.6 %) and Spain (20.4 %), one fifth or more of the population was viewed as being at-risk-of-poverty. At the same time, the effects on the most vulnerable have been more severe. Women, unemployed youth, the long-term unemployed, people with disabilities and migrants are all groups that face considerable challenges and experience greater levels of inequality. Tackling inequalities is a political imperative for the European Commission and President Juncker has placed it high in his political agenda. This was underlined by his commitment to create a Europe with a \u2018Triple A Social Rating\u2019 and to strengthen the European Social Model through a pillar of social rights. Addressing inequalities is not only a matter of solidarity but also of economic expediency. Scientific evidence shows that higher ",
        "7 Setting the Scene levels of inequality are not conducive to economic growth and can have negative implications for macroeconomic stability. Inequality creates \u00abnegative externalities\u00bb for growth since it can potentially lead to higher social conflict, increased rent-seeking behaviour leading to misallocation of resources, lower social mobility leading to underinvestment in human capital and fewer educational opportunities for low income groups. Growth in more unequal countries is also less effective in lowering poverty. DG Research and Innovation supports the Commission\u2019s drive towards addressing inequalities and promoting social inclusion and fairness. The EU\u2019s Seventh Framework Progarmme for research, technological development and demonstration activities and the Horizon 2020 Framework Programme on Research and Innovation finance several research projects on economic inequality; solidarity; poverty and social exclusion; vulnerabilities of different groups of workers (youth, women, disabled, migrants); quality of work and skills; innovations in social protection; tax and benefits policies for combating poverty and promoting inclusion and overall policy learning concerning what works, where and why. This publication presents the most relevant projects in the Social Sciences and Humanities who have taken up the task of addressing the wider issues of inequality, exclusion and social welfare. The projects are a source of ground breaking conceptual work, extensive quantitative comparisons and surveys, profound and in-depth qualitative forays into social challenges and importantly concrete, evidence-based policy recommendations.

In this context, Minimum Income Protection (MIP) is one of the main pillars of European welfare states. However, MIP recipients often suffer from multiple social problems. Thus, effective support for their social and labour market inclusion also requires individualised social service support. In COPE we investigated how five European countries (PL, SE, UK, IT, DE) deal with the organisational challenge of providing interlinked social and employment services. The core of COPE\u2019s analysis was to map poverty and social exclusion in Europe, to examine the complex governance structure of European, national and local policies of minimum income schemes, and to assess their impact on beneficiaries.

        "Project partners UNIVERSITY OF EDINBURGH, UK UNIVERSITY OF MILAN, IT UNIVERSITY OF WARSWAW, PL LUND UNIVERSITY, SE OSLO AND AKERSHUS UNIVERSITY OF APPLIED SCIENCES, NO 15 FP6 and FP7 projects Outcomes The results show that the five countries balance multiple goals and different logics, but lean towards one of two types of MIP: they either organise their MIP schemes at the national level, with a strong focus on employability and activation, but with little scope for social work (UK and Germany). Or \u2013 in Sweden, Poland and Italy - the role of MIP is to uphold the local social order by supporting those who are in need. Links to Active Labour Market Policies and Public Employment Services are weak and unsystematic. For local patterns of service integration, the project revealed a very mixed landscape, with cooperation structures ranging from very close links between MIP, unemployment protection and social service like in Dortmund (DE) to parallel systems of MIP and employment services, as for example in Glasgow (UK). Research at the street-level showed that successful individual support is of course also strongly influenced by financial and staff resources, both of which are often lacking in all systems. ",

Regardless of whether they are citizens of old or new member states of the European Union, people affiliated to these groups tend to experience new and intensive forms of involuntary separation, second-class citizenship, or exclusion. This constitution of \u2018othering\u2019 manifests itself in the lack of recognition and respect from the earliest years. Hence, the ways in which educational practices address ethnic differences appear to be crucial in developing social inclusion based on equal citizenship and recognition. Through applying a cross-national comparative perspective, the project explored the mechanisms in socio-economic, political, cultural and gender relations that make ethnicity a substantive component of inequalities in social status and power.

Overall, the research painted a rather gloomy picture about the lives, opportunities and future perspectives of ethnic minority adolescents in Europe. It revealed some typical dynamics of inter-ethnic encounters in schools of communities densely inhabited by ethnic groups and thus contributed to an expanding research area of \u2018minoritisation\u2019 in Europe. Although ethnicity was viewed as a key category to define social position and identity, the research produced knowledge also on how other social distinctions (in particular gender, religion and social class) intersect with ethnic backgrounds. Findings revealed that the prevailing systems of schooling work towards producing and maintaining these children\u2019s disadvantages in access to quality education. Young people from second-generation migrant and Roma backgrounds seem to share a common fate of being marked with labels carrying dubious connotations as a result of coming from \u201cother\u201d settings than most people \u2013 the majorities \u2013 around them.

Both the relational and attitudinal dimensions of social cohesion were in focus: the extent of social connectedness on the one hand and the sense of common membership of society on the other. The network contributed solid new comparative evidence on issues such as employment conditions and the changing structure of labour markets; inequality of income; social disparities in educational attainment and the role of education in furthering social mobility; differences and inequalities in patterns of family formation and intergenerational solidarity; the causes and consequences of the gender division in paid and unpaid work; patterns of and institutional conditions for dealing with migratory processes and for the integration of ethnic minorities.

The central concept of the project was that a range of factors inhibit or encourage the abilities of individuals and groups to make the transition from being excluded to being included within societies. The aim of EUMARGINS was to identify and prioritise those factors that matter most for specific young adult migrant groups and in different countries. The project also put forward recommendations that can assist with the transition from exclusion to inclusion, focusing in particular on dominant factors such as (un)employment and related education aspects. The project looked at young people with immigrant origins in seven urban areas in seven different European countries, using a comparative framework to identify the most and the least marginalised groups. The project also looked at the interplay between education and opportunities in the labour market. In addition, other relevant areas of interest for young adults were investigated, including leisure and socio- political activism. EUMARGINS was based on a combination of biographical and ethnographical data collection and on the analysis of available statistical data. ",

The fundamental aim of the proposed project was to create and disseminate new knowledge that would facilitate the achievement of greater social equality, and therefore enhance the social cohesiveness, and democratic and market development in Central and East European (CEE) states. The project investigated the multifaceted character of social inequality in CEE states, where the extent and character of social inequality has been dramatically impacted by the transition from controlled economies to forms of market and democratic systems. It assessed the economic and political causes of social inequality among both individuals and countries and its consequences for social cohesion, economic development, social conflict, social mobility, democratic consolidation, and international integration.

However, the scope for these is frequently undermined by the central thrust of the neoliberal policy frame, and in particular of European marketization policies. The project argued that it is essential that public policymakers and business interests recognize that the negative externalities of uncertainty, insecurity, anxiety and declining trust that markets can create cannot be resolved through markets themselves - unaided by public policy. Therefore marketization increases rather than reduces the need for public policy and public resources that offset these negative consequences. Possibilities for doing this are undermined by the insistence of EU policy that social policy is just another area in which markets must operate, rather than one in which they should be counter-balanced.

The particular concern of MYPLACE is with the current generation of young people. This generation does not share any first-hand memory of the Cold War or any direct experience of living under a communist, authoritarian or fascist regime. They do share, however, the experience of growing up during the first global capitalist crisis in the post-World War II period. This vulnerable social position of young people makes them a prime recruitment target for parties and movements of the extreme right. In order to understand whether young people will allow themselves to be manipulated by extreme political movements, MYPLACE employs a combination of survey, interview and ethnographic research. This research provides new pan-European data on: the degree of engagement or disengagement from politics and civic activism among young people; their political values and attitudes and how they are shaped by local, national and pan-European political heritages; and the degree of support for, activism in, or receptivity to extreme political movements and agendas.

The concentration of wage growth among high-skilled workers, combined with disproportionate job growth at the upper and lower ends of the skill distribution, has resulted in a more unequal economic environment. Rising demand at the upper and lower ends of the occupational skills distribution took place during the decade from 1998 to 2008. Job polarisation also occurred in 17 out of 25 EU countries between 2000 and 2010 and the trend is expected to continue if no measures to tackle it are taken. Simultaneously, NEUJOBS finds that with the expanding education sector we will see a continuing replacement of low-skilled workers by medium-skilled workers. This means that the medium-skilled might temporarily assume positions for which they are overqualified. The call for policy-makers therefore is to tackle polarisation, as it is likely to increase socio- economic inequalities within societies along lines of ethnicity, gender, age and skill. ",

YiPPEE focused on the post-compulsory phase, the 18 to 24 age group, using a multi-method approach: literature and policy reviews, published and unpublished statistics, an evaluation of the impact of legislation, and interviews with a wide range of respondents. 170 young men and women in care at age 16 were interviewed face- to face as well as carers and managers of care services. There were strong similarities in the life-story narratives of the young people in all countries, in particular their experience of early neglect and abuse, for which care and education systems do too little to compensate. Although research participants were selected for having shown ability and motivation, few were able to access tertiary education or were on track to do so (8% compared with 40% of their peers). Three main factors were identified: pressure to enrol in short-term vocational training to become self-supporting as early as possible, lack of information and poor guidance, and insufficient practical and emotional support from carers and professionals.

        "66 Mind the Gap: European Research for Combating Inequalities An ever closer union among the peoples of Europe? - Rising inequalities in the EU and their social, economic and political impacts The Treaty on European Union is based on an \u2018ever closer union among the peoples of Europe\u2019. Scientific research in social sciences and the humanities funded by the European Commission under the Seventh Framework Programme shows that socioeconomic inequalities have generally increased in the EU over the last 20 years. A dual trend in inequalities has been observed during periods of economic growth as well as since the onset of the financial and economic crisis in 2008. First, inequalities reinforce the exclusion of already fragile citizens, trap - ping them into lives of exclusion from an early age. This issue triggers many questions as to what models of economic policy the EU should adopt and how these models should be combined with stronger social policies in favour of inclusion and solidarity. Second, rising inequalities threaten the quality of our democracies in Europe. Democracies thrive on equal treatment, proper regard to merit and opportunities for the excluded and the poor to live better lives. To ensure these rights, the EU needs to develop and implement targeted public policies in areas such as education and employment. This publica - tion is aimed at supporting the agenda for jobs, fairness and democratic change put forward by Jean-Claude Juncker and the newly appointed European Commission. 2015, ISBN 978-92-79-39853-7, doi:10.2777/87868, 128 pages http://ec.europa.eu/research/social-sciences/pdf/policy_reviews/ki - na26814enc.pdf#view=fit&pagemode=none ",
        "67 Publications relevant to inequality policy Their Future is Our Future: Youth as Actors of Change In the context of the changing demographic structure of society, Europe\u2019s future prosperity and sustainability largely depend on its ability to take advantage of the potential of all genera- tions. In times of economic and financial crisis in particular, Europe needs a strong young genera - tion to be a driver of sustainable and inclusive growth that will ensure long-term development. Youth represents the backbone of future Europe and we need to prepare the generation that will lead and support the EU in 2040 and after. This publication gives an overview of the most relevant projects on youth and youth-related po - licies. The results of these projects are highly relevant for the new Juncker Commission agenda on \u00abJobs, Growth, Fairness and Democratic Change\u00bb, and in particular relevant for the EU Youth Strategy, as the research aims to ensure the full participation of youth in an innovative, inclusive, sustai - nable and democratic Europe. Thus, they provide solid suggestions as to how EU and national policies can most adequately address the challenges faced by young people today, and how to set the EU on a course for a better future.

        "68 Mind the Gap: European Research for Combating Inequalities Time to Grow: Emerging Knowledge Base for Growth Policy in Europe Economic growth has a top priority on the agenda of European economic policy. Since the 2008 economic crisis, Europe\u2019s growth performance has been sluggish and inca- pable of reaching the level of growth in the USA, which has recovered much faster from the economic crisis. The low growth and high unemployment in Europe has negative effects on the lives of European citizens and on European states. It has entailed increased inequality and raised new sustainability issues. However, at the same time, Europe\u2019s growth pattern has experienced important qualitative changes as Europe has become more knowledge based and globalised, and solving the current challenges provides new growth opportunities, as social innovation shows. This publication presents those FP7 SSH research projects, which took up the task of understanding the (lack of) European growth dynamism and Europe\u2019s readiness to enter into a new and sustainable growth path. Understanding the reasons for Europe\u2019s relatively weak productivity per - formance and weak investment in R&D, innovation and other intangibles as well as lack of knowledge-intensive firms provide insights necessary for designing better and more targeted European growth and job creation policies. Research has also taken up the European risk capital markets as a necessary condition for growth as well as the role of social innovation and creativity as a source of job creation and inclusive growth.

        "69 Publications relevant to inequality policy Adult and continuing education in Europe: Using public policy to secure a growth in skills Adult and continuing education has the dual function of contributing to employability and economic growth, on the one hand, and responding to broader societal challenges, in particular promoting social cohesion, on the other. Companies and families support important investments that have, to date, ensured important growth in both skills and the ability of the European population to innovate. Thanks to this commitment, Europe today has a wealth of organisations speciali - sing in adult and continuing education. The sector has grown in importance, both as an increasingly significant player in the economy and in view of its capacity to respond to the demand for learning by the knowledge economy. As this book shows, adult and continuing education has a critical role to play in ensuring Europe copes with the phenomenon of education exclusion that, repeated year after year, generation after generation, undermines social cohesion and the growth of employment. Public policies must respond to two strategic challenges: to encourage the propensity to invest in adult and continuing education and to guarantee the reduction of educational exclusion. 2013.

        "70 Mind the Gap: European Research for Combating Inequalities New skills and jobs in Europe: Pathways towards full employment The Europe 2020 employment strategy and, in particular, its initiative on \u2018an agenda for new skills and jobs\u2019 aim to support the full employment goal of the Lisbon Treaty. In a context of growing challenges for employ - ment policies in Europe, this report questions current approaches and calls for increased policy learning amongst EU Member States. The report argues that there is room for improvement in employment policies in Europe. It emphasizes the importance of improving access to education, developing more transversal skills and balancing job security and flexibility. 2012. EUR 25270. ISBN 978-92-79-23668-6.

        "The Social Sciences and Humanities comprise a range of scientific disciplines examining the relations between humans in their societal contexts. While the Humanities deal particularly with history, culture and various forms of human behaviour, Social Sciences tend to focus on the social interactions of individual human beings and groups. They address questions such as: How do people live and work together in contemporary societies? Why do individuals organise themselves into communities and want to share the same future? What do Europeans think about globalisation and how do they react to it? Why and how do citizens engage in or abstain from electoral and other forms of political participation? Addressing such far-reaching questions, the Social Sciences and Humanities play a critical role in anticipating and accompanying the evolution of societies, while satisfying humanity\u2019s deep-rooted interest in reflecting on life. Consecutive European Union Framework Programmes for Research have acknowledged the significance of Social Sciences and Humanities research and have supported it at EU level over the past decades. Horizon 2020 recognises Social Sciences and Humanities (SSH) as an ensemble of separate disciplines and highlights their particularly high aptitude to fruitfully collaborate with other disciplines in tackling major societal challenges.
