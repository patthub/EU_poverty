The energy performance of a building shall be determined on the basis of calculated or actual \uf0d6 metered \uf0d5 energy use and shall reflect typical energy use for space heating, space cooling, domestic hot water, ventilation, built-in lighting and other technical building systems. \uf0f0 Member States shall ensure that the typical energy use is representative of actual operating conditions for each relevant typology and reflects the typical user behaviour. Where possible, typical energy use and typical user behaviour shall be based on available national statistics, building codes and metered data. \uf0ef \uf0f2 new Where metered energy is the basis for calculating the energy performance of buildings, the calculation methodology shall be capable of identifying the influence of the behaviour of occupants and the local climate, which shall not be reflected in the result of the calculation. Metered energy to be used for the purposes of calculating the energy performance of buildings shall require readings of at least hourly intervals and must differentiate between energy carriers. Member States may use metered energy consumption under typical operating conditions to verify the correctness of the calculated energy use and enable comparison between calculated and actual performance. Metered energy consumption for the purposes of verification and comparison may be based on monthly readings. \uf0ea 2018/844 Art. 1.14 and Annex .1(a) (adapted) \uf0f0 new The energy performance of a building shall be expressed by a numeric indicator of primary energy use \uf0f0 per unit of reference floor area per year, \uf0ef in kWh/(m 2 .y) for the purpose of both energy performance certification and compliance with minimum energy performance requirements. The methodology applied for the determination of the energy performance of a building shall be transparent and open to innovation. Member States shall describe their national calculation methodology \uf0f0 based on Annex A \uf0ef following the national annexes of the \uf0d6 key European \uf0d5 overarching standards \uf0d6 on energy performance of buildings \uf0d5 , namely \uf0d6 EN \uf0d5 ISO 52000-1, \uf0d6 EN ISO \uf0d5 52003-1, \uf0d6 EN ISO \uf0d5 52010-1, \uf0d6 EN ISO \uf0d5 52016-1, and \uf0d6 EN ISO \uf0d5 52018-1, \uf0f0 EN 16798-1 and EN 17423 or superseding documents \uf0ef developed under mandate M/480 ",

Those primary energy factors \uf0ef may be based on national, regional or local \uf0f0 information. Primary energy factors may be set on an \uf0ef annual, and possibly also seasonal, or monthly, \uf0f0 daily or hourly basis \uf0ef weighted averages or on more specific information made available for individual district \uf0d6 systems \uf0d5 system. Primary energy factors or weighting factors shall be defined by Member States. \uf0f0 The choices made and data sources shall be reported according to EN 17423 or any superseding document. Member States may opt for an average EU primary energy factor for electricity established pursuant to Directive (EU) \u2026/\u2026 [recast EED] instead of a primary energy factor reflecting the electricity mix in the country. \uf0ef In the application of those factors to the calculation of energy performance, Member States shall ensure that the optimal energy performance of the building envelope is pursued.

Member States shall deploy pre-emptive and reactive measures to ensure the quality of the overall energy performance certificate framework. Those measures may include additional training for independent experts, targeted sampling, obligation to re-submit energy performance certificates, proportional fines and temporary or permanent bans for experts. Where information is added to a database it shall be possible for national authorities to identify the originator of the addition, for monitoring and verification purposes. 3. Availability of energy performance certificates The independent control system shall verify the availability of energy performance certificates to prospective buyers and tenants in order to ensure that it is possible to consider the energy performance of the building in their decision to buy or rent.
