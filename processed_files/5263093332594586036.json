        "EU BUDGET FOR THE FUTURE #EUBudget #EURoad2Sibiu #FutureofEurope 2 May 2018 INVESTING IN PEOPLE WHY IS THIS A PRIORITY? People have always been at the heart of the European project. Investing in people, their skills and knowledge, helps respond to global challenges, maintain social fairness and drive Europe\u2019s competitiveness. Investing in people is one of the overarching priorities of the Commission\u2019s long-term budget proposal. The European Pillar of Social Rights reflects this approach. It sets out principles for equal opportunities and access to the labour market, fair working conditions and strong social protection and inclusion. At the Gothenburg Social Summit in November 2017, EU Leaders committed to strengthening the social dimension of the European Union, including through the full implementation of the European Pillar of Social Rights. WHAT DOES THIS MEAN IN FINANCIAL TERMS? The Commission proposes to concentrate available resources within a new single, comprehensive instrument , bringing together the European Social Fund, the Youth Employment Initiative, the Fund for European Aid to the Most Deprived, the Employment and Social Innovation programme and the Health programme. The Commission proposes a stronger focus on youth . This will be achieved by doubling the size of Erasmus+ to \u20ac30 billion and the European Solidarity Corps to \u20ac1,26 billion budgets to give opportunities to more young people to study, train and volunteer abroad, and by earmarking funding for addressing youth unemployment within the European Social Fund. This comprehensive instrument will form together with the Erasmus+ programme, the European Solidarity Corps, the new Creative Europe and the new Justice, Rights and Values Programmes a new cluster dedicated to Investing in People, Social Cohesion & Values with a budget of \u20ac139,5 billion .

        "WHAT IS NEW IN THE COMMISSION PROPOSALS? The proposals upgrade the European Social Fund into a European Social Fund+ with an overall budget of \u20ac101.2 billion , simplifying and increasing its effectiveness by overcoming the current fragmentation of funding instruments in the social policy area. Building on its successful 30-year history, the Commission proposes a substantially strengthened, inclusive and extended Erasmus+ programme, further promoting learning mobility across the EU. A reinforced European Solidarity Corps will integrate the existing EU Aid Volunteers programme. This will offer European citizens a unique opportunity to engage in solidarity activities within and outside Europe. Existing actions supporting European culture and creativity will be integrated into a new Creative Europe Programme (including MEDIA) . The aim is to promote European culture and values that contribute to the identity of our Union. The new programme will also empower citizens through the promotion and protection of fundamental rights and values and to create opportunities for engagement and democratic participation in political and civil society. This programme will include a strong MEDIA strand with funding to further promote European cinema and creative and audiovisual sectors in general. HOW ELSE WILL THE FUTURE EU BUDGET MAKE A DIFFERENCE IN THIS AREA? Investing in people is an overarching priority for the entire EU budget and is therefore covered by many of the Commission proposals. Examples include the following. The Cohesion Policy supports regional and local development by co-financing investment and provides support to small businesses. The InvestEU Fund will focus on investing in people notably through a separate funding window for social skills and human capital. The Reform Support Programme will provide financial incentives for key reforms identified as part of the European Semester, including in the areas of education and training and labour market policies helping to create jobs, fight poverty and promote social inclusion. The Commission also proposes a revamped European Globalisation Adjustment Fund to demonstrate solidarity with displaced workers and self-employed persons whose activity has ceased in the course of unexpected major restructuring events.
