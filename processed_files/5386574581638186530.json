        "(2003/C 222 E/264) WRITTEN QUESTION P-0782/03 by Claude Moraes (PSE) to the Commission (7 March 2003) Subject: EU involvement in world immunisation initiatives The Commission\u2019s programme of Community action in the field of public health, adopted in September 2002, included tackling health determinants as one of its key areas. Immunisation is the most powerful of all preventive health measures, especially for children, and is central to human rights and poverty alleviation. The recent report by the World Health Organisation, Unicef and the World Bank, \u2018State of the World\u2019s Vaccines and Immunisation\u2019 (2002), highlights immense strides. It also points out that although vaccines are the least expensive way of controlling diseases, they are not reaching the populations that need them most in underdeveloped regions in the world. Considering the EU\u2019s commitment to working closely with the major international bodies in the health field, such as the World Health Organisation, what steps are being taken at EU level to invest in immunisation and become involved in new initiatives launched by the World Health Organisation and other NGOs who are responding to mounting international concern and coverage of immunisation and vaccination programmes? Will the Commission consider establishing a health forum, bringing together the health community including NGOs, health professionals and health authorities, to discuss such issues of public health and develop a comprehensive and coordinated agenda of action? Answer given by Mr Byrne on behalf of the Commission (9 April 2003) The Commission is strongly committed to work closely with the major international bodies to support the fight against communicable diseases, in Europe as well as in developing countries. In Europe the main responsibility for vaccination policy, like health services and medical care in general, lies with Member States and each has developed its policy according to national needs. In this context the Commission supports the Member States in their work to control the vaccine- preventable diseases, taking into account their own specific vaccination strategy, in different ways: (cid:1) Working closely with the Member States through the Community Network strengthening the surveillance of vaccine-preventable diseases, under Member States Decision No 2119/98/EC of the Parliament and of the Council of 24 September 1998 setting up a network for the epidemiological surveillance and control of communicable diseases in the Community( 1 ); (cid:1) Funding projects under the Public Health Programme to support specific vaccine-preventable disease surveillance activities and policy oriented projects with Member States and Candidate Countries. Partnership with other countries and international organisations, such as the World Health Organisation (WHO), are possible. The Commission\u2019s activities in this field in developing countries are embedded in its ongoing support for health and strengthening of health, essential to increase and sustain the coverage and effectiveness of immunisation. This support is progressively provided through sector wide approaches and budget support. Immunisation coverage is included amongst the indicators selected to monitor sector performance and improved health outcomes. In some countries, immunisation against vaccine-preventable diseases merits additional support. For instance, the Community has supported specific projects in countries and regions where polio is still endemic. The Commission specifically supports polio eradication efforts in India and Nigeria, where over 90 % of confirmed polio cases occurred during 2002, through projects with a total value of EUR 37,5 million. The Commission also supports regional programmes in West Africa through C 222 E/234 EN 18.9.2003 Official Journal of the European Union ",
        "Unicef (e.g. Appui au renforcement de l\u2019Ind\u00e9pendance vaccinale (cid:1) ARIVA (cid:1) West-Africa), aimed at strengthening capacities towards higher national and regional independence in vaccination programmes. Support for immunisation activities in complex emergencies is also provided through the European Humanitarian Aid Office. Furthermore, the Commission is contributing through regional funds (African malaria Vaccine Network), the special budget line (AIDS vaccine preparedness programmes) and the 5th Research Framework, to the development of new and more effective vaccines against the main poverty- related diseases. ( 1 ) OJ L 268, 3.10.1998. (2003/C 222 E/265) WRITTEN QUESTION E-0793/03 by S\u00e9rgio Marques (PPE-DE) to the Commission (14 March 2003) Subject: European Year of People with Disabilities 2003 The EU\u2019s population currently includes some 37 million people with disabilities (cid:1) among them workers, consumers, taxpayers, politicians and students (cid:1) who, despite having the same rights as those without disabilities, often fail to receive equal treatment. The EU\u2019s citizens must be made aware of the need for real equality of rights, so as to avoid all forms of social exclusion for this sector of the population. In this context, the European Year of People with Disabilities 2003 has as its objectives to increase awareness in the interests of full equality of rights and to promote analysis, debate and exchanges of views on the most effective forms of action. The budget earmarked totals EUR 12 million, for the funding of the following activities: organisation of meetings and events; information and promotion campaign; cooperation with the media; and surveys and studies. Measures having a Community-wide scope may be subsidised up to a maximum of 80 %, while those of a local, regional, national or transnational nature may be cofinanced from the general Community budget up to a maximum of 50 % of total cost. 1. Given that each Member State is asked to name the bodies which will participate in the European Year and to which candidates are to send their projects so that they can submit requests to the Commission for the cofinancing of local, regional, national and transnational actions, what is the deadline for naming those national bodies and ensuring the necessary publicity? 2. What are the deadlines for the publication of the calls for expression of interest and the associated procedure, and what media will be used for publicisation? 3. In view of the Commission\u2019s recognition of the need for a coherent global strategy with a view to ensuring a proper development- and inclusion-oriented policy for persons with special needs, what measures has the Commission taken, and what measures does it intend to take in this context? Will the Commission promote a fully transversal strategy encompassing employment, education and training, access to public buildings and services, etc, and how will such a strategy be implemented in practice? Answer given by Mrs Diamantopoulou on behalf of the Commission (14 April 2003) The Honourable Member might be already aware that in accordance with Article 5 of the Council Decision establishing the European Year of People with Disabilities ( 1 ), all participating countries in the European Year are required to establish a national co-ordinating body to co-ordinate and manage activities in support of the aims of the European Year. 18.9.2003 EN C 222 E/235 Official Journal of the European Union "
