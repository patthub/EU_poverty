        "Evaluation of legislation, policy and practice on child participation in the European Union (EU) Country Mapping Fiche for France March 2015 1 Country Fiche: FRANCE Name of country expert: Diletta ZONTA and Sophie LEHOUELLEUR Position / title: Consultants Organisation: Ecorys Brussels / Ecorys UK Part 1: Overall arrangements within the country A. National Legislative/ Policy Framework (including definitions and budget/financing) Background context to child participation agenda within the country: According to a national stakeholder, historically, we can affirm that a right of childhood ( droit de l\u2019enfance ) has always existed. In Roman law, as well as in the Old French law ( Ancien droit fran\u00e7ais ) the child was seen as an object of paternal authority and not as a rights holder. In the nineteenth century, there was a growing awareness about protecting the child from his/her family or his/her employer. Even after WW2, the emergence of branches of law such as criminal law for minors and the educational assistance framed the child as an object of education rather than a rights holder. The adoption of a new perspective on \u2018children\u2019s rights\u2019 can be traced back to the Law 87-570 of 22 July 1987 relating to parental authority. For the first time, the law established that parental authority had to be divided into two in case of divorced parents, on the basis of two rights: the child's right to maintain relationships with both parents and the child's right to express him or herself. Later on, Law 93-22 of 8 January 1993 introduced in the French Civil Code, (art. 388-1) the right of the child to be heard in all proceedings, although much still depended on the judge\u2019s good will to allow such right to be expressed. However, the text qualifies the child as \u2018having the faculty of discernment\u2019. The value of such an article is that the child\u2019s opinion is to be considered and for this it shall be taken into account. Most notably, article 388-1 was inserted to ensure the child's right to be heard by the court in any proceeding relating to him/her. The review of the parliamentary works that led to the approval of the 1993 law shows that the new provision is rooted in the UN Convention on the rights of the child, which was signed shortly before. A decree of 16 September of the same year dedicates a whole section of the Code of Civil Procedure to the hearing of the child in judicial procedures (Articles 338-1 to 338-9). ",
        "Evaluation of legislation, policy and practice on child participation in the European Union (EU) Country Mapping Fiche for France March 2015 2 A. National Legislative/ Policy Framework (including definitions and budget/financing) The application of the 1993 law led to the establishment of a progressive autonomy of adolescents: the Law of 4 March 2002 timidly entered this path through the prescription, in article 371-1 of the Civil Code, that parents shall involve their children in those decisions that affect them, according to their age and degree of maturity. The law of 5 March 2007 on the protection of children has put French national law in conformity with art. 12 of the UN Convention on the rights of the child and the EU Regulation of 27 November 2003, \"Brussels IIa\" , making it a requirement for the judge to hear a child making such a request. a. How is Article 12 UNCRC reflected in legislation? A stakeholder confirmed that no special law has been enacted to ensure the enforcement of the 1989 UN Convention on the Rights of the Child. Indeed, international conventions have legal superiority over national laws and are directly applicable when having a \u2018self executing\u2019 nature. Also, certain provisions of the UN Convention on the rights of the child appear to be sufficiently clear and precise to be applied directly, without the need to develop specific national legislation. The right of the child to be heard in judicial procedures From 1993 to 2007, the Law 93-22 of 8 January 1993 and the Law of 5 March 2007provided that the child could be heard when he/she so requested. However, with two judgments of 18 May 2005 and 14 June 2005 the First Civil Chamber of the Supreme Court of Appeal affirmed the direct application, in a French court, of two provisions of the UN Convention on the rights of the child: article 3-1 and article 12-2. Article 3-1 provides that the best interests of the child shall be taken into primary consideration for all decisions that might affect him/her. Article 12-2 establishes the right of the child to be heard by the judge. Legislative documents concerning article 12-2 of the Convention: The law of 5 March 2007 on the protection of children (see section A.a.) Section 388-1 of the New Civil Code amended by the 2007 law: \"Any proceeding concerning a minor (capable of discernment) can be heard by the judge or by the person appointed by the court to this effect. The hearing takes place when the child explicitly requests it. In case s/he does not, the judge examines the reasons why such request has not been made. The child can be heard alone, with the presence of a lawyer or a person of his/her choice. If this choice is not in the best interest of the child, the court may proceed with the appointment of another person. The hearing of the child does not however confer him or her a party status in the judicial proceeding. The judge ensures that the child has been informed of his/her right to be heard and to be assisted by a lawyer\u201d. ",
        "Evaluation of legislation, policy and practice on child participation in the European Union (EU) Country Mapping Fiche for France March 2015 3 A. National Legislative/ Policy Framework (including definitions and budget/financing) This principle introduced in the Civil Code is a general principle covering all procedures - Articles 338-1 to 338-12 of the Code of Civil Procedure have undergone significant developments following the changes introduced by Decree No. 2009-572 of 20 May 2009 on the hearing of the child in court. According to these articles, the child capable of discernment must be informed by the holder or the holders of the parental authority or by his/her legal guardian or, if applicable, by the person or entity to which s/he has been entrusted, of his/her right to be heard and to be assisted by counsel in all proceedings. The decree of 20 May 2009 and the circular of 3 July 2009 standardised the practice of hearing the child. It states who could introduce such requests and in which way the opinion of the child had to be transcribed. The request for a child to be heard can be presented to the judge by the child him or herself or by the parents. Under this legal framework, the request can be introduced at any stage of the legal procedure. It can be refused only if the child is incapable of discernment or if the procedure does not concern him/her. If the request comes from the parents, the judge is free to decide whether or not the child should be heard. S/he can refuse if s/he considers that the hearing is not necessary or if it seems contrary to the best interests of the child. The principle is that of the direct hearing of the child by the judge. The child can then choose to be interviewed alone or with an adult of her/his choice, such as a family member. The judge may refuse if s/he believes that the choice of the child is not consistent with his or her best interests. The judge will then proceed to the appointment of a person who does not maintain links with the child (i.e. a social worker or a psychologist). A number of laws provide that the child has to give his/her consent in some specific circumstances: \uf0b7 The consent of a child of 13 years old or above to adoption (Article 345 of the Civil Code) or name change (Article 61-3 of the Civil Code). \uf0b7 The consent of the child and the parents is required in all contracts than have an effect on the personality rights of the child ( droits de la personnalit\u00e9 ): for example, the right to a person\u2019s image and copyright. The same principle applies in the area of medical care (see section B.6) ",
        "Evaluation of legislation, policy and practice on child participation in the European Union (EU) Country Mapping Fiche for France March 2015 4 A. National Legislative/ Policy Framework (including definitions and budget/financing) \uf0b7 Children have the right to seize the juvenile court judge with a request for educational assistance (Article 375 of the Civil Code). This hypothesis is not theoretical, since very often teenagers present an official request to escape their family, a forced marriage or to obtain the right to continue their education [interview: Non Government Stakeholder (NGS) 1 ]. b. How are responsibilities for implementation organised? Is there one entity or body with oversight on implementation of UNCRC Article 12 at national level? According to an interviewee, the responsibilities lie in the hands of several institutions: \uf0b7 the Ombudsman (Defender of Rights) has a central role to play, notably in ensuring the application of the Convention. However his intervention can only be triggered after a request has been introduced. \uf0b7 the Ministry of Social Affairs, the Ministry of justice, the ministry of education and the ministry of youth play also key roles. However, as pinpointed through interviews, there is no single institution that has been entrusted with the implementation of Article 12. How is children\u2019s participation defined in national legislation? For judicial matters, participation is defined in article 388.1 of the Civil Code (see section A.b.) Article 388-1 establishes the general right of children to be heard, whether by the judge or any other person appointed by the judge in the child\u2019s best interests. For criminal proceedings, law 98-468 of 17 June 1998 on the prevention and repressing of sexual offences, and the protection of children indicates that a child has a right to be heard during any criminal proceeding (see also DG Justice and Home Affairs \u201cStudy on Children\u2019s involvement in judicial proceedings. For family matters, Article 371-1 of the Civil Code indicates that \u201cParents associate their child in those decisions affecting them, and this according to his/her age and degree of maturity\u201d An individual right of freedom of expression is foreseen by article 511-2 of the Education Code. Collective rights are included in articles 511-9 and 511-10 of the Education Code and encompass the participation in decision-making bodies of the school as well as the right of assembly and association. 1 The anonymity of all interview respondents has been preserved in the version of the fiche for publication. The views of representatives from Ministries and other official Government bodies are attributed using the term \u2018Government Stakeholder\u2019 (GS), and the views of representatives from all other organisations are attributed using the term \u2018Non- Government Stakeholder (NGS)\u2019. A full list of organisations represented in the study fieldwork is provided in Part 4 of the fiche. ",
        "Evaluation of legislation, policy and practice on child participation in the European Union (EU) Country Mapping Fiche for France March 2015 5 A. National Legislative/ Policy Framework (including definitions and budget/financing) c. Which children are covered by the provisions for Article 12 UNCRC in national legislation? The provisions affect the individual child and children as a group, through class delegates or student representatives. In addition, children above 16 years old have the right to create an association - after the 2001 modification of the law of 1 July 1901, inside or outside the school. However, a stakeholder underlines that there is still some uncertainty when it comes to the definition of the child because of the following reasons: legally, the child is a person under 18 years old. However, when using for instance the term \u2018young\u2019, policy-makers or practitioners might refer to children but also to youngsters above 18 years old. d. What other drivers of participation exist in the country beyond obligations to implement article 12 of the UNCRC to promote the participation of children? \uf0b7 The children\u2019s town councils (Conseils communaux d\u2019enfants et de jeunes). The first children\u2019s town council was created by the City of Schiltigheim, near Strasbourg, in 1979, on the occasion of the International Year of the Child. Indeed, some experiences of youth participation took place before (the National Council of Resistance, Sedan, Pontivy), but they have not been pursued over time. The children\u2019s council of Schiltigheim still exists and, to date, 2,500 children\u2019s town councils exist in France involving children aged 7-18 and young people aged 18-25. \uf0b7 The national children\u2019s parliament (Parlement des enfants). Meeting annually since 1994, the Children\u2019s Parliament gathers 557 children elected by their classmates across France. This event is organized by the National Assembly (Assembl\u00e9e Nationale) with the Ministry of National Education (Minist\u00e8re de l\u2019\u00e9ducation nationale), the Agency for French Education Abroad (Agence pour l\u2019enseignement fran\u00e7ais \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tranger) and the French Lay Mission (Mission la\u00efque fran\u00e7aise) [NGS]. \uf0b7 A stakeholder mentioned the committee for the education on health and citizenship (Comit\u00e9 d\u2019\u00e9ducation \u00e0 la sant\u00e9 et \u00e0 la citoyennet\u00e9), within each school. It is an organism of reflection, observation and proposal, which implements and evaluates the educational projects relating to citizenship, education and health and violence prevention, in order to integrate them into the annual school programmes. \uf0b7 Another stakeholder mentioned the Ombudsman\u2019s young ambassadors for the rights of the child (Jeunes ambassadeurs des droits aupr\u00e8s des enfants) that contribute to raising the awareness on the Convention among children. e. What are the budgetary resources and relevant financial programmes aimed at the promotion and implementation of child participation in each Member The transversal document on youth policies, accompanying the project law of finance 2014, contains all youth-related policies across the different ministries. The policy document takes into account a population ranging from 3 to 30 years old (with a core target of the 6-25 years old individuals), with the aim of including all youth ranges and possible aggregations. Hence, young people are identified along different categories: children, pupils, students, minors, young adults, young workers, young disabled, etc. The document identifies youth engagement, mobility and personal development as a priority axis. In particular, two policy areas include large provision on youth participation: Youth and associations (Programme 163) and Pupils life (Programme 230). ",
        "Evaluation of legislation, policy and practice on child participation in the European Union (EU) Country Mapping Fiche for France March 2015 6 A. National Legislative/ Policy Framework (including definitions and budget/financing) State? The programme 163 covers children and youth from 3 to 30 years old; it contains two provisions: i. Actions to support youth and non-formal education (70M \u20ac in 2014), including in particular initiatives to inform youth; ii. Particular actions for youth (146M \u20ac in 2014), which includes initiatives to promote volunteering among youth, support youth and youth-led organisations, as well as citizenship and social inclusion. In particular, 2M \u20ac have been attributed to the Youth Experimental Fund, to finance innovative projects increasing the visibility and influence of youth-led organisations in policy-making. The programme 230 (4 402M \u20ac in 2014) covers six axis, the largest one being \u201cschool life and education to responsibilities\u201d (2 318M \u20ac), this later includes in particular policies supporting the participation of pupils in decisional organs at school. Provisions on child participation and right to be heard can also be found in the transversal document on Juvenile Justice, accompanying the project law of finance 2014. In particular, the Programme 101 on \u201cAccess to rights and justice\u201d (50M \u20ac in 2014) finances the judicial aid scheme for children and youth (45M\u20ac), including 4 M\u20ac for the audition of the child in civil procedures.

Strengths and weaknesses Please give a brief overall indication of: - Strengths / areas of good practice - Weaknesses / gaps or insufficiencies 1. National Government & overall policy-making NO The Ombudsman, whose main function is to encourage the fullest possible implementation of the Convention on the Rights of the Child and support collective lobbying for children\u2019s rights. The children\u2019s parliament (Le parlement des enfants). As an example, the children\u2019s parliament has approved a proposal stating that, when brothers/sisters are taking into care away from their parents or when they become orphans, they should be able to remain together (in a children\u2019s structure or when they are adopted). This proposal has then been approved by the French parliament - with some modifications. Strengths : it is a constitutionally independent institution. The candidate is appointed by the President of the Republic and is endorsed by the parliament. Weakness : the Ombudsman has no right of legislative initiative and, to act, he or she must seek support from other public bodies (ministries, judicial institutions, local institutions). Weakness: \u201c It\u2019s a representative institution, so not all children have a stake; the national parliament can still modify the proposal \u201d (national stakeholder). Once the initiative on orphan brothers and sisters had been approved by the children\u2019s parliament, the \u2018adult\u2019 parliament brought a significant modification to the text: it added the sentence \u2018whenever possible\u2019, which basically allowed for children to be separated from their siblings. As one official indicated, \u201dthere has been no media coverage or spread of information on the proposals presented by the children\u2019s parliament.\u201d ",

Local and regional government & services NO The children\u2019s town councils (Les conseils communaux d\u2019enfants et de jeunes) and the general councils of youth within French departments (Les conseils g\u00e9n\u00e9raux de la jeunesse) (11-15 years old) show clear evidence of child participation in the sense of Article 12. There are 246 French towns and cities that have been awarded child friendly city status, as part of a worldwide initiative, launched nationally by UNICEF France and the Association of French Mayors (for more information on child friendly cities, please see Part 3 Section 3). Strengths: Children\u2019s town councils are a means for children to engage in decision-making and encourage child-friendly decisions at the town level. Child friendly cities engage with children and young people, through structures to listen to their views, improve education and provide facilities adapted to children and young people. Weakness: Town councils are representative institutions. Their decisions are not legally binding. The creation of a children\u2019s town council or a child friendly city depends on the willingness of local authorities. 3. Care YES Regarding adoption, French law requires the consent of the child's parents and, in some cases, of the child. An agreement must be found with the parents and the child. Consent must be given by a child over 13 years old to his/her adoption (Article 345 of the Civil Code). Strengths : the child\u2019s right to be heard is protected in judicial proceedings. In case of adoption, no adoption can be allowed without the consent of children of more than 13 years old. 4. Asylum and immigration NO Immigration Art 221-5 of the Code for the Entry, Residence and Asylum of Foreigners (CESEDA) foresees when a foreign accompanied child is not allowed to enter France, the prosecutor, notified immediately by the administrative authority, immediately provides an ad Immigration: Strength: Children supported by the Department of Social Welfare for Children ( Services de l'aide sociale \u00e0 l'enfance ) are rather well informed of their rights and have the opportunity to express their preferences for ",

The mission of the ad hoc administrator shall terminate upon the issuance of a measure of supervision. the regularisation of their stay once they reach their 18 years\u201d (civil society stakeholder) Weakness: the time for the appointment of a guardian or an ad hoc administrator can be very long (civil society stakeholder). Asylum: Weakness: The appointment of the ad hoc administrator as well as the asylum decision itself can take a long time; and a change in administrator may affect the child\u2019s behaviour as well as the monitoring of the whole process (civil society stakeholder). \uf0b7 The child can be interviewed and/or auditioned several times, by several, sometimes different, people. He/she is very often asked to describe very precisely his/her life story; the lack of consistency between multiple interviews can then become a problem. In addition, s/he might forget or intentionally omit certain details which can be essential for the French office for refugees and stateless people (OFPRA Office Fran\u00e7ais de protection des r\u00e9fugi\u00e9s et apatrides) ",

For example, a political refugee can no longer return to his/her country as long as he/she retains his/her nationality, which implies that he/she will no longer be able to see family back home. \uf0b7 The situation remains very difficult for all children who are not taken in charge by French Departments and authorised care institutions because of their (recurrent) overload. This is often the case in areas close to main national airports (i.e. Seine-Saint-Denis, Val d\u2019Oise). If a child is not taken in charge by the competent structures, he/she will not be able to assert his/her rights as a child, find support and help to complete applications nor directly address the OFPRA, the institution in charge of providing ad hoc tutors. There is currently a lack of access to rights by unaccompanied foreign children because of identity-related issues (false papers, false age declarations), even if concrete proof should be made on the falsification of identity papers. Age determination methods remain quite controversial. (see Part 2 section 1) ",

Education NO Regarding individual rights, the freedom of expression is foreseen by article L. 511-2 of the Education Code. Collective rights include the participation in decision-making bodies of the school, the right of assembly and to right of association. Strength: Progress has been made in schools and in institutions for child protection regarding the constitution of class councils and children's institution councils, where: \uf0b7 The participation of children in the school decision- making system is possible from the secondary school level, through the class representatives, who are elected by the students. \uf0b7 The representatives also sit in all collective bodies: class councils, Disciplinary Boards, councils of high school life (the latter half is composed of students) where they have a vote equal to that of adults. Weaknesses: according to officials, adults are still not used to systematically listen to a child\u2019s opinion. The child might even be heard, but his/her opinion is not always taken into consideration. This is also because the whole early educational system is still heavily relying on the teacher-pupil relationship, with a strong adult-attachment perspective. The rights of assembly are very much framed and structured by adults. They must be authorised, for instance, by the head teacher. Moreover, children and teenagers are often \u2018left alone\u2019, without proper preparation or reflection. ",

Health YES Article 1111-2 of the Code of Public Health provides that, according to their degree of maturity, children should receive information and participate in the decision making relating to their health. Article 1111-4 of the Code of Public Health states that \"No medical procedure or no treatment can be carried out without the free and informed consent of the person (\u2026). The child's consent must be systematically sought if s/he is able to express her/his will and participate in the decision.\u201d This means that \u201c the child must give her/his opinion on any proceedings and to consent to medical or surgical treatments 2 \u201d. Strength: child participation is reflected in relevant legislation within the health sector. This includes both an overall principle reflecting Article 12, and specific provisions for consent to medical procedures. 7. Justice YES The duty of the judge to hear a child requesting to be heard is foreseen by article 338-1 of the Civil Code and 338-1 and following of the Code of Civil Procedure (see sections A. \u2013b.). For criminal matters, law 98-468 of 17 June 1998 indicates that a child has a right to be heard during any criminal proceeding. The participation of the child is envisaged for all procedures: this general formula refers to all civil procedures and beyond (e.g. criminal or Strength: A stakeholder commented that French judicial courts have ensured that, in all cases, the child can benefit from a personal representative, when his/her interests appear to be in contrast with those of his parents. The existence of specially trained juvenile judges ( Juge des enfants ) also plays a role in ensuring the child\u2019s right to be heard. ",

However, there is no doubt that it is more applied in matters such as family disputes and the separation of parents, as well as in the area of criminal law. Children concerned are those under 18 years (French Civil Code, art. 388-1). Concerning criminal matters , the obligation to hear a child\u2019s opinion who has been a victim (i.e. of violations, mistreatments) has been introduced by the law of 17 June 1998. As the rationale for the new legislation was explained through one interview, \u201cforced in numerous occasions (during the investigation, the different hearings, the trial) to account the facts he/she has been a victim of, the child runs the risk of re-living the trauma and revictimisation. In addition, multiple hearings could let the child think that adults do not believe him/her or that they have forgotten his/her previous statements and consequently that the facts disclosed were unimportant\u201d. The 1998 law has thus allowed for the audio-visual recording of the child\u2019s statements. Weakness: a stakeholder regretted \u201cthat the hearing of the child can always be refused by the court, if it considers that the child does not have the necessary judgment capacities. On criminal matters : Strength: Besides preserving the best interests of the child, the recording can play a much larger role, as it allows viewers to gain a more detailed understanding of the behaviour of the child during his/her testimony. Beyond words, the gestures of the child, his/her look, spontaneity, silences are all clues that are fundamental to understand and interpret the child's point of view. Weaknesses : a national stakeholder believes that young children are not always able to put words to the facts they were victims of, especially if they have been victims of sexual offences. Professionals who gather the testimony of the child sometimes lack sufficient training, especially to understand and speak the language of the child. ",

In July 2011, an article 2bis was introduced in the 1901 law, stating that children over 16 years old can create and manage an association without the explicit involvement of an adult. Thanks to this text, children have the opportunity to progressively understand and take responsibilities, develop initiatives independently and exercise their citizenship in practice.

What influence do policy and recommendations at EU level have in developing legislation policy and practice for implementing Article 12 in your country? The French government has never made any reference to EU law relating to Article 12. However, as highlighted by one interviewee, professionals in the child participation sector have followed the development of an EU-level child participation policy as from 2005-2006. They are also aware of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, although very few articles relate to children\u2019s rights b. What has been done in the Member State pursuant to the Council of Europe Recommendation on child participation? There is no reference to the COE recommendations by the government or other French public authority. According to an interviewee, after the 2009 and 2012 COE recommendations on the French application of the Convention, no official national communication has been released on the subject. - What tools and measures have been set in place to implement the Council of Europe Recommendation? No evidence was found of measures taken at the national level (national stakeholder). D. Implementing Legislation and Policy - How effective is legislation in supporting the implementation of participation overall? - All interviewees agree in declaring that national legislation does not effectively support the implementation of child participation. However, they recognised that \u201cpositive developments have occurred thanks to the entry into force of the 1993 law on the right of the child to be heard\u201d and \u201cthere are some small development also at the educational level\u201d (see section B.5.). a. What have been the main challenges and barriers to implementing this legislation and policy /developing participation in practice? Interviewees highlighted several barriers, including : \uf0b7 There are cultural barriers ; the mentality of French society which, as most southern European and Latin societies, is still very much based on the authority of adults in general, that are not used to have children expressing their ideas. This is especially prevalent within the family and comes with the idea that it is generally quicker to take decisions among adults, without involving children. ",

Implementing Legislation and Policy \uf0b7 Lack of knowledge : the general public is not aware of the rights children are entitled to. Parents, teachers and child professionals are very often unaware of the different tools and methods to involve children in decision-making. They do not even know from which age the child is capable of expressing his/her opinion. There is a lack of proper training for child professionals in this matter. \uf0b7 A lack of civic education for children , especially when it comes to teach them what their rights are (including article 12). Especially, \u201cthe UN Convention is not advertised in schools. If there is a poster on the Convention in a children\u2019s school class, teachers do not take the time to explain what that poster represents.\" \uf0b7 The notion of a child \u2018discernment capacity\u2019 is too vaguely defined. b. What is the situation of child participation in sectors that are covered by relevant legislation? There are some positive developments for what concerns the child\u2019s right to be heard in judicial, asylum and medical matters (see sections B.4., B.6 and B.7). What is the situation of child participation in sectors that are not covered by relevant legislation? Regarding policy-making, a recent study has revealed heterogeneous practices and degree of awareness regarding child and youth participation across French Ministries; child consultation for policy design remains marginal [Doc. 41] (see section B.1). At local level, children\u2019s town councils remains linked to the willingness of local authorities. c. Which groups of children, or types of settings, are experiencing low levels of participation / no participation Children belonging to minorities generally experience low levels of participation. This is especially the case for Roma children, unaccompanied migrant children, children with disabilities and children having left school at an early age. According to the cultural background of the family, children might experience higher or lower levels of participation. d. What additional legislation or policy might be needed to address the gaps or weaknesses identified at e. above? Interviewees propose a general information campaign on the Convention and on the fact that we cannot conceive policies for children without having involved the children themselves. Politicians (and through them, the policy initiatives they inaugurate) need to understand that there are many possible advantages in including children, as their vision can enrich and complete the one of adults.

        "Evaluation of legislation, policy and practice on child participation in the European Union (EU) Country Mapping Fiche for France March 2015 19 E. Structures and Children\u2019s Networks a. What official bodies and institutions are involved in promoting and implementing child participation? Stakeholders feel that local authorities are generally more opened to involve children, since they are responsible for the direct management of schools. More general awareness by local authorities is also promoted through the existence of child friendly cities, which amount to 20% in France, in which child participation is encouraged on all matters concerning them. The same applies for the French General Councils (Conseils G\u00e9n\u00e9raux Fran\u00e7ais), which are in charge of the management of lower secondary schools ( colleges ). However, according to different interviewees, initiatives involving child participation generally take place within schools. Participation activities take the form of e.g. the collective school projects, the school life rules that apply to children, the resolution of conflicts. At the local authority level, children\u2019s councils are sometimes put in place to elaborate collective projects. The regional Ombudsmen and the National Ombudsman\u2019s young ambassadors also have a role to play in raising children\u2019s awareness concerning their rights. b. Which children\u2019s networks exist nationally to support participation and relationships with policy and legislation? \uf0b7 COFRADE (Conseil Fran\u00e7ais des Associations pour les Droits de l\u2019Enfant), ANACEJ (Association Nationale des Conseils d\u2019Enfants et de Jeunes), FRANCAS and EVEIL (a COFRADE member) promote the protection of children and the application of the UN Convention ; \uf0b7 D\u00e9fense des Enfants International \u2013 France (which does not receive public funding, only private; \uf0b7 The youth Catholic associations, such as the ACE (Action Catholique des Enfants), which promotes debates among young people; \uf0b7 Associations with pedagogic and educational objectives (having very limited financing). All these associations are present at the national level, but can also count on smaller regional branches. ",

What tools or mechanisms are in place/have been used most frequently to support implementation and monitoring of children\u2019s participation in practice? According to interviewees, there are no concrete tools, only the Ombudsman\u2019s annual reports and the reports on the application of the UN Convention every 4 or 5 years. D\u00e9fense des Enfants International \u2013 France publishes an annual report on children\u2019s rights. In addition, together with other associations, DEI-France establishes an alternative report on the application by the French state of the UN Convention and sends it to the UN committee for children\u2019s rights right before France sends its official report [Childrens rights in France: against a wall]. b. What support or training exists for organisations in developing appropriate child friendly participation? Mandatory training is a prerequisite for taking up a post where contact with children is likely to take place. Judges, police, public prosecutors and defence lawyers must receive training on children\u2019s participation. As stated in the \u201c Study on children\u2019s involvement in judicial proceedings \u201d, specific training and dedicated services exist in the field of justice. Specific training is provided to brigades of the national police and national gendarmerie forces, which deal exclusively with juvenile justice maters; they are also exclusively responsible of the conduction of investigation, interviews with child victims and operate in child-friendly environments. In addition, there are specifically trained public prosecutors who deal with juvenile cases. Children\u2019s lawyers working in juvenile justice are also provided with free and compulsory training under the judicial aid scheme, and may benefit from training provided by children\u2019s lawyers grouping ( groupement d\u2019avocats d\u2019enfants ), which have been set up in approximately 70% of local Bar Associations. In addition, specialised judges are dedicated to juvenile cases; the Juvenile Court is nearly exclusively competent in cases of children as suspects and exclusively competent to deal with situations of children in danger at the judicial stage. c. What are the prevailing modes of children\u2019s participation that can be found within your country Children and youth are involved within youth council and youth parliament (see section A.f.), within national children and youth NGOs, within education (see section B.5). They are also more numerous initiatives at the local level (see section E.a.). A child has a right to be heard in judicial and criminal proceedings (see section B.7). d. What are the most common forms that participation takes? e.g. Interviewees list the most common forms of participation as: \uf0b7 consultation on decisions affecting children; \uf0b7 collaboration in shared decision making with adults; \uf0b7 child-led projects, notably at the lower secondary school level (college) and in structures where children are temporarily placed (foyers d\u2019accueil).

        "Evaluation of legislation, policy and practice on child participation in the European Union (EU) Country Mapping Fiche for France March 2015 22 H. Impact a. To what extent has children\u2019s participation been effective in influencing /effecting change (e.g. in policy and practice)? The extent and effectiveness of children\u2019s participation are heavily influenced by adults. One interviewee refers to the children\u2019s national parliament, which shows that, despite the children\u2019s active involvement, adults have managed to change what was initially proposed. The children\u2019s parliament had approved a proposal stating that, when brothers/sisters are taken into care or when they become orphans, they should be able to remain together (in a children\u2019s structure or when they are adopted). The \u2018adult\u2019 parliament has approved the children\u2019s legislative proposal, but brought a significant modification: they added the sentence \u2018whenever possible\u2019, which basically allows for children to be separated from their siblings. b. What are the most commonly accepted measures of \u2018effective\u2019 and/or \u2018meaningful\u2019 children\u2019s participation within the country? According to one stakeholder, the most accepted children\u2019s participation measures are those occurring within schools, as well as those referring to the resolution of conflicts (i.e. schools, orphanages). c. How is the effectiveness of participation monitored and evaluated , and by whom? The French Ombudsman (Defender of Rights) encourages the fullest possible implementation of the Convention on the Rights of the Child, supports collective lobbying for children\u2019s rights and the share of information, approaches and strategies. The different associations involved in child participation, such as Unicef and Cofrade, regularly organise conventions, launch opinion pools and publish reports on the situation in France and the application of the UN Convention. a. What nationally recognised examples of children\u2019s participation are considered to be good practice ? And why? Some of the most prominent nationally recognised examples include the following: \uf0b7 The children\u2019s town councils (see section A.f.) \uf0b7 The project launched by the city of Chappelle sur Erdre. The main objective of the Local Educational Project of the City of La Chapelle sur Erdre is to promote, encourage and support the participation of children and youth. The main tools are workshops and debates that allow young people to propose concrete ideas of youth participation in the democratic life of the city\u201d. \uf0b7 The \u2018 Ateliers de d\u00e9mocratie familiale\u2019 (workshops of family democracy). The first two workshops of family democracy were created in Nantes by the parents of the Angel Gu\u00e9pin Malakoff School. In this school, children can express their views and participate in decisions together with adults. Collective projects are implemented according to the democratic organisation of the structure, which comprise learning activities and a variety of community activities for children. More concretely, children are encouraged to take decisions regarding for example: the democratic organization of the school; themes and aims of collective projects; study activities as well as recreational activities. The basis of the \u2018At\u00e9liers de d\u00e9mocratie familiale\u2019 is the recognition that the child is able to participate to and take responsibility in the organisation of the community in which he/she is enshrined.

        "Evaluation of legislation, policy and practice on child participation in the European Union (EU) Country Mapping Fiche for France March 2015 23 Part 2: Specific settings and vulnerable groups in France Setting / vulnerable group 1: [ASYLUM AND IMMIGRATION / UNACCOMPANIED MIGRANT CHILDREN] Overview of the country context \uf0b7 According to national stakeholders, there is a clear gap between what French law foresees and its everyday implementation. In fact, many unaccompanied migrant children have difficulties in accessing their rights. This is also the case for asylum seekers who, on French territory, seek protection. They also have difficulties in being registered in a civil register. \uf0b7 Generally speaking, it is the French Child Welfare ( Service de l\u2019Aide Sociale \u00e0 l\u2019Enfance , under the authority of each department) that takes responsibility for unaccompanied migrant children. However, many of them are not taken care of, with public authorities avoiding the problem on the basis of responsibility and capacity issues. According to stakeholders involved in ground work with unaccompanied migrant children, authorities also use the controversial \u2018bone exam\u2019 to claim that the child is no longer a child (therefore not entitled to claim protection by the French state). However, such exam does not take into consideration the influence of race and physical differences existing between, for instance, a French and an Afghan boy of the same age. Such age assessment exams have also been denounced by the French Ombudsman. D\u00e9fenseur des droits\u2019 (see section B4). Legislation and policy frameworks \uf0b7 According to stakeholders, the main factor is the presence or absence of a person holding the prerogatives of parental authority. Unaccompanied migrant children who have essentially no legal representative on the French territory have great difficulty in accessing their rights and legal proceedings. In the absence of a guardian, these children can not request a supplementary judgement and must go through lengthy procedures to carry out urgent actions. As even normal procedures to obtain a legal administrator are very long, children have often already turned 18 by the time French justice provides them with a clear answer, which renders them ineligible for special protection. Moreover, it is the administrator who represents the interests of the child and act on their behalf. Hence there is no real systematic participation of the child. \uf0b7 Children covered by the legislation means anyone under the age of 18. Such definition includes children with discernment and without. Children with discernment can accomplish more legal actions than those without since they can, for instance, directly request a ruling from the Juvenile Court Judge. ",
        "Evaluation of legislation, policy and practice on child participation in the European Union (EU) Country Mapping Fiche for France March 2015 24 Setting / vulnerable group 1: [ASYLUM AND IMMIGRATION / UNACCOMPANIED MIGRANT CHILDREN] \uf0b7 The legal framework has not effectively supported the implementation of children\u2019s participation. This is due to the fact that, notably unaccompanied migrant children, lack the necessary means, knowledge and support to access all relevant administrative and judicial procedures. As for the participation of children who are retained at the border, it cannot easily be expressed by the child. In fact, when the child is kept in a transit area at the border, s/he must be assigned a legal administrator within 5 days of his/her arrival on French territory. However, when his/her case will be brought in front of a court to decide on whether to grant liberty, it will be the administrator and not the child who will be in charge of the defence. According to some NGOs, this is in opposition to Article 5.4 of the European Convention on Human Rights 3 . \u201cEveryone who is deprived of his liberty by arrest or detention shall be entitled to take proceedings by which the lawfulness of his detention shall be decided speedily by a court and his release ordered if the detention is not lawful\u201d. French law does not in fact say that the administrator shall listen to the child\u2019s opinion. Supporting infrastructure \u201cThere are no specific institutions whose priority is the implementation of children\u2019s participation in the context of asylum and immigration. There are however two major institutions which are responsible for taking care of unaccompanied migrant children and asylum seekers. The French Child Welfare \u2013 FCW \u2013 Service de l\u2019Aide Sociale \u00e0 l\u2019Enfance ), which is managed and financed by the French d\u00e9partements (the French sub-regional entities), is charged with the care of children who have been declared as \u2018in danger\u2019 by the Juvenile Court Judge. In principle, the French Child Welfare ( Service de l'Aide sociale \u00e0 l'enfance ) should be almost systematically designated as guardian for unaccompanied migrant children. In practical terms, this allows children to access their rights even in the absence of a legal representative on French territory. However, the commitment for this type of approach by the FCW is not automatic. Also the OFPRA (Office Fran\u00e7ais de Protection des R\u00e9fugi\u00e9s et Apatrides) -the office for the protection of refugees and asylum seekers, which is entitled to audition people and prepare their request for asylum \u2013 has no specific obligation to listen to the child\u2019s opinion regarding his/her request of obtaining the status of refugee or asylum seeker. Although an accompanied migrant minor may be entitled to seek asylum and to obtain a refugee status, he/she cannot start any procedure without being appointed a legal representative. The representative\u2019s mission is to support the child during the whole procedure. He has however no obligation to listen to the opinions of the child and involve him/her in decision-making. ",
        "Evaluation of legislation, policy and practice on child participation in the European Union (EU) Country Mapping Fiche for France March 2015 25 Setting / vulnerable group 1: [ASYLUM AND IMMIGRATION / UNACCOMPANIED MIGRANT CHILDREN] \uf0b7 France Terre d\u2019Asile is an NGO receiving public funding for the management of reception centres for asylum seekers. Interviewees speaking from other NGOs have however supported the idea that, because of the financial support received from public funds, France Terre d\u2019Asile's policy leeway is rather limited. There is a wide network of NGOs, which in most cases have come together to collaborate and strengthen their advocacy vis-\u00e0-vis public authorities. Some associations involved in assisting and supporting unaccompanied migrant children have joined forces around the following networks: D\u00e9fense des Enfants International-DEI France, Gisti, Cimade, and Education sans Fronti\u00e8res; concerning asylum: Forum R\u00e9fugi\u00e9s, Collectif des Exil\u00e9s du XX\u00e8me and France Terre d\u2019Asile. \uf0b7 There is very little training available on unaccompanied migrant children\u2019s rights to lawyers. The only quality training is offered by the Gisti and concerns information and support to immigrant groups. (see Part 3 ) Developing participation in practice \uf0b7 Interviewees providing support to children involved in judicial matters stated that many unaccompanied migrant children are not aware of their rights, a pre-requisite to claim rights. This considerably limits the opportunities for participation by children e.g. in many cases they do not know they can apply directly to a judge for protection. Participation occurs more typically when children are aware of their rights or when adults inform them about their rights. Thus, participation will be low if the child is not aware of his/her rights or is treated with suspicion and hostility, e.g. when adults ask him/her too many questions to have him/her contradicting him/herself. In practice, many unaccompanied migrant children do not possess a sufficient knowledge of French on their arrival in France. Those who can speak the language are lost in the complexity of the process. They must therefore have access to information about their rights and to legal aid as soon as possible. \uf0b7 When the child\u2019s request for asylum is looked at by the competent authorities (i.e. OFRPRA) and they are auditioned by the Juvenile Court Judge, the latter should normally take the child\u2019s opinion into consideration. Child participation should also occur when the child is given a legal representative who should allow the child to express him/herself. It is also beneficial if this function is carried out by the same person throughout the procedure, as it helps the child to feel safer and open up to adults (in front of judicial and police officers, social workers, teachers, host parents, etc..).

In this context, they show much more willingness to pass orientation tests in order to know what their skills are. Effectiveness \uf0b7 The quality of participation can be defined as the possibility to access the defence of one\u2019s own rights, throughout the different stages of the protection process. \uf0b7 Participation occurs mostly when the child\u2019s right to be heard is protected and encouraged by the Juvenile Court Judge and when it is the child him/herself to request to be heard. In the latter case, however, a long time might pass by between the child\u2019s request to be heard and when the actual hearing, e.g. in Paris, it can range from one week to 4 or 5 months. According to some interviewees, bad practices are particularly observed during school enrolment procedures. Unaccompanied foreign children arriving in France are frequently offered only the remaining places e.g. when a selection process occurs such as in VET paths, training outside national education schemes or regardless of their preferred field of interest. At the same time, where children were supported by NGOs during their school experience, some of them have managed to obtain excellent results, and have shown great willingness to pursue their studies. Impact \uf0b7 All interviewees agree that not enough has been done to make sure that the opinions expressed by the child through their right to be heard are really taken into account. In fact, decisions (on asylum, on judicial/criminal matters, on educational issues, on public life) are taken by adults most of the time without involving children in the consultation/decision process . For example, a protocol entitled \u201cNational measures for the safeguard, evaluation and orientation of unaccompanied migrant minors. Protocol between the state and the departments\u201d has recently been published in France as a result of an agreement between the French D\u00e9partements, the Ministry of Justice and the Ministry of Internal Affairs. Children have not been consulted at all. According to the text, children will be distributed throughout the territory according to the hosting capacities of other French departments, to ease pressure on those areas where children first arrive (and which have a general legal obligation to take children in charge). With this mechanisms the child\u2019s right to be heard will not be applied as to where the child wishes or prefers to stay. \uf0b7 In relation to the recently released protocol, the main challenges is to allow the child to express him/herself on the choice of his/her placement on French territory; provide him/her with an administrator or a legal assistant who will allow the child to express his right to be heard; from a cultural point of view, put an end to the traditional suspicion and prejudice accompanying migrant children and treat them like children in danger (not adults); train the people (judges, administrators, social workers, etc\u2026) to recognise and understand the particularities of migrant children and the importance to allow them to be heard.

        "Evaluation of legislation, policy and practice on child participation in the European Union (EU) Country Mapping Fiche for France March 2015 27 Setting / vulnerable group 2: [ EDUCATION / ROMA CHILDREN ] Overview of the country context In France, there are about 20.000 people belonging to the Roma minority (most often, in France, they are Romanian and Bulgarian citizens); the number of children estimated is at least half this number (10.000). Their general situation is first of all characterised by precarious housing conditions. This has a clear impact on the children\u2019s access to education: on their sleep, their hygiene, as well as the possibility to have a place dedicated to learning at home. It also makes it very difficult for a child to express his/her views on his/her willingness to receive education, where and what to learn and study. In France, compulsory education is constitutionally guaranteed to children aged 6 to 16 years. However, in practical terms, obstacles exist when it comes to the exercise of this right, which in theory cannot be denied to children on the basis of their nationality. Thought, as explained by stakeholders who work with Roma children on a daily basis, those municipalities who take in charge the education of Roma children, do not respect the child\u2019s right to be heard. Local administrators (in collaboration with police forces and - often - civil courts) take decisions regarding whether to enrol a child in school or not, on the type of school and on the location of the school are taken without allowing the child to express his/her opinion. One stakeholder pointed to the fact that when slums are dismantled, the child is given no right to express his/her view on whether to stay enrolled in the same school, follow the family elsewhere or being allowed to seek other kind of educational support. The fact of neglecting this right has therefore practical consequences on the child\u2019s education. Legislation and policy frameworks Unless a judicial procedure is started (in this case, article 388-1 of the Civil code applies), there is no precise legal framework stating that a child has a right to be heard when education is at stake. This happens because a series of legal obligations are constantly ignored by public authorities: \uf0b7 The right to education: France is signatory to international and European legislation enshrining the rights of the child, including the right to education. The French Constitution (Art. 13) and the French Education Code recognise the right of all children to access education. The Education Code states: \"Education is compulsory for children of both sexes, French and foreign, between six and sixteen\" (Article 131-1). However, as declared by one interviewee, the legal framework is unfortunately contradicted by administrative practices (refusal of registration, improper requests for documents proving residence, etc\u2026). This has consequences on the child\u2019s right to be heard: he is not given the opportunity to express his/her desire to be enrolled in school. By not having the possibility to be enrolled in a school, ",
        "Evaluation of legislation, policy and practice on child participation in the European Union (EU) Country Mapping Fiche for France March 2015 28 Setting / vulnerable group 1: [ASYLUM AND IMMIGRATION / UNACCOMPANIED MIGRANT CHILDREN] Roma children miss the opportunity to become fluent in French and be provided with the knowledge assets that will determine their capacity to influence the decisions affecting them. \uf0b7 The French Circulaire n\u00b0 2002-101 du 25-4-2002 stating that municipalities should identify children living within their municipalities and transmit the information to the Ministry of National Education, for the latter to allocate a sufficient number of teachers In some cases, mayors do not report the number of children living on their municipality. When they do accept to enrol children in their (local) schools, the Ministry of national Education does not provide the required children in a timely manner. On the one side, this means that Roma children are not given the right to express their views on where they wish to be enrolled. On the other side, the lack of competent teachers deprives Roma children from being supported by professionals who are aware of their needs and give children the opportunity to express their (school) needs and desires. Supporting infrastructure The French Ombudsman (Defender of Rights) encourages the fullest possible implementation of the Convention on the Rights of the Child and supports the collective lobbying for children\u2019s rights. In this context, the Ombudsman receives individual queries. In January 2012, the Ombudsman too the initiative to create an ad hoc working group with the aim to produce benchmarks and recommendations to identify ways to consider the interests of children when taking decisions concerning them. Article 12 of the Convention on the Rights of the Child is mentioned several times in the document to stress the idea that it is in the best interest of the child to hear him and consider his opinion. Regarding infrastructures supporting education of Roma children: there are two national structures: CASNAV (Le Centre Acad\u00e9mique pour la Scolarisation des enfants Allophones Nouvellement Arriv\u00e9s et des enfants issus de familles itin\u00e9rantes et de Voyageurs): the academic centre for the education of native children and newly arrived children from homeless families and travellers is a subdivision of the Ministry of Education which is responsible for developing educational programs for so-called \"specific\" public. In this context, some schools provide teachers for \u2018traveller\u2019 children in each regional education unit (Acad\u00e9mie). CNED (Centre National d\u2019\u00c9ducation \u00e0 Distance / National centre for distance learning) has a project manager in charge of educational programmes for traveller children.\u201d Although initiatives are in place to include parents in decision-making procedures, none of these institutions has adopted concrete actions and/or tools to allow children to express their views when, for instance, developing specific educational programmes or supporting the educational insertion of children into schools.

The more structured organisations are usually funded by grants from the state and / or local authorities and the private sector (individuals, corporate foundations). The national human rights association called Romeurope has created the \u201cCollectif for the rights of Roma children\u201d, bringing together several association which aim is to favour the access to education of Roma children. In their online presentation, however, no reference to Article 12 or to the child\u2019s right to be heard is made. FASET, a federation regrouping associations for the scolarisation of gypsy children, implements teaching classes through mobile trucks, by reaching the children directly to the place where they live. The teaching trucks are the means used by the association to get as close as possible to Roma children who are not enrolled in schools. By doing so, the association aims at promoting access to education and training, maintaining social ties and provide access to basic skills for greater independence in a child\u2019s life. In the organisation of their activities, no information was found on the fact that FASET encourages children to express their views and preferences and that these are considered by the association when shaping concrete activities. None of the interviewees mentioned any training programme given to promote Roma children\u2019s participation in the decisions concerning their education. Developing participation in practice According to interviewees, the fact that Roma children might able to express their views on decisions concerning their education is closely related the (lack of) social inclusion and the (lack of) knowledge of needs of Roma children. \u201dThere is a profound misunderstanding of the diversity of situations characterising the Roma children. If nationality (Romanian and Bulgarian) and the fact of belonging to a minority (Roma) are a common element, many differences exist: have they been to school in their country of origin? Have they been to school in France? Does their family situation allow them to consider going to school or participating in a training programme? Do the deficiencies (educational, emotional) caused by the precarious situation they live in allow them to envisage an education project and to express their preference? Moreover, the child\u2019s right to be heard is difficult to implement in practice because of the prejudices surrounding Roma childre. Some interviewees suggested that the expression of a child\u2019s opinion can be hampered by the attitudes and beliefs expressed by adults (such as local authorities, police, teachers, lawyers, judges, etc\u2026) vis-\u00e0-vis Roma children. As a consequence, when a child feels that he is seen as a criminal, he/she might be afraid to express ideas and opinions. As stated by one national stakeholder: \"Adults do not listen to their opinion and their wishes. Roma children rarely express themselves and are generally aware of the fact that their voice is not being listened. These obstacles might have a discouraging effect on them and affect their lives even when they become adults. ",
        "Evaluation of legislation, policy and practice on child participation in the European Union (EU) Country Mapping Fiche for France March 2015 30 Setting / vulnerable group 1: [ASYLUM AND IMMIGRATION / UNACCOMPANIED MIGRANT CHILDREN] However, some associations and volunteers working with Roma children favour the child\u2019s right to take up learning opportunities and improving his/her condition. Moreover, such associations put important efforts to try to meet the views and wishes expressed by children regarding learning and education. One of these associations encourages Roma children to express their preferences and takes them into consideration when developing socio-educational activities (see Part 3 Section 3). There is a need to raise parents\u2019 awareness and provide them with all the information necessary to understand that their child\u2019s opinion is worth being listened to (i.e. regular meetings with social workers and/or with the juvenile court judge). The need to involve parents also means that social workers need to know the child\u2019s rights and be trained to communicate such rights to the child\u2019s family. Finally, the ability to speak and understand the child\u2019s language is an important element to allow the child to be heard. Effectiveness \uf0b7 The child\u2019s capacity to express his views can depend from the child\u2019s level of education and his/her ability to communicate and express ideas in an understandable way. Hence, a child who has never been to school or has never been used to approach authorities (may they be teachers, judges, lawyers, social workers, etc\u2026) might have difficulties in effectively have his opinion heard. \uf0b7 Experience and daily work have shown that the most successful forms of participation could be developed when children were involved in medium-long term projects. Participation of young people which is expressed through a daily activity is hard to obtain, since education projects somehow contradict their search for an income. Getting their participation requires an individual work that can only be done over a long time. Socio-educational activities offered by association Hors la Rue are successful because of two main reasons: they provide a framework of rules for the common living ( r\u00e8gles de vie commune ), but they also offer the freedom for children to express their preference and, eventually, not to participate on a regular basis along the lines of a pre-defined programme. The promotion of such participation can lead to an individual tutoring and to the definition of an educational/training project with and for the child. ",
        "Evaluation of legislation, policy and practice on child participation in the European Union (EU) Country Mapping Fiche for France March 2015 31 Setting / vulnerable group 1: [ASYLUM AND IMMIGRATION / UNACCOMPANIED MIGRANT CHILDREN] Impact \uf0b7 The fact of giving a child the opportunity to express his/her views can have several positive impacts: increased motivation of the child to take part in the activity; increased duration of the child\u2019s participation in the activity (more than once and/or over the medium/long term); higher chances for the child to consider enrolling in a school (in case he/she has access to alternative education opportunities such as the \u2018school caravans\u2019; higher chances that the child will disseminate the information regarding the activity and might try to involve other children; \uf0b7 Positive consequences of Roma children\u2019s participation regarding their education can be found: \u201cwhen the children enrol in school, when they regularly communicate their educational wishes to family and parents, when children succeed in beginning an educational career and pursue their studies \u201d (national stakeholder). \uf0b7 Obstacles and challenges to Roma children\u2019s participation in educational matters are several: the existence of rigid family traditions placing the child as a subordinate to his/her parents \u2013 notably the father who is often the only member of the family entitled to take decisions without consulting other members; the economic insecurity of families which makes the child\u2019s right to be heard very hard to be applied \u2013 within and outside the family \u2013 as few development opportunities are available. The access to a house is another element which might influence the child\u2019s right to be heard: the dismantling of slums not only reinforces poverty, but it also decreases the opportunities for Roma children to establish regular contacts with professionals who can listen to their views and eventually help them realise their educational wishes. According to interviewees, some cultural changes are also needed: the end of the stigmatisation, discrimination and prejudice against Roma people could play a role in encouraging children to further express their views.

Unlike in other countries, the French government is not directly involved in the project and French cities do not receive financial assistance. Description of sector/setting and profile of children involved 246 French cities and 4 Departments (2014 data) are part of the Child Friendly Cities project. The initiative, created in 2002, progressively led to the establishment of a network for the exchange of information and best practices most conducive to child development (6-18 years old). This included an interactive website, publications about activities and projects as well as yearly national meetings for all cities taking part in the initiative. Description of example/type of participation The aim of the Child Friendly Cities project is to encourage children to systematically take part in all activities taking place in their city and express their views on how child friendly cities should be. In order for cities to retain the Child Friendly title, their performance is evaluated every year to decide if it is upholding the standards of performance. In addition, at the end of a mayor\u2019s mandate, the title expires and city\u2019s performance is reviewed. With this project, children are encouraged to systematically take part in all activities taking place in their city. Children participate in the planning and organization of their local educational projects, neighbourhood readjustments, the programmes taking place at their leisure centres...etc. Children are encouraged to think of themselves as proactive agents capable of bringing about change to their cities, communities and the world. Children\u2019s participation in Bordeaux - one of the first 12 pioneer French cities having joined the project. The municipality has engaged itself in constantly listening to the concerns and needs of its young population, with the aim to improve services for children and involve them in decision making. To do so, , in 2004, Bordeaux launched a survey among children to know more about their lifestyle, their expectations and suggested projects, as well as their opinion on the future of their city. Survey results showed that children felt they were not sufficiently informed about the existing policies and required their opinions to be considered more. The survey addressed many issues relevant to children including sports, culture, entertainment, health, education, computers, violence and the environment. ",

As a consequence, these children (10-18 years old, great majority are boys) are left alone \u2013 sometimes on the streets \u2013 without be given the chance to access the necessary help and counselling to obtain a legal status (i.e. refugee). Some of these children began systematically contacting GISTI\u2019s to seek for opportunities to be heard, which led to the creation of a permanent free legal advice service, managed by volunteers. However, as declared by one interviewee, \u201cit was not the intention of the association to open such a service, which has necessitated the almost-continuous yet free-of-charges presence of lawyers and legal advisers in the GISTI\u2019s premises. It was the ever-growing number of young immigrants who started to regularly come to GISTI, which \u2018obliged\u2019 the volunteers to organise themselves to provide an answer to their questions. In the volunteers\u2019 view, this was a clear sign of the young immigrant\u2019s willingness to know more about their rights and obligations, in order to participate more in the decisions concerning their requests for asylum or residence on French territory.\u201d ",

They have taken the decision to participate in a trip to Paris and visit the Louvre museum. Accompanied by 4 educational workers, they beneficiated from a private tour guide who took them around the museum for about two hours. As the idea was coming from the children themselves, it has met the favour of the children and encouraged them to express their opinions and wishes. Outcomes The children have expressed new wishes for future activities and trips: the museum of technology and science, a tour on the \u2018bateaux-mouches\u2019, etc\u2026 By organising this type of initiatives, the association has also attracted the attention of new children.
