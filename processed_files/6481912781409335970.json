        "1. Welcomes the initiative taken in convening the High-Level UN Conference to focus attention on the need to act globally to reduce the adverse impact of human activities on the oceans; 2. Notes that despite the world\u2019s commitment to curb overfishing by 2015, made in 2002 at the World Summit on Sustainable Development in Johannesburg, 31,4 % of the world\u2019s fish stocks are still overfished; recalls that overfishing is a serious threat not only to entire marine ecosystems but also to food security and to the economic and social sustainability of coastal communities worldwide; 3. Is concerned that ocean acidification caused by increasing levels of carbon dioxide has serious negative impacts on many marine organisms; stresses the need to develop effective adaptation and cross-sectorial mitigation measures in order to build resilience to ocean acidification and harmful impacts of climate change, on the oceans as well as on coastal ecosystems; 4. Stresses the need for an ecosystem-based and precautionary approach as enshrined in the Treaties and the Common Fisheries Policy to be implemented in global fisheries management, so as to rebuild and maintain exploited fish stocks above levels that can produce the maximum sustainable yield; 5. Calls for any decision on fisheries subsidies to take into account the specificities of artisanal and small-scale fisheries, their local character and their fundamental role in ensuring food sovereignty and the economic and social survival of coastal communities; 6. Encourages states to assume their respective responsibilities as flag, coastal, port and market states, in particular by: \u2014 flag state \u2014 full implementation of the international and national management measures to ensure that vessels flying their flag respect the rules; \u2014 coastal state \u2014 ensuring sustainable fishing in waters under their jurisdiction and controlling access to those waters in order to prevent illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) fishing; \u2014 port state \u2014 ratification and full implementation of the FAO (Food and Agriculture Organisation) Port State Measures Agreement; \u2014 market state \u2014 taking measures to ensure better coordination between the fight against IUU fishing and trade and market policy; 7. Stresses the importance of conserving at least 10 % of coastal and marine areas, in line with UN Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 14.5; 8. Stresses the importance of UN SDG 14.7 in terms of increasing the economic benefits for small island developing states and least developed countries from the sustainable use of marine resources, including through the sustainable management of fisheries, aquaculture and tourism; 9. Calls for enhanced sustainable fisheries management, including through the implementation of science-based management measures; 10. Calls for reinforced regional cooperation among all states in fisheries management for a sustainable and equitable exploitation of migratory species, especially regarding scientific stock assessments, monitoring, surveillance and control of fishing activities as called for by the UN Fish Stocks Agreement of 1995 and the three Review Conferences of 2006, 2010 and 2016; believes that all commercially exploited species should be covered by Regional Fisheries Management Organisations (RFMOs) with increased powers to efficiently enforce management decisions and sanctions; 11. Calls on the Commission and the Council to promote further the principles and objectives of the Common Fisheries Policy; 12. Instructs its President to forward this resolution to the Council and the Commission, to the governments and parliaments of the Member States, and to the Secretariat of the UNFCCC with the request that it be circulated to all non-EU Parties. 30.8.2018 EN Official Journal of the European Union C 307/187 Thursday 1 June 2017 "
