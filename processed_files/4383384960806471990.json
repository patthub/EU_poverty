        "Employment rate - proportion of the population aged 15-64 that is in employment (%) Unemployment rate, 2007 (%) Unemployment rates, 2007 (%) Average nominal monthly wages and salaries (EUR) Household expenditure, 2007 (%) Indicator definitions Population: inhabitants of a given area on the 1st of January of the year in question. Population density: ratio of the mid-year population of a territory to the size of the territory. Life expectancy at birth: the average number of years a person would live if age-specific mortality rates observed for a certain calendar year or period were to continue. Figures are given separately for men and women. Crude rate of natural increase: ratio of natural population increase over a period to the average population of the area in question during that period. The value is expressed per 1000 inhabitants. Infant mortality rate: the ratio between the deaths of children under one year and the number of live births in a given year, expressed as deaths per 1 000 live births. Total fertility rate: the average number of children that would be born to a woman during her lifetime if she were to pass through her childbearing years conforming to the average fertility rates of each year. The data therefore represent the completed fertility of a hypothetical generation of women, with the overall figure being computed as the sum of the fertility rates for each age (with the number of women assumed to be the same for each age). Average nominal monthly wages and salaries: Nominal wages and salaries are all incomes and remunerations received by employees in relation to their work. Also considered as part of this variable are the value of interest on loans provided by employers to employees at reduced or zero rates of interest, as well as services provided by employers, for example recreation, catering, housing, kindergartens, which are paid for from a profit- share fund. Household expenditure: the value of goods and services used for household needs and classified by 12 main headings of COICOP (Classification of Individual Consumption by Purpose). Spending of human resources as share of GDP: funding of education either by bearing directly the current and capital expenses of educational institutions (direct expenditure for educational institutions) or by supporting students and their families with scholarships and public loans, as well as transfers to private households and firms. Employment rate: the proportion of population aged 15 to 64 that is in employment. Unemployment rate: persons aged 15 to 74 who were not employed, had actively sought work during the past four weeks and were ready to begin working within two weeks, as a proportion of the total number of active persons of the same age. Long-term unemployment rate: share of persons unemployed for 12 months or more in the total number of active persons in the labour market. Youth unemployment rate: the share of unemployed persons aged 15 to 24 as a proportion of the total number of active persons in the labour market (the labour force) aged 15 to 24. Countries on the road to EU membership For half a century, the European Union has pursued ever-deeper integration while taking in new members. Most of the time, the two processes took place in parallel. A growing membership has been part of the development of European integration right from the start. Today ' s EU, with 27 Member States and a population of close to 500 million people, is much safer, more prosperous, stronger and more influential than the original European Economic Community of 50 years ago, with its 6 members and population of less than 200 million. Future enlargements will concern the countries of South-eastern Europe, which are at various stages on their road towards the EU. At present, there are three candidate countries: Croatia, Turkey and the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia. Accession negotiations with the first two started in October 2005. The former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia became a candidate country in December 2005 but accession negotiations have not started yet. All the other Western Balkan countries are potential candidate countries: Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Montenegro, Serbia and Kosovo under UN Security Council Resolution 1244. The EU has repeatedly reaffirmed at the highest level its commitment for eventual EU membership of the Western Balkan countries, provided they fulfil the accession criteria. The role of Eurostat, the Statistical Office of the European Communities, is to follow the progress of the candidate and potential candidate countries in the area of statistics and to support them in their efforts to align their statistical data with EU and international standards by providing assistance and collecting data from those countries. As far as the EU social policy is concerned, combating poverty and social exclusion, promoting active inclusion and increasing employment opportunities for those furthest from the labour market are all of major importance. Technological change, globalization and an ageing population are transforming Europe ' s societies. A renewed Social Agenda addresses these changing social and labour realities. The ambitious Social Agenda aims to create more opportunities for European citizens, improve access to quality services and demonstrate solidarity with those who are affected negatively by change. Brussels European Council in March 2008 emphasized that open markets and a sound international environment contribute to growth and jobs. The EU should continue its endeavours to conclude ambitious bilateral agreements with important trading partners and further step up the efforts for integration with neighbouring countries and candidate countries through developing a common economic area. Data collection The national statistical institutes (NSIs) provided the information presented within this leaflet. The majority of the data is taken from the key indicators that are collected on a regular basis by Eurostat Unit E4. Most data presented in this publication were processed during May-June 2008.
