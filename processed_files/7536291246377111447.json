My view is that for the sake of historical continuity it is a good thing that we refer to this building using the name of a king after whom the area was named over a century ago. However, I do not consider it a good thing that we opt for a name that stems from just one language. In my opinion, we should require that the name of a building like this is recognizable in as many languages as possible. Consequently, I would reiterate my suggestion to opt for a Latin derivation, 'Leopoldina', if we can name this building in the same manner as other public buildings here in Brussels, take the Albertina, for example. Linguistically speaking, that is far more neutral and makes the matter much more acceptable for our citizens, promoting their attitude towards the European institutions. ') Formal silling at 4.05 p.m. with an address by Mr Rabin, Prime Minister of the State of Israel: see Annex 2 ) Approval of the Minutes: see Minutes Mr President, we still have the time and opportunity to change the name. I hope that you will take the trouble to deal with the matter, which is after all not that insignifi cant. (Applause) KILLILEA (RDE). - Mr President, concerning the order of business, I should like to ask a question of you, the Council and the Commission. Now that the GATT Agreement seems to be coming to a conclusion in the next fifteen days, and taking into account the NAFTA agreement that has been put in place between the United States, Mexico and Canada, and the public statements that are being made welcoming that by the European Union, would the Commission now make a statement to the House, either through Sir Leon Brittan, the negotiator, or Mr Steichen, on the following situation arising from the NAFTA agreement: it is understood that President Clinton spent 7.5 billion dollars in one week to get that agreement through the American Congress. Most of that money was spent to gain votes in Congress from the agricultural sector. Taking into account the importance of the Blair House Agreement, has the Commission, Parlia ment or the Council been informed how this money spent, be it covertly or be it publicly will affect the Blair House Agreement? On account of the size of that expen diture... (The President cut the speaker off) PRESIDENT. - Mr Killilea, you cannot raise a matter now which is not on the agenda and which you have not proposed should be placed on the agenda. ",
        "No 3-439/2 Debates of the European Parliament 1.12.93 (Protests) KILLILEA (RDE). - Mr President, I am making a point of practical information. PRESIDENT. -1 am sorry, but you cannot raise that now. de la C\u00c1MARA MARTINEZ (PSE). - (ES) Mr President, I would just like to remind those present that today is International AIDS Day. I think that Parliament should make a gesture of solidarity with the people suffering from this terrible disease. HOWELL (PPE). - Mr President, on a point of order. I am rather surprised at the way in which you dealt with Mr Killilea's request. What I should like to do therefore is to ask you how we can get a statement from one or other Commissioner concerning the status of the GATT Agree ment and, in particular, concerning the status of the NAFTA agreement. It is extremely important and if it is not taken this week, then it must be taken in Strasbourg. PRESIDENT. - Under Rules 96 of the Rules of Pro cedure either you or your group would have had to have made a request to this effect at least one hour before the beginning of the sitting. I would have then tried to accommodate you. LANE (RDE). - Mr President, I am extremely disap pointed that we cannot have a discussion and a debate on GATT during this mini-session. The December part- session will be too late. We, as the elected representa tives, are being denied our rights by a technical rule of this Parliament. Rather than quoting Rule 96, it is far more important that we have a statement from the Commissioner, Sir Leon Brittan, followed by a debate or questions. PRESIDENT. - Mr Lane, the same applies to you: according to the Rules of Procedure that request should have been made at least an hour ago. (') /. Order of business PRESIDENT. - The next item is the order of business. The final version of the draft agenda as drawn up by the Conference of Presidents pursuant to Rule 95 of the Rules of Procedure has been distributed. Thursday: The Committee on Development and Cooperation pro poses that the report by Mrs Braun-Moser on develop ment prospects in South Africa should be included. BRAUN-MOSER (PPE), rapporteur - (DE) Mr Presi dent, I would like to ask the House to approve the urgent consultation of the report which was unanimously adopted last week in committee and which is based on a motion for a resolution by Mr Saby. Even the Council, which has penned various resolutions on South Africa, would welcome this. In view of the peace negotiations, Parliament should adopt an opinion. This is a burning topic that we simply cannot postpone until next year. As in the case of Israel and the PLO, with South Africa, too, we should make our statements to coincide with the ') Membership of Parliament \u2014 Documents received - Communication of common positions of the Council - Texts of 'Treaties forwarded by the Council - Transfer of appropriations - Petitions: see Minutes current situation. I would ask the Members of this House to support the proposal. (Parliament agreed to the proposal) MIRANDA DA SILVA (CG). - (PT) Mr President, I want to raise a matter regarding the order of business we have just approved, merely to say the following: I do not actually aim to contest the order of business, but I would like to highlight certain aspects of it which we feel to be extremely important. They mainly have to do with the decision-making process at Community level. The question that arises is this: We are going to hear what the Council has to say today in reply to the oral questions on the next European Council. We are going to hear the Commission speak tomorrow, mainly on the issue of the White Paper, which is to be adopted on the 5th. The Council will reach a decision on this matter at the next summit, immediately following the 5th, yet all this will be done without Parliament having been formally pre sented the White Paper - and even worse, without Parliament having a chance to study it and issue an opinion. This matter is extremely serious. The European Parlia ment is not going to adopt a position on the White Paper. The national parliaments are not familiar with it and they are not going to adopt a position on it either. We think that this is an obstacle to the democratic process, and we feel that the decision-making process at Community level should indeed be democratic. For this reason, Mr President, we think that in future the Commission and the Council should establish timetables regarding decision-making, thus giving Parliament the opportunity to closely and carefully analyze the docu ments and issue an opinion on them. PRESIDENT. - Mr Miranda da Silva, the Conference of Presidents agreed to proceed as appears in the agenda: President Delors will make a statement tomorrow morn ing at the beginning of the sitting on the preparations for the White Paper to give Members an opportunity to discuss this with him and put questions. We cannot of course adopt a resolution on this tomorrow morning but we do, nevertheless, have an opportunity to raise matters relating to the summit and the White Paper. TINDEMANS (PPE). - (NL) Mr President, I do not wish to return to the vote that took place this afternoon, but I would like to ask you the following questions: Do you find it normal that we should vote on an urgent topic concerning South Africa at a time when the Committee on Foreign Affairs and Security is in session and cannot attend this plenary sitting? Secondly, do you consider it normal for important committees to be convened at a time when we are in plenary session? This is helping to give Parliament a bad name. People think that it is a matter of absenteeism, but rather it is the case that committees have been convened. (Applause) PRESIDENT. - Mr Tindemans, I would point out to you as a group chairman, that we have followed the proper procedure. I do, however, concede that this is an excep tional situation in that Mr Rabin is addressing the Committee on Foreign Affairs and Security and the Committee on External Trade Relations. ",
        "1.12.93 Debates of the European Parliament No 3-439/3 (Parliament adopted the agenda thus amended) (') 2. Racism and xenophobia PRESIDENT. - The next item is the joint debate on two oral questions by Mr Turner, on behalf of the Committee on Civil Liberties, and Internal Affairs: - to the Commission (B3-1544/93) - 0-201/93), and - to the Council (B3-1545/93 - 0-202/93) on racism and xenophobia TURNER (PPE), rapporteur. - Mr President, the Com mittee of Civil Liberties and Internal Affairs has put down these two Oral Questions to the Council and the Commission to give the possibility of having the annual debate on racism and xenophobia. The context is very urgent in this particular case for two reasons. One is the political side. All the groups who regularly attend the committee are absolutely united in their condemnation of racism and xenophobia. They are also absolutely united in condemning the extremist parties for feeding on racism and xenophobia. We feel very strongly that there is a danger to the democratic process in the extremist activi ties of those who are using racism and xenophobia. Of course, in our particular case we are concerned because the elections for the European Parliament are coming up in six months' time. Naturally, therefore, it has a very particular context for us in that respect. But, secondly, it is important because only yesterday and the day before the Council met and discussed all these matters. Last year at the same time in this debate I said I felt I was speaking into a void. It is not quite as bad as that this year because we have just had a report ofthat Council meeting (which I have received only today as it turns out). But the previous week, the presidency came to our committee and said to us: We cannot show you any documents because we do not know what the consensus of the Council will be. Now, the whole point about Maastricht is that we are entitled to a) information and b) consultation. That particular response denied us both those things. Consultation, of course, means that the Council and Commission should come and discuss with us before the decision is taken and find out what we think, so that they can take into account our view when they make their conclusions. As far as I can see, the Council of Ministers in their report of their meeting over the last two days say first of all they have studied the results of the inquiry which was set up, I understand, by the Danish Summit in the summer. We have not seen that document either. Of course, Parlia ment's views would be very much amplified if we had seen that document. We need to see it. That comes under the heading 'information'. Then they say that before the end of 1994 they will arrive at a common accord for action to be taken in the light of the report which I have just referred to. This is the opportunity for the Council of Ministers and for the Commission to make sure they consult us continuously throughout the process of their arriving at the conclusions that they say they will arrive at before the end of 1994. We must have real and continuous consultations if Maastricht is to mean anything at all. That is my first ') Delegation of power of decision to committees - Speaking Time: see Minutes conclusion, Mr President, as to this debate this year. It would seem, quite late I may say, that the Council have at last got down to things and are now going to start working. They have the information before them. It is the ideal occasion for them to say to us today that they will consult us continuously, having given us all the docu ments which they have themselves, including all the research done for the report made at the request of the Council of Ministers in Copenhagen. So that is the first thing. Secondly, they say they are going to try and define what is a racialist act. Undoubtedly that is a matter which we are very much concerned with ourselves. There is a law in the United Kingdom of a very detailed nature on this. One of the points we have been making in the past few years is that the laws in the different countries on preventing racialism and xenophobia are all quite different and very often start from a very different base. Very often in continental countries they are based on broad words of the constitution whereas in Britain the law is based on a very specific act of Parliament. If the Council is indeed going to try and define what is a racialist act, this is something on which we would wish to have consultation. I now come to the Commission. Last year we called for a study by the Commission on the various laws in the Member States on racialism - the very thing I have just been talking about. We asked them for recommendations for improvements. Indeed, we said that they should act under Article 235 with a directive. Since then they have said that they do not very much like the idea of Article 235 and a directive. I do not care about the legal niceties of the thing. What we want is for the Commission to be working on the different laws as they exist and as they are put into effect in the various Member States, and to define what they think should be done to ensure that all countries have reasonably the same laws, which will be the most effective ones possible against incitement to racial hatred. So what I would like to know from the Commission is: Is it proposing to carry out this study and is it proposing to put forward independent recommendations or is it on the other hand simply going to tag along behind the Council which appears to be studying much the same thing? From my own point of view, I believe that the Commission should make an independent study of its own, should consult us about that study continuously and keep us informed and should then make independent recommen dations. Then between the two institutions - the Council and the Commission - and with the consultation of Parliament, we might end up at the end of 1994 with some coherent law against racialism and xenophobia. IN THE CHAIR: Mrs PERY Vice-President FLYNN, Member of the Commission. - Madam Presi dent, I should immediately say that I agree with Mr Turner that this is a very important question and the Commission shares with Parliament an abhorrence of racism and xenophobia, as honourable Members will be aware from the several occasions that I have addressed this matter in Parliament. ",
        "No 3-439/4 Debates of the European Parliament 1.12.93 FLYNN The Commission also shares Parliament's concern about continuing manifestations of racism and xenophobia in Europe. The Community in which we live is a multi cultural and multi-ethnic one and that diversity enriches the Community and benefits us all. There is a need for constant vigilance to ensure that the phenomenon of racism, xenophobia and anti-semitism is successfully resisted. Nevertheless, it is essential to repeat that the powers which have been granted to the Community in this field are, of course, limited and that the main responsibility is borne by the Member States. I think that is appreciated from the tone of the comments of Mr Turner. Within these limits, however, the Commission seeks to play its part in taking initiatives to counter racism and xenophobia. Our efforts have largely focused on meas ures designed to promote the integration of our migrant and ethnic minority populations. I would like to mention some of them against the particular background of the issues raised by the resolution to which this question refers. I should, at the very outset, acknowledge the role of Parliament itself in making much of this possible by way of its support and active encouragement of such initiatives in the context of the budget. The Commission has, for example, supported networking initiatives. These bring together those who provide support for migrants and those who tackle the problems of racism. These initiatives have included giving migrant communities their own voice within the Community through the establishment and funding of the Migrants' Forum and providing core funding for the European local authorities interactive network on ethnic minorities, known as ELAINE. This network brings together city and local authorities which will often provide the very first contact that migrants have with their host society. The aim is for participants to learn from each other and to identify best practice in dealing with migrants. We plan to expand ELAINE to cover the whole Community. There will also be a very interesting meeting convened by this network, to be hosted by the city of Barcelona next year, which will discuss the monitoring and registering of racially moti vated attacks. One of the most important practical initia tives in my opinion is the Commission's support of the efforts of the trade unions to combat racism and xenopho bia. I want to develop with the European Trade Union Confederation an action programme in this area. You will know my views on employment. I want more jobs in Europe. I also want to discuss with the social partners how best to eliminate racism from the jobs market. Within the framework and with the support of the Commission, ETUC will be hosting a conference to discuss trade union strategies to combat racism and xenophobia later this week in Brussels. Later actions will include youth involvement and an inquiry into attitudes at work. In 1994 I hope to bring together all the national bodies concerned with the fight against racism in the Member States, for example, the United Kingdom Commission for Racial Equality, the Dutch National Bureau for Combating Racism, the Bel gian Centre for Equality of Opportunity, the German Federal Office for Alien Affairs and so on. I think that a much better general understanding is necessary of prac tice in the fight against racism in the Member States. It is not easy to assess this. There is an increasing recognition, however, by Member States that European-level meas ures can be useful. At their meeting in Kolding earlier this year, the Ministers for Justice and the Interior set up an inquiry on racist acts. The results of this inquiry have led this week, now in the context of Title VI, to the Council of Justice and Home Affairs Ministers recommending a multi-agency approach to racism. This includes schools, social services and the police. Other lines of action will include consciousness-raising, particularly of officials such as the police, and the better collection of data on racist incidents. In adopting the conclusions in this matter the Council acknowledged the important work undertaken by the European Parliament in this area. In the conclusions it had intended as a first step to promote improved cooper ation between Member States. To that end the Council endorsed a series of measures and instructed COREPER to report to it by the end of 1994 on the progress achieved in relation to them and on the other concrete measures considered appropriate to combat racism and xenopho bia. I think what is important is that the Council has identified racism and xenophobia as an important issue for it and one to which it will be returning. The Commis sion will be playing an active part, of course, in all of these discussions. The House will also, Madam President, be aware that the Heads of State of the Council of Europe met in Vienna in October and adopted a comprehensive declaration and plan of action on combating racism, xenophobia, anti semitism and intolerance. That Vienna meeting was followed up two weeks ago by a ministerial meeting in Athens which sought to bring forward that plan of action. I welcome those initiatives because the Council of Europe is a forum which brings together both the Twelve and the countries outside the Union. The Commission intends to associate itself closely, of course, with the Council of Europe action plan and will provide whatever support we can. To sum up, Madam President, where it has the powers, the Commission will strive to continue to build on what has already been achieved. It will be looking to you for continuous support for initiatives of the kind that I have already mentioned. At a different level, the Commission will be seeking to stimulate discussion and debate on how the Community and the Member States should continue to tackle the problems of racism and xenophobia. I have to say to you that the Commission has recently, of course, published its Green Paper too on European social policy. This is a consultative document as we know and we want a wide variety of comments and contributions from this in preparation for producing a White Paper next year. I am particularly interested, of course, in the views of Parlia ment in this area. I would, in fact, be astonished and extremely disappointed if the theme of racism and xeno phobia is not taken up by very many organizations. The question I have asked in the Green Paper is as follows: How can we improve and broaden the promotion of measures in the field of education, information and legislation as tools in counteracting racist attitudes, acts and discrimination? That is the question in the Green paper and it is important to record it here. But in asking the question, of course, we must also pursue the debate. We can focus, I believe, increased attention on the issue and hopefully get a balanced response which will advance our collective determination to identify the causes properly and to take the appropriate measures that lie within our area of competence. ",
        "1.12.93 Debates of the European Parliament No 3-439/5 (Applause) DERYCKE, President-in-Office of the Council - (NL) Madam President, as Parliament knows, the Council has attached tremendous importance to the fight against racism and xenophobia, the protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms. In this connection, the Coun cil would remind the House of three important declara tions and resolutions: first and foremost, the joint decla ration made in 1977 by the European Parliament, Council and Commission regarding respect for basic rights. Secondly, the joint declaration adopted on 11 June 1986 together with the European Parliament and the Commis sion, in which all expressions of intolerance associated with racism and xenophobia were strongly condemned. Thirdly, the resolution by the Council and the represen tatives of the governments of the Member States within the framework of the Council meeting of 29 May 1990 regarding the fight against racism and xenophobia, in which the Member States were called upon to consider a number of legal and institutional measures aimed at combating these phenomena. As Mr Flynn has said, initially it seemed natural for the Member States to adopt such legal measures with a view to taking the action required to improve the situation. However, this does not alter the fact that whenever the Member States study the possibilities for harmonizing the policy on asylum and immigration, they constantly remind themselves that the main thing is to resist the danger of racism and xenophobia, primarily with regard to the subjects of third countries who are legally resident in the Community. In this respect, the Ministers for Justice and the Interior - building on the European Council meeting of December 1992 in Edinburgh and the declaration on the principles governing the external aspects of immigration policy, which emphasizes, among other things, that there is a need to combat racism and xenophobia more resolutely - took the initiative to which you referred in your question. For, during a meeting held in Kolding in May 1993, the ministers decided to hold an inquiry into the forms in which racism and xenophobia were expressed in the twelve Member States as well as to commission a study into the way in which acts of violence against foreigners might be the work of organized groups. In June of this year, in Copenhagen, the European Council reiterated that it is determined to combat all expressions of intolerance and racism with every availa ble means. The European Council strongly condemned the recent attacks on immigrants and refugees in the Member States and decided to apply itself more to detecting and eliminating the causes of this scourge. Now that the Treaty on European Union has come into effect, these areas are - and I quote: 'areas of common interest'. The Belgian Presidency is closely following this dossier with a view to coming up with concrete proposals before these six months are up. The Council of Justice and Internal Affairs held yester day and the day before took note of the results of the inquiry decided upon in Kolding. The Council, which was convened for the first time in the context of the single institutional framework of the new treaty, once again expressed its horror and concern in connection with the attacks on immigrants that have taken place in many Member States of the Community and condemned the increasing right-wing extremism in Europe as a whole. It also pointed out the important work done by the Euro pean Parliament and initiatives which the Council of Europe took at the summit held on 8 and 9 October 1993, including in particular the action programme for combat ting racism and xenophobia. On the basis of the results of the inquiry, as a first step towards promoting better cooperation between the Mem ber States regarding the prevention of racism and xeno phobia, the Council approved a number of practical measures of which I shall give a few examples, without going into details. Firstly, Member States which are not yet following the multi-institutional approach in the fight against racism and xenophobia, in which schools, social services and the police are involved, should consider the scope offered by this approach. Secondly, a suitable training programme within the various bodies for handling legislation at national level must enable them to become more aware of expressions of racism and xenophobia. Thirdly, the Member States should examine the extent to which the collation and publication of statistical data can be improved with a view to recognizing the situation better and also being able to control it better. The Council instructed the committee of permanent representatives to publish a report on the progress made by the end of 1994 at the latest. Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, we are con vinced that a coordinated action at European level against racism and xenophobia is getting under way, and I thank Parliament for its enduring commitment with regard to this extremely important problem. (Applause) FORD (PSE). - Madam President, an hour ago wc listened to the Prime Minister of Israel, Mr Rabin, speak to this Parliament, and we all welcomed the historic agreement between Israel and the Palestinians. Almost half a century of conflict may well be over. Yet we in Europe also have unwanted legacies from half a century ago returning to us. There is a growth of racism, fascism and anti-semitism. In Germany last year there were more anti-semitic incidents than there were in any of the five years before Hitler came to power. We have certain elected politicians who claim that the holocaust, the death of six million Jews and communists, trade unionists and homosexuals, travellers and the mentally ill, was merely a point of detail of history. We have elected politicians who state that the Americans built the gas chambers in Buchenwald after the war. We have Mr Le Pen. Equally, in Italy less than fifty years after the fascist dictator Mussolini was hanged we have the prospect of the direct descendants of his party winning power in Naples, Rome or Trieste. What a legacy for the millions who died throughout Europe and beyond fighting for freedom and democracy half a century ago! Even if these representatives of an evil philosophy fail at the last hurdle, their very presence in the final ballot is an insult to the dead from the war. Racism is spreading in Europe, with up to one racial attack every 35 seconds in the European Community. Something needs to be done by the Council, the Commis sion, the Member States and the European Parliament. ",
        "No 3-439/6 Debates of the European Parliament 1.12.93 FORD The re-emergence of these philosophies from the dark, dank corners of the mind and politics is the product of our failure. We must tackle the problems of hopelessness and alienation amongst our people, particularly young peo ple, as they search for work in our Community. We have to get our Community back to work. Twenty million unemployed form the breeding ground for fascism and racism. I welcome the proposals from the Commission to tackle that problem, because unless we do so we are going to hear again the echoes from the 1930s, the Austrian Nazi Party slogan: 'One million Jews, one million unemployed, one million Jews too many', and the slogan of the French National Front: 'Three million unemployed, three million immigrants, three million immigrants too many'. We need a European programme for jobs, growth and recovery, but we need legislation as well. I welcome the comments by Commissioner Flynn, but what we really need is a European Community Race Relations Act. We need a Commission that recognizes that it can move in that direction. It has the power. The Solemn Declaration against Racism and Xenophobia signed by the Council, the Commission, the Member States and Parliament in June 1986 is appended to the Treaty of Rome. That gives the Commission the opportunity to take action. What is needed is the will. I congratulate Commissioner Sir Leon Brittan who, speaking recently to the Association of Jewish Ex-servicemen in the United Kingdom, stated that the time for action has come. I hope he will be joined by others within the Commission to allow the implementa tion of one of the key demands of the Committee of Inquiry into Racism and Xenophobia which was also echoed in the De Piccoli report. We also need, as Mr Turner said, more openness and tolerance. It is impossible to separate the activities of Trevi, Schengen and K4 from the creation of a climate of fear amongst third country nationals living in the Euro pean Community. If you have an agenda of the control of terrorism, drugs trafficking, prostitution, immigration and asylum, must be a suspicion that third country nationals are seen as a problem and not as an opportunity for us all. These discussions have to be brought out into the daylight. At the moment we have a double democratic deficit. Not only do we have no say in the outcome, but we do not even have any knowledge of what the debate is about. Equally, I welcome the proposals for action from the Council, but there is much else that it could do. There has been a demand - put not once, not twice, but three times - for a European year of racial harmony. What is the Council proposing at the moment? I understand it is proposing for 1995 the European year of the young driver! Finally, we have to save Europe from the narrow, vicious, hate-filled world of fascism and racism, to save Europe from being divided by sex, by race or by nation, by standing together. This requires broad-based, non-sectar ian campaigns that involve men and women, black and white, young and old, Europeans and non-Europeans, to put pressure on us all to look to the future, a thriving, prosperous future, an outward-looking Europe where all Europe's residents can live together with the same rights and the same duties. That is why the Socialist Group has the Anne Frank Exhibition here, so we can see what happened in the past. That is why we have organized a week against racism and xenophobia and for tolerance. That is why we ask all other democratic political parties to join us in our campaign. (Applause) BEAZLEY, Christopher (PPE). - Madam President, I would wish to follow Mr Turner's remarks directly to the Minister about the requirement for legal activity in this regard. He will know that in the United Kingdom it is a criminal offence to incite racial hatred. I found his introductory speech inadequate, and I hope when he replies to the debate he will be able to explain to the European Parliament how, in the very near future, fol lowing subsidiarity, he will lead a discussion, whether through the national parliaments or through the European Union's institutions, to ensure that throughout the Twelve it will become, as it is in the United Kingdom, a criminal offence to incite racial hatred. Mr Ford's speech was a good one, but it was inadequate. He failed to point out that politicians in the United Kingdom have been elected in Tower Hamlets on a racist basis, supported by more respectable parties, who have been accused of pandering to racism. He also failed to point out that Sir Oswald Mosley, a former member of my party, subsequently a member of Mr Ford's party, founded the Blackshirts in Britain. He was incarcerated during the last war. His son, Nicholas, served his country honourably. So the enemies of harmony have no nation ality. They have always existed in all countries through out our society. I wish to thank the Commissioner for his comments, but I hope that Minister Derycke will be able to explain during this debate what action he is going to take - not merely that he has sympathy, not just that he understands the problem, not just that he wishes to remove the causes, but what legal action he, with his colleagues, will take on this matter. I would also agree with Mr Ford on the Anne Frank Exhibition, which has toured many Member States and, indeed, my own constituency and that of other fellow British Conservatives. I think it is very easy to wish to turn our backs on things which are unacceptable but are nevertheless part of human nature. It is easy to blame one country or one people or simply to blame a political creed, but I hope that all Members and visitors to Parliament will take the opportunity to look at that exhibition and read Anne Frank's diary which, I must say, I myself had not done until the exhibition came to Truro. (Interjection: 'Half of it is a forgery!') I hear someone claiming the Anne Frank diary is a forgery. I do not wish to rise to that bait. That is a despicable comment. (Interruptions) Madam President, on behalf of the European People's Party, may I agree with the chairman of the Committee on Civil Liberties, and Internal Affairs that we look to the Council for action, and we mean legal action. (Applause) NORDMANN (LDR). - (FR) Madam President, there are a number of people who think that our current debate is a ritual one. It is true that the Committee of Inquiry into ",
        "1.12.93 Debates of the European Parliament No 3-439/7 NORDMANN Racism and Xenophobia asked for an annual debate, and we hold that debate. We hold it every year. Sometimes there is a risk of it becoming a bit repetitive. However, certain interruptions, like those we have just heard, show that the struggle against revisionism - which is one of the aspects and one of the components of racism, anti semitism and xenophobia - is a constant struggle that is far from over. That fact in itself would justify this debate. I would add that this debate is all the more important since it is the last one that our House - which has deeply involved itself in combatting racism and xenophobia - will be able to hold, except, of course, for a debate of topical or urgent subjects. Consequently it is a good idea to take this discussion seriously. I would like to join the preceding speakers in thanking the Commission and the Council for the beginnings of a positive response and for efforts which, even if wholly inadequate compared with our requests and the urgent nature of the matter, nevertheless bear witness to a desire which is positive and which is directly in line with the extension of the 1986 declaration, as Mr Ford reminded us. Indeed, this declaration is a sort of legal foundation in the Community's struggle against racism and xenopho bia, the first stage in a declaration of European human rights that will have to be written one day. So it is in a spirit of reaching a consensus that the Liberal, Democratic and Reformist Group has looked into this question and supports, in particular, the proposal for a resolution drafted in the Committee on Civil Liberties and Internal Affairs. This proposal for a resolution represents a position that should gain the agreement of virtually the whole of Parliament. Not only is this significant, but it will have symbolic value at the end of this legislative session. We are experiencing some difficulty with certain amend ments tabled by the Socialist Group. While we are totally in favour of the Anne Frank exhibition - for this is wholly within the spirit of common struggle that constitutes our motive force - some amendments, on the other hand, are likely to call the consensus into question. I would like to point out how. The Liberal Group is sceptical about Amendment No 3 - which calls for a ban on the marketing of certain emblems and the holding of musical concerts - because it is very difficult to define the objects in question, or, more exactly, the boundary between what would pass for inciting racism and what would be considered non- harmful. The Liberal Group is all the more sceptical on this point since experience shows that when an object is banned, it acquires a market value which makes it even more sought after, whereas turning it into an everyday object sometimes has the desired effect - at least from the point of view of its market value. The second amendment that poses a problem is Amend ment No 4, which I shall now read out: 'Whereas there is an urgent need to create a common front of democratic parties in order to reject any alliance with extreme right-wing groups' (which is no problem for all the parties in the Liberal Group) 'and to keep their represen tatives away from any responsibility within the institu tions where democracy is exercised.' Here, the amend ment is ambiguous. If it is a question of fighting over the electoral terrain to ensure that there is no elected repre sentative of extreme right-wing groups, then our parties certainly agree. However, if it is a question of prohibiting democratically elected representatives from carrying out their mandate, then that is another matter, and we run up against a new incarnation of the old formula: 'No freedom for the enemies of freedom.' which, in our eyes, is surely not the best way of fighting the enemies of freedom. I hope that a split vote will prevent ambiguities on this point. Our third remark concerns Amendment No 6. We sub mitted another amendment because we feel that the wording gives rise to problems. As for Amendment No 7, we are naturally in favour of positive actions, but the congratulations extended to Mrs Mitterrand are a bit too specific for a general resolution. The scope of a resolu tion like this one demands that overly national points be avoided. If France had to be mentioned, then one would also have to congratulate the action of the French Interior Minister, who has set up a unit in each prefecture to combat racism and xenophobia, thus clearly demonstrat ing the desire of the public authorities to undertake the struggle using real instruments, namely the administra tive authorities that can take action. This is more impor tant than certain symbolic initiatives if we want to see results. We have not tabled any amendments in this connection, but if we were to tip our hat, it would be in that direction. Madam President, these remarks show - and I would like to conclude on this point - that the Liberal Group feels it is essential to have the maximum level of consensus on this issue. We would also like tomorrow's vote, especial ly the split votes, to enable this House, for the last time during this legislative session, to clearly and forcefully express the 1986 commitment in the joint declaration by the three institutions and to pass on this expression to the forthcoming Parliament, which will have to continue the struggle. ROTH (V). - (DE) Madam President, dear Members of the House, throughout Europe there is a dramatic increase in extreme right-wing, racist, anti-semitic vio lence. Millions of people are afraid of being attacked, injured and killed because they are of a different national origin, because they are refugees or immigrants, because they are Roma or Sinti gypsies, because their skin is black, because they are Jews or Moslems, gay or lesbian, homeless or handicapped. Outward expressions of racism are increasingly in line with so-called inwardly- facing eugenics. It is particularly bad that the orgy of violence, which is overrunning these people among us, is increasingly becoming the norm. Throughout Europe, extreme right- wing, racist parties are celebrating landslide victories. It is dangerous to play down the problem, labelling the people who vote for these parties as protest voters, because of the hope that they want something other than what is on offer from these criminal organizations. Not only in the Federal Republic of Germany, which is undoubtedly top of the league in acts of violence, does the future - with the renaissance of nationalism and the advent of extreme right-wing parties - have a horrific past. The total of 6,336 criminal acts and at least 70 murders in 1992 alone, merely in the Federal Republic of Germany, and a never-ending escalation of organized violence against refugees and immigrants, make it abun dantly clear how cynical and misleading it is to speak of ",
        "No 3-439/8 Debates of the European Parliament 1.12.93 ROTH young people prepared to commit isolated acts of vio lence and of xenophobic Germany. In Italy, one party is celebrating tremendous election successes which quotes Mussolini directly and whose ideology - now as ever - consists of fascism. Fascism, which has brought so much wrong, pain and suffering throughout the recent history of Europe. I am shocked, deeply concerned and furious about the developments in Belgium with the Vlaams Blok, in France with the Front national, and in Great Britain with the British National Party. I could extend this list. I am indignant at how these very organizations are misusing and making use of social problems in the European Union for their repulsive racist campaigns. But I am also shocked at the overall extent of the shift to the right in the European Union, and at how it is continuing to shift further. Political demands and state ments on, say, the fundamental right to asylum, which could be attributed just a few years ago to the most extreme edge of the far right, are increasingly being termed as 'common sense', even in democratic parties. I ask you, what still has to happen before we finally get round to reacting to this in earnest and effectively? Whatever the answer, the time for pretty and hypocritical speeches is finally over. Racism and right-wing extrem ism are arising out of the centre of society, and pogroms are created in the heads of people whose minds are also full to the brim with politicians' speeches and newspaper headlines. Racist comments are not free expressions of opinion, but should be treated and punished as crimes! In this European Union we must finally put an end to the systematically staged campaigns against refugees and immigrants, against people from third countries, who are degraded as third-class citizens in the very linguistic term used to describe them. Institutional racism and institu tional discrimination, which is a constituent element in this European Union, must finally be abolished. It is not acceptable for us to pay the price of European unity in so-called compensatory measures, which further aggrav ate the creation of an ethnic hierarchy. A Citizens' Europe which genuinely merits such a name must offer all its inhabitants the same political, social and cultural rights, for inequality and discrimination are always a basis for racist violence. We, the members of the Green Group in the European Parliament, support the joint motion, which came about in highly constructive cooperation within the Committee on Internal Affairs. We most heartily support the demand that we not merely talk a lot of hot air and issue declarations that are never followed up, but regard the fight against every form of racism, right-wing extremism and xenophobia as a central challenge for European policy, take it as a central challenge for democracy, and finally implement specific measures against such racism and right-wing extremism. Proposals have already been around for a very long time, and there are some very good proposals. However, what we need is a genuine action programme and, above all, an enforceable directive against racism and any form of discrimination. Further more, we suggest the establishment of an independent authority, a body of the European Union with clearly defined powers and possibilities for exerting influence, and ask the House to support this motion along with us. Let us all take the strain together, so that our Europe is constructed with respect for basic rights and fundamental freedoms and in line with the principle of the indivisibil ity of human rights. Let us join forces to prevent new walls from being put up which exclude people in this Europe of ours. Commissioner Flynn spoke of a multi cultural society. Yes, that is our objective. However, Mr Commissioner, we are very far from having a multi cultural society in our Europe! A multi-cultural society is based on equality, the acceptance and granting of equal rights to different cultures and of the same rights to all people living in our Europe. You know as well as I that the reality is quite different. Why, for example, is Union citizenship, which would represent a positive step towards a collective Europe, not actually offered to all the people living here? Elie Wiesel once said: The old ghosts are still abroad. For old and new Nazis, hate is a truth, hate is an instrument. Let us give hate no chance, let us give the Nazis - old and new - no chance. For we must quickly rid ourselves of the spirits that they summoned. DERYCKE, President-in-Office of the Council - (NL) Since I have to leave the sitting, I would like to speak at this point. Tomorrow I will be in the Development Council, but I will ask my colleagues to take note of further comments in this debate, which I \u2014 for one - find very interesting, so that I can report on it to my colleagues responsible for the interior and justice, Messrs Tobback and Wathelet respectively. 1 wanted to speak on two important points, since the questions were put directly to the Council. First and foremost, it seemed to me that there was still some doubt surrounding the question of whether the Council would be prepared to inform the relevant committees - and therefore the Commission in this case - of the further progress made regarding the study reports that it intends to commission. I think that the Council has not only expressly undertaken to have these results by the end of 1994, but that within the framework of the agreement already concluded on information and consultation of the appropriate committee - at least orally - it is also prepared to inform the Commission of progress made with regard to this matter. By the way, if my information is correct, Messrs Tobback and Wathelet have suggested to the chairmen of the committees concerned that reports on the results achieved should be brought out before the end of the year. So I think that the Council has no problem whatsoever in saying in this open manner what results have been achieved and where the Council is headed. There is a second important point in connection with the speech by Mr Beazley. He asked what the Council is doing and whether the Council is succeeding in establish ing unified European criminal law regarding the fight against racism and xenophobia. While the Treaty on European Union does provide for such steps, naturally this depends on the will of each Member State. In Belgium, as in the United Kingdom, we have such legislation. So it comes down to each Member State in the first instance creating a body of legislation under which these acts are punished in accordance with criminal justice meted out by national criminal court judges. Since there is now room for manoeuvre, and to the extent that the Member States are prepared to harmonize their criminal law, the possibility must be examined, and I would ask Mr Beazley - and any other Members of the ",
        "1.12.93 Debates of the European Parliament No 3-439/9 DERYCKE European Parliament who are concerned about the press ing problem of racism and xenophobia - to ask their respective national parliaments to intervene in this area and urge them to proceed with this unification. So in this respect I am in full agreement with the speaker. This would indeed represent a very great step forwards with a view to being able to move on to a coherent policy regarding criminal law. IN THE CHAIR: MR VERDE I ALDEA Vice-President WIJSENBEEK (LDR). - (NL) Perhaps Mr Derycke can stay and listen for another moment, for this concerns Rules 93 and 94 of our Rules of Procedure, which state that we may ask questions concerning home affairs. Article K.6 of the Treaty on European Union states that the Presidency of the European Parliament shall consult the European Parliament on the principal aspects of activities in these areas and provides for the views of Parliament being duly taken into consideration. If the minister leaves now, how can the remarks made by Parliament be taken into account? NIANIAS (RDE). - (GR) Mr President, I think that the report produced by the Council and Commission was satisfactory in many ways. Please allow me, however, to add something to all the wise comments made by the speakers who preceded me, and who described the situation of racism, xenophobia and anti-semitism in Europe. The first point I would like to make is that there should be an explanation of what we mean by these three terms. If we intend to make legislation that carries weight, then we have to define these terms so that the same definitions are used by the various Member States and the Community: in other words, what is racism, what is xenophobia, what is anti-semitism and what is intolerance? The problem of definition is one of a clearly scientific nature. But there is also the political problem. There are reasons explaining why we have this situation today. There is a centuries' old 'tradition' of xenophobia and racism in Europe. They are phenomena with historical roots, the origins of which lie in the clash between European and other societies. The stupid woman who, 40 years ago in London, rejected a man by saying 'Go away black man', was not a modern, but an old-fashioned, English person who lived with the tradition of xenophobia and the expulsion of foreigners. This attitude was the result of ignorance, a lack of education and a bad mentality, and it still exists in many strata of the European populace. Legal artifices and written condemnations are failing to resolve this situation, as is the political exploitation of the situation by various political parties. The only way to combat the situation is via a long-term, intellectual, scientific and sociological programme. Such a pro gramme must be implemented. We need a long-term policy. The situation is not being resolved as fast as we all would like. The second point is that there are economic reason why young people who come to Europe from elsewhere clash with the native population. Unemployed workers in Europe, who fight to defend their livelihoods when they see foreigners coming, are justifiably obsessed by this fear. However, they are not justified in their actions towards foreigners, for God's sake. So, while their fear is justifiable, there is also an aversion which nourishes it. There are compelling economic reasons why the situation is as it is. Only an economic policy can solve the problem in the long term. We must go straight to the heart of the matter: to the economic, intellectual, psychological, and cultural heart of the matter. If the Commissioner and the Member States took firm steps in the right direction, after many years the problem could be solved and the peoples of Europe could live together in peace. Without a long-term educational and intellectual policy, and without a firmly rooted economic policy, the problem will not be solved and Europeans and foreigners will continue being unable to tolerate each other. MORETTI (ARC). - (IT) Mr President, for the ump teenth time this House is talking about one of the biggest problems resulting from the Community's economic and social crisis: racism. Acts of intolerance are mushrooming with increasingly frequency in the Union. They are incited by an exasper ated incomprehension that is largely due to ignorance and people's lack of desire to live together. One example of this is the uncontrolled surge in the activities of groups of nazi skinheads and extreme right-wingers that are spread ing throughout Europe and involving new generations of people. I think it right that once again the European Parliament should be asked to adopt a position on this serious problem - a problem which, of course, cannot be solved merely by coming up with new economic schemes, but rather by the commitment of all the Member States to encourage learning and culture. I am convinced that the Community should also adopt any legislative, social and economic measures aimed at ensuring that European citizens and non-Europeans who are legal residents can live together. The Union must take action so that every country can have educators and teachers who are skilled, objective and prepared, and so that young people can learn about each other, and learn to respect different cultures and diversity. The readiness to resort to violence is the worst evil that can take root in a society, and of course suppressing the violence is not the only solution. We must insist on this approach and invest in it to ensure that culture receives the space it requires. There are some political forces that preach equality of peoples and insinuate that for certain citizens there are only rights, failing to mention the duties. This cultural tendency of false tolerance and false altruism is just as responsible for the growing tension in Europe, and some political forces are building up their consensus on this contradiction. We must work towards and commit ourselves to having the Union invest more in the culture of education so that people can truly live together in mutual respect for each other and grow united in their diversity. ",
        "No 3-439/10 Debates of the European Parliament 1.12.93 DILLEN DILLEN (DR). - (NL) Mr President, words which belong to the arsenal of disinformation and manipulation are bigotry. The manipulation of words is intended merely to disinform public opinion among the peoples of Europe so that they, in turn, can be more easily manipulated. The sole aim of all this is, once and for all, to portray and condemn the forces that stand up and fight for the maintenance of their language, culture, religion and civilization - in short, for the essence, singularity and culture of their people and of all the peoples of Europe - as racists, x\u00e9nophobes and bigots. Our response is as strong as it is truthful: Racism means contemptuously looking down on someone because they belong to anoth er race, and branding them as inferior. I set great store by solemnly declaring here that as nationalists, which is what we try to be, and as right-wingers, which we also endeavour to be, sentiments of this nature are completely alien to us. We do not look down on anyone because they are foreigners, because they belong to another people, because they do not belong to our European culture and civilization, or because they belong to another race. We do not hate anyone for being a foreigner, and anyone who says that we do is lying due to their political stupidity or out of political hatred, or for both reasons. Fighting to maintain our own singularity as a people and as Europe, the refusal - following the death of colonialism - to see Europe colonized in turn, is our right and duty, and has nothing - but absolutely nothing - to do with racism and xenophobia. Consequently, it is both our right and our duty to stand up for watertight immigration - a stop for Europe and also for a policy supported with human, economic and financial resources to send non-European foreigners back home. This is the only way to prevent real hatred, mutual hatred within just a few years. Mrs Roth, you mentioned the Vlaams Blok. The Vlaams Blok is heading for further election triumphs! (Applause from the Technical Group of the European Right) RIBEIRO (CG). - (PT) Mr President, Left Unity sup ports these matters as well as the proposal for a resolution on racism and xenophobia, thus reaffirming the positions it has adopted at other times. Both are the result of concern, or even alarm, in the face of the growth of this anti-social and criminal phenome non, and its political expression. We share this concern and alarm. However, we would like to make it quite clear that, given the gravity of the situation and the expectations, we must avoid adopting a demagogic position in which we attack the symptoms while ignoring, or even adding to the causes of the evil. That would be like someone giving aspirin to a person suffering from tuberculosis and then subjecting him to forced labour. Racism and xenophobia have their own culture medium in an economic policy which - in its monetarist blindness of accumulating financial capital - forces productive resources to lie idle, creates unemployment and causes social exclusion. We support the proposal for a resolution and the confer ence proposed for March 1994, since it does not concen trate on superficial aspects and contributes towards attacking the economic and cultural roots of this social disease. GONZALEZ ALVAREZ (NI). - (ES) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Council has noticed an increase in racism and violence in Europe. However, apart from condemning it, the Ministers of Justice and the Interior have limited themselves to making vague comments, and they have failed to provide a tough response to a growing problem that is boosting the fortunes of the far right, as was demonstrated by the recent Italian elections. In Madrid, the recent murder of a young person by a group of skinheads has again shaken awake the conscience of the Spanish people, as did the murder one year ago of a Dominican woman whose only crime was to come to Spain to seek a future for her children, so very, very far from her own country. Left Unity is convinced of the urgent need to make an effective response at European level, and for this reason we are calling for the mobilization of the institutions, democratic forces and all citizens. At heart, the solution is socio-economic in nature. How ever, it also lies within the scope of the law and in energetic action by the justice system. We are asking for a directive that will lead to the widespread application by the Member States of tough legislation against racism and xenophobia, and which will outlaw violent neo-nazi groups. Just as the Commission proposed in June 1989, the Council must adopt a policy of social integration for immigrants from third countries who are resident in the Community, thus entitling them to vote in local elections. Our country has reformed its constitution to this end. Mr President, at stake here are the democratic values of our civilization. The Europe we want is a Europe based on open, free and tolerant societies. However, to build this Europe, it is essential to react - and let us all react - by adopting specific, effective measures. (Applause) DE PICCOLI (PSE). - (IT) Mr President, over the past few months we have witnessed numerous incidents of racist intolerance at many locations throughout the Mem ber States of the Community. These are dangerous events, not only because of the gravity of the actions themselves, but in that they reveal the malaise present in sectors of public opinion, and especially the hardship that often leads to the idealistic disenchantment of many groups of our young people. These factors must not be underestimated. We must also acknowledge the development of sectors of public opinion which, although they reject the violent actions undertaken by racist groups, are nevertheless prepared in some cases to justify the motivations behind these incidents and, in many cases, to acknowledge that the cause of these intolerant attitudes lie specifically in the excessive presence of non-Community citizens. The proposal for a resolution prepared by the Committee on Civil Liberties and Internal Affairs is alarmed at the electoral success of extreme right-wing and neo-fascist political groups in some Member States of the Union. This is an opinion that I fully share. It is also bolstered and confirmed by recent election results in some Com- ",
        "1.12.93 Debates of the European Parliament No 3-439/11 DE PICCOLI munity countries, including my own, and I share the concerns voiced by Mr Forte and others regarding the elections in Rome and Naples, where the secretary of the extreme right-wing grouping and the granddaughter of the father of Italian fascism are figuring in the run-off for the mayor's post in that city. I hope, and I am convinced, that this will not happen, but already the consensus obtained illustrates the breakdown within some sectors of the moderate electorate - a phenomenon that cannot but cause alarm among all sincere democrats. The structural causes which encourage the spread of racist intolerance and the resurgence of extremism are well known: first there is the exploitation of the social malaise present in broad sectors of the populations in our Member States. However, there is also evidence of inertia by our institutions, both at Community level and by the national authorities as regards concrete initiatives aimed at elimination and prevention. The taking of important positions is not always followed up by initiatives and coherent actions. Consequently, we have seen the following results in recent months: inadequate action aimed at the prevention and elimination of extreme right-wing groups; inade quate preventive action for breaking down racial preju dice, especially via a broad, widespread and comprehen sive information and training campaign in schools aimed primarily at young people. From this point of view, I believe we must also be critical of the fact that the Commission - within the limits of its competence - failed to take account of major points made by Parliament in its most important opinions, and I truly hope that the initiatives announced here by the Commissioner will be reflected in concrete actions over the coming weeks and months. Mr President, my dear colleagues, I would not underesti mate the importance of certain solemn declarations, such as the one in Vienna made by the Heads of State and Government of the Council of Europe on the fight against racism and xenophobia, yet I wonder how many of these solemn declarations have been followed up by concrete initiatives by authorities in the Community, especially at national level. We cannot carry on with declamatory initiatives alone, rather we must undertake an incisive and comprehensive action that will remain at the forefront of public opinion and in the minds of the people in the coming weeks. For this reason, I can only reconfirm the importance which the Community attaches to an action programme, thus availing itself of the new powers conferred upon it by the Treaty of Maastricht. From this point of view, I do not agree with the point stressed in the second speech made by the Council representative, in which he states that the action by the Council must consist of observing the initiatives taken by individual Member States. I believe that the Council must also press for initiatives on the part of the Member States in order to assume a positive role on these issues of mobilization and commitment. JARZEMBOWSKI (PPE). - (DE) Mr President, under Article F of the Maastricht Treaty the European Union expressly undertook to assume a special responsibility for human rights and basic freedoms. Deeds must now follow, and the President-in-Office of the Council must not be allowed to disappear! Mr Commissioner, we want to see action, and what we need from the Commission is a genuine action programme. I do not find it sufficient that you raise a question in a Green Paper which we then spend another two years discussing. No, we want you to give us a concrete action programme! Naturally, as Christian Democrats, we are committed to the principle of subsidiarity. Consequently, the Member States will have to take care of most of the individual measures. What counts is to debate and decide on a European strategy aimed at combatting xenophobia and racism, based on the Commission work programme, and to submit it to the Member States. On the one hand, this programme must contain measures aimed at preventing racism and xenophobia from arising in the first place. On the other hand, it must contain measures aimed at introducing tougher penalties for any actions of a racist or xenophobic nature. In my opinion, prevention is all about bringing home to people and thereby impressing on their awareness and sensibilities the outward dignity of every individual person - whatev er the colour of their skin, whatever their nationality and religion, starting even in schools and kindergartens. However, it is also important to encourage social groups - trade unions, sport clubs, and also the political parties, to debate with their members and win them over to the idea of fighting any form of racism or xenophobia on a daily basis. Yet that is just one side of the matter. As far as the punishment of racist and xenophobic actions is con cerned, the Member States must enable their police and legal system to resolve and punish such deeds swiftly and effectively. If necessary the legal provisions should be strengthened in this respect, as should the relevant judicial and police departments. We cannot accept a situation in which young or older criminals are arrested in the morning in the context of some xenophobic actions and questioned as to their identity, only to find them selves free again that same afternoon to carry out the next offence against foreigners. In this respect, criminal law must be really precise, and it is not acceptable for the Council representative to say that we should take the matter to our national parliaments. No, if it is a duty of the European Union, then right here is where the prevention and punishment of racist criminal acts must be debated. Parliament was set up to conduct debates with the Council and the Commission in this Chamber. I am firmly convinced that the European Union can secure its place as a political community in the minds and hearts of the people if it genuinely fulfils its duty, namely to protect human rights and basic freedoms for all citizens living in the Union. ANTONY (DR). - (FR) Mr President, I fear that, in a strange sort of inverted racism, this Parliament is not hunting out racism in its lair. It is not hunting it out in its most gigantic historical manifestation. I do not see any exhibition on communism, which nevertheless organized anti-religious racism, anti-peasant racism, and anti-bour geois racism, killing 200 million people in the process. People were killed because they belonged to a certain race or nationality. They were killed because they were from a certain social class. So, it is those people who are seeking to teach us a lesson. The President of Chr\u00e9tient\u00e9-Solidarit\u00e9, an organization active in 26 countries, together with my 3000 little ",

You must be kidding! This is a very strange inverted racism that never goes after the anti-Christianity that is oozing - indeed flooding - from our televisions and radios, which more or less everywhere treat the Christians of our countries with scorn. This is why, as the president of the General Alliance against Racism and out of respect for the French and Christian identity, I can tell you that while, in France, we counted - and unfortunately this is too many - 24 racist acts out of 4 million offences committed last year, never has this anti-French racism - which accounted for more than 50 trials - been denounced outside our organization. This is the anti-Christian racism recognized by Mr Camus in the latest issue of the Tribune juive. Earlier, Mr Nordmann spoke to us about units being set up, units of the intolerable thought police which the great journalist Annie Kriegel wrote about in Le Figaro. On behalf of the Cercle d'amiti\u00e9s fran\u00e7aises, juives et chr\u00e9tiennes, I would like to say today that - astonishingly - there has still been no light shed on the Carpentras affair. I would like to take this opportunity to remind you that a few weeks ago the newspaper L'Ev\u00e9nement du Jeudi said: if the truth were revealed, there would be a tidal wave of public opinion in favour of the Front national in France. So I ask you here: Why has no light been shed on the Carpentras affair? I will answer. The truth is known. It was made known by Mr Joxe. It is being made known by Mr Pasqua. No light was shed because it was an ignoble sham to discredit the national movement in France. So, my Jewish friends from Carpentras told me: Tell them at Parliament, because the truth has not been told. I am going to tell you, because we were able to find the son of the Rabbi of Marseilles, we were able to find that Algerian teacher who wrecked cemeteries, and yet we have not found the profaners of Carpentras. I am asking today for some light to be shed on this, because truth... (77?^ President cut off the speaker) ROGALLA (PSE). - (DE) Mr President, I would like to point out that a large proportion of discriminatory acts against foreigners and other races has taken place within our borders. For more than 10 years this House has fought for the creation of the Single Market and abolished these borders, and at this very moment the... (The President cut off the speaker.) VAN OUTRIVE (PSE). - (NL) Mr President, first and foremost we are naturally pleased with the decision adopted at the Council of ministers of justice and the interior yesterday and the day before to the effect that they genuinely endorse the efforts of Parliament. We are also pleased that the Council is at last proposing a few measures. However, I would like to take up a specific point in our resolution, namely the one in which we ask the Commission to rapidly draw up a draft directive on combatting racial discrimination. In my opinion, such a proposal must attack the really problematic situations by means of prohibitory clauses. Let me mention just a few: all discrimination, in whatever sphere of life, especially with respect to access to the job market, to the housing market, to social protection, to public or private social and cultural life; and all racist and xenophobic propagan da or abuse, or incitement thereto. We have already heard some today - and here I am thinking of incorrect information or disinformation, of perverse associations of certain terms, like the systematic mentioning together of immigration and crime, of prostitution, immigration and drug trafficking which are all reported in the same breath in the press or speeches by certain politicians as if it still happens fairly often. The organizations, companies and persons who support such propaganda - including in financial terms - must be suppressed, as must all deeds or practices by public services, which result in harassment, in making it more difficult to obtain certain rights, in refused access by immigrants to organizations, or the sponsoring, defence or support of racial discrimination by public bodies, and finally punishment twice over, for example, by deporting legally resident individuals who have already served out their punishment. In all this, Mr President, there would of course appear to be a need for adequate legal aid, argumentation and access to the dispensation of justice, and for legal persons to instigate civil proceedings. Only by adopting such a concrete approach can an effective legal instrument be created for fighting racism and xenophobia. In conclusion, I would like to ask the Council - or those representing the Council here today - two specific questions. Has there been any talk of the proposal submitted by the European Parliament to make 1995 the year of understanding between different peoples? That is my first question. The second is this: might we also be granted access to the results of the inquiry on racism and xenophobia which was carried out in the various Member States? The results are also of interest to this Parliament. MEBRAK ZAIDI (PSE). - (FR) Mr President, once again, here we all are to debate a cancer which has not stopped spreading. Once again, we have to stigmatize the growing number of racist and xenophobic crimes and offences. I agree with my colleague, Mr Nordmann, when he talked about the importance of looking into this serious problem. How many more times will we have to do it before these extreme expressions of human stupidity are finally examined in a genuine policy of training, prevention and elimination. By sheer evasion, compromise or even false compromise with the possibilities of exclusion, Europe as a whole is witnessing the political emergence of movements advo cating the rejection of others and the withdrawal into an illusory regional or national authenticity. Members of the House, this is happening to such an extent that there are grounds for great concern about the composition of this House following the forthcoming European elections. Tomorrow it will be too late to lament over a Europe where the rhetoric of hate hissed by those currently sitting on our far right has become politically representative. It is up to us today to ensure that these revisionists of the concept of civilization remain permanently and com pletely marginalized. In the current crisis of society, injunctions and incanta tions are not enough. Indeed, they are never enough. Action is what we need. We must attack the roots of the evil with specific measures in the area of education, training, housing and citizenship. With every day that passes, the rhetoric of tolerance is losing ground precise ly because it is all too often just rhetoric. Every day, we look increasingly like smooth talkers, while other people ",
        "1.12.93 Debates of the European Parliament No 3-439/13 MEBRAK ZAIDI with simplistic solutions appear as remedies to the idleness of the people. In meetings and at colloquia, in conferences and at symposia, we function in a closed circuit among right-thinking people of multicultural wealth. At the same time, in France, funding is being cut to organizations and associations working to promote the integration of immigrants, literacy and the socialization of women. At the same time, in my region, during a debate bringing together economic and political officials, we heard an administrator from the national health board say: 'The foreigners who buy scores of gold crowns are responsible for the deficit in the social security system'. All this takes place against a backdrop of indifference or general approval. Shame on those officials who were present but said nothing, who did not reply, and who are stroking the foul beast the way it wants to be stroked. To conclude, Mr President, I am choosing to be naive and believe that this extraordinary part-session will at last lead to a startled leap and especially to action. (Applause) RAMIREZ HEREDIA (PSE). - (ES) Mr President, after listening to so many important speeches against racism, violence and xenophobia, and assuming that the words of the members are the most justified expression of Euro pean citizens on the whole, I wonder how there can be such great disagreement between what is being said and defended here and what we can see out there in our cities? The violence is increasing with every day that passes, occurring mainly in the major European cities where the losers are always the same: those who are different, immigrants, those whose culture or skin colour is differ ent. We will have to ask ourselves and search our own inner conscience as to what extent mere words and speeches alone will bridge this tremendous gap, the ever-growing chasm that is opening up between the majority of society - usually the sector wielding the political, and especially economic, power - and these enormous minorities who lack political power and, naturally, have absolutely no economic power whatsoever. Perhaps - along the lines of what I have just heard - Community legislation against racism and violence should be given drastically enhanced powers. I therefore agree with most of the speeches and good wishes that we have heard once again in this House this afternoon. However, it is once again with some alarm that I listened to the assertions made by the extreme right-wing section of the House, especially when reference was made to attitudes which - in times past, they say - could have arisen from certain attitudes of religious intolerance. Mr President, are we going to prove insensitive to the tragedy in the nearby Yugoslavia? Does ethnic cleansing not turn the stomach of all European democrats? Can we continue to remain insensitive when faced with the tragedy and pain of so many innocent human beings, and so many children whom we see every day on our television screens and who are the victims of ethnic cleansing? Is there any expression that could make even more graphically clear the extent to which human mad ness is capable of turning men into monsters, tigers and wolves who turn against their fellow men for no other reason than the fact that their skin colour is different or because they have a different religion? Mr President, I would like what we are saying and discussing here to result in something which - more than the Official Journal of the European Communities, via programmes which will unequivocally be empowered by the Commission and Council - will be engraved on our consciences and will make all of us human beings see how despicably we are behaving towards our fellows. (Applause) FLYNN, Member of the Commission. - Mr President, 1 have listened with very great interest to the debate and I recognize the intenseness with which many of the Mem bers contributed to it. Certainly the Commission and the Council are taking action on racism and xenophobia. From what many Members have said, what has been achieved and what is proposed following the conclusions of the Council meeting yesterday and the day before is appreciated and welcomed. Certainly I agree with Mem bers that more needs to be done and the Commission and the Council are committed to further action. That is an important point to stress. I say to Mr Turner that he would like to see the legal niceties disposed of and perhaps he can have a degree of freedom there but he must at least appreciate that it is not a luxury that I can take in the same way. I think he appreciates that point. Mr Ford made the suggestion concerning the Year of Tolerance. It is just as well to remind Members that the Heads of State of the Twelve are already committed in the context of the action plan agreed at the Council of Europe summit in Vienna earlier this year to supporting preparations for making 1995 the Year of Tolerance. I think that will be appreciated by all concerned. Mr Turner also mentioned the study of the legal instru ments that might be possible in this regard. He must remember that the Commission has already published a study on the legal instruments to counter racism and xenophobia, in December 1992. Since then the Commis sion has followed up that study by sponsoring the seminar in Montpellier in February. Of course I take on board the reference that was made to the social programming. The suggestion that this ques tion of racism and xenophobia should be seen in the wider situation of social policy is precisely the reason why I include it in the Green Paper on social policy, referring to the wider context and the fact that we need to take measures to promote social integration and to combat exclusion. I should also say that the European idea was and is built on tolerance and respect for fundamental rights. The great strength of Europe is the diversity of the traditions and the characters of all the peoples that make up this Union. That is the great potential of Europe and it was never intended in the creation of a united Europe that we would homogenize people into uniformity. Europe is a celebration of diversity and that is where it draws its great strength from. So the Union can only be truly democratic when we respect - and protect - the dignity of every citizen. Our attitude does not rely, I would suggest to Members, only on law and resolutions and matters ofthat nature. It relies on conviction and understanding of the fundamental human values that underpin all the society that makes up this Union. That is what the Commission stands for and that is what the Council and Commission will support. ",
        "No 3-439/14 Debates of the European Parliament 1.12.93 PRESIDENT PRESIDENT. - The joint debate is closed. I have received two motions for resolutions tabled pur suant to Rule 40(5) of the Rules of Procedure. (') The vote will take place on Thursday at 12 noon. (The sitting was adjourned from 6.40 p.m. to 6.45 p.m. to allow the Council time to arrive) 3. European Council of 10 and 11 December 1993 PRESIDENT. - The next item is the joint debate on the following oral questions to the Council: - B3-1545/93 by Mr Tindemans, on behalf of the Group of the European People's Party, on the meet ing of the European Council in Brussels on 10/11 December 1933; - B3-1548/93 by Cot and others, on behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists, on the meeting of the European Council to be held in Brussels on 10/11 December 1993; - B3-1540/93 by Mr de la Mal\u00e8ne, on behalf of the Group of the European Democratic Alliance, on the meeting of the European Council on 10 and 11 December 1993 in Brussels; - B3-1541 /93 by Mr Galland, on behalf of the Liberal, Democratic and Reformist Group, on the European Council meeting on 10/11 December 1993; - B3-1542/93 by Mr Miranda da Silva and others, on behalf of the Left Unity Group, on the European Council meeting on 10/11 December 1993 in Brus sels. TINDEMANS (PPE). - (NL) Mr President, Minister, Members of the House, I shall restrict myself to five remarks and five questions. Minister, I would like to begin - and believe me I say this with tremendous conviction - that this mini-session, this debate - however innocuous it may seem - is a kind of moment of truth, for it is the last occasion of its kind before major decisions are probably - I repeat, probably - made on 10 and 11 December. I hope that these decisions will take account of both the economic and social aspects since social and economic considerations always go hand in hand in Europe. Minister, with a current tally of 17 million unemployed in the Community, in a situation where there are long-term unemployed and jobless young people and where all this was already discussed first in Edinburgh and then in Brussels at the special meeting, we are finding that it is taking the Community, or the Union, far too long to make major decisions regarding the fight against unemploy ment and the striving to achieve economic growth. Nonetheless, the proposal to combat the crisis together if one arose was one of the main motives behind the founding of the European Community. So if we fail to live up to it, if we fail, the European idea will lose a great deal of its attractiveness. From the opinion polls you know as well as I that the citizens are currently tormented by three main concerns. Firstly, there are the issues of unemployment, jobs, growth: What will the future look like? And we all know ') See Minules that major depressions can lead to political disasters. Secondly, - and I say this not merely because our compatriot Mr Van Outrive mentioned it, but because the fact has emerged from opinion polls - there are the issues of crime, and the safety of our citizens. You know that this is one of the great concerns. Thirdly, - and I do not link this with what I just said - there is immigration policy. Europe, the Community, the Union must be in a position to implement a common immigration policy. My third remark is as follows. Presumably, during the European Council meeting on 10 and 11 December, when preparing to make decisions - or,as I hope, when the decisions are actually being made - the topic of subsidiarity will crop up. Well now, I would like to stress the following: anyone who knows their social history and is familiar with the history of social ideas, will know that subsidiarity was always bound up with solidarity, so the idea of solidarity should also feature in the European Council debate alongside that of subsidiarity. Historical ly this has always been the case. Fourthly, I would like to make an urgent appeal to the Belgian Presidency to watch out at the summit for decisions that might not go along the lines of consolidat ing the intergovernmental aspect, or which clearly deviate from what we always wanted with a view to achieving a kind of free trade zone in Europe, and to make especially certain that there is no change of tack. My fifth point is this, Minister. If institutional problems are debated, then I would like to point out that Parliament is particularly sensitive to the problems associated with it. We are the expression of the general right to vote. Well, if the structure of Europe, the institutions and their future is discussed, then this Parliament wants to play its full role in this context. Let there be no mistaking the fact that I would like to emphasize this point clearly on the eve of that meeting. I now come to my five questions. You have now heard my five remarks, which I made on behalf of my group. We hope - and I would like to press this point home, for this should have become abundantly clear from what I have said this far - that major decisions will indeed be made on 11 December. However, we are still not familiar with the contents of the White Paper, we do not know what will be proposed in it. We do not know the White Paper and I would like to go even further and say that I was struck by an expression used a few times by Jacques Delors. He spoke of the programme for the 21st century, the politics of the 21st century, and during the past few days I even read somewhere that he is supposed to have said that the White Paper is not yet the plan for the 21 st century. Well now, Minister, that being the case I would ask this about the summit to be held on 10 and 11 December: What is its significance and what could the link between the White Paper and the plan for the 21st century be? Secondly, Minister, it has always been said - and we are also convinced of this, there being no hesitation on that score - that the European programme for combatting the crisis or attempting to achieve new growth, is comple mentary to what is being done at national level, and vice versa: national policy should complement what is being done at European level. I would like to urge - and I hope that there will be no discrepancy between European policy and whatever actions are intended to be compie- ",
        "1.12.93 Debates of the European Parliament No 3-439/15 TINDEMANS mentary at national level, because neither policy should neutralize or even cancel out the other - that this point be borne in mind as well. Thirdly, Minister, we have on occasion heard rather confused reports about a spectacular plan for the devel opment of our infrastructure. Recently we have heard no more about it. So my third question to you is this: What is happening? Is there already or will there soon be a spectacular proposal? I mean it when I say spectacular; this is not just a throwaway expression. Is there such a spectacular European plan for infrastructure and public works in the pipeline? Fourthly, and you will already have noted this from what I have said thus far: If institutional reforms are to be debated, what kind of institutional reforms will these be? Believe me, Parliament is greatly concerned about what might be said there. Will it be a matter of what we in Union jargon call arithmetical adjustments or of inevi table reforms with a view to enlargement? Will the number of members of the Council or the number of members of the Commission be affected, or will the reforms dig deeper still? I would like to point out, once more, that this Parliament is paying particular attention to the direction such proposals might take, and once more I would like to ask you the question: Is something afoot in the European Council? Can you say something about it now, or is it for later? Finally, my fifth question - and you may well be surprised to hear me say this at this time - will the subject of a European constitution be raised, perhaps? Here in Parliament we have been considering this idea since 1989. The first rapporteur on the subject was Emilio Colombo, who was later called back to Italian politics and left the European Parliament. The next rapporteur was Marcelino Oreja, who has now gone back into Spanish politics, also leaving us. At present our member Fernand Herman is the rapporteur. Believe me, some highly readable material has been produced on the subject of a European constitution. A position has been developed that uses legal, political and ethical arguments to appeal for the quickest possible adoption of a European constitution. If we had one, any Member State, and any candidate for accession, would know what they were committing themselves to when they joined the Com munity, what the basic principles of this Union are, and in which direction we must think when considering new proposals or fresh developments. Minister, the question I am asking you is this: Could this topic be raised at the summit, and if not when might it crop up? When you have answered this, Parliament will feel encouraged in its attempts to get to grips with the matter as best it can. Minister, I do not need much more time to tell you what is going on in my group, but I would like to underline one more thing: we consider the European Council meeting on 10 and 11 December to be highly significant - very dangerous, too - but highly significant. The European idea will live or die depending on what is decided there. At this time of crisis, everybody is waiting to see what decisions are made there. If none are forthcoming, then we will lose our faith in the joint endeavour to construct Europe. Consequently, we are also counting on all the Member States - and especially on the Belgian Presiden cy - for a favourable outcome of the meeting on 10 and II December. The Belgian Presidency could round off its term nicely there. That is my message to the Belgian Presidency. (Applause) DURY (PSE). - (FR) Mr President, we have just held a debate on racism and xenophobia. I would like to emphasize the incoherence of this afternoon's sitting. There is indeed a link between the rise of the far right, the rise of racism, the rise of the withdrawal into ourselves and what the Brussels Summit will have to decide. I would like to say first of all that our debate is a bit distorted because the next summit will be devoted to a White Paper with which we are not yet familiar. There fore, I have an initial question: Is this White Paper ready? Jacques Delors will tell us about it tomorrow, but today we are debating merely on the basis of hypotheses. My question is a simple one: What can we expect from this summit? I can tell already you that we socialists expect to see the emergence of a genuine political will to face up to the crisis and put an end to unemployment. For now, I would like to tell you about our disappointment. Edinburgh was only a timid response to the questions we were asking ourselves. We feel that this response was inadequate, especially since the Ministers of Finance did not manage to implement anything. Nothing came out of Edinburgh. Today, we can clearly see what elements are needed to revive job-creating growth. I emphasize the word 'growth'. I say it especially to my colleagues among the Greens who were responsible for the failure of the progressive resolution on the White Paper last month under the pretext that it was inspired by an ideology of growth. I lay claim to this ideology, because without growth there can be no creation of jobs. Of course, there should not just be any old growth. Growth must be sustainable, and in particular it should respect the envi ronment. However, rejecting growth also means rejecting employment. Our friends the Greens claim that they are defending employment and struggling against unemploy ment, but by rejecting the means to do so they are fooling both themselves and the people. In a nutshell, we are at 'zero' growth. The result is that there are 17 million unemployed people in the Community. We therefore want a recovery based on four elements - and here I am referring to the paper by the economist Malinvaux and his colleagues. First of all, a neo-Keyne- sian recovery at European level. This means, for exam ple, the implementation of large networks with major financial backing. Jacques Delors spoke of ECU 150 billion. We could be content with ECU 100 million, but the figures must be considerable to be up to the task of this major recovery effort. Secondly, there must be an effort in the area of research. At least 3% of GDP should be earmarked for research if we want to take on the United States and Japan in the open competition of the world economy. Thirdly, the concerted lowering of interest rates, at least in the short term. Fourthly, we need a genuine social policy. Of course, our competitiveness has diminished, but it is not by engaging in social devaluation that we will be able to respond to the problems. Should we wear down social rights? Surely our wealth lies in human capital, the level of training and the quality of work? Surely the reduction ",
        "No 3-439/16 Debates of the European Parliament 1.12.93 DURY of social charges on low wages - to be financed by an energy tax or by a European tax on capital - would be the best response to the needs of the people? I would say that the Belgian Presidency has not made much progress on this point or on taxation. Let us hope that the Council will have the audacity and will to once again take responsibility for these elements, both in principle and in terms of the scale of expenditure allocated to them. This is an essential condition for restoring confidence. Of course, the Presidency of the Council is not alone. It is true that it has run up against the opposition of certain Member States, primarily Great Britain to be exact. We find it inexcusable that, after paying lip service to the ratification of the Treaty of Maastricht, the British Prime Minister should day after day undertake to empty the Treaty of all its content and dismantle the social aspect of Europe. The example of the directive on working time is totally significant. After doing everything it could to empty the directive of any true content, Great Britain not only abstained from the vote, but said it would file a complaint with the Court of Justice. Great Britain has also set about discrediting Economic and Monetary Union and systematically blocking the will to recovery. Undoubtedly other governments find Great Britain's positions convenient, which for them serve as an element of justification. In any case, I would like us to make a show in the opposite direction. The last meeting of the Council of Ministers of the Economy and Finance boggled the mind. Is it not time for the Member States to show that they do not want to accept unemployment and that there is a genuine will to organize a European recovery, at least by the Eleven? Is it inconceivable to imagine a second Edinburgh Summit in Brussels without the United Kingdom? That would be a two-speed Europe, but then again, is there not one already? Once again, let the Eleven decide on an opt-out with a majority vote. Then we will see what Mr Major does when his back is to the wall! I repeat: no single country can get out of the crisis alone. When a country tries to extricate itself to the detriment of its neighbours through competitive devaluation, exper ience shows that such action resolves nothing in the short term. Our countries must balance their public debts. Their room for manoeuvre is increasingly tight. Their spending is rising because of unemployment and social exclusion. Often, the only choice possible is a deflationary one. The only answer is therefore growth and a policy that encou rages employment. For a decade now, workers have made efforts to be productive, and they have made efforts to moderate wages. However, they have noticed that their efforts have been in vain and that more job losses are announced with every day that passes. Yet Europe is rich in savings. Nonetheless, private investment has visibly dropped by 10% over the past few years. Since the economic world does not want to assume its responsibil ities, it is up to the heads of state and government to assume them in order to implement a group of coherent measures for together combatting unemployment and social exclusion. Minister, the pressures of the labour market are growing, as you are well aware. Governments are often driven to make difficult decisions. However, efforts at productivity have primarily benefitted the world of capital. Let us halt this spiral. The every-man-for-himself attitude has its limits, because it is all of us together - especially the workers - who will be plunged into disarray if we reject Europe. I would now like to say a word about foreign policy. The situation in the former Yugoslavia and the calvary of Bosnia is a shame for us all. Why did the Council not at least consent to make the symbolic gesture of making Sarajevo the cultural capital of Europe for one week? I shall conclude by raising the subject of the elections in Russia. We were all pleased that a decision was made to take joint action to observe the forthcoming elections. We were right to do so, because we are worried. Yester day, it was announced that Yeltsin supporters asked that the opposition be gagged under the pretext that it was criticizing the president's draft constitution. Is it really in line with Europe's position to support the unacceptable? I hope not, and I would like to hear what you have to say on this subject. Just a while ago, Mr President, we heard Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin talk. He made an appeal to Europe. We will soon have the pleasure of hearing Mr Arafat in Strasbourg. We know that the process under way is a delicate one. Mr Rabin asked us for support in two ways: firstly, by contributing major economic aid to the Pales tinians in order to change the situation on the ground with housing and work. However, I think we must also make a gesture towards Israel. Israel must become Europe's economic partner, with greater opening up of Europe. I believe that the peace efforts must be accompanied by positive signs. We await this summit with hope, albeit a hope tinged with scepticism. We do not doubt the goodwill of the Belgian Presidency. It already has many positive achiev ements to its credit. Everyone acknowledges this. How ever, the goodwill of the Belgian Presidency in no way guarantees a goodwill effort on the part of the European Council. Mr President-in-Office, I implore you to tell your collea gues about the disarray of those we represent. Their voices are not being heard, even if they are listened to from time to time. It is truly important that the workers, the men and women, the citizens of the Union have the impression that this Europe exists for them, and not only for ideals whose purpose they never see. It is truly important to give Europeans hope! (Applause) IN THE CHAIR: SIR JACK STEWART-CLARK Vice-President BEAZLEY, Christopher (PPE). - Mr President, on a point of order. Could the House be assured that when the President-in-Office of the Council replies to the debate, the comments that the Socialist spokesman has just made about the British Government and Prime Minister Major will be touched on because it was clearly a Socialist attack. It is not fair to call Britain responsible for creating a two-speed Europe. If I were to lower myself, I might say to Mrs Dury that her country is a two-speed country. I would never say that. It is not true what she said. I hope ",
        "1.12.93 Debates of the European Parliament No 3-439/17 BEAZLEY, Christopher that the President will represent all the Council of Ministers in his reply. DE LA MALENE (RDE). - (FR) Mr President, Members of the House, the European Council which is to meet in a few days's time will, it would seem, talk about unem ployment. At last, at last - we are tempted to say! We had to wait until there were almost 18 million unemployed in Europe and for the crisis to reach such proportions before the European Council would officially turn its attentions to unemployment. However, as it is our absolute priority, let us not spoil our pleasure. Let us not deny our satisfaction. We are pleased that this is so. Two documents will be tabled at the Council, both of which we are only very partly familiar with. This makes our debate slightly surrealistic. One document concerns the medium term, and is called the White Paper, and other document - with which we are a bit more familiar - concerns the short term. This second document was drawn up by virtue of Article 103 of the Treaty on European Union. Even though we have organized separate debates, these two texts cannot be separated. A single objective seems to emerge: to do whatever is necessary to ensure that the number of unemployed in the Community is halved by the year 2000. There is one precondition for achieving this objective: a strong growth rate of at least 3.5%. Of course we are very far from achieving that. We must provide ourselves with the means to achieve this objec tive, namely to achieve a stable macro-economic frame work that is improved by the competitiveness of our economy. Finally, there must be multiple actions promot ing employment. We cannot but agree about all this. We are agreed, first of all because the Commission is showing a firm will, something which is not always the case in this area. Many economists are rallying more to an attitude of laissez-faire and free trade. We are in favour of voluntarist action. How could one fail to approve the proposed wage restraint? How could one fail to approve the proposed priority on investment? How could one fail to approve the rejection of the proposed reduction in working time? How could one reject the reduction of tax or social security charges that weigh down on low wages? We can go along with all this. But what we can perhaps object to is the fact that these proposals are not very original and that indeed nothing is very original in this document. However, at this point in my speech I would like to express three concerns, because I fear that there are a few contradictions. My first concern centres on currency. There is little talk of currency in this document. Yet we know that it occupies an important position in Punta del Este. There is no longer any mention of it. However, we are aware of the impact that monetary manipulations can have on our economy, whether these manipulations are internal or external. My second concern centres on the international commer cial environment of our Community, namely the GATT problem. I am not one of those who expect a great deal - at least not in the short term - from these negotiations and this policy, because the game has become so distorted. The Commission talks of a new multilateral trade organ ization. But who believes in this new trade organization? Who believes that it will emerge from the GATT nego tiations? Surely it will never see the light of day, just like the Havana Charter never saw the light of day in the early 1950s. Everyone knows that our American friends are not prepared to abandon their trade sovereignty. So there will not be a new international trade organization. Uncon trolled and unsanctioned multilateralism will be knock ing on the door of our disarmed Community. My third concern is motivated by the possibly deflation ary effect of the efforts required or imposed by economic convergence, which set out a path that is difficult to keep to. In our view, we have repeatedly and forcefully asserted that no other priority should weaken the urgency associated with the fight against unemployment. These are my three concerns: currency, the lack of a trade organization, and the problem of reconciling our conver gence policies with the fight against unemployment. That brings me to the end, Mr President. In conclusion, I would simply like to say that the Community does not have a good image among many sectors of public opinion as far as the fight against unemployment is concerned. However, elections will be held in a few months. The Council will have to drastically increase its awareness if it is to improve this image. Otherwise we risk facing a bitter morning after. (Applause) WIJSENBEEK (LDR). - (NL) Mr President, the aim of this debate, as referred to in the questioning, is to learn from the Council exactly what will be discussed here in Brussels. Naturally, the socio-economic circumstances - as most of my colleagues have already pointed out - will comprise the main course. Well, tomorrow we will be hearing in detail about the socio-economic affairs, but now for once we simply must have a clear answer from the Council as to the full list of items on the agenda. I really wanted to devote rather more attention to the intergovernmental side of the debate because, Mr Presi dent, in view of the relevant procedures we must make it quite clear that, to put it mildly, there is an anomaly here. For before the European Council takes place, Mr Presi dent, the European Parliament should be given an oppor tunity to state its opinion. Put more strongly, nothing can be done in the Council before Parliament has given its opinion, and I would point out that both Article J.7 and Article K.6 of the Maastricht Treaty or the Treaty on European Union state the following: the Presidency shall consult the European Parliament on the principal aspects of activities in the areas referred to in this Title, and that applies both in Article J on foreign policy and in Article K on home affairs. Let me reiterate: 'The Presidency (...) shall ensure that the views of the European Parliament are duly taken into consideration'. I would now like to hear from the President-in-Office of the Council what he understands by 'duly taken into consideration', and how he envisages expressing the feelings of Parliament when Messrs Tindemans and Cot, and in their wake Mrs Dury, say that there is no real need for a decision, while other groups have just said 'no. Parliament expresses its opinions in a decision on which a vote has been taken, because otherwise the President- in-Office of the Council will be unable to do his work on 10 and 11 December'. For how should he then properly represent the view adopted by Parliament? ",
        "No 3-439/18 Debates of the European Parliament 1.12.93 WIJSENBEEK But there is another aspect, too. It begins with the fact that the Council has not once really consulted us and that the President-in-Office of the Council should really have done so and must still put it to us. I am still waiting to hear how the President-in-Office of the Council will actually answer that. In actual fact, he should first have submitted to us what the basis of the debates in the Council was, and, as Mr de la Malene has just said, we can pick up bits here and there, we can read something in the press that ministers have said and the piece by Delors is worthless, but what is really on the agenda now, how it is debated and how the ministers then sit down and consult each other, that is something we do not know. Put in much stronger terms, I would like to point out, Mr President, that if we had not organized this debate here at our own initiative, then the Council would probably not have been able to adopt a legally valid decision. I must now put a very clear question to the President- in-Office of the Council. If, at least, you read articles J.7 and K.6 closely, then the Council cannot make legally valid decisions unless we have given our opinion. How ever, did the people in Maastricht - who did this to an even greater extent - say that there is no possibility of appealing to the European Court of Justice in order to have this matter sorted out? I am pushing for the jurisprudence of the Court of Justice because I hold its judges in very high regard, and I would refer to the fact that the isoglucose ruling back in 1980 clearly indicated that where Parliament should be consulted and has not given its opinion, no legally valid decision is made. Now we cannot run to the European Court of Justice with this matter, but I think that even a normal judge would be sufficiently capable of saying something. Just imagine, if we had not made that judgement at our own initiative, then there would still be no legally valid decision by the Council. This, at last, brings me on to the matter itself, to the fact that the European Council - at least as far as we are aware - is going to set priorities in the area of cooperation in the field of justice. Precisely in that field, it is of the greatest importance - for our voters, too - that we let our opinion be heard, because for us the fact that the Council is now going to set something in motion as far as police cooperation is concerned is of the greatest importance, for we, too, are in favour of our citizens having freedom of movement - including, therefore, those citizens who want to get up to mischief. Consequently, the people paid out of public funds to prevent those who are of a mind to get up to mischief from doing so should also have freedom of movement. This means, then, that in any case our policemen must have every opportunity to apprehend villains. However, if this means merely putting together all kinds of files - and I am happy that this is happening round the corner from where I live, and as a Member of Parliament will go in and to see what is happening - then that is still not subject to parliamentary control. I believe that we must be given the right to contribute our opinion on this and we are therefore in favour of the objectives of a common policy on police matters, but we certainly want to exercise some parliamentary control. Surely there is nothing wrong with that. We repeatedly hear from the Council that there is absolutely no way of achieving this, that it is a matter determined by officials, and that no Members of Parliament must get a look in, because that is dangerous, for all kinds of people who are also terrorists will then find out what has actually been ferreted out. That is not the case, Mr President, but it is true to say that we want to bear our responsibility. There are still a number of other matters that I actually wanted to raise. In any case I would like to point out that the Dublin convention must now finally be ratified by all members of the European Union. I would like to point out that we should all have a passport and an identity card, and in memory of the late President of this Parliament, Mr Cornelius Berkhouwer, I would also like to say that our citizens should have a Community driving licence, stamps and passport. One more question, Mr President, regarding the lan guages used in the patent office. Is it really true that Mr Lubbers has just said that the Belgian prime minister, Mr Dehaene, supposedly intends to omit Dutch, and that Mr Lubbers therefore went along with him? PIQUET (CG). - (FR) I would rather we did not tell each other any tales during this debate. Community authorities and national governments both recognize the gravity of the situation: the economic recession that is taking hold in the long term, the steady rise in unemployment, the poor and the excluded whose ranks are constantly grow ing. However, one question arises: How did this situation come about? In my opinion, this situation is the result of policies of austerity and rigour implemented in the Member States. Nevertheless, instead of learning a lesson from this situation and from this failure, the Commission and the Council are persevering in their pursuit of the same policy. They are reaffirming the same commitment to the convergence criteria which are choking off national budget policies. They are continuing to implement a liberalization process that destroys jobs, and they are strengthening their offensive against social acquis. Yet everyone has noticed that the people are reacting strong ly. Strikes and demonstrations are becoming more fre quent in many Member States in defence of employment, purchasing power and social acquis. Can we continue to act while ignoring this reality and the will of the people? Mr President-in-Office, do you not consider it necessary to take heed and account of the protests and desires of the people? This is no time for half-measures or pretence; we need a genuine reversal of priorities. Employment must become the priority objective of any Community policy. This is why I think we must refuse to allow the search for competitiveness at any price to serve as an excuse for lowering wages, deregulating labour and weakening social protection. In my opinion, we must follow a completely different logic in order to contribute towards a genuine recovery of the economy and to develop employment. We must take a determined stand to rein force the European growth initiative and renounce the convergence criteria which are causing recession. We must also show greater determination in taking account of the problems of employment and training, as well as maintaining and modernizing public services. In addition, we should gain control over the movement of capital, and tax it in real terms so that money goes towards production and the fulfilment of needs, rather than towards speculation. Lastly, we should affirm the requirement to implement a process to reduce working time without affecting workers' incomes. I believe, Mr President, that time is of the essence and that we must assume our responsibilities. ",
        "1.12.93 Debates of the European Parliament No 3-439/19 (Applause) CLAES, President-in-Office of the Council - (NL/FR) Mr President, Members of the House, it would seem useful for me to begin by saying for the benefit of Mr Wijsenbeek that a European Council has no agenda and has never had one. It is the President of the Council who sends out a letter to all his colleagues and proposes certain topics, but there is nothing to prevent other topics being raised in the course of the Council meeting itself. That is the reality of the matter and I would ask you to take that into account. I am here to listen attentively to what you and your colleagues have to say. I believe that the President of the Commission will be here in your midst tomorrow. He will come here not to rest, but to listen to you. It goes without saying that we are prepared to take account of the advice and views presented by Parliament. If you lack confidence in those members of the Council or of the Commission who have contact with Parliament, then I would like to remind you that for some time now each European Council meeting has begun with a statement by the President of the European Parliament. If you are of the opinion that we are airing your opinions to an insufficient extent, then perhaps you have a more reliable element, consisting of burdening your President with the task of bringing across your views to the European Council where he is always the first person to take the floor, and I can assure you that his words are most attentively listened to. I think that you have presented things rather one-sidedly and needlessly expressed your concern about the manner in which the Commission and Council supposedly neglect to take account of the advice and suggestions made by the European Parliament. With respect to this evening's debate, Mr President, I will concede that I am in a rather delicate position. You do not know what is in the White Paper, and neither do I. The ECOFIN Council will only meet this Sunday - so I would hope - to hold a definitive discussion on the recommen dations which include Article 103, the main economic orientations and the White Paper. The following day, the General Affairs Council may work through these topics again to create the conditions that should enable the European Council to make some fruitful decisions. The President of the Commission will most probably be able to give you a more precise idea tomorrow. In any case, the President of the European Council, Belgian Prime Minister Dehaene, has visited the various capitals in order to try and gain a clear view of the global orienta tions that should be able to be chosen at the European Council meeting on 10 and 11 December. Before the Commission begins its final deliberations on both Article 103 and the White Paper, there will be a fresh meeting between the Presidency and the Commission. So please accept my apologies that I cannot already go into detail on documents which we are not certain exist. Be that as it may, I would like to begin by echoing what Mr Tindemans said in his introduction. It is undoubtedly correct to say that the European institutions have reacted - and are still reacting - sluggishly to the major chal lenges of our time. Structural unemployment, the general feeling of insecurity, and the problem of migration and immigration. In fact, like Mr Tindemans, I believe that Europe is losing its credibility and that it is high time to take structural decisions on the matter. It is undoubtedly the case that the forthcoming European Council repre sents a select opportunity which should not be missed, and I would like to assure Mr Tindemans that the Presidency will make the greatest possible effort to create the conditions required to make difficult, delicate deci sions, whereby the standing of Europe is consolidated and, moreover, some prospect of a solution is generated after those major challenges of which you rightly rem inded us. At the same time - and I will return to this in a moment - you rightly pointed out the necessary parallel that must exist between subsidiarity, on the one hand, and solidarity, on the other solidarity being an ethnic value which I believe to be a fundamental aspect of Western civilization. I can assure you, Mr Tindemans, that as far as the Presidency is currently concerned, we shall do everyth ing we possibly can to check a stronger intergovernmen tal approach and to try and find solutions to the chal lenges you listed which point in the direction of the integral consolidation of European integration. I already mentioned Article 103. This is the very first time that we are having to implement this article, and I admit that we are looking in a slightly clumsy and definitely uncertain manner for the best way in which to actually try and invite the heads of state and prime ministers to shed some light on these options together. In any case, it is a fact that in this case Article 103 and the White Paper cannot be viewed separately. They must form a single whole, whereby the short term joins up with the long term. Both will have to form a single strategy, otherwise I fear that we risk partly missing our first rendezvous with the Maastricht Treaty, at least as far as its first pillar is concerned. This is an initial difficulty which should not be underestimated, and with which the Commission, incidentally, is also faced. How exactly should this Article 103 be interpreted in this structurally difficult period of crisis and recession? How should we approach it? Listening to President Delors and other members of the Commission, I think I can nonetheless say that it is not the Commission's intention to come up with some kind of legislative programme, even if there is a concern to avoid falling into an abstract, academic discussion which will ultimately not be of much use to the 17 million unemployed already mentioned by several speakers. Nevertheless, I would like emphasize that in my own modest opinion there are no miracle cures for the great challenges confronting us today. Mr Piquet, you will no doubt allow me to point out that you, too, failed to suggest any miracle cure to stave off the structural crisis with which not only Europe, but the whole world, is confronted. We must take account of the elements which have fundamentally changed and which are making it necess ary for us to perform an agonizing review not only of our policies, but also of our very strategies. In any case, there are various elements which I believe cannot be neglected. This very afternoon the Presidency, together with the Commission, held talks with the Amer ican Secretary of State, Warren Christopher, and Mr Kantor on the problem of liberalizing world trade. I do not intend to dare to play a numbers game like, say, the OECD has done. Nor do I think that the solution to the problems specific to the Uruguay Round will be the same as the solution to all our problems, but I certainly do believe that - both psychologically and in terms of its ",
        "No 3-439/20 Debates of the European Parliament 1.12.93 CLAES content - a balanced global agreement before 15 Decem ber will serve as a non-negligible impulse for the world economy. Thus, I believe that, in these decisive times, we in Europe must make a significant effort to create the conditions required to achieve a global solution to the problems of today by 15 December in Geneva. Please note that I said a global, but balanced agreement, in which we must take care of our interests - not just as far as the agricultural sector and cultural specificity are concerned - but also where all the other extremely important dossiers, such as access to the market, the abolition of excessively high tariffs, intellectual property and services figure on the agenda. We must ensure that these new agreements succeed in stimulating Europe. Another element which makes us green with envy, I find, is connected with the weak competitiveness of our businesses. I do not think that anyone can dispute that an effort must be made to lower labour costs. May I go along with you in pointing out that not one of our 12 Member States today is capable of making such a major effort by itself. Compensatory measures are required and inevita bly we want to prevent ourselves from sinking into situations that are impossible in budgetary terms. Conse quently, I believe that it is necessary for the Council to support specific initiatives already taken by the Belgian Presidency. I am, for instance, thinking of the formula of the CO2 tax. I am also thinking of the need for fiscal harmonization within the Community. I am thinking of specific measures against the activity called 'specula tion'. To my mind, the best way would appear to be fiscal harmonization. Members of the House, I did not write the Treaty, nor did you. However, you need unanimity and, unfortunate though it may be, your unanimity is lacking in the Council today. So you will have to continue pleading for it, calling for greater understanding from all those who are currently of the opinion that we should not work in this direction. I am thinking of another element which I believe is pretty generally accepted by all the groups in Parliament, although the approaches probably differ in kind. We may end up having to introduce greater flexi bility into the work process in Europe, and that must find its expression in different ways of redistributing work. Please do not ask me to wager all my cards on a single formula. Moreover, I believe that would be neither wise, nor appropriate. Various formulae are possible, depend ing on the country concerned, the characteristics of a particular industrial sector or features of a specific company. In a gesture of solidarity, these formulae must enable us to work on a manner of redistributing work which will ultimately result in unemployment coming down again. There can be no doubt that a series of social considerations must be taken into consideration here, with maximum retention of purchasing power. However, personally speaking, in this economy of ours which is characterized by increasingly severe competition vis a-vis new competitors who - primarily at the technolog ical level -are gradually beginning to rival Europe, I have my doubts as to whether all this can be done without purchasing power being affected in some way. I cannot imagine all those who negotiated formulae for redistri buting work at Volkswagen in Germany - the trade unionists, the workers themselves - being idiots or irresponsible individuals. They opted for greater solidar ity in the redistribution of work, for which they were prepared to pay a certain price. I have no difficulty with the fact that other sectors of the population should actually make a much greater effort. I repeat, unfortu nately at present the European Council lacks the unanim ity required under the terms of the Treaty to bring this about. Let us make that quite clear. Another element that will undoubtedly be one of the ideas that crops up in the White Paper is connected with the need to enhance efforts in training and retraining. Today, the form of capital par excellence is human knowledge. So there would appear to be no doubt that top priority will have to be given to efforts concerned with research and develop ment and scientific research. I must be rather cautious as far as one further element is concerned. Mr Tindemans asked me a very specific question: once again, we are not being told anything about the ideas of the President of the Commission regarding the major programme involving all kinds of communications projects. As far as I am aware, it remains his intention to come up with a proposal of this kind. Back in Edinburgh, a not inconsiderable portion of the ECU 8 billion provided was already earmarked for the implementation of such projects. Personally, I think that Mr Delors - who will be able to confirm this himself tomorrow - is continuing to maintain that the efforts to be made here must be intensified, not only vis-a-vis the 12 Member States themselves, but also with a view to the improvement and modernization of the economy, espe cially in central Europe. I would now like to draw your attention to the limits concerning the policy for recovery. If we have to call on the capital market to finance these programmes, taking account of the limitations characterizing the national budgets today, we will have to avoid asking too much of the capital market and thereby stimulating a rise in interest rates, the essential aim being to lower the cost of money. So there are very delicate balances to be res pected. We must not give public opinion the impression that we can find any sum at all to finance whatever programme we like. The cost of money is a key element in all politics, which must promote durable growth and hence quality. Coming back to the comments made by Mr Tindemans and Mrs Dury, I would say that all this has to be done within a framework of solidarity. Consequently, more attention must be paid to the social chapter, as defined in the Maastricht Treaty. You have no doubt noticed that the Presidency included several concluding paragraphs on this subject at the special summit in Brussels. We are hoping to find the means to develop these paragraphs by linking them to Article 103 and the White Paper at the summit on 10 and II December. Mr Tindemans, I do not think - although you never know - that the meeting on 10 and 11 December will give rise to a fundamental institutional debate. The Presidency has been asked to examine the extent of agreement that the Twelve might reach regarding an institutional approach to the enlargement of the Community. We shall measure the extent to which the Council on 6 December can agree to the approach adopted by the Presidency, which would be in favour of a linear extension of course, regarding the importance of the votes in the Council. Unfortunately, so far I have not managed to detect any unanimity, but that is the direction in which we would like to go. I believe I ",
        "1.12.93 Debates of the European Parliament No 3-439/21 CLAES already said as much to the Committee on Foreign Affairs and Security, and I would like to reiterate it here once again. Nevertheless, like you and others, I believe that the time has come to create a framework that would allow a philosophical interinstitutional debate on the institutional future of our Union. It is high time that we set this in motion. I think that we must at any cost avoid a useless confrontation between so-called large and small Member States. However, I repeat that there can be no avoiding the doctrinal debate on the future of Europe. If we really intend to go over to more efficient formulae, whereby the small Member States will supposedly have to take a small step backwards, then we would have to give up the intergovernmental approach, because if it is maintained then any Member State, however large or small, can express itself with the same votes of equal value. So there is no way to avoid this debate having to be held in substance on the occasion of the fundamental institution al debate. Everyone must appreciate this and I am very much aware that you have never doubted for a moment that there is no way around this. We are playing it purely by ear for now. As regards the problems associated with Article 103, I can unfortunately not say much more on this at present for the reasons I have already explained to you and for which I would ask your understanding. Only at the beginning of next week will we know more precisely how far we can and cannot go - with the very first exercise of the option on major economic orientations in the short term, complemented by a White Paper that extends the structural aspect in the longer term. With regard to the former Yugoslavia, I would like to take this opportunity to say to Mrs Dury that, as you know, we took up the initiative again in Geneva the day before yesterday. I am not going to shout victory. After all the failures we have experienced it would be impru dent of me to talk to you so soon of a success. All that I can say to you for the moment is that firstly, as far as humanitarian aid is concerned, we have succeeded in convincing the generals to sign the agreement drawn up by Mrs Ogata. These signatures ought ultimately to enable us to intensify this humanitarian aid, which is as necessary as it is urgent. However, so often have such signatures not been respected that I would prefer to await their application on the ground before making a state ment. Secondly, we have succeeded in convincing the various parties concerned to stay in Geneva and resume negotia tions on the basis of the proposals made by the European Union and taking account of the so-called 'invincible' acquis. I would not risk making an optimistic prognosis. Some comments made by the actors in this tragedy have, in my opinion, been too negative to hazard doing so. I think it was our duty to create an element enabling the co-chairmen, Mr Stoltenberg and Lord Owen, to resume the talks. That much we have done. The 12 foreign affairs ministers are not ruling out the possibility of a further meeting before the end of December to give a fresh boost to the negotiations. Unfortunately, for the moment I can say nothing further on the subject of the former Yugosla via. Regarding the elections in Russia, or rather our efforts aimed at consolidating this regime, which is still looking to establish democracy, and at helping the economy which, as you know, is growing weaker every day, we have decided, first of all, to send observers. A coordina tion centre has been set up in Moscow in conjunction with the Council of Europe and the CSCE. In conjunction with the national parliaments we are now assured of the presence of some 300 observers, which nonetheless means that even now there will be no observer in around 30 Russian electoral constituencies. Consequently, we should further intensify our efforts during the final days. More importantly, it would seem that we are hoping to finalize a partnership agreement with Russia before the European Council meeting on 10 and 11 December. That is why we have invited President Yeltsin. The Commis sion experts are negotiating in Moscow at this very moment. We will have the chance to discuss a final text with Mr Kozyrev the day after tomorrow in Brussels, at the COCOMA meeting. I believe that all this indicates the Community's readiness to assume its responsibilities with a view to promoting stability in Eastern Europe. Certainly, like you, I am asking myself several questions regarding presidential intervention in certain electoral broadcasts on television. Russia, which has never known democracy, is in its apprenticeship in that respect, and I would say that it is our duty to help things move along in the right direction. Finally, an allusion was made to your meeting with the Israeli Prime Minister, Mr Rabin, who was in turn received by the Council today. In this context, I can tell you that we have taken on our responsibilities regarding the Palestinians, i.e. vis-a-vis the PLO. The European Union is ready to commit itself - in an extremely wide-ranging programme - to the tune of ECU 50\u00d2 million. The PLO is making good progress. A page has been turned and institutions must now be created that guarantee sufficient transparency as well as efficiency in the implementation of projects. On the other hand, we are ready to aid all those who are now seeking to stimulate the peace process by associating other countries of key importance, e.g. Syria. Moreover - and this is a matter of honour for the Belgian Presidency - the Palestinians must be aided but so must the State of Israel. It is with this in mind that a proposal for a mandate to negotiate for the Commission figures on the agenda of the General Affairs Council scheduled to be held on 6 December. The aim of this mandate would be to thoroughly review the cooper ation agreement negotiated in the 1970s. There, too, I hope that we will very soon be able to send out a positive signal to the Israeli people, thereby showing in an impartial manner that the European Union is ready to assume its responsibilities in an attempt to stimulate and consolidate the peace process which, without the sligh test doubt, is in something of a jam for the moment. Mr President, I would like to reiterate to all those who have spoken how convinced I am that, in the few days remaining for it, the Belgian Presidency will make every possible effort to create the conditions which ought to permit the European Council to take measures of a structural nature with a view to strengthening the compe titiveness of the European economy, improving our instruments for combatting unemployment - both of young people and the long-term unemployed - and enabling us at last to present public opinion with a bundle of measures in which the plans for short term run entirely along the same lines as the structural medium term, i.e. the White Paper. ",
        "No 3-439/22 Debates of the European Parliament 1.12.93 (Applause) BARON CRESPO (PSE). - (ES) Mr President, we are on the eve of what will probably be the final European Council before the elections for the European Parliament to be held next year. In addition, the European Union was born just last 1 November. So we all have an obligation to create fresh momentum and show a genuine commitment to the future. I believe that the question we are raising here and which is being raised by our fellow citizens is whether work or well-being have any meaning or future and, consequently, whether the agreements to which we have committed ourselves - i.e. the achievement of political, economic and monetary union - will actually lead anywhere. In this respect this debate on the White Paper and its existence is receiving little attention, for there is no question of the Commission concealing something that might be a panacea. Developments at the last ECOFIN Council really caught my attention since it appears that the ministers of finance and the economy were bent on cutting the President of the Commission down to size in public. I have read the press from several countries, and the respective minister in each country is always right. This is not the problem. The problem is how we are going to get out of the current situation. I believe it is important that the ministers for finance and economic affairs, who generally take rather secretive positions when they fear that their budgets might be cut, should also make a positive contribution towards providing answers, for I do not believe that the Commission is the only body respon sible for moving things along in this situation. For this reason, Mr President-in-Office, I noticed that you mentioned the time when you were the minister for economic affairs for your country. In the European Council, which has no agenda, it is very important that our leaders realize that we need positive answers. I agree that it might perhaps be debateable to return to neo- Keynesian recipes, but this is what President Clinton is doing with his programme, which aims to revamp infra structures and introduce a national health system, as well as featuring a considerable amount of belligerence as far as trade is concerned. With regard to the conclusion of the current round of GATT, I would very much like to know what we are going to do with Law 301 and Super 301 which puts us in the stocks one day, only to take us out the next. I believe that we must conclude the current round of GATT, but with the prospect of a World Trade Organiza tion, otherwise I do not believe that manna will fall from heaven. As regards the economic recovery plan, I believe that it makes a great deal of sense to go ahead with a multian- nual plan for convergence - an area in which a number of things are lacking: trans-European networks, environ mental programmes, the renovation of infrastructures, public works and urban rehabilitation. There is no doubt that this poses a problem for the capital markets, though there can also be no doubt that there is currently too much saving compared with demand. Moreover, we must bear in mind that this too will allow us to face up to the rising growth in the unemployment we are currently experienc ing, namely unemployment for unskilled workers. For this reason, I urge the President-in-Office to ensure that the call for training is not just an appeal made in principle and using rhetoric. I agree that a trained society is the best investment. However, it is plain to see, for instance, what the Council is doing with many of the relevant plans put forward by the Commission, which are encountering serious difficulties. In this connection I believe that an entire range of measures should be put forward which cover not only flexibilization - which I believe must be achieved - but also sacrifices, while also offering positive elements at the same time. I trust the President will allow me a brief reflection on the common foreign and security policy vis-a-vis the former Yugoslavia. This is a common action which, in my opinion, should give wholehearted support - as well as pay tribute - to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. Moreover, I believe that there is an impor tant element in the Council: you all went to Geneva, where you said that there must be more combativeness in order to ensure that people are respected. Faced with these so-called 'warlords', who are faction leaders and bandits, I believe it is important that the European Union bring all its weight to bear on preventing mass genocide and something absolutely repulsive, namely holding the civilian population to ransom. Here, I believe we must support the Council and demand that it do more. As for Russia, the President-in-Office of the Council is well aware that I complained on behalf of Parliament about the first attempt at common action in this regard. Naturally, we do not think that democracy is going to spring up in Russia overnight, but we cannot accept the attitude of a gentleman who has appointed himself headmaster and is hitting everyone with a ruler. Pressure must be exerted on President Yeltsin to refine his man ners and democratic habits. Otherwise, if the truth be told, it will be hard to remain a mere onlooker. Lastly, Mr President, I would like to talk about the extremely important issue of enlargement. In this connec tion, I must say that the only Community institution prepared for enlargement is Parliament, which can accommodate new Members here in this Chamber. I have repeatedly gone over the timetable mentioned by the President the other day and I think that a miracle will have to take place if the Council is to be enlarged by 1 January 1995, as we would all hope. IN THE CHAIR: MR BARZANTI Vice-President ANASTASSOPOULOS (PPE). - (GR) At one point in his long, albeit essential and very interesting speech, the President-in-Office of the Council emphasized that the time has come to take some important decisions. I believe that if there were a possibility that guarantees could actually be enforced, then that would be the best topic to pursue in today's sitting. If the only outcome of all this was President Tindeman's initiative to once again table the major problems that the European Council is going to tackle at its summit on 10 and 11 December, then we would have every reason to be satisfied. However, Mr President -judging from what was pointed out by the Members and from the extremely attentive answers given by Mr Claes - and I understand his delicate position and am not among those who would ",
        "1.12.93 Debates of the European Parliament No 3-439/23 ANASTASSOPOULOS criticize the Belgian Presidency for its efforts regarding the language it uses - I fear that we are just as concerned as we were when we first entered the Chamber. Further more, I do not agree at all with the efforts made by the Belgian Presidency because, as I said earlier, this is neither the time for a report, nor the time for us to lavish praise. Nevertheless, many of the groups in this House feel that the Presidency is doing very valuable work, just as we often feel that the presidencies of small countries possibly turn out to be the best in the Community. Here I could mention the Luxembourg presidency, the smallest country in the Community. I could mention the Irish presidency and the Portuguese presidency. And of course the Belgian presidency is part of the same tradition. This belies the forces that argue that perhaps we could handle our problems more efficiently if we took the presidency out of the hands of the small countries. This is not the problem. Let us be a bit more serious. We most definitely need to hunt for solutions to structural problems so that the European Union can become more efficient. How ever, this discussion must not serve as an opportunity to upset balances and create new problems - to the detri ment of the smaller countries - that poison the spirit which should prevail throughout our Community. I shall now touch on the major problems. There is nothing new - as the President-in-Office pointed out - in the fact that many of the things mentioned this evening do not claim to be original. The current President of the Greek Republic, Konstantinos Karamanlis, who in my opinion is a great politician, has repeatedly asserted that many truths are truisms. But just because they are truisms does not mean they stop being true. Europe has been in crisis for some time now. Not just a crisis of unemployment - which is its worst manifesta tion - nor just a crisis of depression, but rather a general crisis which is affecting everyone - a moral crisis, a political crisis, a structural crisis. We do not yet have an answer to this crisis. The President-in-Office also said - and I agree with him - that there are no miracle cures. That is very true. We have a habit of being weak when it comes to finding solutions to the problems of the age we are living in. Let us admit it: So far we have not come up with any new ideas, and there are no miracle cures. I wonder, however, whether we are entitled - at such a time of weakness - to let ourselves slide into lethargy? I believe that this is the basis of the comments made by President Tindemans and all the rest of us. The Council must be daring - even if it does not have the approach that will provide solutions - because the problems are such that we cannot put off tackling them. So let us be daring, Mr President. I have no doubt about your intentions, or the intentions of the Presidency. However, I do have my doubts about whether there is currently the political will in Europe as a whole to seek out daring solutions that might enable us to find a new ray of hope and line up at a new starting line. BOISSIERE (V). - (FR) Mr President, we have long been used to seeing the Council of Ministers - just like the European Council of heads of state and government - shun its responsibilities. The Belgian Presidency is no exception to this rule. I can recall that two part-sessions ago it made a statement on the implementation of the Treaty of Maastricht. However, at the end of a debate in which 15 Members spoke - at times to ask specific questions - the Council left the Chamber without deign ing to answer our questions. I now believe that the Council was not really prepared to make a statement to begin the debate on the preparation for the European summit to be held in a few days' time. Thanks to our Rules of Procedure, fortunately we have the means to obtain certain information and certain positions from the Council. It would be nice if one day we could have answers to our questions and a statement before the debate. As regards the European summits, if we take a look at a few examples from the past, then what remains of their conclusions once the few decisions - which concern non-events, and which are sometimes made to save face - have been removed? In this connection, I would like to talk about, say, bogus issues concerning the siting of institutions. These are issues on which the summits have only succeeded in definitively maintaining a status quo, or have distributed agencies by siting them in one country or another. Are these genuine political decisions of the kind expected by citizens today? Is it enough to change names and now call it the Council of the European Union? Are these the kinds of decision that we can expect from the next summit? I do not think so. All these examples show that the Council is moving doggedly towards its objectives, and that it often uses the positive thinking method. It displays this attitude of pursuit in the economic and monetary sectors in particu lar. This is no coincidence. On the other hand, as far as democracy, political union and social affairs are con cerned, it tends rather to shirk its responsibilities. Here its approach is more to bury its head in the sand. We do not really know what items will remain on the agenda of the next summit if the sensitive issues are removed. In any case, many people appear to be saying that it will deal with the White Paper on growth, compe titiveness and employment. I will not talk about that because it is on the agenda for tomorrow. I will simply say that we see a number of contradictions in this. Growth is always emphasized, whereas it is quite clear that growth is increasingly synonymous with social exclu sion. This is not what I say, it is what President Delors says. It is not me who is saying that growth will not be enough to create jobs, it is the ECOFIN Council that is saying so. This doggedness is becoming evident in all areas, wheth er in an effort to apply the Treaty on European Union itself, or to move beyond it. To apply it, we doggedly pursue Economic and Monetary Union, the timetable and the convergence criteria. These criteria are still totally unsuitable, and perhaps we should concede this some day. We are evading responsibilities in the institutional area. Let me give just a few examples. The Council did not deign to tackle the question of the uniform electoral procedure, which, as the European Parliament wanted, should be proportional, so that it can be applied in 1994. Similarly, we are awaiting a decision concerning the right to vote and right to stand for the forthcoming elections. With regard to the Committee of the Regions, we have made it quite clear that this Committee should contribute, of course, to subsidiarity, but that it should be composed of elected representatives. We already know - since certain delegations have told us - that a number of countries have sometimes appointed officials, and that they are therefore not obliged to follow the line defended by the European Parliament. In this matter, the European ",
        "No 3-439/24 Debates of the European Parliament 1.12.93 BOISSIERE Council has a responsibility that must be fulfilled most vigorously. As for the question of the common foreign and security policy, the Council is proving its impotence, or else it is incapable of being involved in the current debate on the architecture of European security. Over the past few days, there has been a number of debates by the WEU and CSCE, and Parliament does not have a position. I would like us to have an opportunity to discuss this. Lastly, the Council is running away from its responsibil ities. In order to move beyond Maastricht, it must take responsibility for tackling the challenge of expansion. This is not an arithmetic change, but a question of moving down the constitutional and federal road. If the Council, with the Treaty of Maastricht, is not up to the task, then you may rest assured that we, the European Parliament, are prepared to move in the direction of co-decision-making in order to ensure that the necessary political decisions are finally implemented. LANE (RDE). - Mr President, I welcome the President- in-Office's statement. This afternoon we paid great attention to Prime Minister Rabin, especially when he outlined the progress in the Arab-Israeli dialogue. I hope that the December summit will give full support to the peace process initiated by the Irish Prime Minister, Albert Reynolds, in conjunction with his British counter part, Mr Major. The whole moral support of the European Union must be harnessed behind this initiative. The biggest problem facing the European Union just now is unemployment. We are now heading towards 20 million people out of work. Growth is stagnant and we are all aware that one requires an annual increase of 4% to 5% in GDP in order to create more jobs. We are not heading in that direction at the moment. We have the white paper on jobs. We have the green paper on initiatives in the social area. The Commission files and the Commission offices must be filled with papers. What we require now is action, not words, not more plans. We have the plans, we need action. I believe that the main source of employment in the future is going to be in small to medium industry. The United States and Japan have 70% of their workforce in small to medium industries. The European Community has 60% or slightly less. We have to concentrate on that particular area if we want to create jobs. On the question of social policy, we have to make better policy towards the deprived and the handicapped within the Community. We seem to ignore these two sectors at the moment. We have a HORIZON programme, which is only nibbling at the problems in this area. So we need action, not words, not green papers and not white papers. We need that action immediately. Other wise we will have a revolution within the European Community, if we allow our unemployment to reach 20 or 30 million in the years ahead. Ib CHRISTENSEN (ARC). - (DA) Mr President, unem ployment is twice as high in the European Union as in the USA and four times as high as in Japan. Moreover, most other OECD countries have a far better employment situation than the Union. Unfortunately, according to what the Commission and Member States have come up with so far, there is no prospect of any improvement for the time being. Quite the contrary, we must say. It is becoming crystal clear that the monetary policy settled in the Treaty on European Union will remain a higher priority than employment. This much is obvious not least from the Commission's presentation. I under stand from what the President-in-Office of the Council said that a common currency with common unemploy ment, strict regulation of the Member States' economic policies based on Article 103 are also important and decisive elements - along with intervention, as indicated in the Commission White Paper or its preparatory stages, in matters which have hitherto been subject to agreement between the social partners, free matters of agreement between the social partners. In any case this is the situation in my country. Along with calls for wage restraint and top-down control over public expenditure and revenue, which - when all is said and done - could mean a threat to public welfare despite all the assurances that the intention is to preserve it. Currency speculation and dealing in property values, which are a source of inflation and unproductive invest ment, will remain unaffected although here in Parliament this much has also been hinted at - even by the Group of the Party of European Socialists. Instead, the main attention has been focused on public revenue, expendi ture and especially deficits and wages, but not on this totally unproductive expenditure, which involves no work. Should an upswing occur abroad, then we may fear that progress will be capitalized, with fresh inflation as the source. This, combined with artificial, politically determined currency values, which give speculators excellent opportunities, to the detriment of the serious business sector, will mean that in this way neither interest rates, which are a thorn in the side of the economy and employment, nor the tax on labour - these two decisive elements - can be laid down to the benefit of employ ment. In other words, speculation will continue to be more profitable than production. And this is the sticking point. Others have looked for ideas. Here are perhaps a few thoughts that should be developed further, for current policy is not leading us anywhere. We have now had an uninterrupted rise in unemployment for nearly 20 years in the Community. The greatest problem of all is that the Union's ponderous machinery and top-down control, which will become much worse under the terms of the Union, are preventing individual countries from making headway. These coun tries must be given the incitement and opportunity to do so, and also to implement an economic policy which is better suited to their basic situations, for as we can see, both such circumstances and standards vary considerably from country to country. These countries are being prevented from going ahead and showing us how to implement an economic policy which reconciles the intention towards employment with the intention towards economic stability. These two things now appear to be diametrically opposed, and supposedly we ought to implement a policy which reconciles these two elements. The possibility is lambasted and ruled out to the same extent as people are embarking on a continuation of the current policy. ",
        "1.12.93 Debates of the European Parliament No 3-439/25 MARTINEZ MARTINEZ (DR). - (FR) Mr President, it is 8.30 pm. We are talking about the European Council of Brussels, but mainly about unemployment. There are about 10 people here in this sitting to take an interest in the fate of 25 million real unemployed people, people who are dying of cold and hypothermia in the streets; 50 million European inhabitants suffering in misery; the collapse of social security; curtailed retirements; diminished sick ness benefits; and the planned elimination of elderly and ill people - just look at Dutch legislation - under the pretext of avoiding the prolongation of life by medical means. Yet we still have enough strength to support the illnesses of others! The dramatic thing about this situation - to which everyone is indifferent, especially here where there is nobody to take an interest in this issue - is that the causes of unemployment are known, as are the solutions. There is no unemployment in South East Asia; there is not unemployment in Japan; there is no unemployment in the United States. If there is unemployment in Europe, it is because there are factors here that do not exist there. We know what these factors are: over-taxation and free trade. Just yesterday, President Walesa explained to us that as soon as the Polish borders were opened, one million jobs were lost in Poland. We are aware of the inadequate duration of working hours - 1,600 hours in France, compared with 2,000 hours in Japan, the inadequate training and ideological monetarism. Since the causes are known, unless unemployment is supernatural the solutions are self-evident: a tax reform which will transfer social security contributions to VAT, and which will stop making it advantageous to tax capital; tackling the problem of demographic movements - and therefore immigration - and daring to look it in the face; creating wealth rather than sharing misery with all this nonsense of reducing working time. There are 21 million jobs in France. If everyone worked zero hours, then of course that would make an extra 21 million jobs! But that is idiotic! We advocate free trade, of course. But nobody has asked what happened to the 12 million rural workers who have disappeared in Europe. As with the people in the favelas of Brazil, they figure among the population of unemployed and, of course, illiterate peo ple. However, it is true that illiteracy has its advantages: it keeps people from reading European Community resolu tions. It keeps people from reading the Treaty of Maas tricht. And it keeps people from condemning the Euro pean Community, which is the fundamental cause of poverty on this continent. EPHREMIDIS (CG). - (GR) We are holding an extraor dinary sitting of Parliament ten days before the Council Summit, supposedly so that we can give an opinion on all the things that will be debated and, probably, decided on there. I feel justified in saying that this debate is not only strange, but also ridiculous, because we are being called upon to give an opinion on something with which we are not familiar. We do not even have any proposals or guidelines for decisions that would enable us, as serious people, to fulfil our duties. However, Mr President, the actual debate and the way it has been organized is neither strange nor ridiculous. It is a copycat debate, one that will be referred to by the Council and the Council officials, who will be able to say that because of everything Parliament decided, they them selves did not decide any faits accomplis, but that some form of discussion with the European Parliament did take place. Mr President, the same thing is also happening within the national governments, which are refusing to discuss matters with their parliaments and get their opinions before they take matters to the Council. Such opinions would serve as a kind of authorization for what they would support in the Council. Now of course, the main problem is unemployment and the economic crisis. But what do we hear? We hear repetitions of all the things we have heard in similar speeches in the past: the lowering of workers' wages, the reduction of working time, the introduction of flexible working time, and the reduction of social benefits. But, Mr President-in-Office, we have heard that over and over again, and now you are saying it too. Yet you yourself have admitted that these models are bankrupt. So why are you repeating them? Why do you not have the courage and guts, as one of our Greek colleagues said, to forge a different path and introduce a 35-hour working week, i.e. a 7-hour day, in order to safeguard the vested interests of the workers as regards industrial relations, wages and social security, thereby giving them the emotional and physical strength to be productive - and making the Community economically competitive - and serve as good, well-paid consumers? This would provide the Community's economy with a firm foundation so that it can compete with the outside world. I would also like to talk about politics, Mr President. On the eve of the elections in Russia, President Yeltsin is being called upon to sign an agreement to be approved both here and there. Does that not constitute an interven tion in the elections of that country? In doing so, is the European Parliament not rewarding the man who dis solved his country's national parliament by force? And why, Mr President, did you not say a single word about solidarity? Why, on the eve of Greece's assumption of the Presidency, are the Community countries rushing to recognize the Republic of Skopje? It would not have been the end of the world if this process... (The President cut off the speaker) PUERTA (NI). - (ES) The President-in-Office of the Council will have noticed that all Members of the House - on whatever side - share the same concern for the economic recession and its social impact, the most dramatic indicator of which is an unemployment rate of 11%, or more than 17 million unemployed people. In my opinion, in this time of crisis - which is not just a European crisis, but a worldwide crisis with a European aspect - the forthcoming European Council will assume even greater importance. So far, the economic policies applied in the Member States have produced scant results and have led to anxiety and protests within society. Examples of this can be seen in the recent events in Belgium and the forthcoming general strike in Spain, which is a social protest full of anxiety and yet so lacking in hope. The Community's proposals do not help raise hopes because, besides laying out broad objectives and demon strating good intentions, they placed the emphasis on wage restraint measures, labour deregulation and the ",
        "No 3-439/26 Debates of the European Parliament 1.12.93 PUERTA alteration of what we euphemistically call 'rigidities in the labour market'. Because of all this, we in the European Unitary Left would like to encourage the Council to promote policies which preserve the European social model and, which at the same time, are capable of creating 15 million jobs by the year 2000. We feel that the primary objective is undoubtedly the creation of jobs through non-inflationary annual growth of 3%. To do this, we must implement a socio-economic policy which is not bound by the rigidity of monetarist indicators of nominal convergence but which unites productivity and social protection, while abandoning the obsession with blaming the situation on workers' social costs. Values will have to be considered that you share: the stimulation and modernization of public services and a fiscal policy which channels capital towards invest ments that create jobs, rather than merely towards specu lation. I would also like to say that in order to fight 'Euro- scepticism' we will have to give some thought to enlarg ing the Community, while at the same time reconciling democracy with efficiency and preserving the Commun ity's patrimony as well as our sensitivity to the political importance of the smallest countries. Lastly, I would like to express my great concern about opinion polls carried out in Sweden and Norway which do not bode well for accession to the European Union. If this trend in public opinion persists, we will see negative outcomes in referenda. Such results could also determine whether or not Finland joins and would definitely be a serious blow to the credibility of the European Union. We are asking the Council to give some thought to this problem, which runs directly counter to the creation of supranational democratic institutions within the frame work of the future European constitution to which this Parliament is committed. PAPOUTSIS (PSE). - (GR) Mr President, the major economic crisis and the ever growing number of unem ployed people indeed present a serious danger to the cohesion of our society and the stability of the democratic system. The forces which served liberalism in recent years promised us that the full liberalization of the market would create new jobs. Was that a lie or deceit? Whatever the answer, the result was - and still is - a fiasco and the economic crisis, rising taxes, the reduction of workers' wages in real terms, unemployment and poverty. It is becoming clear - now more than ever - that there is a need for realistic and dynamic decision-making on devel opment, together with the creation of new jobs, and technological and scientific progress. Only in this way, I believe, can we increase the competitiveness of the European economy, while at the same time maintaining the cohesion of our society. If we aim to achieve competitiveness - and competitiveness alone - by any means, then I fear somewhat that in coming years the European Union will experience major tension and social conflict, while the number of unemployed people will grow and large sections of the population will be socially marginalized. We must speak out now to the citizens of Europe and guarantee new jobs, along with specialized work, voca tional training for workers as well as social security and economic recovery. We must fight speculation, restore the economies of the Member States by reducing public deficits and inflation, successfully coordinate economic policies among the Member States, and undertake a radical transformation of the tax system. Why not pro mote the coordination of fiscal policies in the Community even more? This is exactly what we expect from the guidelines on development, employment and competi tiveness, which will be approved by the European Coun cil next week. Some people, of course, are focusing their interest on the proposal to reduce working time to four days a week and 32 hours a week. I do not know in which Member States such a policy can be generally applied. Naturally, I am not saying that those who adopt this policy - as was the case at Volkswagen, are irresponsible. In my country, however, such a proposal could not be accepted, because it would result in the reduction of workers' incomes in real terms, and because in actual fact it represents an effort aimed at redistributing poverty. In Greece, such a policy would have resulted in a strong social reaction, without anyone knowing what the final consequences would be. However, Mr President, there is a clear need for the European Council's new guidelines to contain provisions for the reorganization of the labour market in accordance with the needs of our time. Whatever happens, the new model for European society must be discussed and decided on by the social partners within the framework of a long-term European agreement. The trade unions will have to have the first word in this respect. With these thoughts, Mr President, please allow me to wish Mr Claes and the Presidency of the Council good luck in the Council's work next week for the good of Europe and the benefit of our people. JARZEMBOWSKI (PPE). - (DE) Mr President, Mem bers of the House, I hope I do not confuse the President- in-Office of the Council further. I would like to say something about the fourth question to the Council, concerning policy on justice and the interior. Unfortu nately, he - being the President-in-Office of the Council - must take a stance on this question. Unfortunately, in my opinion, the inaugural meeting of the Council of justice and interior ministers, newly created under the terms of the Maastricht Treaty, has not become a miles tone in the new cooperation between the three pillars of the Union, but rather a stumbling block. How did I reach such a conclusion? I only know the results of the Council meeting from the press, for the information transmitted to me by the Council was in French. However, I refuse to read information in Parliament which is not written in my language. I expect the Council to use all the languages used in Parliament when it wishes to inform Members of the House. As far as I could ascertain from the press, the proposals made by the interior and justice ministers in the European Council were more than scant, for - first of all - they are really nothing more than the extension of the working list of the old TREVI Ministerial Conference. For example it is stated that there are plans to continue the work on a convention concerning the violation of our external borders. This convention has been lying around in the Council for the past two years. Furthermore, the persis- ",
        "1.12.93 Debates of the European Parliament No 3-439/27 JARZEMBOWSKI tently laborious work concerning the definition of the term 'refugee' - either within the context of the problems associated with the right to asylum or with respect to a special status - are also to be continued. For all that, I will concede that the ministers did agree to go over to the operative establishment of anti-drug units. However, even in doing that they did not manage to reach agree ment even about the final head of the Europol drug unit. Worse still Mr President-in-Office, for today it is you who is acting as the President-in-Office on our behalf, the conference of justice and interior ministers even took some backward steps compared with what had already been achieved without the Maastricht Treaty. All of a sudden one Member State has reservations about the previous work done on the right of asylum. Yes, one Member State even has a reservation regarding the text and spirit of the Maastricht Treaty, with the state in question making known its reservations concerning the organization of the European Police Office EUROPOL as agreed under the terms of Article K. 1. No 9 of the Maastricht Treaty. Finally, the European Parliament cannot accept at all the fact that the Council of justice and interior ministers failed to take up Parliament's long standing demands for effective participation in cooper ation within this area. For these reasons, I hope that you will tell the European Council that this House insists on two things: firstly, the European Council must ensure that an action programme with clear objectives and contents on cooperation within the European Union in the areas of justice and interior policy is proposed for the year 1994. Secondly, and to my mind more importantly, the European Council must ensure that before the adoption of the action programme, the European Parliament is quickly and comprehensively informed - in all languages used in Parliament -about the Council's plans - as provided for in Article K.6. of the Treaty on European Union, and that Parliament's opinion is taken into account before the Council makes its decision. RIBEIRO (CG). - (PT) Mr President, the expectations surrounding the European Council meetings would seem to be of particular relevance here. Following a year dominated by the topic of Maastricht in which the main aim of the summits held was to find means of ensuring that what they approved was not rejected, even though in reality the people did not respect it - this is the first European Council to be held while the Treaty is in force. It comes at a time of full-scale economic crisis against the backdrop of a deteriorating social situation and a compelling environment marked by a lack of confidence, not to mention total discredit. With respect to the economic crisis, the Council is going to decide on a Commission recommendation which starts off badly and ends up even worse. It starts off badly because, in the first paper it was frankly monetarist, insistently in favour of nominal convergence, not aimed at the key issue of economic recovery and intrinsically linked to job creation. It ended up even worse because, after being revised and passed on for a recommendation, the paper was even more monetarist and more in favour of nominal convergence, but included less about recove ry and job creation. As regards the deteriorating social situation, with 12% unemployment and with farmers, workers, public sector employees and students in the streets, the Council is going to have to make a decision on the basis of macroeconomic options in the White Paper and the Green Paper. Now, the White Paper is the one on the competi tiveness of the microeconomy based on the costs of the labour factor, with strict wage restraints, more precarious employment and a lack of social protection - however much one tries to sweeten the medicine. It even goes so far as to prevent Parliament from being able to take a decision on it. The other one, namely the Green Paper, is dedicated to the social aspect, in so far as it is not overwhelmed by competition. Its transformation into a White Paper will have to be postponed until the middle of next year, by which time a 'Black Paper' might be justified. So, within this framework - one that fails to mention GATT, which some people claim is what everything depends on - what can we expect from the next Council? A contribution to the restoration of confidence and credibility in this Community. Greater efforts at proper and appropriate information, no matter how difficult this will be. Social reality will impose itself and the thick skins of the so-called 'Euro-sceptics', or even worse, of those accused of being 'anti-European' will not be enough to justify being so far removed from reality. H\u00c4NSCH (PSE). - (DE) Mr President, Members of the House, nobody envies the Belgian Presidency or you personally, Mr President-in-Office, the task facing you. After the two-year paralysis caused by institutional debates and the ratification of the Maastricht Treaty, the peoples of Europe are now expecting the new institution al framework to be used for a policy which benefits the people in our Member States - the unemployed, the young people, and women who see their future threa tened and believe it has been lost. In so doing, not only are they expecting actions, but also orientation. I am aware, Mr President-in-Office, that the requirement of unanimity is an obstacle. However, as a Member of Parliament, let me say that the heads of government and the governments themselves would not be facing the difficulty which you so rightly mentioned if they had listened to Parliament. I will not bother you by making a list of demands. It is not for me to censure my fellow Members of the House, but I do consider some of the wishes and demands that have been transmitted to the Council to be considerably exaggerated. For the main thing is not that we present a whole list on 9 and 10 December, but that the European Council limits itself to the major task of fighting unem ployment in Europe and in the European Union. A signal must be sent out there that consists not only of action, but also offers some kind of orientation. We are aware that no miracles can be expected, as you pointed out. Nor must - or indeed may - we put all our eggs in one basket. Rather, we must search for flexible solutions - depending on the circumstances in our Member States. Let me now ask you three questions, which also have to do with orientation. What are you doing to lure private capital out of financial investments and into productive investments? It is not only both an economic and a social scandal that, compared with the gross national product, private investments exceed the productive capital invested in manufacturing, but it is also an expression of old-fashioned attitudes that have seized hold of Euro- ",
        "No 3-439/28 Debates of the European Parliament 1.12.93 H\u00c4NSCH peans in their economies and will continue to paralyze our competitiveness on the world market. It is not just a matter of taxing interest, but also of the fact that we are ready in general to indulge in fresh activity in Europe and our economic system. Secondly, what are you doing to create a European infrastructure that creates and safeguards the veins along which the life-blood of our economy will flow tomor row? Thirdly, what is happening with regard to labour costs, which are too high in our Member States? How can they be reduced, and at the same time how can taxes on the consumption of natural resources be raised, thereby creating a balance between the intensification of desired economic growth and the safeguarding of the natural resources of our planet and of Europe as a whole? Mr President-in-Office, as I have already said, both you and the European Council are facing a difficult task, which includes both the efforts to secure peace in Jugoslavia and enlargement. However, indirectly you are blaming unanimity, while at the same time demanding merely the linear continuation of current circumstances in the context of enlargement. Would it not be expedient to show rather more courage and say: We actually need an institutional reform - in the context of enlargement, which maintains the European Community's ability to act. I do not want to practise cheap polemics, but I would like to warn the Council: more than a coherent closing statement depends on the result of this European Council. If the European Council does not send out a clear signal, then the approval of Europe by our peoples will hang in the balance. So take our good intentions, our urging and support along with you, so that you and your colleagues have the imagination, strength and courage to head towards brighter horizons. CHANTERIE (PPE). - (NL) Mr President-in-Office, you have already taken up a number of elements of the debate in your speech, but I would like to stick with the problems associated with jobs and unemployment. The figure of 17 million has been mentioned, 17 million EEC citizens, or 10% of the active population who are out of work. The situation during the last decade never gave rise to such great concern. According to some predictions, the Com munity will be home to some 20 million unemployed next year. So we could say that are facing a fundamental crisis as far as employment is concerned. The size of the active population in Europe has risen sharply in recent years, and it will continue to grow by about 1.5% per annum. Annual economic growth of 2.5% is required merely to keep these new additions to the workforce in work. We know that this will not be achieved next year or the year after. However, even more is needed to bring unemploy ment down - the figures being mentioned are between 3 and 3.5%. The figures for the last few years illustrate this. In the late 1980s, 9 million new jobs were created within the Community, but after five years of economic growth, although the level of unemployment in 1990 had dropped to 8.5%, we still had 12 million unemployed - and that was after five years of economic growth between 1985 and 1990. In other words, economic growth is absolutely necessary, but is not sufficient to solve the crisis regard ing employment. That is the situation facing us - and facing you, the members of the European Council, next week. What response will the European Union find to this socio-economic crisis? That is the question on the minds of all our citizens. In fact, I am rather concerned about the reports from the last ECOFIN Council where the objectives formulated in the White Paper were watered down or called into question, which could lead us to think that perhaps we are on the wrong track, i.e. favouring the road of economic and monetary progress at the expense of the social aspect. I am referring to the Commission White Paper on the creation of the internal market, dating from 1985, the White Paper well drawn up by Lord Cockfield, with nearly 300 new European laws aimed at promoting freedom of movement. In 1986, Parliament highlighted the social dimension of the internal market, and it took four years before that element found its way onto the table, namely in December 1989, when the European Commission submitted the elements to do with the social dimension, four years after Lord Cockfield's White Paper. I fear - as, I believe, do many others - that we will be faced with the same task here, i.e. that a White Paper has been produced focusing on economic measures, but that the social aspects have been neglected, and that we will see the phenomenon of social dumping, which to a certain extent is already a feature of the workings of the European Community, become even more widespread. Mr President, you pointed out that there must be a link between the short and long term, and that is precisely what makes me uneasy when I see the texts covering the short-term and the general objectives according to Article 103 of the Treaty. These texts make no mention of social objectives, but merely treat economic objectives. We will only be able to have faith in the White Paper and also congratulate the European Council if the White Paper ends up highlighting the social aspects - and hence the whole range of problems associated with employment and with being creative in the search for new standards - in addition to the economic aspects. Minister, we wish you every success in rounding off the Belgian Presidency. The whole image of the Belgian Presidency will, I think, be very closely determined by the formulation of a coherent plan next week at the European Council. We wish you all the best in this endeavour. METTEN (PSE). - (NL) Mr President, the Community is faced with explosively rising unemployment, and the White Paper - the economic section of which has already been published - must show us how to put an end to it. The aim of the White Paper, to create 15 million new jobs, thereby halving today's level of unemployment by the end of the century, is an excellent one, and whatever it does the Commission must stick by this objective, regardless of the criticisms of the ECOFIN Council and maybe also the European Council. But it will not be an easy objective to achieve, for it requires a 2% annual growth in jobs right up to the year 2000. However, since per capita productivity is increasing by 2% each year, if growth stops, then the number of jobs will even decrease quite considerably. At the same time, the offer on the job market is rising by 0.5% each year, which means that 0.5% more jobs are already required to make up for the increase in the number of people seeking work. Conse quently, a further increase of 2% is required to compen sate for the increase in productivity. So even if gross growth of 2.5% in the number of jobs is achieved, the ",
        "1.12.93 Debates of the European Parliament No 3-439/29 METTEN actual number of unemployed will remain the same. In other words, what some people call jobless growth is nothing more than a kind of employment threshold to growth. Below the threshold less jobs are created than are destroyed, and only above the threshold is unemploy ment made to fall. The conclusion from all this is that anyone who wants or accepts growth of under 2.5% is prepared to put up with a further increase in unemployment. We go along with the Commission in saying that unemployment cannot be tolerated and that growth of at least 3% which ends up creating job opportunities is necessary. However, we agree with the Commission that it can be accepted, among other things, that growth just above 2.5% contri butes towards reducing unemployment. Shifting social security charges, which are currently still primarily affecting wages, to other sources, such as eco-taxes, taxes on consumption or on capital returns, is a suggestion that should result in more work-intensive growth. However, other taxes - e.g. on currency transactions - could come into consideration. Nevertheless, it is crystal clear that growth is not only necessary for creating jobs, but also for achieving the objectives of Economic and Monetary Union. Unless there is sufficient growth we can certainly forget Economic and Monetary Union, and it is too easily forgotten that the countries which would suffer the worst damage as a result would be the countries with the strongest currencies, like the Netherlands and Germany. Last year alone, the guilder and deutschmark became more than 7.5% more expensive compared with the balanced average of their competing European curren cies. Only monetary stability - and ultimately a single currency - can put an end to that development, for which we have paid dearly in terms of jobs and employment. Moreover, this is reason enough for these countries to adopt a more pro-Community attitude and bring a com mon, growth-oriented approach within the bounds of possibility. Growth that ends up creating jobs will not come of its own accord or merely through the market. On paper we already have a growth initiative; now we just need one in reality. READ (PSE). - Mr President, in view of the lateness of the hour I will just make three or four short points to the President-in-Office. The first is to emphasize to him that we need a Europe that is not just a marketplace but a Community where people are at the heart of Europe and economic efficiency and social progress are two sides of the same coin, since sound economies are the basis of sound communities. Speaker after speaker has empha sized the scourge of the evil of unemployment in the Community and the urgent need for pro-active policies to come out of the summit meeting. The clear message must be that not only can Europe afford to work but it cannot afford the present mass unemployment. My second point is to say to the President-in-Office that the Socialist Group is aware that the agreement at Edinburgh for additional funds to generate jobs has still not been implemented. We felt very strongly that the agreement in itself was not enough. We now want to hear that the adequate funds allocated will actually be spent. The third point - and this very much refers, Mr President, to the White Paper - is that there is of course a need for a more flexible labour market but not if it means an erosion of safety or environmental or social standards. There are considerable advantages in positive flexibility in the labour market being negotiated by the social partners. The European Socialist Group is very happy that this is what the ETUC has called for and we are looking to the Commission, the Council and employers' organizations to respond to the lead taken by European trade unions. Another, important, point which I think has not been made by any other speaker is that the summit will have on the agenda the issues concerning the third pillar of the Treaty of Union. I should like to tell the President- in-Office today that this is one issue which fundamentally troubles European citizens. It may not be the case for Ministers, but citizens of the Union and MEPs are finding increasingly that whilst lip service is paid to a reduction in passport controls, in practice each airline passenger is subject to even more passport scrutiny, to three or even four checks on each outward journey. That is the exper ience of citizens of the Union and the summit needs to deal with this. Free movement is a fundamental right of every citizen and eligible resident. The importance of this issue cannot be overestimated because it touches upon one of the most volatile social issues in all our countries, namely racism. Black Europeans need to see that the highest authority in our Union, the Summit of Leaders, is working to ensure that their legitimate rights as Euro peans are protected and guaranteed. You know, I am sure, Mr President, that this Parliament has just completed its annual debate on racism and xenophobia and we will continue to campaign on this issue. So, on those matters - on unemployment, on pro-active measures, on freedom of movement - I very much hope that the Summit will be successful and I join with other colleagues here in this Parliament to wish the President-in-Office every success. SAKELLARIOU (PPE). - (DE) Mr President, President- in-Office of the Council, one area which has not received due attention here today is the common foreign and security policy. Foreign and security policy is preventive policy - reacting to facts is not policy. If we want to have an efficient foreign policy, then we must look ahead, plan ahead and steer ahead. Only by so doing can we create security and maintain peace. I would like to make three comments on these issues, which must surely also be on the minds of the European Council. The first question has already been raised by the chairman of the Committee on Foreign Affairs and Security. We have a common action for the elections in Russia. However, holding elections to their parliament is not sufficient. There is no way of achieving democratiza tion, normality or reconciliation if presidential elections are not held in 1994. In my opinion the European Council should press for this and urge the Russian president to schedule such elections. My second comment concerns the energy crisis in the Ukraine. Mr President-in-Office, let us not pretend that we cannot see the budding conflict between the Ukraine and Russia. Let us not pretend that we did not know why the Ukrainians want to retain their nuclear weapons. These nuclear weapons must be destroyed. Why not buy them off them? That is the decision we expect from the European Council on 10 and 11 December. Pay for their nuclear weapons by supplying them with energy! That would be a right, important and urgent decision which would be in both our interests and those of the Ukrain ians. ",
        "No 3-439/30 Debates of the European Parliament 1.12.93 SAKELLARIOU My last comment concerns the nations of eastern, central and southeastern Europe, which are not in a particularly enviable position as far as security policy is concerned. They are living on the edge of the crater of a volcano and can only hope that the volcano will not erupt. And what are we doing? We reject their request for protection and inclusion in our defence alliance by resorting to the argument that allowing them to join could cause the volcano to tremble and erupt. At the NATO summit on 10 and 11 January 1994 the European Union must close ranks and demand that these countries be allowed to join NATO immediately if they so desire. We have great respect for all the republics of the former Soviet Union, especially for Russia. We must give Russia every guaran tee and feeling of security that it needs. Not even Russia can be granted a right of veto regarding the composition of NATO. CLAES, President-in-Office of the Council - (NL/FR) Mr President, I shall limit myself to a short reply for those who are still here. I agree with Mr Hansch that now that the Maastricht has been ratified we must at last start implementing it, and that now, of all times, public opinion has a need for clear orientation and specific priorities, including the fight against unemployment. I would like to say to him that after ratification, the first thing that had to be done, of course, was to adopt a series of measures enabling the establishment of the instru ments permitting us to implement the treaty. In my opinion, that was the merit of the extraordinary Summit held in recent weeks, whereby as regards the first, second and third pillars, the inevitable measures - if I may put it like that - were taken, although I am very well aware that public opinion was not very much affected by all those measures, even if to my mind they do meet a need. Otherwise I can subscribe fully to your speech. There seems to be a need to stimulate a policy of investment by adopting specific measures vis-a-vis risk capital, which should be enticed more into the investment sector, and hence the employment sector. As I already said in my introduction, I share your opinion when you call for an enlightened reduction of labour costs. Let there be no doubt about that whatsoever. I would not want to let myself be led into an approach, Mr Boissiere, which is far too negative. Please allow me to say that, setting aside our convictions, we have nothing to gain by denying the merits of European integration. I do not see any reason to ridicule the decisions made con cerning the seats of our institutions. Europe deserves a more positive approach. This is the Europe, which - above all in the West - has brought stability and peace, which has been at the root of much of the social and economic progress made over the last few decades. We should ask ourselves this question: What would the situation in Europe have been today if it had not been for the European institutions? That is a much more positive approach, and one that people should adopt. I repeat, setting aside our convictions, especially during these difficult times, let us try to develop a more positive approach to Europe. We are all called upon to play our role. I will gladly admit that there are reasons to criticize certain gaps, certain weaknesses, the absence of certain things, but apart from that I believe that there are many arguments in favour of Europe. Let me now turn to our greatest enemy: unemployment. I agree with Mr Lane that we are creating far fewer jobs than the United States and Japan for the same-sized investment. The discrepancy is from 1 to 4 or even 1 to 7. But we must have the courage to examine the underlying reasons. I believe that in this respect we must accept certain flexible formulae, albeit without denying the value of our social model. I believe that this debate is inevitable. I would also like to say to Messrs Christensen and Ribeiro that I do not share their criticisms, which I think are exaggerated, of a purely monetarist policy on the part of the European Community. Some people seem to have forgotten already that last year the whole of Europe suffered from a series of devaluations, devalua tion being the most dishonest form of taxation that exists, because it is linear and immediately hits small savers. How can we possibly respond to these speculative movements of capital? What is the best way to defend purchasing power while maintaining a stable policy? Members of the House, the best way is to develop a monetary union which pools all our resources so that tomorrow we will be capable of holding our own against these speculative movements of capital. No country in Europe is capable of standing up all by itself to the large-scale speculative movements of capital which I condemn, but which are nevertheless a reality. Let us not confuse monetarist policy with the develop ment of a monetary union which is intended to defend purchasing power and, above all, the capital of small savers and people who earn their living by working. I believe that we must make a distinction between a policy aimed at strengthening our currencies and a purely monetarist policy. I share the view of Mr Chanterie who expressed his concern about the social element. Like Mr Metten, he pointed out that even real growth of 2.5% of GDP will not enable us to create any jobs. This is an entirely new state of affairs. Any university student 10 years ago who said that growth in real terms of 2.5% would not create any jobs, would - I fear - have been sent immediately to a second lesson. This is therefore a totally new fact, a structurally new fact, for which neither you nor I have a miracle solution. By the way, and this is no criticism, fortunately we live in a democracy; if I were to count up all the elements of solutions presented here today in this debate, then they would to some extent make a pretty contradiction. I say this merely to point out that it is not all that surprising that there are clashes of opinion within the Council regarding the question of how best to get to grips with the current structural crisis. Anyhow, as far as I am concerned, and as far as the Presidency is concerned, I share the concern expressed by Mr Chanterie that the approach cannot be purely technical, but must also be inspired by a series of social concerns, whereby we must try to retain the essential characteristics of our social system, but always do so within the framework of an employment policy. So in that respect I would like to say that we should not now dismiss Europe again with a wave of the hand as if nothing had happened recently. May I also remind the House that five months ago the Structural Funds and the Cohesion Fund were approved. This means ECU 176 billion being earmarked over a six-year period for the development of the European Union, for a show of solidarity between the better and less-developed countries. Two Marshal plans in six years, and some claim that we have neglected all the instruments at our disposal to combat the crisis! Let me also say that such criticism is surely rather one-sided and exaggerated. I am not here to defend any ideal Europe, I ",
        "1.12.93 Debates of the European Parliament No 3-439/31 CLAES am giving my explanation as to why the European Council is facing difficult challenges; nor can I guarantee a highly satisfactory solution, but may I ask that we also take account of the constructive elements that have recently been put into place. I would also briefly like to say to Mr Jarzembowski that I shall look into how it is that the decisions made by the Council are not being sent out in the various languages. I understand and accept his criticism, and I shall presently inquire as to what exactly happened on 29 November. Anyway, the Council that has to develop the third pillar had been assigned to draw up a plan of action and a work programme. Several serious blockages have arisen in the Council in that context, for reasons that are rather familiar to the Belgian minister, but anyway I do not think that this should now give us cause to present all the major tasks assigned by the previous European Council - with regard to the development of Europol, the common visa policy, the development of a common immigration policy, and the fight against drugs and terrorism - to the European Council on 10 and 11 December in the form of a work programme. I hope - and I genuinely believe - that this Council will give the Council of Foreign and Interior Ministers precise guidelines to make short work of this very important third pillar, which genuinely responds to the serious concerns that are rife in public opinion today. In conclusion, a final word to the last speaker about the situation in the Ukraine. Let me say that the European Union is by no means refusing to cooperate with that country. On the contrary, we are saying explicitly that - just like with Russia - we are prepared to sit down tomorrow around a table and negotiate and sign a partnership agreement so as to develop cooperation in the various domains. However, there is one condition attached, which I do not feel to be exaggerated: the Ukraine, and hence also the Ukraine's parliament, is expected to accept the non-proliferation treaty and to implement the Salt I treaty. We can no longer tolerate there being countries favouring a policy of proliferation, and let me say this: it has little to do with internal security. I really do not believe that a country like the Ukraine needs ballistic nuclear equipment to defend itself against a theoretical danger emanating from Moscow. So I can confirm - and President Kravchuk knows this full well - that Europe is open to immediate negotiations, but on condition that guarantees regarding the non-prolifera tion of nuclear, chemical and other weapons are forth coming. So much, Mr President, for a few considerations in reply to the speeches given here. Regardless of whether or not we shared the same opinion, I would very much like to thank the various speakers for their speeches, and I can assure you that we will do our utmost to take Parliament's contributions into account during the decision-making process at the forthcoming European summit.

I am delighted that you have accepted our invitation. We issued this invitation on 16 September only a few days after the signing of the historic agreement between the Israeli Government and the representatives of the Palestinian people. You, Prime Minister, played a major part in bringing about this agreement. The European Parliament recognizes this peace agree ment as a major step forward. It seeks to pave the wave for a more comprehensive, lasting and peaceful solution to the Middle East problem. We expect and hope that this will prove successful. Over the last few weeks, however, it has been shown that there are still countless obstacles to overcome. The European Union and the European Parlia ment are prepared to play an active role in promoting economic stability and political security. I would ask you, Mr Prime Minister, to take the floor. (Loud applause) RABIN, Prime Minister of Israel. - Mr President of the European Parliament, Vice-Presidents, Members of the European Parliament, distinguished guests, I really feel a sense of history in speaking to those who represent countries and peoples that for more than a thousand years have spearheaded the progress of civilization and set an example to the whole world. In European societies technology has reached a high peak but, more important, those societies have produced a new way of life, a new form of society and government - I refer to the democrat ic way of life: rule by the people, of the people, for the people. I am a son - a proud son - of the Jewish people, a people that created the first monotheistic religion, a people that gave the world the Bible, its values, its faith and its tradition. I belong to the generation of Jews that has witnessed and participated in the two most dramatic developments in Jewish history in almost 2000 years since the destruction of the Second Temple. First, the most dramatic tragedy ever to have taken place in the history of the Jewish people - the Holocaust. Second, the greatest achievement of the Jewish people in the last 2000 years, the revival of Jewish life in the only place on earth that Jewish life, independent life can be developed: in the land of Israel, in the Holy Land. Strangely enough, these two major events in the long Jewish history: the Holocaust and the Redemption took place in the 1940s. So, I belong to the generation of Jewish people who understand the awesome responsibility that the long history of the Jewish people, which goes back 3000 years, entails. I am glad to belong to that generation of the Jewish people which at last has the unique and great opportunity to shape its future through its own history. The long Jewish history has bestowed upon our genera tion, the present people of Israel, the present leadership of Israel, a unique historic responsibility to create condi tions for the proud survival, the independent survival of the Jewish people. I was born in Jerusalem. I have lived almost all my life there and I am proud to be an Israeli. I thank God for giving me the unique opportunity to belong to these people and to a generation that can decide its own fate. May I now, bearing in mind what I have said, turn to the present realities. We live also in a unique historic period in the life of the world and in the life of the Middle East. What we have seen in the last few years is unprecedented since the end of the Second World War. We have seen the bankruptcy of Soviet communism, the collapse and disintegration of the Soviet empire, the end of the Cold War, the tumbling down of the Berlin Wall. We have seen a changing world that offers great opportunities to many peoples, to many countries. We no longer have the same world, the same kind of international relationships that existed up to the end of the 1990s. There is no doubt that in Europe the Iron Curtain does not exist any more and in the Middle East the Soviet umbrella that protected many extreme leaders of Arab countries who relied on that umbrella politically, militarily and economically is no longer there. This brought a change to the Middle East, to the relationship between the Middle East and the outside world. In the Middle East we have lived through another crisis - the crisis in the Gulf. If there was any war in the last few years in the Middle East, thank God no one could accuse Israel of being responsible for it! But the crisis in the Gulf, the capability of the international community led by the United States to withstand aggression between two Arab countries and to reverse the results of their aggres sion and to punish their aggressor no doubt sends another message to many countries in the Middle East and, I believe, beyond. The culmination of these two events created the new realities in the Middle East and in Israel. On the interna tional scene, and following the crisis in the Gulf, we have seen an effort to continue in the most dramatic way the efforts to put an end to the Arab-Israeli conflict. Allow me to say with all frankness, the historic breakthrough in the relationship between the Arab world and Israel took place when the very courageous leader of an Arab country, President Sadat of Egypt, decided to come to visit Israel. He spoke in Jerusalem from the podium of our Knesset, the Israeli Parliament, and called for peace. He convinced the people of Israel that here was a leader, an Arab leader, who wanted peace. He brought, by his ",
        "1.12.93 Debates of the European Parliament No 3-439/33 RABIN act, all the walls of suspicion, hatred and prejudice tumbling down. He convinced the people of Israel that here was a leader - a leader of the greatest Arab country, the country that led the Arab world through all the major wars that took place between them and us - and there was no obstacle on the road to achieve peace between Egypt and Israel. The people of Israel were ready to make painful concessions because they believed this leader, President Sadat, had taken a great risk by coming to Jerusalem. He convinced us that he wanted peace. The peace between Egypt and Israel was concluded and signed in March 1979. For many years no other Arab leader dared to follow in the footsteps of President Sadat. There was a gap of twelve years before another effort was made. The United States and Russia, with the assistance of the international community, brought about the Madrid Peace Conference with the participation of four Arab neighbours: Jordan, Syria, Lebanon and Egypt, representatives of the Palestinians and Israel. We tried hard, we made efforts, we met face to face and a letter of invitation to the Madrid Peace Conference that was accepted as the basis for the peace negotiations was formulated with the purpose of achieving peace treaties between Israel and its three neighbouring Arab countries with which we have not yet reached peace and to move in two stages to the solution of the 100-year conflict between the Palestinians and Israel. Unquestionably the peace negotiations had to be face to face on a bilateral basis. Why? Because peace cannot be imposed. Israel cannot impose peace on its Arab partners. The Arab partners cannot impose peace on Israel and, with all due respect, the super powers or the super power cannot impose peace either. Peace by imposition is a contradiction in terms. Peace can be made only when the parties to the conflict, as at present, decide to put an end to war, violence and terror between them and establish relations of peace. No one - and I emphasize this - can make peace in their place. This was the basic assumption of the co-sponsors of the Madrid Peace Conference and it is the responsibility of Israel and its Arab partners in the peace negotiations to find a way by themselves - they can be assisted by others but no one can replace them, can act in their stead. It is their responsibility and this is why the world had to point to the Israelis, to the Arab partners, and say 'You have to make peace. We can assist you. But we cannot act in your place'. Since becoming Prime Minister of the new government of Israel, I set out to achieve the major goal of peace and security for Israel after the six wars we had to fight, with not one day of rest between the wars or after them, right up to today, when on both sides people are still being wounded and killed. We are very sensitive about our security, and for good reason. I have pointed out to you our long Jewish history. We are proud that we have never asked any country to make a defence pact with us. We have never asked any foreign soldier to shed one drop of his blood for the defence of Israel in a context of regional conflict. We have never asked for any foreign forces on a permanent basis for the sake of the defence of Israel. It is our responsibility - we can manage. We do not want to drag others into regional wars. If the tendency towards regional conflict continues, other countries are liable to become, involved in wars. But this does not have to be so. Therefore for us, peace means security. I once said to the Israeli people that the Zionist movement decided to return to Zion to establish a Jewish state in the only place where a Jewish state could be built - in the land of Israel. We also decided who our neighbours would be - 100 to 120 million people of Arab countries. An additional 100 to 150 million Muslims. I wish that we had as partners some of your countries, some of your peoples. But in a case like this one cannot choose one's neighbours. I also said to the people of Israel that there are only two ways we can live with our neighbours. Either we try to bring about peace, which will give us security, or we live always under the threat of war, violence and terror. I myself prefer to take calculated risks for the sake of peace. I went on to say that I would prefer to have peace with countries that have a tradition of democracy, values of democracy. But unfortunately our neighbours are aggressive authoritarian and totalitarian regimes. If we have to wait until democracy is established and prevails there, we might have to wait another 100 years. Therefore, it is not up to us to judge the way of life among every neighbouring Arab country or people. We have to try to achieve peace with them as they are, though mindful of the risks, and retain a margin of safety for Israel's security. This is the way I think. There is no need to make peace with friends. Peace you make with enemies, sometimes very bitter enemies. These are the realities in the region. It is preferable to take calculated risks for peace and it was this that guided our policy. I knew that for the achievement of peace we had to make compromises. After pondering the Madrid preliminary negotiations, I came to the conclusion that the keys were either in Palestinian hands or in Syrian hands. Many people for many years used to say that the crux of the Arab-Israeli conflict lay in the conflict between the Palestinians and Israel. We decided to tackle the problem by making the basis for the Madrid Peace Conference the letter of invitation. I decided - and personally it caused me a lot of pain, to many Israelis it was and still is difficult to swallow - that I would not take part in a masquerade. That meant realising that the Palestinian delegation for all practical purposes represents the PLO. We took a deci sion for mutual recognition between Israel and the PLO. What made this possible for me and my conscience was the chairman of the PLO, Mr Arafat, giving in writing a full commitment, denouncing and rejecting violence and terror, expressing a readiness to discipline his people who continue terror and violence, and recognizing the right of Israel to exist as a Jewish independent state. He commit ted himself to solve further differences only by peaceful means and to look at the articles of the Palestinian Covenant that negate the very existence of Israel. These run counter to the agreement in the declaration of principles that we signed in Washington and were to become inoperable and invalid at a later stage when it was possible to call upon the Palestinian National Coun cil to do this legally. We signed the declaration of principle and we are trying to implement it. What we are committed to do is very complicated. For example, when we signed the agree ment with Egypt it was painful. But afterwards there was a clear line with on one side Egypt, on the other side Israel: a clean-cut division, a clean-cut distribution of responsibilities. The same will apply when we have ",
        "No 3-439/34 Debates of the European Parliament 1.12.93 RABIN peace with Jordan and Lebanon, with whom by the way we have almost no territorial problems. With Syria we have some territorial problems. But once there is a peace treaty there will be a line. The responsibilities will be clear-cut. What we are trying for in the interim with the declaration of principles is the establishment of interim self-government arrangements for the Palestinians, so as to create peaceful co-existence between two entirely different entities. They differ religiously, politically, you could even say nationally, but they are interwoven one with the other; each encounters the other daily in work and travel. The purpose, my purpose, is to let the Palestinians run their own lives. I do not want to run the life of Gaza, Khan Yunis or Dir Al Balah. Let them run it. At the same time, in accordance with what is written in the declaration of principles, the settlements are to remain. Israel will carry overall responsibility for the security of the Israelis in the settlements and when they travel. Israel will bear respon sibility for external security, still control outbreaks of terror, hopefully not more than that. This is the distribu tion of responsibilities. We are working hard to find a way in which we can work together to achieve these goals, knowing it is an interim agreement. It is not so simple. There is in the background a backlog of prejudice and suspicion. There is opposition to the agreement on the Palestinian side and the Israeli side. There is opposition on the Palestinian side to Mr Arafat's decision to the agreement that we signed, led mainly by extremist Islamic terrorist groups, that escalate terror against Israel with one purpose beyond killing Israelis: through this terror they hope to kill the agreement, the peace negotiations and the capability to implement the agreement. They know that by this terror they create antagonism among the Israelis against the agreement, because many of them come to me and say: 'Mr Prime Minister, you promised us peace. What we see now is a continuation of terror'. Some of the Palestinians can say the same. I have to respond to those who elected me, to those for whom I am Prime Minister. I am Prime Minister to all the people of Israel; those who supported me and those who did not. Therefore, we are living in a very sensitive period, a period in which both sides need strong nerves, to over come the obstacles, to focus on the completion of the negotiations. And let us not forget that six months were given, in the DOP, for the implementation of the first phase, the Gaza-Jericho phase, two months for the negotiations, four months for the implementation. I would not see any major crisis if we took time to reach an agreement that will clarify the road for an implementa tion that will leave no misunderstanding. A declaration of principles can be general, but the translation of these principles to the ground, their communication to the way of life, to the responsibilities of the Palestinian police, to the Israeli police and military units, to the settlements, to the civilians, has to be very clear. Otherwise friction will lead to a disaster. Today there were meetings in Paris of the Palestinian- Israeli economic committee to determine in a general way the relations between the two entities. We do not try to patronise or to impose. We would like to negotiate as partners to the same endeavour. We had in Cairo the subcommittee on security. We had in El Arish the subcommittee about transition of responsibilities from the civil administration to the Palestinians, even though all the heads of the 15 departments of the civil adminis tration are Palestinians. They can stay if they decide to keep them. It will bring about a smooth transition of power. We would like to see a continuation of the negotiations with the other Arab countries. I believe there is no major obstacle to a solution of the problems between Jordan and Israel, especially now that we have started with the Palestinians. There is no territorial problem between us and Lebanon. We all recognize the international bounda ry. The only question is security, to see a government in Lebanon that controls its own territories. I hope we will see better signs on the part of the leadership of Syria. I do not expect that anyone will repeat what President Sadat did, but we are a democracy. We have to convince the people that the other side, one of the partners, really wants peace. As we have to show it, we expect the other side to show it. I believe that we face great opportunities. We expect support for the peace process. We should forget resolu tions of the past, except the United Nations Security Council resolutions, look at the new realities, not bound by any other resolution, by any group of countries or individual countries, and support the present resolution. In conclusion, Israel expects Europe first and foremost to support the peace process, to understand that the main responsibility for the achievement of peace lies with the parties to the present conflict. The parties to the conflict must be the main partners in the peace-making process. Secondly, we welcome the readiness of Europe to sup port financially the Palestinians as part of the internation al effort in a positive, constructive way, through projects in housing, infrastructure, job creation and education. We always welcome assistance to the Palestinians in the territories. This should be given directly. Many European countries have already contributed here and there, but in the context of the peace process a major effort has to be made. Thirdly, we do not ask for any financial assistance from Europe for ourselves. We will get it from other sources. What we expect Europe to understand is that Israel is taking risks and the people of Israel expect to see that as a result of the peace efforts it will be possible for them to advance and strengthen our economy, to have a more progressive society, to provide refuge to Jews who are oppressed, who are persecuted, be it in the former Soviet Union, Syria or in Yemen. Their place, their home, is in Israel, the Jewish state. Half a million immigrants came from what used to be the Soviet Union over the last four years. This is an increase of over 10% vis-\u00e0-vis the total population, Jews and non-Jews, who are Israeli citizens. We absorbed them. We made a real national effort. 10% of our budget was allotted for their absorption in addition to the 9% to 10% of our GNP, which is budgeted for the defence of Israel. We would like to have the opportunity to be, not members, but associated with the European Community. I do not want to give figures, but there is no doubt that we are in the red in the trade balance between our two countries, and very much so. I hope after meeting with the leadership of France, Italy, Belgium, tomorrow Ger many and Britain, and the leadership of this Parliament, that on 6 or 7 December the Council will give a mandate for renegotiation of the 1975 agreement. We want your support for the peace process, your understanding, your ",

For hundreds if not thousands of years the majority of Jews lived in European countries. Israel, as the state of the Jewish people, looks at Europe as the cradle of democracy and Western civilisation. Israel looks at Europe with the hope of support and assistance to the peace process, and first and foremost for the parties in the Middle East that are engaged in real, meaningful peace making, and who are committed to peace. This is our hope, our expectation from you, the representatives of the European countries, the European peoples, who are Members of the European Community. (Loud and sustained applause) PRESIDENT. - I would like to thank you, Prime Minis ter, on behalf of the Parliament for your wide-ranging analysis of the present situation and the political objec tives of your country. We are convinced that with the historic Washington Agreement you have embarked on the path towards moderation and dialogue. The imple mentation of this Treaty should lead to a lasting peace between Israel and all its neighbours. The European Union is particularly concerned to support close cooper ation and strengthen relations with the Middle East. The European Parliament supports the aims of a common external and security policy of the European Union. It wishes priority to be given to developing common approaches in several areas. This includes, in particular, a comprehensive peace plan for the Middle East. Prime Minister, your visit has been a great honour for us. I declare the formal sitting closed.

Adjournment of the session 58 IN THE CHAIR: MR KLEPSCH President (The sitting was opened at 10 a.m.) (') to believe that yesterday's debate on the European Council did not need to be accompanied by a resolution put to the vote? (Applause) WIJSENBEEK (LDR). - (NL) Mr President, I would like to ask you the following question on the basis of Rule 37, alternatively Rule 19 of our Rules of Procedure. Yester day, in the debate with the President-in-Office of the Council, the President-in-Office of the Council stated first of all that the European Council indeed had no agenda and could consequently not put us in the picture in advance regarding what will appear on it at the European Council meeting. I think that our Committee on Institu tional Affairs should give its verdict on that because the European Council has now become an institution. How ever, the President-in-Office of the Council, Mr Willy Claes, also said, huh, I do not need to listen any longer to what Parliament has to tell me, because at the beginning of a European Council meeting your President always comes along to make a statement. Mr President, may I ask you what statement you are going to make there? Before you go there, how can we as Members of this House find this out? Moreover, on the basis of what Parliament resolution do you make this statement? For that reason, is there not a need for us to succeed here today in establishing the majorities and wishes of the House on the basis of resolutions? Is it therefore not also a mistake on the part of both the Group of the Party of European Socialists and the Group of the European People's Party (Christian-Democratic Group) 1 ) Approval of Minutes - Documents received - Observers for elections in the Russian Federation: see Minutes BRAUN-MOSER (PPE). - (DE) Mr President, yesterday we placed the report on South Africa on the agenda for today. At the same time, one report could not be treated yesterday evening due to a lack of time, namely the UNRWA report on refugees, which is currently much more urgent in view of the fact that aid to the refugees is supposed to start in January. On the other hand, I do not think it appropriate to set aside merely a quarter of an hour for the report on South Africa, for that is an extremely important debate. Consequently, I would like to move that the report on South Africa be postponed until the part-session in Strasbourg. METTEN (PSE). - (NL) Mr President, we all want the people of Europe to know about what we debate and decide here in Brussels. One precondition for this is that the journalists sitting down here can adequately follow what we are doing. However, both yesterday evening and this morning it was impossible for the journalists to hear what happened because their headsets did not work. Could you please ensure that this is put right again as soon as possible? Naturally, it is laughable when funda mental things of this kind are not in order. It does nothing for the workings of this House, and certainly not for the publicity of Parliament. PRESIDENT. - Thank you, Mr Metten. The Secretary- General will take care of that. ",
        "2.12.93 Debates of the European Parliament No 3-439/37 I. Growth competitiveness and employment PRESIDENT. - The next item is the Commission state ment followed by debate on growth, competitiveness and employment. DELORS, President of the Commission. - (FR) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Members of Parliament, the European Council will supposedly - at least, so the Commission hopes - devote a large proportion of its time to economic issues. However, it will do so in the course of two different exercises that must be kept quite distinct. Firstly, the white paper, which is to be dealt with now, aims to assess the strengths and weaknesses of the European economies in a gloomy and sometimes even dramatic economic climate. Secondly, the application of Article 103 will usher in the new Treaty with regard to Economic and Monetary Union. This will be dealt with later. I would simply like to say that under the terms of Article 103 the economic policies of the Member States become matters of common interest and that, for the first time, the Council of Ministers of Economic Affairs and Finance will vote by a qualified majority on common orientations which will, in the meantime, have been examined by the European Council. As far as the White Paper is concerned, the Commission will examine the draft intended for the European Council next Sunday. Therefore, for the time being, I can only give you a few pointers, which are the fruit of collective work, since a debate was held here in the European Parliament and we received contributions from each Member State that proved very useful. In addition, you will undoubtedly recall that we sent you an initial document, concentrating on economics, which was stu died by the Council of Ministers of Economic Affairs and Finance. I shall not return to the diagnosis given at the European Council meeting in Copenhagen on the basis of a report which I presented there. The heads of state and govern ment felt that the situation was serious enough to spend five hours debating it. I will not say anything about the diagnosis, except for these two points. On the one hand, the globalization of the world economy poses radically new problems. I know, Europe made a lot of progress economically under the impetus of Objective 1992. However, we must look reality in the face: the world has been quicker than us, and new competitors are emerging with advantages that must be taken into consideration. Moreover, we cannot deplore the fact that the developing countries are waking up, since the majority in this House has always been in favour of developing the South. The second element which in my view dominates the situation is that, at grass roots level, talking with workers and the heads of small and medium-sized enterprises, the situation is virtually catastrophic, with daily redundan cies and fears - perhaps excessive fears. Be that as it may, believe me, there is a great gap between those of us who are holed up in our offices and social reality as it exists in most of our countries. I believe that this information must be taken into consideration and I hope that the heads of state and government will consider this to be a warning sign for national policies, because the white paper does not claim that Europe can resolve all the current social and economic problems - it can help, but nothing more. I also hope that they will feel that the most important thing today is to create work and jobs. This is essential, first of all because our demographic situation is continuing to deteriorate, and because in 15 years the number of unemployed will be very large compared to the number of working people. I put the question to you: How will we finance our social security systems, not only the incomes of our pensioners, but also health expenditure and family allowances? Secondly, because there are needs that are not being met at present. We know what they are. Not only are there 40 million poor people in the Community, but we also know full well that with the upheavals in daily life in both towns and rural areas, there is a tremendous need for local community services. Therefore, to my mind, the essential question is this: Will we be able to create employment to combat unemploy ment and social exclusion, which is becoming a massive phenomenon, and also - and perhaps so far we have lacked imagination here - to provide more support for the development efforts of our neighbours in the South and East? In order to move in this direction, I repeat, we must create employment, because there are needs out there. I therefore support a need-driven economy, not one based on the distribution of poverty. The first question that arises is this: How do we attain growth? To some extent, this will be the purpose behind the implementation of Article 103. Frankly, I will only say a brief word about this. If the economic climate does not improve in Germa ny, which has the most powerful economy, then 1994 is likely to be a disappointing year. As for the European growth initiative, it will perhaps go down in the Com munity's short history as the first time that the Twelve decide to work together, but we must acknowledge that it is quite inadequate for reviving the European economy. Accordingly, we are working in three directions: towards a sound economy, towards greater competitiveness and towards more jobs. As far as the sound economy is concerned, most governments feel that dogged pursuit of our aims, which would increase budget deficits and open the taps of monetary circulation, might bring some immediate relief, but that we would then encounter great difficulties of adjustment and competitiveness so that, at the end of the day, we would have more unemployed people and no more growth in two or three years' time. Therefore, the White Paper will include the concept of sticking to the macroeconomic path, the one described in the working paper sent to you, which shows that, with the uncertainties hanging over 1994, we might find ourselves with a conventional growth rate as from 1995 that was sufficient to reduce unemployment. This is why, despite the reservations of certain ministers of finance, we are maintaining this objective: to create 15 million jobs by the end of the century. (Applause) It also goes without saying that one of the reasons for our current difficulties is that while up until 1990-1991 our economies were converging and the currencies were relatively stable, the whole situation exploded beginning in early 1991. At present, the prevailing factor is the divergence of economic trends. These are manifested in competitive devaluations within the Community itself, meaning that when a country manages to find a margin of growth through exports, it does so at the expense of the other Member States. This situation cannot be allowed to persist, because if it does - and it is to avoid this that the second phase of Economic and Monetary Union has been ",
        "No 3-439/38 Debates of the European Parliament 2.12.93 DELORS applied - it will lead to the breakdown of the common market and perhaps mean the end of European integra tion. This is why the objectives of Economic and Monet ary Union - whatever one may think of the criteria - present the immense advantage of allowing us to achieve the convergence of our economies, secure stable exchange rates and bring about a better understanding and greater cooperation among the Twelve. Turning the Community into an island of stable growth is important both to us and, I repeat, to our neighbours in the East and South. We need greater competitiveness, since it is clear that, despite the progress made between 1985 and 1990, we have lost some ground. We feel that the essential factor in competitiveness is not the cost of labour. The essential factor is primarily our capacity to master technical progress and to take ourselves towards the future in a time of major scientific and technological changes. This is why we will propose common actions at European level - I will submit them to the Commission and I think it will agree - allowing us to improve our competitive ness. What form will these actions take? On the one hand, they will be major infrastructure programmes allowing goods, services, information and people to move around more quickly and more cheaply. These programmes will be an asset in the context of town and country planning and, by extending these infrastructures beyond our fron tiers, they will facilitate the modernization of the econ omies of the countries of eastern Europe. This is why we also propose that the Community enter the new information society on an equal footing, for this society is going to cause upheavals in the organization of work and the organization of our societies. No individual country can go it alone. Considerable sums of money are involved. Just look at what is happening in the United States if you want to get an idea. We too must create information highways that will allow us to create this new information-based economy, and which will also allow us to create large numbers of jobs and meet needs, especially in the areas of training and health. Lastly, the Community's research policy must be made more flexible. Ladies and gentlemen, Members of the house, this is a personal opinion I am voicing here: There has been enough debate aimed at multiplying the areas of intervention of a policy that accounts for just 3% of Community research expenditure. We must be both capable and flexible enough to bring our efforts to a point where we can endow them with added value. This is the case, in particular, for information technologies and biotechnologies. (Applause) Finally, of course, there is the question of how best to manage the Single Market in order to make it more competitive. I think that a large proportion of our final report will be devoted - thanks mainly to Mr Flynn's contribution - to employment policies. Employment policies - the term is inadequate. It would be better to use the term 'employment systems', which also covers edu cation and training, the operation of the labour market and the way in which enterprises are managed. All of this represents an employment system. Yet, because of unem ployment, these employment systems are now out of synch with the economic policies being implemented. Employment policy is not a social welfare policy, it is an economic policy that enhances the 'employability' of workers, which strengthens qualifications and which makes it possible to improve competitiveness. However, naturally, with massive unemployment, we have all let ourselves be persuaded by a social treatment of unem ployment, forgetting that the essential thing is to respond to needs and to enable everyone - especially young people and the long-term unemployed, to regain hope and not be marginalized in society. This is why we will emphasize the need for access to continuing training throughout one's life, not only for those people who do not have jobs, but also for those who must adapt to new qualifications and new careers. This is why we will emphasize external flexibility, of course. The labour market must function better; workers must be more mobile. We will also emphasize internal flexibility. Enterprises must manage human capital with just as many priorities as technical capital. A different balance must be struck. We cannot tolerate an economy in which the variable of adjustment is the man or woman who is working. Enterprises simply must assume their responsi bilities in dealing with human capital. From this point of view - even if this example cannot be reproduced - what has happened at Volkswagen is very interesting. This enterprise had a choice. It could lay off 30,000 workers, meaning that the local authorities would take care of them using the contributions paid by the other workers and that out of these 30,000, perhaps 10,000 would be in a desperate situation one or two years later and would have lost the taste for work or the required qualifications. However, instead of doing that, it decided to retain all the workers on a four-day working week in a sort of partial unemployment, but an unem ployment that was accepted by the enterprise and the workers out of a sense of solidarity. The enterprise is financing the operation, as are the workers by agreeing to a wage cut. However, this is not an example for the future. This is an example of how to deal with a temporary situation. It would be a mistake to take Volkswagen as an example for the general distribution of working time. I repeat: it is not a matter of distributing an existing quantity of work, but rather of creating more work. (Applause) Poorly qualified workers pose other problems. A poorly qualified worker is judged according to criteria asso ciated with the demand on the part of enterprises, but has many human qualities: a great desire to work, qualities of human contact, and others. These people could work tomorrow, but they cannot work at the cost that their work currently represents. It is for this reason that in Europe there is a problem with the remuneration of so-called, I repeat, poorly qualified work, even though I do not like that term. I believe that by reducing indirect charges imposed on wages and transferring them else where, we could succeed in creating many jobs. I am repeating a formula which is familiar to you and which is not popular in all countries, but which is nevertheless a simple one: our society and our economy are designed in such a way that today's relatively abundant resource of labour is penalized, while the rare resource of the healthy environment is not taxed. This must change. We cannot support an environmental policy and reject this shift. We must tax rare resources - water, CO2, etc. - while at the same time reducing the cost of labour. We cannot have ",
        "2.12.93 Debates of the European Parliament No 3-439/39 DELORS indirect charges that account for 60 or 70% of wages. It is the worker himself who is penalized, because his direct wage is affected by the size of these indirect charges. (Applause) Lastly, and such is the philosophy of an employment policy integrated into the employment systems I men tioned earlier, we must have employment services of higher quality and with greater financial backing, so that the primary aim of the employment service, when a young person arrives on the labour market - and here we can take the example of an unemployed person - would be to find him a training scheme or an activity, and not paid idleness. Paid idleness must only be envisaged as a last resort, when nothing else can be done. However, we are now in the habit of concentrating all our strength on compensation and not enough on invention, innovation and qualification for finding these people a training scheme or activity. The other day, in Sweden, which implements an active employment policy, one of the officials told me: being an unemployed person in Sweden is a full-time job. It is an activity that does not leave a person on the margins of society. You have an activity and you can have a hope of finding it again. It is not a two-speed or three-speed society. It is a homogeneous society. Believe me, a homogeneous society is the only way to assert our active solidarity. Of course, that implies not only the employ ment services, but it also requires that the people them selves take charge of some of their problems. Instead of a passive society, with the supervision of welfare organiza tions, we must return to an active society. Otherwise, Europeans will not have the strength to stand up to the massive wave of competition and change in the world. Such is the warning confronting us. We must shake off our lethargy. We must regain our taste for work. We must reject all Malthusian temptations. And we must look around and see which needs are not being met: elderly people who would like to stay at home but who are institutionalized; the young people whose parents are gone for hours on end. I could give many more examples. Consequently, at the same time as we find our competi tiveness, we must move towards a new model of devel opment, with an active society that takes charge of itself, regains its optimism, and allows us to pass on to future generations a natural capital that is as good as - or perhaps even better - than what we have today. We must satisfy these new needs and provide ourselves with the means to satisfy them through reforms that will be paid for by everyone, and which are not simply a matter for the state, the state budget or the leaders, but call for a collective effort to reorganize our European societies. (Applause) METTEN (PSE). - (NL) Mr President, I shall begin by calling upon the European Commission, making an appeal and offering support, indeed primarily an appeal to stick closely to the specific objectives expressed by the Commission in its memorandum on the economic aspects of the White Paper. The memorandum that we already have in our possession, which specifically calls for 15 million new jobs before the end of the century, which calls for the level of unemployment to be halved, and which calls for a commitment to 2% more jobs each year. I think that these kinds of specific commitment are necessary to make the policy credible again, and on behalf of my group I would like to express our sincere support for the drafting of a specific document, full of real commitments, which is what the White Paper must be. The Council must definitely not be allowed to water it down! Mr President, it is clear that the job creation is only possible if there is sufficient economic growth, and that is not expected before the end of the century. So one thing is clear: If we wait for the market, if we merely take a number of economic measures, then this will not come about. There will be no new jobs and unemployment will continue to rise. That means that both the Community and the Member States must commit themselves to measures which promote growth. This can be done quite simply. The first thing to do is attend to the implementa tion of the Edinburgh package, because that has in fact still not happened. That is the first task. Secondly, I believe that the problems pointed out by the Commission in the introduction have less to do with the Commission and its intentions than with the Member States, which are not prepared to adapt their own policy to the common interest. So what we must issue is an appeal to the Member States to do that, to fall in with the line that the President of the Commission has just sketched out. VON WOGAU (PPE). - (DE) Mr President, it is of course difficult to reply to your speech - on which I congratulate you - in just two minutes. We must be quite clear about the fact that, on the one hand, we are debating areas for which the European Community is responsible, whereas on the other hand, we are dealing with areas that lie outside the EC's field of competence - and in these areas our debates can only serve to provide some impe tus. The question is this: What are the chances for future growth, e.g. in the area of car production and the manufacture of other products, which have already reached the peak of their production cycle? We are no longer finding growth within the European Community, but rather outside it, namely in China, South East Asia, Africa and India. Precisely for this reason it is very important that the Community should assume its responsibility over the next few days and do everything it can to conclude the GATT agreement, for that is of the greatest importance for the future of our economy. A second responsibility of the Community is the Single Market. The investment forces of the Single Market had already become effective before 1 January 1993, but in my opinion there is still tremendous potential for cutting costs, with a view to enhancing the competitiveness of the European Community. This is a second focus that must be established. Thirdly, I would like to take up the issue of infrastructure which you raised. You cited a figure of 15 million unemployed. It would have been just as interesting to hear a specific figure for the resources required to improve the infrastructure of the European Community. The question arises as to whether we should go beyond what was decided in Edinburgh. Specifically, we must check to see what the investment possibilities will be next year and the year after. In that way we can avoid committing one error that the Community has committed several times in the past - namely, making substantial resources available without being in a position to use these funds in a sensible manner. ",
        "No 3-439/40 Debates of the European Parliament 2.12.93 VON WOGAU As I see it, the real chance for the European Community to emerge from the current crisis is via competition, whereby I mean not only competition between enter prises, but also competition between the systems of the 12 Member States of the Community - based on the new concept of the European Community. In my opinion, the competition that arises here is the real force which may permit us to hope that we can find a back way out of the current crisis and manage to create the jobs we all need. VOHRER (LDR). - (DE) Mr President, I share the economic policy view of President Delors. We are indeed capable of coming up with the necessary production using an increasingly dwindling number of workers; on the other hand, we are caught up in fiercer competition, with the result that the productivity in some enterprises has risen by an astounding 30% to 40% within a very short period of time. All this is connected with substituting work to the benefit of capital, energy and raw materials. This process is still disguised by a wage difference between the European Union and Eastern Europe, the Far East and even the USA, with the result that more and more jobs are being exported. Consequently, it is necessary to think about our systems of taxation. We may not just tax incomes, thereby making labour even more expensive, but rather reorganize our tax system and - as Mr Delors said - increasingly use raw materials and environmental pollu tion as the basis for taxation. In suggesting that here today, Mr Delors, please under stand the obstacles with which we are confronted. Ques tions of taxation require unanimity within the Council of Ministers, and we are miles away from achieving such unanimity. If I am appealing for an ecological market economy, as the Commission did in its Fifth Action Programme, with its call for sustained development and strong economies, then it is necessary that we apply the causative principle in the area of environmental protec tion, apportion the environmental costs, and thereby also relieve our budgets. Only if we have prices that take ecological costs into account, will it prove possible to combine environmental objectives with economic growth. However, we must then transpose the packaging directive - which Parlia ment supports, but which is continuing to be blocked by the Council - in the waste management sector. We must then tax energy consumption - Parliament and the Commission agree on this point, and practise this envi ronmental approach in the transport sector and agricul ture. I am optimistic that we will then reach our objectives, namely implementing environmental policy within the market economy, creating more jobs and thereby work ing together to advance their ideas. ERNST DE LA GRAETE (V). - (FR) Mr President, every member of the Commission plays his instrument like a virtuoso. However, with his White Paper, Mr Delors seems unable to compose a symphony. As always, it is Mr Bangemanns's tuba and Leon Brittan's bass drum that are drowning everything out. The music from the social and environmental domains is barely audible. Yet again, we are hearing the traditional rhetoric: First of all comes austerity; we will see about employment later. The citizens of Europe are fed up with the rhetoric that our governments have been spouting for 10 years. Employ ment is a real priority. So why, yet again, is it taking third place? Put employment at the centre of your policies; then you will be able to convince the Europeans that Europe is a good thing for them. Stop promising us that results are just around the corner! We want fast results in this area. Let me take a single example, Mr President: that of the Single Market. We were told that the Single Market would be fantastic. On 1 January 1993, we were going to create five million jobs. So where are we now? We have talked about the free movement of goods, services and people. This free movement has indeed been achieved - but not for people. For capital, yes; for goods, yes; for services, to a certain extent; but we are still waiting for the free movement of people and that is what we need most. DE LOS SANTOS LOPEZ (ARC). - (ES) Mr President, Members, one of the sentences in the declaration on the White Paper on competitiveness, employment and growth says: 'a substantial reduction in unemployment is possible if society is prepared to make the efforts today that will lead to greater employment and prosperity tomorrow.' As an Andalusian, i.e. as a person from a region with an unemployment rate triple the Community average, please allow me to ask how we are going to work this miracle. I am forced to recall that, for the most disadvantaged regions, the hoped-for advantages of the Single Market and the opening up of frontiers merely represent an imbalance in their balance of trade, or the creation of jobs outside these regions - which comes down to the same thing. I should also remind you of the catastrophic impact of the prevailing monetary policy on the less developed Member States. This policy has produced effects which are being suffered by their battered economies. In addition, the sacrifice of the primary sector - especial ly agriculture and fisheries - has hard hit the growth expectations of the most disadvantaged regions, where primary activities account for a major proportion of the gross national product. I must also recall the sense of urgency and the demands which nominal convergence places on economic and monetary union. For certain Member States these were unattainable aims for reaching promised objectives of which there is no glimpse in either the short or medium term. Lastly, I agree that it is an ambitious goal - by its very necessity - to reduce the current level of unemployment in the Community by 50% by the year 2000. This means that in Andalusia, the unemployment rate will have to drop from 30% to 15% of the active population. Yet, I repeat the question: Can you, ladies and gentlemen, explain to me how we Andalusians will manage to work this miracle? BLOT (DR). - (FR) Mr President, Members of the House, I can see that the guidelines just presented by the President of the Commission, Mr Delors, are in many respects courageous and extremely interesting. They deserve our congratulations, as does, in particular, his excellent analysis of the taxation of labour as the cause of unemployment in our European economies. However, I would like to ask the Commission two questions. The first concerns the fact that growth is a process of economic divergence, a process of polarization, as the French economist, Francois Peroux said, and with whom ",
        "2.12.93 Debates of the European Parliament No 3-439/41 BLOT the President of the Commission is surely familiar. Consequently, the rules of convergence for Economic and Monetary Union are surely incompatible with the very process of growth, which can only take place when there is the greatest amount of divergence among the various economies? My second question is the following: Many well-known economists, for example the Nobel prizewinner Maurice Allais or Mr Garry Backer, the theoretician of human capital, have recently highlighted in numerous scientific articles the toll taken by immigration on Western econ omies. Yet, is not the White Paper's silence about the net cost of immigration and about the competition between nationals and foreigners on the labour market the result of purely ideological taboo? Should not this issue be raised, and at least studied and mentioned, if we want to analyse all the conditions that, one day, will make it possible to regain full employment? AIN ARDI (CG). - (FR) I too heard Mr Delors' remark on the large gap between us, the European Community, and social reality. I would say that this is the very least one could say in the light of what is happening today among workers and the people in the Member States. He also affirmed the great importance of the goal of creating jobs and employment. I am relieved to hear him mention this observation and this goal, but I do not think that the measures mentioned can respond either to the ambition of bringing the citizens closer to the Community or to the ambition of creating employment. Nevertheless, it was indeed the search for competitiveness at any price that led the Commission to attack wages and social protection. Workers have already paid their dues, both in terms of productivity and in terms of wage restraint, since real wages have increased at a rate of 1% less than the rate of productivity during the period 1989-1992. These efforts were made and unem ployment continued to rise. So this is not the right solution. On the other hand, capital is becoming increas ingly geared towards speculation. Is it not time to gain control of this movement of capital, and tax it in order to channel it away from speculation and towards produc tive, job-creating investment? Secondly, the increasingly stringent application of the convergence criteria limits the Member States' budgetary room for manoeuvre and contributes towards aggravating the recession. Do you not think it is necessary to review these strictly monetarist criteria in order to genuinely take account of the problems of employment and training? Lastly, growth of 2.5% would just make it possible to stabilize unemployment at its current level. We are far from that. Growth of more than 3% is needed, provided that it is not inflationary. However, it alone will not be enough to eliminate unemployment. In addition, what do you think of the proposal to undertake a process for reducing working time without affecting workers' wages? PINT\u00d3N (NI). - (FR) Mr President of the Commission, like all those who listened to you, I was struck by the quality of your diagnosis and by your obvious desire to resolve the serious problem of employment in Europe. However, I must say that I am not convinced by the solutions you proposed. I wonder whether all the meas ures you proposed do not bear witness more to intellec tual disarray than a firm will based on clear principles. My criticism, in essence, centres on the following point: All you are proposing to us is more state intervention, more regulations, more supervision of economic opera tors by the Community and, perhaps, by governments. I will cite a few examples for you. For the large-scale infrastructure works you proposed, you quite simply want the administration to take the place of the banks and transport or telecommunications enterprises whose busi ness it is and who would undoubtedly be in a better position than the administration to make profitable investments. Similarly, you want to organize technical research instead of laboratories or research centres. You also said just now that you wanted to explain to the heads of enterprises how better to manage their own enterprise. I could give many more examples. You should know that, in the minds of the people and workers everywhere, I fear that your plan quite simply reinforces the image of a Europe of regulations and constraints, instead of leaving freedom to flourish like we all need it to. BURON (PSE). - (FR) Mr President, a majority of us here agree with your analyses and your eloquent plea. My question today is different: In what direction is your White Paper heading? The information we managed to obtain regarding the reactions of the ECOFIN Council merely served to confirm our serious worries. Of the trio of growth, competitiveness and employment, we have the feeling that the ministers only grasped the second one, i.e. competitiveness, and have tackled it from the limited viewpoint of bringing down labour costs. Yes, the indi rect, fiscal and social costs of labour must be reduced, but care must be taken not to destroy the social pact or shatter consumption. On the other hand, what is the reaction of ministers on essential factors such as industrial policy, research and development policy and the creation of large networks that require public intervention? As for growth - i.e. the second section - where is the financial commitment needed for an adequate Commun ity initiative? As for employment, well, instead of the eagerly awaited message, there was less than nothing. Mr President, do you intend to take your proposals on the organization and reduction of working time and confirm them with examples, and is the Commission prepared, in the eyes of public opinion - and not just before Parlia ment - to have the Council assume its serious responsi bilities? (Applause) BROK (PPE). - (DE) Mr President, I believe that with your risky undertaking of presenting a White Paper of this kind, you have taken an important initiative because in so doing you have overcome old thinking. Both the right and the left like clinging on to old ideas, and it would certainly make sense to set new priorities on where we should concentrate our thinking. I believe that you also selected the correct sequence: given the globalization of the economy and the analysis arising from it, competitiveness must be secured, growth must be promoted to create new jobs, and by taking action in major sectors - e.g. biotechnology, information technologies or infrastructure - competitiveness must be promoted. In my country, all the parties are spending a great deal of money on rebuilding roads - which is an ",
        "No 3-439/42 Debates of the European Parliament 2.12.93 BROK achievement on the part of sated societies, not societies in search of new solutions. Unfortunately, the biotechnology and information tech nology sectors can be characterized by an old motto: If a new discovery is made in the USA in January, then in March products based on this discovery will be land on European and American coasts, and in July committees will be set up to look into the ethical and social conse quences of this discovery. It is due to this kind of thinking that we find ourselves lagging behind at the moment, and we must have the courage and strength to set sail for new shores. In this context it is important to remember that we may not combat unemployment by redistributing work, but rather we must create new jobs. Furthermore, the internal and external flexibility in this area, which you mentioned, are also important. We need new ideas. For instance, so-called poorly qualified workers must be classified in such a way that their work is sought after, thereby overcoming several attitudes displayed by the social partners. MAHER (LDR). - Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we badly need in this Community to create an employ ment culture rather than the redundancy culture that we seem to be racing towards in recent times. We need to put on a pedestal people with entrepreneurial flair and a spirit of enterprise rather than, as we often do in our Member States, taxing them when they are just starting off. We kill them before they can get going. Very often the state has contradictory measures. They supply money to create employment, then they kill employment by their taxation laws. Captains of industry are often distinguished more for the numbers of people they can get rid of than the numbers of people they keep in employment. They go for technology very often when they ought to be focussing more on people. I want to challenge those, Mr President, who call for new measures on the environment. Indeed I am in favour of having the best possible environment, but very often we are not told how much it is going to cost. If we have an energy tax, what does that do to employment? Does it increase or decrease it? Mr Delors, I would put a challenge to you. You said that a big problem is the amount of tax that workers have to pay. I suggest to you that that is not the important problem. The important problem is, provided that these workers get a good income, it is the tax that has to be extracted from enterprise that depresses the enterprise. LANNOYE (V). - (FR) Mr President of the Commission, your goal is to create 15 million jobs. I think that is a laudable objective and nobody will contradict you on that point. Having said that, I believe that the methods and objec tives which you are placing at the service of the interests of this so-called priority objective are not the answer. An act of faith in the relentless pursuit and exacerbation of international - and indeed global - competition is cer tainly not the ideal method for creating 15 million jobs in Europe. You place the emphasis - principally in terms of invest ment - on communications networks and information highways. On the subject of information highways, do you not think that it is dangerous to harbour the illusion that the new generation of telecommunications infra structures is going to lead, as you said, to the creation of hundreds of thousands of jobs? It is dangerous if you fail to take account of the fact that it will also contribute towards eliminating others, and that, moreover, these jobs will be very easy to relocate. I am raising questions on this matter because it seems to me that they deserve a precise answer. VAN DER WAAL (NI). - (NL) Mr President, there is no difference of opinion as far as the prospects of the European economy are concerned, increasing competi tion and the further loss of jobs. It is clear that the problem of job opportunities cannot be solved by a short-term job plan or by collective work-sharing. Struc tural adjustments are required that will take years. It has all been said before, but will the police, the social partners and citizens want to see this thing through? The seriousness of the matter seems to be getting through only with difficulty, but it must be conceded that it is a difficult message. Nothing less than a break with a welfare policy that has been there for decades, steadily growing and improving. A policy taken from life is being practised, i.e. milk it for all it is worth. That is not a favourable climate for a policy that is asking us to take a step backwards. However, we politicians should not speak too readily of an insufficient willingness on the part of others to accept economy measures. Thou who prea- cheth the law of wage moderation, should practice moderation thyself - or can the salaries of civil servants and the pay of members of parliament resist the cries for moderation? The White Paper is concerned with econ omic measures, but the moral content of our democracies is no less important. In conclusion, on the basis of the results of the White Paper regarding the internal market we have learned that the models of society that we are capable of building are worse than we thought. So is it not now unrealistic to awaken the expectation that we have the means to create 15 million jobs in our hands? VAN VELZEN (PSE). - (NL) Mr President, I was pleased to note that the President of the Commission is still ablaze with fighting spirit, and I wish him great resolve in sticking to the quantitative objectives of his policy, and in the fight for a social model as a framework within which the debate on the necessary modernization of our labour market will have to take place. However, besides the economic debate, Mr President, I would like to draw some attention to the political problem facing us, i.e. that according to the contributions of the Member States, both in writing and within the Council, there is virtually no confidence in a common approach, in excessive faith in a purely national approach. Is it not the task of the Commission and Parliament in the first place to primarily hammer on about the added value of a common approach as a logical consequence of the inter nal market? My impression, Mr President, is that along with the economic problem, the current political situation is certainly commanding just as much attention, because if there is insufficient faith in a joint Community approach it will appear virtually impossible to solve the economic problem. I hope that will also be the basis for the discussions and outcome of the forthcoming Council, because at the moment the citizens do not really believe in Europe, and that has a great deal to do with our ",

I fear the worst if it should once again emerge that we are incapable or unwilling to attack the problem of unemployment. CHABERT (PPE). - (FR) Affecting almost 12% of the active population, unemployment is a disease that is now hitting every family, every commune and every area of our cities in Europe. The well-known consequences of unemployment are disastrous. Not only does it represent an incredible economic waste, but more importantly it is reflected in some 17 to 20 million human, individual and family dramas, and the same number of unacceptable, often desperate and sometimes explosive situations. Let us not fool ourselves, this rot, which creates new poverty, inequality and social exclusion, is striking at the very heart of our civilization. Europe has decided to face up to it. While this is certainly an economic necessity, it is primarily a humanitarian one. What is now certain is that the origin of this situation is no longer cyclical but structural. In the industrial and tertiary sectors we are know experiencing the effects of a produc tivity whose impact on agriculture has been gauged over the past 20 years. In France, for example, while we increased our production and became a largely exporting agricultural country, the number of rural workers drop ped by half. Today we are sure that any foreseeable or hoped-for growth will not in itself be enough to offset the job losses linked to productivity. This must lead us to a veritable revolution in our behaviour and action. There are three pitfalls to be avoided when undertaking this action. Firstly, the pitfall of protectionism: We in France know that the Maginot line was never any use. Then there is the pitfall of ultra-liberalism, which would boost the social recession. Lastly, there is the pitfall of trying to slow down technological progress, when it is this very progress that has always been the source of progress in our society. What we have to do, Mr President, is explore new areas, as you rightly proposed in your draft White Paper: e.g. by sharing working time, exempting social security charges from tax, exploring new areas of activity in services and the environment, and setting up a genuine policy for promoting SMEs and SMIs, since we know that it is they that are the only centres of job creation. Other leads can be explored, but the important thing is to know whether there is a genuine political will to implement them. These are the expectations that Europeans have of their leaders. Let us hope that the summit will succeed in living up to them. NIELSEN (LDR). - (DA) Mr President, Europe's alarm ing mass of unemployed are naturally looking forward to real action being taken at European level. We have debated for far too many years, have had good intentions and strong desires to get rid of unemployment. And what has happened? The topic of the White Paper we are awaiting is growth, our competitive capability, and employment. Unfortunately we have witnessed negative growth, falling growth, and - as Mr Delors has already pointed out today - our competitive capability has fallen, and we are poorly placed in comparison with the USA and Japan. So things have gone in the very opposite direction to the one we intended and have presented us with the prospect of rising unemployment this year. That is beneath human dignity and we simply cannot afford it any longer. Now people are expecting action. I hope we will let sleeping dogmas lie. I note that there is talk of work-sharing. Yes, we may well have to have work-sharing. I do not believe it will be enough. In any case, I do not believe in it at all if it means retaining the same wage for working less. Where will the money come from? After all, we cannot go on and on sharing. We must show some imagination for creating genuine new jobs. So we must exploit technologies and scientific research, and we must create favourable condi tions for our many small and medium-sized enterprises. You said yourself, Mr Delors, that it is a catastrophe for our small and medium-sized enterprises. Yes, but it is they that will create jobs in the future, so let us bring about better economic conditions for them. Let us not tax them. They are the ones that will create the many much-needed jobs, so leave off promising 15 million jobs which you cannot after all guarantee. IN THE CHAIR: MR PETERS Vice-President ARCHIMBAUD (V). - (FR) Mr President, could you specify the Commission's view regarding the reduction of working time? What importance do you attribute measures of this kind in the fight against unemployment? What actual measures would you be ready to implement in order to encourage and follow-up the new initiatives aimed at work-sharing? Is the Commission envisaging measures aimed at ensur ing that any such sharing takes place in a manner that is not precarious, but which protects those who are commit ted to the path of solidarity. In this context, there would have to be a large-scale democratic debate on what is meant by 'flexibility', involving all the relevant actors. Finally, I would like to join those who asked you whether the Commission is determined to make sure that the Council faces up to its tremendous responsibilities regarding the fight against unemployment. (Applause) PAPAYANNAKIS (NI). - (GR) Mr President, President Delors told us that we need a 2.5% increase in production in order to stabilize unemployment. Of course, under the current conditions and without the increasing competi tiveness that has already emerged in the services sector, such increases in production are not likely to happen in the developing and mature economies of Europe unless a number of major changes are made to their structures. It is clear that we cannot solve the problem of unemploy ment by increasing production. However, we may be able to solve the problem with new technologies in certain areas - as mentioned earlier. I believe such an approach opens the way - and in my opinion this is an important way in the area of non-commercial employment - to those people who are not subject to major international competition, at least not for the moment. However, the big question is who is going to pay for this. The vast amounts of money needed to make these structural changes in reality can certainly not be found by levying ecotaxes, which no-one at international level currently wants. ",
        "No 3-439/44 Debates of the European Parliament 2.12.93 PAPAYANNAKIS Hence, Mr President, the only possible solution would be direct taxation. Unfortunately, however, we are in the position of holding a ridiculous debate at a time when we are refusing to make direct taxation an area of Commun ity competence. This leaves us defenceless, because - for one thing - the issue of unemployment, which is an expression of national as well as European solidarity, requires another ideology and another approach towards European integration, and not merely a technocratic approach. FORTE (PSE). - (IT) Mr President, I do not believe that the White Paper can be considered a sort of panacea for the problems facing us. I hope, however, that we can make progress on the problems regarding the direct competence of the EC and its institutions. If, for example, the GATT negotiations are not concluded this month, a subsequent loss of credibility will come about despite the prospect of 15 million jobs. If the Single Market does not work, then all the rest will just be chit-chat. Coming to the crux of the matter under discussion here, I would say that we must take account of the fact that here today in this debate we can only make requests because we are not competent in this matter. For the social legislation in the various Member States employs a series of standards in the area of, for example, unemployment benefit, aid to unemployed workers, working time, and so on - all of which differ from country to country. In addition, there are general laws of economics by which everyone must abide. One basic law of economics says that of course we can reduce working time, but we must also reduce workers' incomes. This is the hard law of the economy! That is why when we tackle these issues we must be totally serious and extremely cautious. I wonder, Presi dent Delors, whether the problem regarding the flexibili ty of working time, which is at the heart of this entire issue, has been tackled by the trade unions at European level, or whether a debate has been initiated around a negotiating table at that same level - because it seems to me that the prospects that are being held out are primarily pretty, rhetorical aspirations, although so far there has still not been a minimum level of confrontation with the social forces. This is why I would suggest that we take more concrete steps to fulfil these aspirations: This is not just a matter of changing working time - let us all work less, but at least all work - but rather of tackling this issue together with the social forces, industrialists and entre preneurs at European level and coming up with specific responses to this situation. I wished to God that is was possible to create 15 million new jobs, but that, of course, would require a major commitment and a very major effort indeed. I hope that all the optimism that could emerge from this debate will at least be partly successful in assuming some concrete form, and therefore in reviv ing the idea of Europe amongst the Europeans. DELORS, President of the Commission. - (FR) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Members of the House, I would like to thank everyone who spoke, whether to support the documents in their possession or to criticize them, as is normal. Two of you said that the Commission must make the Council of Ministers face up to its responsibilities. Of course, we must assume our responsibilities, but need I remind you that for two years in all the Member States the main scapegoat for explaining any difficulty has been the European Commission? This fact has made us tend towards great modesty. You will notice this when you read the White Paper. The White Paper does not promise a brighter future. The White Paper does not offer certainties, because - believe me - if there were solutions, then they would be known, and some of our countries would have already applied them. Therefore, while I addressed you with a certain amount of enthusiasm, this was because I refuse to accept the current situation. However, if you ask me to come up with a miracle cure, then I must say that I cannot. First of all, to those among you who fear that the White Paper will propose new powers at Community level, I would reply that you are mistaken - for the following reasons. Firstly, the financial limits set by the Edinburgh Council will not be exceeded. 'Package II' will be respected. We do not intend to ask for additional millions of ECUs for Community public expenditure while the national budgets are in the situation you know only too well. Secondly, there will be no state intervention as far as infrastructure is concerned. I remind you that one particular provision of the Treaty on European Union provides for the Community to be able to decide to create infrastructure networks. Development plans have been established by our ministers. These development plans include, of course, priority networks, but for the rest it is up to the enterprises concerned, the national governments and the financial markets - as well as the banks - to do what needs to be done. We are not asking this to be financed by the various public budgets. Similarly, as regards research, we do not aspire to imposing priority areas of research. Enterprises and research institutes will decide on those. If I mentioned the 'information society', it is because I took the trouble to consult ten researchers and ten leading company bosses to find out where we are headed for. Indeed, what purpose does a Community research programme serve? It serves to facilitate cooperation between research insti tutes and enterprises, and to give that 'something extra' which makes it possible to put together a financial package and encourages us to move in this direction. If I spoke about that, it is because every minister wants their own town to benefit by receiving ECU 20 or 30 million. Every official wants to have his own counter. This is what is killing us at European level. If I proposed regional development programmes in 1987, it was to avoid this culture of the counters. Everyone wants to get hold of ECU 2 m from here or there. As for us, we must go where the effort is needed. This is what Mr Davignon did when he created the ESPRIT programme at the right time. To those who speak of interventionism, I would say that we are continuing our battle to consolidate the Single Market and eliminate obstacles to healthy competition. Believe me, our telecommunications companies will not manage to assimilate technical progress and move ahead of their competitors if they are shackled in administrative chains. The key will be in the hands of national policies. The White Paper is merely a discussion paper. It is at national level, and even at a more decentralized level, that things will have to be done. This is an opportunity for me to appeal once again in favour of a society of initiatives and an active society, and to answer your questions on the organization of working time. I am in favour - and I hope the Commission will ",
        "2.12.93 Debates of the European Parliament No 3-439/45 DELORS follow me here - of initiatives aimed at organizing working time within enterprises, at decentralized level, but I do not think that a widespread reduction in and sharing of working time is the solution to our problems. That will only weaken us, whereas what we have to do is create wealth. There are poor people among us. I repeat, there are needs that have not been met. (Applause) However, of course we will publicize every successful initiative for organizing working time which allows people to lead a better life and also creates jobs. This we will do within the framework of the social dialogue I have undertaken since 1985. To those who are worried about the reaction from the Member States, I would say that the debate in the Council of Ministers of Economic Affairs and Finance was positive. However, when these gentlemen emerged again, they all had to think of their political life on the domestic front, so they had to find a scapegoat, a whipping boy: and that was the Commission report. That is not right. I am telling you that I do not have a magic solution. I would like the national politicians to do the same. Together, we must all seek solutions aimed at remedying the rampant social and moral disease that is wracking our countries. To those - and there are still those - who advocate growth in an individual country or protectionism, I would reiterate that the Community represents 25% of the world market and that, if we protect ourselves, then there will be reactions and we will lose even more jobs. As regards getting on top of technological progress, I would point out - and I thank the Member who men tioned it - that technological progress is not a miracle cure. Although mastering technological progress means promoting job creation, if we are to do this we need a great deal of intelligence and initiative -and there is nothing self-evident about that. It is true, for example, that a certain vision of the information society could lead to a further reduction in the number of jobs. The impor tant thing for us is to master technological progress. For look around and you will see that globalization is here. That is a fact you cannot ignore. As regards the information society, I could even give you some specific examples, but I do not wish to advertise for American companies. However, in Europe 10 years from now do you want us to have to go via the United States or Japan every time we want some piece of data essential to our work or whenever we want to communicate? If that is what you want, then go ahead and continue making your speeches about the obsessive fear of technological pro gress or about protectionism. The founding fathers of the Treaty of Rome wanted Europe because they wanted Europe to stand on its own two feet. It was not simply a matter of saying: 'Let there be no more war between us'. They wanted the nations of Europe to join forces, because individually we could not face up to the world. That is the essential idea, the political idea. Those who say: 'We should consign the founding fathers of the Treaty of Rome to a museum,' are forgetting something, namely that each of our countries, whatever its past glory, cannot face up alone to the many economic, ethnic and religious risks threatening the world. It is not because the Berlin Wall fell that we are moving towards universal democracy and peace. We must be vigilant. We must be strong and, besides, there is no generosity without power. I repeat: There is no miracle cure. Adding the icing to the cake, I would also say that neither a generalized reduction of working time nor a wage cut is a miracle cure, as certain people claim. If we must have the same wages as the Chinese in order to be competitive, then we might as well turn our backs on 200 years of work and social achievement. That is no cure either! (Applause) Nor are protectionism or the dogged pursuit of our objectives miracles cures either. As for the rest, well that is debatable. We must size up everything. We must achieve Economic and Monetary Union under realistic conditions. Mr Blot said - and this was something that was worth hearing - that growth is based on divergence. I believe that in the 1960s, for those of us who remember that time, whenever a European country was in a tight situation, it expected that another country would have more growth to stimulate it. Today, however, we no longer think in terms of the European sphere, but rather in terms of the whole world, and it is the convergence of our economies that will best enable us to achieve our goals of sustainable growth and social progress. The world changed between the 1960s and the 1990s. Let us try to remain as lucid as is necessary. Let us not be disarmed by the changes taking place. Rather, let us show the will to face up to them. Let us be clear-sighted and imaginative! (Applause) PRESIDENT. - The debate is closed. 2. Welcome PRESIDENT. - I should like to welcome a delegation from the parliament of the Kingdom of Nepal led by His Excellency Masheshwor Prasad Singh, which has joined us in the visitors' gallery. (Applause) This visit is part of the third interparliamentary meeting with the appropriate delegation of the European Parlia ment. The Community enjoys good relations with Nepal and our contacts at parliamentary level have shown that there is a joint interest in cooperation. I hope that this third meeting will become a further step along the road to a necessary and desirable strengthening of relations between our countries and peoples. I wish the visit of the Nepalese delegation every success. Once again I should like to bid them welcome on behalf of Parliament and wish them a pleasant stay in Brussels. 3. Broad guidelines of economic policies PRESIDENT. - The next item is the report by Mr Donnelly, on behalf of Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy (A3-384/93) on economic policy in the Member States and the Commun ity. DONNELLY (PSE), rapporteur. - Mr President, this report is of great importance to this House, and I believe ",
        "No 3-439/46 Debates of the European Parliament 2.12.93 DONNELLY that the Commission shares the European Parliament's view that in stage 2 of economic and monetary union there must be clear guidelines based on common goals for the coordination of economic policy across the European Union. I have to say though that I do not believe that the Ecofin Councils have shown any signs of sharing the concerns or views of Commission and Parlia ment on this matter. Indeed, it is quite obvious that the desire of the Commission to set proper targets for this key economic framework has met with such hostility from finance ministers that the document which emerged from the Commission has been stripped of any substance and merely reflects the same bankrupt, minimalist and over whelmingly monetarist policies which have driven Europe into this mess and so many of our citizens out of work. My report therefore gives guidelines which will bring demand back into Europe's economy, which will set the scene for real and lasting economic recovery and, most important of all, achieve the overriding objective of a substantial reduction in unemployment. The report recognizes the public finance problems which exist in several Member States, but through this resolution, Mr President, we want to make absolutely clear to finance ministers that this House does not support tackling the underlying problems in public finances on a time scale which simply aggravates the recession. Indeed, instead of cutting public investment at this time, we believe that Commission and Council should be giving encourage ment to the role of both public and private investment to meet the increasing unmet needs of our people. There fore, the economic guidelines should be encouraging job generation across Europe through prudent public/private partnership, in improving infrastructure, urban renewal, health, education, training and childcare, investing to meet the unmet needs of our citizens. Mr President, this report rejects any attempt by Member State governments to seek to imitate the sweatshop economies of the Far East as a route out of recession, and so we set out specific and concrete objectives, which should be the basis of Europe's coordinated economic programme. First, we call for the full implementation and full reinforcement of the Edinburgh and Copenhagen initiatives, which unbelievably, after almost a year, have failed to be fully applied. We call on national govern ments to genuinely reorientate their national budgets towards employment creation and we seek an increase in the European Investment Bank's temporary financing facility. We believe that the European Union should introduce a range of incentives for employment, by shifting the burden of taxation away from employment. These incen tives must help to encourage employers to hire the long-term unemployed and boost investment in human resources. We call for the Ecofin Council to coordinate measures to close the numerous tax loopholes across Europe, which are adding to the revenue problems of many Member States. And since tackling unemployment is our main objective, we ask the European Council to engage with the social partners in a rapid assessment of how the reorganization of working patterns can contri bute to job creation. We ask the European Council to give greater recognition and support to the potential for job generation through public spending. Mr President, this is a proposal which we have allowed to be dismissed too easily in the past, but only on the grounds of political dogma. And of course, in order to boost small and medium-sized enter prises, there has now to be a rapid and coordinated reduction in real interest rates in Europe to levels com parable to our major industrial competitors. Mr President, the European Parliament today wishes to remind the Council that the overriding importance of creating sustainable employment is our priority, because it is the priority of the citizens of Europe. Of course, on that basis, it should also be the Council's priority. This goal requires a new model of development, not merely more of the policies which have led to the jobs crisis that we face today. In conclusion, Mr President, we urge the Commission and the Council to adopt and promote coordinated econ omic measures that will lead to a sustained recovery, allowing the benefits that are gained to be shared throughout the Union. The imminent Council meeting is a crossroads for the European Union. When this House passes overwhelmingly, as it will today, this resolution, it is in fact demanding that the European Union should take the path which can help restore public confidence in Europe and in this dynamic and essential process. I urge the House to overwhelmingly support this report today and send a clear message to the Council in a few days' time. BOFILL ABEILHE (PSE). - (ES) Mr President, I would like to thank Mr Desmond for kindly allowing me to take the floor in this debate, a debate which might be viewed by some as a routine act of parliament to discuss the economy. Yet nothing could be further from the truth. Mr Donnelly has already made this quite clear in his excel lent report. The great significance of these general guidelines lies in the fact that they attempt to strengthen the coordination of an economic convergence that enables sustained, job- creating growth. More importantly, these guidelines shape a new model of development, providing new orientations on investment, taxation, and specific poli cies. I am convinced that price stability is necessary, as affirmed in the Treaty on European Union and in the Donnelly resolution. We must also reduce the public debt, which would allow us to gradually lower interest rates across the board and thereby create the conditions for the exchange rate stability we require to exploit the potential of the Single Market. It is also certain that reforms of certain aspects of the labour market are increasingly appropriate if we are to eliminate some of the current rigidity that is seriously aggravating the problem of unemployment. However, one might legitimately wonder, as do many citizens of the Union - with something between amazement and confu sion - why all this is necessary. Well, now is the time to explain - without beating about the bush - that these measures have no other purpose than to create stable employment, but without writing off future jobs. The effects of the structural reforms bring with them the unavoidable commitment of solidarity with all those who do not have work, especially young people, women and the long-term unemployed, all of whom are suffering most acutely from the effects of the crisis.

Today, not only do we, the citizens of the Union, differ from each other in terms of the accumulation of individual wealth, but we also differ in the most dramatic way possible, namely as to whether or not we have a job. However, there are also the ethics of criticism, from which we must not stray. Rather, we must put them into practice, and this is the most appropriate forum for doing so. We must criticize the lack of solidarity and the selfishness that has surfaced in several meetings of the Council of Ministers, just as we must criticize the passivity in which the Commission has taken refuge on many occasions. Moreover, we must also criticize the fact that we sometimes have to criticize ourselves. Please allow me to give one example that will illustrate what I have been saying. Since the crisis began, we have affirmed the need to boost growth. In December 1992, the European Council of Edinburgh dealt with the objectives and means that should be included in a collective and coordinated effort to generate growth and employment. A European Investment Fund was created, as was a credit line at the EIB. This credit line was increased by ECU 3 billion in Copenhagen, ECU 1 bn of which was ear marked for interest-rate subsidies benefiting small and medium-sized enterprises, which we feel play a major role in job creation. So, we must denounce the fact that the Community measures were barely put into effect. When the were officially put into effect - and I stress officially, as in the case of the credit line from the EIB - this did not entail genuine additionality. The EIB agreed to allocate a large proportion of its usual loan programme to the Edinburgh initiative. Mr President, in addition to the ethics of responsibility and criticism, we, as political officials, must also create a sense of anticipation. Now, more than ever, we must call upon our fellow citizens to perform a common task, to overcome the economic crisis and to make a commitment to solidarity in order to alleviate the difficulties of those who are suffering most from the crisis: the unemployed. It may be necessary to call for the construction of a Europe that is not only democratic and rooted in solidar ity - today more than ever - but also to call for a Europe of work, since work is the foundation of human develop ment. JACKSON, Christopher (PPE). - Mr President, underly ing this debate are two crucial questions. How do we restore hope and a future to the 17 million of our fellow citizens who are unemployed? And how should we secure sustained, non-inflationary growth? In this report we affirm three vital characteristics. First, the creation of favourable conditions for enterprise, innovation and investment to generate wealth and employment. Second, the creation of economic conditions which justify a rapid reduction in interest rates in Europe. And, third, measures to stimulate demand which must be achieved without overheating the economy and triggering a new inflation ary spiral. Obviously we seek sustained non-inflationary growth. But we are not adequately competitive in the Commun ity. How can we be when we learn that hourly rates here in Belgium, France or Germany are 50% above hourly wage rates, not in the sweatshops of the Far East, but in California. Our companies face additional costs and burdens which make the competitive gap wider still. They come from social and other legislation. Of course we want high standards but we do not want legislative luxuries which result in unemployment for our fellow citizens. Europe suffers from diminished economic demand. We must create the economic conditions for non-inflationary growth so that we can have cuts in interest rates which can stimulate demand and stimulate investment. I now want to turn to the unanswered question, namely how we can release the job-creating capacity of our economies. Growth is a necessary but not sufficient condition for creating employment. Let me explain. Large companies increase productivity rapidly. One I know has, in the last five years, cut its employment by 50%. It now employs half as many people as it did and yet it has increased its sales. So large companies, economi cally so important for us, are on the whole net shedders of jobs. How are we going to solve this conundrum of unemployment. Well, American experience shows the crucial importance of small and medium-sized enter prises up and down our countries: the tiny new compan ies which come and go but also those small companies which have put down roots and are in a position to grow rapidly and take on many employees in the process. These are the job creaters. So how do we encourage them? We have asked for a special programme of initiatives to help these companies. We must cut legisla tive on-costs, get rid of red tape and create this economic environment that is favourable to them, to growth and investment. This report is an honourable compromise between right and left in favour of the people of the European Union. We do not agree with every word of it but in essence it points us clearly in the right direction. I am relieved it does not give support to misguided nostrums like a 4-day week and I am glad on behalf of my party to give it our support and to commend it to the Commission and the Council. PORTO (LDR). - (PT) Mr President, the Donnelly report, just like the Commission White Paper, comes at an especially difficult time of recession and worsening unemployment. History - which we should always bear in mind - shows that in periods of crisis such as this it is necessary not only to find suitable policies, but also to avoid the temptation to undertake policies which, although they might have some immediate attractions, would not solve the funda mental problems and would in the medium and long term lead to much profounder difficulties. In this context, the most serious temptation, and one which is already emerging, is the temptation to withdraw into a feeling of protectionism, thus trying to guarantee jobs in enterprises that are unable to compete in an open economy. Nevertheless, the Commission is quite clear here: it is not taking this path, but rather is basing its strategy for action on three pillars, one of which is to increase external competitiveness. This means increasing competitiveness by exploiting and enhancing Europe's great potential in a world in which, if we placed demands upon ourselves, we would continue to have relative advantages in many areas. We must continue to stress the need for a balanced agreement in ",
        "No 3-439/48 Debates of the European Parliament 2.12.93 PORTO the Uruguay Round, since Europe has to be very rigid compared with third countries which also comply with our rules. The second serious temptation is to abandon the current policy of monetary and exchange rate stability, deeming that any inflationary tension or exchange rate devaluation would be a suitable means for promoting investment and employment. Experience shows that this kind of objec tive is not achieved in this way, and must therefore be pursued along the lines of the Treaty of Maastricht. Lastly, it should be underlined - since it is a positive aspect that both the Donnelly report and the White Paper remind anyone liable to forget it - that the recession cannot lead to a downturn in the efforts to achieve social and economic cohesion, since it is clear that it is often those regions which have flexible, well-organized small and medium-sized enterprises with access to new techno logies which avoid the costs of the crisis and manage to find new employment opportunities. ERNST DE LA GRAETE (V). - (FR) The Commission draft guidelines of the economic policies of the Member States of the Community is a real catastrophe, so I congratulate Mr Donnelly on the work he has done. I think that his report already marks a major improvement, and I hope that the signal sent out by Parliament will be heard by the Council as well as by the Commission. It is even more of a real catastrophe because the conclu sion of these draft guidelines clearly shows that the Member States must definitely respect their convergence programme, otherwise things will turn out badly for them. It is well-known that the Maastricht Treaty pro vides for the punishment of Member States which are not good pupils regarding macro-economic policy as defined in this report. Our Parliament is calling upon the Council and the Commission to make unemployment and social exclu sion the focus of their concerns. We are calling upon them to turn their logic around, to stop always saying: First growth and competitiveness, first austerity in con vergence policies, then maybe we will have jobs'. We say that the creation of jobs and social integration for all European citizens must at last be made the priority. What hypocrisy to speak of negative economic growth! How can they use such language? We are asking that there be growth, of course, in exchanges of information and know-how, and that there be less growth in goods and commodities. We are asking that the convergence criteria be aimed not only at currency, but also at the real economy. It is intolerable to create an economic and monetary union without providing for fiscal solidarity or social security mechanisms. This is tantamount to encouraging the survival of the fittest. We, however, want a Europe where everyone can be a winner. So the European growth initiative must be focused back on the productive sectors, and not on the motorways which are, moreover, generat ing additional bother. The aim must not be to move around faster and more cheaply, except for information and persons. But not for vehicles. So let us focus the European growth initiative back on the sectors which bring jobs. As for competitiveness, we do not reject it here within the framework of Europe where the differences between individual countries are not too large. But with countries outside Europe the matter is much more delicate. Even if we lower labour costs an unqualified worker in Europe costs around seven times as much as a worker in Asia. So for us the Uruguay Round is not a priority. In any case, not in the conditions under which it is currently being negotiated. Competitiveness at international level is not a solution. Rather, it is the cause of our current problems, and we want this to be finally understood. Consequently, we are calling for reorientation towards a new model of economic development that is not based on protectionism. Protectionism is a withdrawal into one self, the very opposite of what we, the members of the Green Group in the European Parliament, want. We already said the same thing yesterday about racism and xenophobia. However, we do want trade, though as I already said, more for know-how, training and informa tion, and less for commodities. We want Europe to rest on a pillar of social rights, which enables human dignity to be maintained and extended outwards. (Applause) LATAILLADE (RDE). - (FR) Mr President, Members of the House, whatever happens, the sheer scale of the drama which is now hitting the entire Community and the unemployment which is eating away at the very founda tions of our societies must not be eclipsed by a few fallacious words. It is a long-standing evil, but one with a scope beyond all measure familiar to us from even the recent past. It has numerous causes and origins, but its fatal consequences are unacceptable. Innumerable young people, women and adults, aged between around 40 and 45 years, cannot live for ever on promises and hope. Hopelessness is invading our streets, our neighbourhoods and our cities. We are witnessing the dramatic situation of persons 'of no fixed abode', which is nearly always the final stage of an individual process which started with being made redundant. A situation which has been inevitably com pounded by other difficulties of a personal and social nature arising all at the same time. Admittedly, the short-term measures proposed in the brief document on the broad economic guidelines, like those contained in the resume of the White Paper for the medium term, are pointing in mainly the right direction, albeit without proposing any very original solutions. The most difficult part remains to be done. There is a need for real growth, even if we know that it will not contribute to the creation of jobs. However, I regret to point out to the previous speaker that without growth there will not be any jobs anyway. We cannot strengthen the convergence policies of the Member States without common practice. There will be no such common practice without the funding by taxation of social security costs and the search for a greater flexibility on the labour market. Nor, of course, must we neglect the social acquis which embody European progress. Finally, Mr President, the Community must provide itself with sufficiently effective legal instruments in the con text of trade policy with third countries so as to have a means of recourse when faced with unilateral commer cial decisions. We must do this quickly. Unemployment is biting into our societies. We must not dither! ",
        "2.12.93 Debates of the European Parliament No 3-439/49 BARRERA I COSTA BARRERA I COSTA (ARC). - (FR) Mr President, the measures proposed by the Donnelly report do not go to the heart of the problem. They offer palliative treatment for a very serious disorder which is rooted in the unequal trading conditions in international trade. The nub of the question, what are really at stake, are the GATT agreements - both those we are preparing to sign and those currently in force. Under these circumstances, it seems incredible that Parliament has been unable to hold an in-depth debate on this matter during this mini- session. People are advocating openness and free trade, and basing themselves on a study carried out by the World Bank which promises the earth for everyone if the GATT agreements are signed. However, it has been shown that this study lacks scientific rigour. The least bit of prudence would require that the 15 December deadline be rejected, and that the whole business be reexamined in a more transparent manner and with every methodological gua rantee. I am convinced that if, without practising protectionism systematically, the European Union does not take meas ures to protect its internal market - which is vast enough not to fear technological obsolescence - then we will have to resign ourselves to a considerable drop in wages and give up our system of social protection. And even by doing that it is by no means certain that we will avoid unemployment. Instead of considering the uncontrolled increase in inter national trade as the only path of salvation, we should focus on Community preference. Instead of dreaming of a multilateral international trade organization, which is impossible for the moment, we should focus on bilateral agreements negotiated on the basis of mutual benefit. Mr President, unless we get a grip on ourselves in time, the large enterprises will extricate themselves from the current dilemma by relocating, and the international finance sector will increase its profits further. However, for a continually growing number of Europeans that will mean impoverishment, unemployment and misery! (Applause) BLOT (DR). - (FR) Mr President, Members of the House, the Commission paper is incomplete but at least has the merit of looking at the problem of unemployment within the context of a policy of supply, rather than merely one of demand. The main question, if I correctly understood it, was how to lower the cost of labour in such a way as to increase employment. That, I believe, is a courageous and correct approach, and I would like to point that out. On the other hand, the economic policy measures recommended by the Donnelly report take us back to the 1960s or even to the post-war years, for the measures are based on a Keynesian analysis which we now know to be scientifi cally outmoded. We now know that calling for the recovery of global demand and the lowering of interest rates leads us nowhere. It is merely wishful thinking. All this cannot be decided in advance; nor can growth. I just spoke to Francois Peroud, who analyzed growth as a polarized process of differentiation. In effect, are the convergence criteria which have been laid down to lead us into EMU not deflationary in their outlook? Is monetary union not a dangerous objective for growth? The example of German monetary union has shown us this, for unemployment has skyrocketed in the East, and inflationary pressure has increased in the West. However, making the economy of the former GDR converge with the West German econo my is less ambitious than wanting to achieve long-term monetary union between 12 profoundly different coun tries. As a result I believe that we should question the long- term objective of monetary union in the interests of preserving growth and employment. Furthermore, I must stress the burden of the cost of immigration weighing down on our competitiveness and on the level of compe titiveness on the job market between nationals and immigrants, which is now higher than ever before. There too, I would again refer our colleagues to the analyses of the Nobel Peace Prize... (The President cut off the speaker) RIBEIRO (CG). - (PT) Mr President, of the key docu ments for the next Council meeting, the one on macroe conomics is the only one on which this Parliament can formulate an opinion. The White Paper enables us to appreciate the difficulty in finding a consensus that will serve as a bridge for the social aspect which links the fundamentalist version - in which competitiveness is based exclusively on control, wage restraint and cutting the cost of the 'work' produc tion factor - to and the softer version. The Green Paper shows that, as is customary, the social aspect will be nothing more than a reference and will be postponed until mid-1994, by which time the White Paper should have been adopted, and when the situation will - predictably - be even 'blacker'. It is sad that our opinion is not being heard on documents which are, and which should be, essential. However, I wonder whether it is worthwhile in the light of the example provided by this report. I welcome the intentions of the rapporteur to counteract the overwhelming monetarist trend. However, like eve rything that can be used to counteract, hinder, or moder ate this trend, the draft report itself was overwhelmed because there was a lack of courage or ability to ensure explanatory distinctions. Instead they sought out a bland consensus which works in favour of the trend to push aside the socially essential priority of job creation. The result is disappointing. The report being debated is an inconsistent and even contradictory whole. We still do not know what the most important, central or urgent problem is. Unemployment or the lack of demand? Or is it the insufficient supply, that does not make use of resources, especially human resources? What is the primary objective or the central objective of this report? The 'massive reduction of unemployment' or 'creating conditions that favour enterprise, innovation', etc.? Or is it the difficulty of the free movement of the 'enormous volume of transnational financial capital flows and the impact of speculation on productive and commercial investment'? One fears that this resolution will leave little more than sparse affirmations to soothe the consciences of Mem- ",

CHEYSSON (PSE). - (FR) Mr President, I was told that this Parliament must express an opinion at any cost. All of a sudden the search for compromise has prevailed over a desire to define a true policy. We shall vote for the plan, but I would like to point out its inadequacies and omissions. Firstly, there is the temerity of its wording. From the outset the resolution modestly states that the economy is suffering a certain lack of demand, whereas it is clear that the dramatic shortage of demand is the main factor to blame for the crisis. So it is demand that must be stimulated and activity that must be created. The resolu tion barely dares to murmur that there is - and I quote: 'a possibility of channelling public spending towards activ ities entailing strong employment'. So what remains of industrial policy, of research policy, of development aid in the East and South or of the European growth initia tive? All these being areas in which the public authorities have to take responsibility for creating jobs and enhanc ing the degree of activity. Another shortcoming is this: In the draft resolution we recommend that the debates on GATT be concluded without mentioning the requirement to achieve a bal anced agreement and the need for a world trade organi zation. Nor do I find anything on fiscal measures aimed at reducing speculation. Nothing - and this I can hardly believe - on work-sharing, or at least on the reorganiza tion of working time - on a case-by-case basis, of course, and by agreement between the social partners. Here we are, then, a long way away from what we heard and demanded yesterday from the spokesman for the Group of the Party of European Socialists, as well as from the representatives of other groups. Quite far away, too, from what Jacques Delors told us. Has it occurred to anyone, Mr President, that tomorrow we shall be going to the electorate? An electorate, which is familiar with the situation described, with a speech as timorous as this, timorous to the point of appearing insipid? I do not believe it. HERMAN (PPE). - (FR) Mr President, Members of the House, in the resolution presented by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy in the Donnelly report, and which the main political groups have undertaken to support, the European Parliament, damping its electoral preoccupations, has succeeded in silencing its divisions to support the main lines of the policy sketched out in the Commission's White Paper. It is that, above all, that I would like to remember, more so than the inadequacies, which were also noted by our group in other respects. We have not been able, each one of us, to present our ideas as to how the crisis can be resolved. It is much more difficult to achieve a two-page consensus in Parliament than in a document drawn up by commissioners, assisted by the best European experts, who - being a so-called all-party body - are supposed to reach a consensus more easily than we can. Of course, we also feel a certain dissatisfaction regarding the text, but - on the whole - the important part of the message is that we shall emerge more easily and effec tively from the crisis if we coordinate our efforts. In the light of the disunity among the various governments, that is the message that must be sent out. Faced with a sceptical public opinion regarding the national govern ments and European institutions, Parliament and the Commission must together send out the message that there is a future, but that this future is not entirely rosy, that there is no miracle solution, that in various areas we will have to proceed in stages, make new attempts and, finally, explore new paths. That is what the resolution means. Of course, it does not go far enough in some areas, but that is the price of our political consensus. (Applause) LALOR (RDE). - Mr President, it has taken record levels of unemployment to awaken the European Union to the fact that there is enormous disquiet among the citizens of the twelve Member States about their future. Where there is unemployment among men and women in Ireland or France, Germany or Greece, the sense of frustration, alienation and hopelessness is the same. For years we have spoken of the Community, and now the Union, as one of the great economic forces of the world, the land of milk and honey. Now that is all going sour because the decision-makers would not listen to or deliberately ignored the extent of the growing unemployment crisis around them. I want to reiterate that the single most important problem facing the European Union is unem ployment which is now expected to reach a record level of about 18 million people unemployed. Each and every single unemployed person represents an economic loss to the Union. The families of the unemployed, often forgot ten in the equation, are also deprived of their right to expect a decent standard of living and a decent way of life. The cost of maintaining the very fabric of our social welfare system is put at serious risk by the utterly unacceptable trend of increasing unemployment. Increas ingly, the sense of the world as a global village is turning into reality. What happens in the economies of the United States and the Pacific Basin countries has an immediate impact on our traditional trading patterns. We cannot survive in isolation from the. We must compete or lose even more of our market share. The close relationship between economic growth and that of job creation has been clearly established. Periods of high growth in output have always been accompanied by relatively large employment increases and we must at all costs translate high growth into new and sustainable jobs. Finally, we must recreate the incentive to work, to increase productivity and to provide employment as an essential part of creating the growth we need in Ireland. To translate recovery into jobs, I urge the Commission to reach an early decision on the structural fund programme presented by the Irish Government. TONGUE (PSE). - Mr President, I hope this debate will be reported in national newspapers, because it is a crucial message we are sending today which must reach citizens and especially our national politicians, namely that in an interdependent global economy we in the European Union gain mutual economic strength if we coordinate our macroeconomic policies. To listen to national finance ",
        "2.12.93 Debates of the European Parliament No 3-439/51 TONGUE ministers you would think that to coordinate policies was a weakness and a loss of sovereignty. Unemployment affects 18 million of our citizens and poverty is affecting 50 million. It is a human tragedy but also an economic tragedy. Unemployment and poverty impoverish the whole economy through lost revenue and purchasing power. The poor do not have resources to buy goods and services that keep others in work. All macroe conomic policy should have as its aim job creation and the reduction of poverty. Low interest rates and low inflation have had pride of place up until now, and yet we are still in recession and the cohesion of our societies is under threat. It is time to reorder priorities. Public and private invest ment is urgently required in our economic and social infrastructure. Houses, public transport, research and development, education, childcare: Member States' obsession with reducing budget deficits obscures the need to invest in these areas. Investment here will create jobs and, very importantly, underpin and support econ omic recovery and growth. Industry and commerce require a highly developed infrastructure if they are to compete. I would like to mention just one area: childcare. It is often forgotten as an important infrastructure issue. Childcare serves our children well and if we invest in it, we will be investing in higher achievement gained by our children later in life which will enhance our economic prosperity. It enhances women's ability to get training and work, and society gains from their skills. But very importantly, childcare is a labour-intensive area of activity. National strategies for example in the United Kingdom could create thousands of jobs which would pay for themselves in the long term. This Parliament must join with the Commission through this resolution today and call most strongly for a change of course by finance ministers. SPECIALE (PSE). - (IT) Mr President, I believe that it is very important that the Donnelly report focused on work and unemployment as a fundamental problem in the Community. This is very important. If this central impor tance is not acknowledged, then we will not be acting in harmony with the citizens of Europe and Europe will be straying from public sentiment. If we are unable to provide a convincing response rooted in solidarity at Community level, then every country will go its own way without - and against the interests of- the Community. If the Community is seen merely as a ruthless judge appealing to the market and seeking to cut budgets and aid without proposing anything in its place, then the outcome can be nothing short of the alienation and breakdown of the Community. This could lead to the emergence among us of many little Robespierres who delude themselves into thinking they can ensure the survival of their own country by cutting off their neigh bour's head. Such an approach leads only to nationalist and localized tendencies. The recognition of unemploy ment as a central problem forces us to understand why we are in this situation. At the heart of the matter is a crisis concerning several models that have been followed and several different approaches to economic policy. Unless we change, these approaches will not be able to combat unemployment and the crisis. So why, in periods of major expansion, has Europe not created any - or very few - jobs? Why, despite the fact that wages last year rose less than productivity, has this not been reflected either in growth or employment? Bringing back the old policies and the old recipes is a mistake. The document contains proposals which I agree with. I believe, in particular, that we must stimulate non-material investment, research, training and infrastructure. However, the central problem, in a nutshell, is how to create activities and new job opportunities within the context of a new and different economic policy, while at the same time concentrating on the quality of work. In short, our problem is how to rediscover and re-invent work and place it at the centre of our attention. FLYNN, Member of the Commission. - Minister Presi dent, first of all I would like to thank all those who have contributed to the debate and say that note has been taken of all of the major points that have been made. The Commission of course attaches great importance to the adoption of the broad guidelines on economic policy of the Member States of the Community, as required by the Treaty on European Union, Article 103. This exercise will allow the Community to make a quantum leap in the effectiveness of its economic policy coordination. In effect, these guidelines will constitute the reference for the drafting of the individual convergence programmes and for the assessment of their implementation. They will allow, if the need arises, specific recommendations to be addressed to individual Member States. The first application of the provisions of the Treaty is very important for two specific reasons. Firstly, as the first implementation of the new procedure, it will have an impact also on the way the exercise will be carried out in the future. Secondly, it represents the translation into operational policy recommendations of the macroecon omic part of the White Paper on growth, competitiveness and employment. The Commission appreciates that the calendar imposed by the procedures laid down in the Treaty forced Parlia ment to work under very difficult conditions. In the future, the Commission intends to start the process leading to the final adoption of the broad guidelines with the publication of its own annual economic report. This document will contain an assessment of the economic situation and a discussion of the available policy options. Then Parliament will be in a position to formulate an opinion, which the Commission will consider when drafting the recommendations for the guidelines. The present Commission recommendations call for two remarks of importance. Firstly, the guidelines are an exercise distinct from the White Paper, but the two are completely consistent. The actions suggested in the forthcoming White Paper can only be implemented successfully in a macroeconomic framework such as the one resulting from these guidelines. Secondly, contrary to the impression that some have gathered, the frame work document which the Commission adopted on 10 November is consistent with the recommendations adopted two weeks later. There is no change of direction, and in fact the framework document continues to consti tute a more detailed exposition of the ideas which are in the guidelines. Regarding the policy content of the guidelines as pro posed by the Commission, given the sharp deterioration in the unemployment situation and the forecast medium- term failure to significantly address this problem, the guidelines recommendation focusses attention on firstly, ",
        "No 3-439/52 Debates of the European Parliament 2.12.93 FLYNN stopping the upward trend in the jobless total and second ly, setting in place the policy framework necessary to reduce unemployment substantially in the medium to long term. The Commission notes with pleasure that Parliament shares its position that the present poor employment/unemployment performance of the Com munity constitutes a central economic policy problem. The size of the task before us, as has been stated by the President of the Commission, is emphasized by the fact that if unemployment is to be cut substantially, say from the present rate to half the present rate by the year 2000, then of course 15 million new jobs will have to be created in this society. And the quest for stronger employment creation requires an appropriate strategy for both macro- and microeconomic policy. The Community needs an explicit exposition of the broad guidelines to be followed in the key areas of monetary policy, budgetary policy, labour market policy and structural adjustment. We think the challenge is a dual one. Firstly, to act decisively to support growth in the short term and secondly to create the proper conditions which would permit stronger employment-creating growth to be generated in the medium to long term. Finally, Mr President, confidence factors are critical in igniting the recover process. Lower interest rates certain ly will be an instrument to boost short-term prospects, creating the conditions for further substantial reductions in interest rate demands. Essentially, the present and expected budgetary and wage developments must be kept in line with the authorities' stability objectives. And here again there is an identity of views between Parliament and the Commission. We call for right policies to be put in place now, we feel we have accumulated the necessary analyses and information to do the job, and we are going to lay out the policy changes both economic and social that will bring about the statistics that we would like to see at the end of this century. PRESIDENT. - The debate is closed. The vote will take place at 12 noon. 4. Refugees in the Middle East PRESIDENT. - The next item is the report by Mrs Braun-Moser, on behalf of the Committee on Develop ment and Cooperation (A3-370/93) on the proposal from the Commission to the Council (COM(93) 503 - C3- 344/93) for a decision on the conclusion of a Convention between the European Economic Community and the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (UNRWA) concerning aid to refugees in the countries of the Near East. BRAUN-MOSER (PPE), rapporteur - (DE) Mr Presi dent, this is the Eighth Convention between the European Union and the UNRWA designed to provide financial assistance for the Palestinian refugees and their families in Jordan, Syria, Lebanon and in the occupied territories of the West Bank and Gaza. You yourself mentioned the urgency of the situation, and indeed the first funds are meant to start flowing by January, for the people in question are particularly vulnerable. Some of them still live in tents in camps and in emergency accommodation, and what is more have probably for years felt pawned or treated like a political football. Their integration or return to those areas from which they fled, is more necessary than ever. In particular, the people who left their homes in the 1948 or 1967 waves of refugees urgently need our help. Here too, as for previous conventions, we have invested the resources earmarked in the financial protocol for UNRWA activities primarily in the education and health sectors. To my mind, the main thing is to prevent the educational opportunities open to these people from being reduced any further. We hope that our special measures in favour of mothers and children will prevent families from being destroyed any further. Food aid must be promoted, and not be provided in too short a supply. The food required will be purchased at local markets or in other developing countries, so we will actually be pro moting the local markets too. The UNRWA Convention coincides with a new phase in the Middle East, which will supposedly be characterized by peace. We have a unique opportunity to actually encourage peace. As a result, I would ask you to go along with all the amendments and approve the budget line, in which we have already allocated commitment appropria tions to the tune of the tidy sum of ECU 50 million. These resources can already be made binding for three periods, and the total at stake is ECU 93 m. BELO (PSE). - (PT) Mr President, the Israeli-Palestinian joint declaration says that the two parties will examine the economic situation in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, and will emphasize the need for a rapid improve ment in the economic conditions of the Palestinians living there. It is in this respect - as well as with respect to the resolution on the Peace Agreement recently approved by this House, and in view ofthat fact that yesterday Yitzhak Rabin told us here in this House that peace could not be imposed - that the Braun-Moser report, which gives a positive and urgent opinion of the EEC-UNRWA Con vention, stands out. In the meantime, Tuesday's events in the Gaza Strip demonstrate that today it is not merely a question of development aid for the education and health of popula tions living in refugee camps: the political aspect of the situation is at least just as important as social and economic support. This leads us to draw two conclusions concerning the Commission's action. Firstly, in so far as we should not limit ourselves to providing several tens of millions of ECUs to UNRWA action, we should not give up the political content which shapes this support and action in the current situation. Let us not forget that the forces against peace are mobilizing young people - especially those who live as refugees and who therefore are not socially integrated - through strikes in schools. Secondly, given the political importance of each gesture at this juncture, we are amazed that the Commission, using the legal basis invoked, should hesitate or back pedal in the face of greater involvement on the part of the European Parliament. We believe that this fear when confronted with the most symbolically political body of the Union augurs badly for an understanding of what is currently happening in the - still - occupied territories, and especially in the refugee camps. FLYNN, Member of the Commission. - Mr President, in the context of over four decades of seemingly intractable ",
        "2.12.93 Debates of the European Parliament No 3-439/53 FLYNN problems in the Arab/Israeli conflict one fact stands out: with over 2.5 million refugees and amid all these tensions the Palestinian society has been able to maintain its strong separate identity and not crumble under the social, political and economic stress. This owes much to the Palestinian determination to survive. But I firmly believe that without the organic link, the social, educational and health services, and the jobs that over more than 40 years have been provided by the United Nations RWA, this determination would have been put to perhaps an over whelming test. Over this period there has been no other organization linking together refugees in five fields over four countries and providing them with the basic neces sities. The European Community recognizes the crucial impor tance of UNRWA. This is reflected by the fact that the Community and its Member States provide over 43% of the agency's total budget. It is also reflected by the care and sympathy with which all the UNRWA's appeals and special projects are examined and by the considerable degree of study and discussion that the Community devotes to the present and to the future of the refugee question. Since 1972 the European Community assistance to UNRWA has taken place in the framework of three-year conventions clearly defining its conditions and goals. The convention covers all five fields of operations. Aid was initially limited to food aid. In 1982 it started covering education and from 1990 on it covered health programmes as well. In addition to contributions to UNRWA's normal budget, the Community has sup ported emergency operations in Lebanon and the occu pied territories. This has included substantial amounts for emergency and additional food aid such as the contribu tion of 6,000 tonnes of flour for the Gaza Strip decided on by the Community in December 1992. Furthermore the Community has contributed to UNRWA's development programme in the occupied territories. The projects undertaken cover scholarships, the new vocational training centre in Gaza, physiothera py, garbage collection and support for UNRWA's techni cal department for infrastructure projects and the shelter rehabilitation project. A new general hospital for the Gaza Strip in Khan Yunis is being built by UNRWA with European Community funding. The hospital's construc tion will show the population of the Gaza Strip that their plight is in our minds and will provide desperately- needed jobs and hospital beds. The Community has also approved a project to fund feasibility studies for a master plan for the environment in the Gaza Strip which includes planning for a comprehensive sewage scheme. A new convention between the Community and the UNRWA is being discussed here today. This new con vention will cover the period from 1993 to 1995. Under the levels of support of the educational and health programmes they will be expanded. The proposed text indicates a cash contribution towards the cost of UNRWA's education and health programmes of ECU 30m for 1993; ECU 31m for 1994 and ECU 32m for 1995. In the framework of the health programme, UNRWA will introduce a maternal health and family- planning programme. Because of this expansion, the new convention will significantly increase the Community contribution to United Nations RWA's regular and expanded programmes thereby addressing in an impor tant way the urgent appeal formulated by the Commis sioner General to all donors in March of this year. The entry into force of the Maastricht Treaty will make it necessary to change the Convention's legal basis and rather than Article 235 of the Treaty, it now must be Article 228 paragraphs 2 and 3, sub-paragraph 1 in relation to Article 130w. The new Convention responds to the United Nation's RWA's need as they have been expressed during the negotiations between the Commis sion and the United Nations' RWA. Let there be no doubt about the decisive support that the Community has given and continues to gives to this agency whose day-to-day contributions to easing the tensions in a highly volatile area cannot be sufficiently praised.

        "No 3-439/54 Debates of the European Parliament 2.12.93 LE CHEVALLIER LE CHEVALLIER (DR). - (FR) Madam President, Members of the House, anti-racism has become the major imposture of the end of the 20th century in Europe. It embodies the last incarnation of the left and of the far left aimed at keeping hold of the voters who have deserted their ranks and, following the failure of the communist ideology, finding another galvanizing objective to replace the class struggle. Happily, the peoples of Europe are no fools. The election results in Europe, and particu larly in Italy, are proof of this and will consign the professional anti-racists to the dustbins of history. No, Members of the House, there is no such thing as racism. It does not exist in France, except in the imagina tions of some of our colleagues - yesterday's fellow travellers, and today's agents of disinformation and subversion. As proof just look at the survey carried out by the weekly magazine L'Express, published on 16 Sep tember 1993. When asked the question: 'Do you feel happy in France?', 92% of legal migrant workers answered 'yes', and 6% answered 'no'. When asked another question: 'How do you assess your relations with the French?', 87% of migrant workers answered that they were rather good. Upon reading the results of such a survey, who will believe that racism is the total evil which is undermining French society, when the migrant workers themselves give such overwhelmingly positive responses regarding France? Indeed, the number of racist acts committed in France between 1991 and 1992 fell from 51 to 28, out of a total of 4 million crimes or offences perpetrated each year in France. There, too, the facts are damning for the anti-racists, who are merely out to denounce national sentiment, to destabilize nations and create divisions and hatreds between national, reli gious or ethnic communities. Take care, Members of the House, lest tomorrow's Europe - like the Lebanon - become a battleground for ethnic or religious confronta tions, through our own fault. (Mixed reactions) NORDMANN (LDR). - (FR) Madam President, I would like to make two observations. Firstly, the survey quoted by Mr Le Chevallier was extremely interesting. It shows that living in France is good because the friends of Mr Le Chevallier are not in power, a situation that must contin ue. My second observation is this: I would like to thank Mr Van Outrive for responding to the appeal I made yester day, as a result of which we have come up with a resolution, including the amendments that were adopted, and which I hope and believe the entire Assembly will be able to adopt with conviction and without any trouble. And, once again, now that we have arrived at our final debate of this term of Parliament on such an essential and sensitive topic, I believe that the virtual unanimity that we will be able to achieve is a good thing, and I would like to thank all those who have cooperated to make it possible. GOLLNISCH (DR). - (FR) If racism did not exist, then it would have to be invented, for it is the only doctrinal bond between the disparate groups comprising the major ity of this Assembly. As Mr Dillen put it excellently yesterday, we bear no grudge against foreigners. We find the idea of bearing a grudge against someone because of their race, roots, nationality or religion deeply repulsive, but we do bear a grudge against the many leading politicians and economists who allow them to become established among us in defiance of the rights and aspirations of the indigenous peoples that we represent. This new religion has its inquisitors and its witchcraft trials. Is this, as Chesterton put it, a Christian idea gone mad? No, for the alliance of stateless capitalism and international socialism corresponds too well to the inter ests of various groups on the look-out for underpaid pairs of hands in industry, or in search of new members or voters. Every occupation has its collaborators. The peo ples of Europe will judge our attitude severely. And your sons will judge your attitude severely, just as the sons of the national socialists severely judge those of their fathers. ELLIOTT (PSE). - Madam President, it is absolutely vital that this Parliament should be doing what it is doing today in supporting a resolution that condemns racism in outright terms. We must stand up and be counted on this issue. We must not appease racism. I want to say two things. Firstly we need to stress - and I am sorry it is not stressed enough in the resolution - the positive benefits of a pluralistic society. I am happy to live in and to represent such a pluralistic society and I assure you it is a great place to be. Secondly, I want to say this to the extreme right represen tatives here and to others who think like them. Remember this. Everybody is the potential victim of somebody else's racism. If we are not prepared to stand up for and defend the rights and the freedoms of others how can we expect that they will defend our rights when we may need their help. Racism disfigured this Community in the earlier years of this century. We must never allow it to do so again. (Applause) PRESIDENT. - I give the floor to Mr Le Chevallier on the basis of Rule 108 of the Rules of Procedure. LE CHEVALLIER (DR). - (FR) To Mr Nordmann I would like to say that if the survey in L'Express makes it appear that France is not at all racist, then I believe this to be thanks to the presence of the Front national, which enables many people to hope that, thanks to the Front national, the serious problems which will arise through immigration will be resolved. Consequently, this inter pretation is diametrically opposed to his, but I believe I am the one who is right. CAUDRON (PSE), in writing - (FR) With this explana tion of the vote, I in turn would like to express my deep concern faced with the rise of racism and forms of fundamentalism, xenophobia and caricatures of national ism, with unstaunched anti-semitism and the verbal and physical abuse perpetrated by fascists and neo-fascists. So, at the same time, in order to face up to this, we must staunch unemployment and idleness, which serve as a breeding ground for racism, the 'beast' that will not die, and fight - both politically and legally - against those who serve as vehicles for these ideas. ",
        "2.12.93 Debates of the European Parliament No 3-439/55 CAUDRON Everything is linked together: a plan for employment and against unemployment, social policies which promote integration and rule out exclusion, the punishment and pursuit of more or less well camouflaged racists of all kinds. Europe must realize that it is at a watershed. We need the broadest possible Union in favour of employment and against exclusion, racism and xenophobia. That is why I support the demands, actions and positions adopted which point in this direction, hence the resolution which is today being put to the vote by this House. EFREMIDIS (CG), in writing. - (GR) Almost 10 years have passed since the problem of racism and xenophobia were last dealt with officially by the Community. In 1985, the European Parliament set up the first Committee of Inquiry into Racism and Xenophobia, and in 1986 we had the first joint declaration by the Community's three political and institutional bodies. However, not only was the problem not dealt with, but over the past two years we have witnessed an especially dangerous and worrying upsurge and spreading of the problem. Of course, this kind of problem does not arise of its own accord. It is accompanied and incited by the uncontrolled activities of organized neo-Nazi and neo-fascist groups. I believe it is obvious to any fair-minded and democratic person that even frequent proclamations by the official bodies of the Community or from the governments of the Member States no longer suffice. Rather, what is needed is a demonstration of a genuine desire to restrain and eliminate the phenomenon, a desire which can no longer be expressed merely by taking specific measures at Community and national level. As the European Parliament has already proposed, we believe that intervention through Community legislation is necessary. The Community must intervene directly with legally binding action that would unequivocally condemn the phenomena of racism, xenophobia and fascism. Such intolerant actions, the incitement to such actions, and the tolerance of racist actions would be recognized as punishable offences, and effective sanc tions would be provided for those who break the law. Of course, the police and the legal authorities of the Member States which are tackling the problem most vigorously - under the responsibility of their governments - must take a serious look at the problems involved in actually applying this legislation, since the provocative lethargy displayed towards those who inspire violent racist and fascist activities is playing a major role in the current renaissance of these phenomena. In addition, we feel that in this connection we will need to use mechanisms of intergovernmental cooperation for internal and legal relations. The coordination of actions among police authorities, for example, and the attendant system of exchanging information, could be used - not to the detriment of the political and trade union freedoms of the citizens - to play an important role, since the anti-democratic action of racist and fascist groups crosses over national frontiers. At the same time, and with the same decisiveness, the Community will have to take active steps to tackle the causes which give rise and momentum to these phenom ena. The aggravation of social inequalities, the sharp rise in unemployment, the social exclusion of millions of 'new poor', the continuing deterioration of living and work conditions that will be included in the strict auster ity policy and formulae for new cuts in social spending, and the return to the Middle Ages being prepared in the celebrated White Paper as regards industrial and other relations - in the name of competitiveness and Maas tricht - are the physical basis on which racism and fascism can grow. We are asking the European Council, which is to meet in a few days' time, to reject these proposals, to jettison this reasoning - which does not offer anything positive - and to lay the foundations at Community and national level for another policy which will actually tackle workers' problems, restore the econ omy via the social guidelines, and thus tackle the roots of the problem of racism and fascism. (Parliament adopted the resolution) European Council of of 10 and 11 December 1993 (') Motion for a resolution, on behalf of the Technical Group of the European Right (B3-1664/93) on the European Council of 10 and 11 December 1993 in Brussels Explanations of vote VANDEMEULEBROUCKE (ARC). - (NL) Madam Pre sident, Members of the House, once again we have a whole series of resolutions here which the major groups have decided to vote against so that ultimately they will have no resolution. May I remind you, dear colleagues, of one of our past meetings here in Brussels, when we also failed to come up with a resolution on unemployment, at a time when 67% of all the citizens in the European Community are saying that it is the top priority? I thought that, in anticipation of the summit to be held in Brussels on 10 and 11 December, we should at least be wise enough to indicate a number of directions in which the European Parliament would like to go. Surely it cannot be the case that we meet here with all the money we spend and adopt no resolution, leaving the European summit to decide everything, only to complain later about the results achieved there. Well now, in my opinion that is unaccept able, and I believe we must say that competitive potential is indeed important. Furthermore, I believe we can say that we need a change of attitude within our society, whereby free time is extremely important. I believe we must say this: a reduction in working time - and above all the redistribution of work - is a moral duty, since we cannot simply drop an entire generation of young people. We cannot do so for the sake of our future, for which we are responsible. So here we have a missed opportunity for the second time. Everyone has come here by plane, train or whatever only to achieve no final result for the second time and complain that the European summit has hogged all the power while we proved incapable here. It is not fair of the major groups to act in this way. CAUDRON (PSE), in writing. - (FR) On the occasion of these votes I would like to express my support for the ideas championed here today by Jacques Delors, who ') For outcome of vote (Docs. B3-1659/93. B3-I660/93. B3-1661/93 and B3-1662/93): see Minutes ",
        "No 3-439/56 Debates of the European Parliament 2.12.93 CAUDRON insisted on the need and conditions for the recovery of growth which must be combined with work-sharing measures and the reduction of working time. Unemployment is fatal. It must be stopped. Time is short and democracy is in danger. We must display imagina tion and courage. Will the European Council prove capable of this? As things stand today, we might be excused for fearing that it will not, and being pessimistic as a result. Will we have to wait until there are 25 million unem ployed and 60 million poor before the national govern ments finally take account of the dangers threatening us? We cannot tolerate unemployment, but we cannot com bat it merely by stimulating the recovery of growth. Nor can we tolerate managing it by redistributing the shortage or accepting partial unemployment as the norm. Today, Parliament expects the Council to display politi cal courage, to define ambitious objectives and specify ways of fulfilling them. (Parliament rejected the motion for a resolution) Report by Mr Donnelly, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy (A3-384/93) on economic policy in the Member States and the Community Explanations of vote GOLLNISCH (DR). - (FR) Madam President, not eve rything in the Donnelly report is bad, but it sets out to square the circle: increasing demand without increasing either economic overheating or inflation, making work more flexible without prejudicing acquired social rights, and reabsorbing public deficits without desisting from major public works. In actual fact, in our opinion the true causes of the economic crisis we are currently experiencing seem to be the obsolete nature of the means of production, due partly to the corporatist opposition of the left-wing trade unions to any modernization, and partly to the use of manual workers from the Third World. Then there is also the loss of our internal market under the influence of free-tradism and relocations. Finally, there is the despoiling tax system and bureaucracy which is both paralytic and discouraging to small and medium-sized enterprises. Consequently, we must seek true remedies, first and foremost through a draconian reduction in public taxa tion. Secondly, by eliminating bureaucratic obstacles which are weighing down on the creation, management and development of enterprises. Thirdly, by adapting our educational system to the needs of the modern economy. Fourthly, through the reconquest of internal and Euro pean markets by practising the principle of Community preference, the cornerstone of the Treaty of Rome, which has been flouted for years. Fifthly, through the firm reversal of the tide of immigration within the framework of a policy of cooperation with Third World states. The truth comes out very weakly in the report by Mr Donnelly, but we doubt the capacity of the political groups forming a majority in this house to do the opposite of what they have been doing for decades. (Applause from the Technical Group of the European Right) ERNST DE LA GRAETE (V). - (FR) Madam President, the report by Mr Donnelly has become a little like a potluck party where everyone takes what they brought along in the first place. Unfortunately, this does not always make for a good soup. Let me give you an example of this. When you read paragraph 1 and para graph 2, you will see that the over-riding objective is to achieve a massive reduction in unemployment. However, at the same time, the central and most pressing problem is that the Community economy is suffering, etc. Here we have the first problem raised by the socialists and the first problem raised by the conservatives. Everyone can take what they please from this report. Under these conditions, we believe that the signal sent out is not very clear, and we shall abstain from voting on this report even though we believe that, bearing in mind the new elements which have been incorporated into it, it is already an improvement on the Commission proposals. BANOTTI (PPE), in writing. - I will vote for this report but wish to reiterate the need for greater support for and emphasis on the SMEs. Many small industries are experiencing particular diffi culties in the face of imports from countries particularly in the East and Far East where goods are produced under dangerous and deplorable conditions. The recent tragedy in the toy factory in China was not unfortunately unique. In addition to appalling working conditions those work ers are paid pitifully low wages. Moreover they pose serious competitive problems for our own industries. Our future ability to create jobs will greatly depend on the will of our young people to create their own small and medium industries, particularly in the rural and peripher al areas. We must ensure that their efforts are not hampered by others who do not respect or share our standards. DALY (PPE), in writing. - The Commission's White Paper on Mr Donnelly's report offers a serious and thoughtful response to the present status quo on unem ployment. I will support the report. My concern is that they are confined by that very status quo because the European economic scenario for the foreseeable future is different from any in the post-war period. European political leaders are prisoners of an economic arithmetic which is squeezing out political options and initiatives. The bars of this economic prison include high public sector deficits which will swallow up any 'peace divi dend' without trace, but will not address the job losses coming through as defence orders drop and operational manpower is reduced. Successive traditional economic stimuli have been slow to encourage people to spend. Democraphic trends show clearly that people are living longer. This means more money is needed for social provision for the elderly. Technological developments, whilst increasing produc tivity, have also the consequence of significant job losses so more money is needed for training etc. Meanwhile, the newly industrialized countries of the Far East have captured large slices of the world market. ",
        "2.12.93 Debates of the European Parliament No 3-439/57 DALY These factors indicate that the credible options available to the European Union are limited under the status quo. In fact, I believe the options have now become so squeezed that we must discard the strait jacket and explore a wide range of radical alternatives more appro priate to the real challenges of the 1990s and beyond. Today the wider challenges do not lie at home. The former Soviet bloc and the Third World face grave industrial agricultural, enviromental skill shortages and unemployment problems. My simple preposition is that we should marry our over-capacity in production with the huge identified shortages of manufactured inputs which exist in these places. This is not the place to produce a comprehensive shopping list but my own experience from working on the Development Committee indicates the scope for discus sions with Third World former Soviet bloc countries to produce an aid package which would provide a kickstart at both the giving and receiving end of the equation. Such a kickstart would give these countries an increase in purchasing power as their economies get off their knees. Trade and employment would, therefore, increase. In short, I believe a 'Marshall Plan' of this kind is what is needed in the 1990s. DILLEN (DR), in writing. - (NL) There is an easy answer to the question of economic policy guidelines within the European Union and its Member States. Every European people, and indeed Europe as a whole, has an obligation to conduct a policy which leads to prosperity and welfare. This presupposes there being a balance between the economy and ecology, resulting in maximum possible cultural development. National and European economic interests must be safeguarded. The first order of the day must be to provide employment for our own people first. Then, the same principle must be applied at European level: dismissal of American preten sions to hegemony; and the defense of European agricul ture and industry, where required, by appropriate, bal anced protectionist measures.
