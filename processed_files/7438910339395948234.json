        "3.3. Feed (for products of animal origin only) and raw materials (for processed products only) Raw material (meat): The raw material for making \u2018Pitina\u2019 is meat from sheep or goats or from ungulate game, limited to roe deer, fallow deer, red deer or chamois for the mainly lean part, and from pork belly and/or shoulder for the mainly fat part. The lean part must constitute meat from one single species from those listed above. Seasoning: This is a mixture of sea-salt or rock salt or a mixture of the two, along with pepper, garlic, wine and aromatic herbs; nitrites and nitrates are also used. The following aromatic herbs are allowed: juniper, caraway or wild fennel, fennel seeds, musk milfoil. Coating: Maize flour The raw material must have the following requirements: (a) colour and characteristics of the meat: lean, red meat, no covering of fat, no micro-haemorrhages or haematoma; (b) colour and characteristics of the pork belly and/or shoulder: red-pink lean meat and snow-white fat. Mechanically-separated meat is not permitted. The raw material must conform to the following percentages: Minimum Maximum Lean part 70 % 90 % Fat part 10 % 30 % 3.4. Specific steps in production that must take place in the identified geographical area All phases in the production of \u2018Pitina\u2019, from the removal of external fat from the raw material to the maturing of the product, take place in the geographical production area. 3.5. Specific rules concerning slicing, grating, packaging, etc. of the product the registered name refers to \u2018Pitina\u2019 is sold whole, either vacuum-packed or packaged under a modified atmosphere. It may only be packaged in the production area and as part of the same production process. It is necessary to limit packaging in this way in order to guarantee the product\u2019s specific characteristics. Unlike other matured products, the paste for \u2018Pitina\u2019 is not contained in a casing. The only \u2018wrapping\u2019 and protective agent is the maize flour present on the surface of the hemispherical ball of paste. Therefore, packaging the product during the production process avoids both the \u2018Pitina\u2019 losing its shape and becoming excessively hard due to being exposed to humidity and non-controlled temperatures. 3.6. Specific rules concerning labelling of the product the registered name refers to All packaging must bear the product logo and the EU symbol. The Protected Geographical Indication \u2018Pitina\u2019 must appear on the label in clear and indelible lettering, clearly identifiable from any other wording on the label; this must be followed immediately by the words \u2018Protected Geographical Indication\u2019 and/or the abbreviation \u2018PGI\u2019. 23.1.2018 EN Official Journal of the European Union C 23/9 ",
        "The product logo is shown below: 4. Concise definition of the geographical area \u2018Pitina\u2019 is produced exclusively in the Province of Pordenone, in the municipalities of Andreis, Barcis, Cavasso Nuovo, Cimolais, Claut, Erto Casso, Frisanco, Maniago, Meduno, Montereale Valcellina, Tramonti di Sopra and Tramonti di Sotto. 5. Link with the geographical area The specificity of \u2018Pitina\u2019 is based on the intrinsic properties and the originality of the product, which can be summed up in the unusual use of game, sheep or goat meat, not seen anywhere else in the Alps, and in preservation methods which, unlike other preparations based on meat, do not involve casings or a rind, but a thin layer of maize flour which, together with judicious smoking, allows the product to age and prevents it from drying out. \u2018Pitina\u2019 is produced in an area with distinctive eco-environmental conditions, which the Regional Meteorological Observatory (OSMER, 2011) has defined as \u2018a pre-Alpine enclave with a separate climate profile marked by record annual average rainfall and the frequent mixing of air masses, together with the specificity of the mountainous landscape that hosts the \u201clowest permanent snowfield in the Alps\u201d\u2019. In geographical terms the production area for \u2018Pitina\u2019 is located in three valleys \u2014 Valcellina, Val Colvera and Val Tramontina \u2014 within the mountainous region above the Western Friuli high plains, between the Tagliamento and Piave rivers. Part of the area is within the Friuli Dolomites Natural Park. This region was historically blighted by poverty, emigration and a subsistence economy in which meat was a precious commodity and pig-farming was extremely rare. Animal proteins were provided by sheep and goats slaughtered when they reached the required age, or perhaps injured or killed in ravines or, occasionally, by ungulate game hunted, in most cases, by poachers. The need to preserve what little meat was available for as long as possible, particularly during the winter, led to the development of preservation techniques which, for that matter, are common to the entire Alpine region and to northern Europe, such as smoking meat and stabilising it with pork fat. In the case of \u2018Pitina\u2019, the leftover meat, more often the less popular cuts, was roughly cut up, the fat and tendons removed, and chopped on a b oard called a \u2018pestadoria\u2019 with a heavy knife called a \u2018manarin\u2019; the mass was formed into meatballs with the addition of salt, spices (sometimes soaked in wine) and wild fennel. The meatballs (\u2018pitine\u2019) were then rolled in maize flour and smoked in the hearth (\u2018fogher\u2019 or \u2018fogolar\u2019). A series of oral testimonies collected by local historians from 1978 onwards (in the degree thesis by Renata Ventorelli entitled \u2018 La cultura popolare di Andreis e la sua valle \u2019 (Popular culture in Andreis and its valley), Urbino University, academic year 1981-1982) has led us to firmly believe that \u2018Pitina\u2019 was widely prepared and eaten in Val Tramontina and its neighbouring valleys in the early 1800s. It is also important to note the reference to \u2018Pitina\u2019 and its specific characteristics in the book \u2018 La valle del Colvera \u2019 (Mazzoli, Maniago, 1973): \u2018\u2026 Pitina was made from sheep and goat meat \u2026\u2019, as well as the more detailed description found in the book \u2018 Civilt\u00e0 contadina del Friuli \u2014 architettura spontanea e lavoro a Navarons \u2019 (Peasant life in Friuli \u2014 spontaneous architecture and work in Navarons) published in 1979: \u2018Pitina is a rolled ball (eight centimetres in diameter and three centimetres thick) of sheep, ram, she-goat, he-goat or chamois meat. The meat is boned, the external fat having been removed, and ground in a machine or by hand, then seasoned with salt, pepper and garlic and a certain amount of fat is added. The paste is mixed well and rolled in maize flour. The balls are smoked over the embers of juniper wood. The \u201cpitini\u201d can be kept in a dry place for over a year\u2019 (\u2018pitini\u2019 is the author\u2019s attempt at the plural of the name).

        "The tradition of \u2018Pitina\u2019 in Val Tramontina is mentioned in the V Comunit\u00e0 Montana \u2018 Tourist Guide \u2019 of 1989: \u2018\u2026 particular mention should be made of \u201cpatina\u201d \u2026 made of ram\u2019s meat smoked with rare aromatic herbs and spices, added skilfully, according to an old, jealously-guarded family recipe\u2019. The name \u2018Pitina\u2019 originates from Val Tramontina. The first people to produce it, according to historical evidence, were the villagers of Inglagna and Frasaneit, in the municipality of Tramonti di Sopra, and it is here that, from 1969 onwards, the Pro Loco association revived the local tradition by organising the Pitina Festival which has been held every July since then. Between 1997 and 2000 \u2018Pitina\u2019 was included in the Arcigola Slow Food\u2019s first list of endangered products, a video was produced (Pieffe immagini, Maniago, 1999), and a \u2018committee\u2019 was set up to safeguard the tradition and the recipe. Almost at the same time the product was included in the first list of traditional products drawn up by the Friuli-Venezia Giulia Region in accordance with Ministerial Decree 350/99.
