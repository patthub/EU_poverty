        "T R A I N I N G NEW SKILLS GERMANY With ESF support, Germany is dedicat- ing close to EUR 16 billion to proactive measures to meet the challenge of its ageing workforce and ensure con- tinued growth. At federal level, ESF programmes focus on getting more people into work through supporting job creation and entrepreneurship, while in the L\u00e4nder , young people, skills and education are priorities. Together, these activities are nurturing the highly skilled workers Germany needs for growth, today and for the future. AND THE EUROPEAN SOCIAL FUND THE ESF IN GERMANY: SOME EXAMPLES A helping hand The \u2018We need you\u2019 project in the Rhineland- Palatinate helped school students from migrant or disadvantaged backgrounds improve their career chances by providing a mentor during their last year in school. Through focused activ- ities, the personal mentor helped develop the students\u2019 social, emotional and cognitive skills \u2013 with the aim of smoothing their transition into vocational training. The results speak for them- selves \u2013 over half of the 821 participants went on into further training (up from 10 % previ- ously) and 30 % chose to stay in further educa- tion in school. Training without borders To help SMEs compete across borders and increase participation in transnational apprenticeships, the federal ESF programme \u2018Training without borders\u2019 is run in co-oper- ation with the Chambers of Skilled Cra(cid:2) s and the Chambers of Industry and Commerce. The programme is supporting SMEs through mobility coaches who organise work place- ments and visits in other countries for the apprentices. They also advise on vocational training opportunities and the legal and insti- tutional issues involved. Almost 90 % of par- ticipating companies fi nd the experience to be very positive and benefi cial for the company and apprentice alike. And over half intend to continue sending their trainees abroad as part of their regular vocational training schemes.

        "M I C R O - F I N A N C E NET WOR KING Germany is putting a major eff ort into expanding its workforce and creating jobs. This is because of the dramatically worsen- ing age structure of its population \u2013 already it has the highest proportion of older people and the lowest proportion of young people in its population in the EU. And with above- average employment levels, Germany is seeking workers from among those unem- ployed people who usually fi nd it more dif- fi cult to get a job \u2013 for example, immigrants, people with low qualifi cations and women with childcare responsibilities. These groups now have new opportunities: for training, for acquiring new skills, for fl exible working, and for help in overcoming the particular obsta- cles each of them faces in getting a job. Germany is modernising its education system, too \u2013 it needs more well-qualifi ed school and university graduates to take the highly skilled jobs the country\u2019s technologically advanced industries require, as well as fi lling new job opportunities in the growing fi nance, technol- ogy and service sectors. Deploying ESF funding both at the federal level and in the L\u00e4nder should also help achieve Germany\u2019s goal of having 77 % of its working-age population in a job by 2020. As part of this, it aims to fi nd work for 330 000 citizens classifi ed as long-term unemployed \u2013 which will mean fewer people living in households at risk of poverty. ESF spending in Germany For 2007-2013, Germany is receiving EUR 9.4 billion in ESF funding. With national co-funding, this brings the total ESF spend- ing on jobs to EUR 15.7 billion. The federal government is using 37 % of the ESF budget while the L\u00e4nder are allocating the remain- ing 63 % to respond to their own priorities. In general, the federal programme is focus- ing on the adaptability of workers and enter- prises and giving disadvantaged groups bet- ter access to jobs. In the L\u00e4nder , the emphasis is on improving education and skills. There is also funding for transnational projects to support cross-border training and share best practice with other Member States. INVESTING IN PEOPLE AND JOBS: THE OPPORTUNITIES FOR GERMANY Better workers and enterprises With ESF support, Germany is aiming to help 290 000 aspiring entrepreneurs start and run their own businesses. For example, the \u2018EXIST\u2019 programmes support entrepreneur- ship among universities and students \u2013 help- ing transfer new ideas and technologies into hi-tech start-ups. Likewise, the \u2018New Quality of Work\u2019 programme aims to develop more productive jobs and the workers to fi ll them, particularly among SMEs. And \u2018Founder coaching\u2019, which is a professional develop- ment programme for new business owners to help them get their companies through the diffi cult fi rst years and ensure they can grow and create jobs more quickly. In addition, the ESF is contributing EUR 60 million to the German Microcredit Fund which makes loans available to self-employed entrepreneurs who cannot easily access fi nancing from other sources \u2013 such as the recently unem- ployed, immigrant entrepreneurs and women who are starting their own businesses. More jobs for more people The focus is on more job opportunities for women, immigrants, older workers and dis- abled people, among many others. The \u2018XENOS\u2019 programme, for example, fi ghts against exclu- sion and discrimination in the labour market and promotes job prospects and integration for immigrant groups: from simple language training, to the nationwide \u2018Schools without racism \u2013 schools with courage\u2019 programme linking over 1 000 schools and 750 000 pupils and teachers in activities to embrace diversity. Similarly, the annual \u2018Girls\u2019 Day\u2019 event sees hi- tech companies and R&D organisations open their doors to over 100 000 teenage schoolgirl visitors \u2013 encouraging their interest in highly skilled technical careers. For mothers and carers, ESF funding has created 70 000 extra childcare places, enabling parents to get back to a job and better balance their work and family life obligations. Education: skills for the future ESF projects are promoting school qualifi - cations, apprenticeships for the young, life- long learning for all, and improved school environments and teaching. For example, there are over 280 projects to encour- age more apprenticeships \u2013 with more than 50 000 places created so far. And the \u2018Learning on Location\u2019 programme is helping districts and cities develop frameworks for lifelong learning, promoting it as a source of new skills and better job pro spects. While for over 400 000 young people from dis- advantaged groups, the ESF in Germany is off ering training opportunities to improve their chances of employment.
