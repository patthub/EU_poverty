On 30 January 2006 the Council adopted the revised European Partnership for Albania, based on the Commission's proposal presented on 9 November 2005. The partnerships contain short\u2013term and medium\u2013term priorities. The countries are expected to fulfil the short\u2013term priorities in one to two years. Therefore the Commission considers it appropriate to present a proposal for an updated European Partnership for Albania. This renewed European Partnership is based on the provisions of Council Regulation (EC) No 533/2004 of 22 March 2004 and takes into account the new developments as described in the 2007 Progress Report. It lists short- and medium- term priorities for the country\u2019s preparations for further integration with the European Union. In order to respond to the European Partnership, the competent authorities in Albania should develop a plan with a timetable and specified measures Albania intends to take to this end. The Commission will monitor progress in implementing the priorities regularly. The European Partnership priorities form the basis for programming the financial assistance of the Community, which will continue to be provided under relevant financial instruments, in particular Council Regulation (EC) No 1085/2006 of 17 July 2006 establishing the Instrument for Pre-Accession Assistance (IPA). The proposed Council Decision has no financial implications. In view of the above, the Commission invites the Council to adopt the attached proposal for a Council Decision. ",

        "EN 5 EN ANNEX: ALBANIA 2007 EUROPEAN PARTNERSHIP 1. I NTRODUCTION The European Council endorsed the introduction of the European Partnerships as a means to realise the European perspective of the Western Balkan countries. The proposed revised partnership updates the second one, on the basis of the findings of the 2007 Commission Progress Report on Albania. It identifies new and remaining priorities for action. The new priorities are adapted to the country\u2019s specific needs and stage of preparation and will be updated as necessary. Albania is expected to develop a plan including a timetable and specific measures intended to address the European Partnership priorities. The partnership also provides guidance for financial assistance to the country. 2. P RINCIPLES The Stabilisation and Association Process remains the framework for the European course of the Western Balkan countries, all the way to their future accession. The priorities identified for Albania relate to its capacity to meet the criteria defined by the Copenhagen European Council of 1993 and the conditions set by the Stabilisation and Association Process, notably the conditions defined by the Council in its conclusions of 29 April 1997 and 21 and 22 June 1999, the final declaration of the Zagreb Summit of 24 November 2000 and the Thessaloniki Agenda. 3. P RIORITIES The priorities listed in this European Partnership have been selected on the basis that it is realistic to expect that Albania can complete them or take them substantially forward over the next few years. A distinction is made between short-term priorities, which are expected to be accomplished within one to two years, and medium-term priorities, which are expected to be accomplished within three to four years. The priorities concern both legislation and its implementation. In view of the need to set priorities, clearly there are other tasks for Albania to complete which may become priorities in any future partnership, also taking into account future progress made by Albania.
