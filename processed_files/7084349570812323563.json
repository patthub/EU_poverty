The 2008enterprisepolicyassessment presents a comprehensive picture of policies that promote entrepreneurship and enterprise development in the Mediterranean partner countries: Algeria, Egypt, Israel, Jordan, Lebanon, Morocco, the Palestinian Authority, Syria and Tunisia. The assessment is based on the enterprise policy assessment grid, an analytical tool designed by the authors of the report in consultation with Euro-Mediterranean Charter stakeholders.The assessment measures and benchmarks progress in the 10 dimensions of the Charter: \u2022 Simple procedures for enterprises \u2022 Education and training for entrepreneurship \u2022 Improved skills \u2022 Access to finance and investment-friendly taxation \u2022 Better market access \u2022 Innovative firms \u2022 Strong business associations \u2022 Quality business support schemes and services \u2022 Strengthening Euro-Mediterranean networks and partnerships \u2022 Clear and targeted information For further information please consult the following websites: http://ec.europa.eu/enterprise/index_en.htm http://ec.europa.eu/europeaid/index_en.htm www.oecd.org/daf/psd www.etf.europa.eu N B - 30 - 08 - 581 - E N - C R e p o r t o n t h e i m p l e m e n t a t i o n o f t h e E u r o - M e d i t e rr a n e a n C h a r t e r f o r E n t e r p r i s e ",

Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development, Private Sector Development Division The OECD Private Sector Development Division brings together under one umbrella horizontal regional programmes aimed at enhancing sus- tainable growth and employment through better policy to improve the business climate. The division assists regions in developing and implementing effec- tive policy reforms to enhance investment, competitiveness and pri- vate sector development in several regions. Its programmes include the Investment Compact for South East Europe, the Middle East and NorthAfricaInvestmentProgramme,andtheEurasiaCompetitiveness Programme. The division was created to respond to the growing demand for private sector development policy advice in non-OECD economies, which in- creasingly requires a horizontal, cross-issue approach.

        "Page 5 The European Commission is keen to strengthen relations with our Mediterranean partners.We wish to fully exploit the potential of the European neighbourhood policy. This could ultimately lead to the creation of a large single market, which would create a lasting win-win situation for all partners involved. Some important steps have already been taken to enhance business opportunities and profit from exchange and mutual learning. The Euro- Mediterranean Charter for Enterprise is clearly a good example in this respect and I am very pleased that nine Mediterranean partners have sub- scribed to it. Adopted by industry ministers in 2004, the Charter is based on the model of the European Charter for Small Enterprises. An improved business environment and the promotion of entrepreneurship and small and medium-sized enterprises are not only challenges for the EU but also for our partners in the neighbourhood. It was appropriate then to share our recipes for prosperity and job creation and it is time now to look into the results achieved so far. For eight months, hundreds of organisations and people in our partner countries from the Commission and from its partner organisations have worked together to assess the progress achieved under the Charter. As a result of this remarkable cooperation the present report shows that EU enterprise policies have been a valuable source of inspiration for our Mediterranean neighbours. It proves that our Mediterranean partners are developing a strong entrepreneurial culture, which is a valuable asset for them and a precondition for successful growth and job creation. The report also underlines the importance of further close cooperation in this area.Therefore I would like to use the occasion of the presentation of this report to invite our partners to profit from the Commission\u2019s recently tabled proposals on how to best promote SMEs and entrepreneurship (the Small Business Act for Europe). Peace, stability and prosperity are objectives which the EU and its Mediterranean partners share. Vibrant enterprises, led by down-to-earth but ambitious entrepreneurs, are, in my view, a vital element in achieving these common goals.

In fact, one of the key achievements of the pilot project has been the enhancement of dialogue between governmental institutions and private sector organisations. Another is the exchange of information and experiences at the country and MED regional level. Today, private enterprises are the main engine of growth in the MED countries, progressively replacing government-sponsored investment pro- grammes and state-owned companies. Over the last three years, the MED region has experienced strong economic growth and has embarked on programmes of structural economic reform aimed at improving the business environment and facilitating enterprise development. However, the MED region still faces a number of challenges. The most pressing challenges are: generating a sufficient number of jobs to absorb the fast-growing number of young and increasingly better educated entrants into the labour market; promoting entrepreneurship, in particular among women and youth; and reducing overall unemployment. At the same time, MED enterprises need to innovate and grow to withstand the increasing level of competition arising from the process of economic integration at global, Euro-Mediterranean and regional levels. Addressing these challenges will require action on several fronts, through well-structured and targeted policy initiatives. This report provides a contribution to policy development and cooperation with the final aim of supporting enterprise development in the MED region and addressing the challenges listed above.

It provides a comprehensive overview of enterprise policy in the MED countries. The Charter was adopted by industry ministers in 2004. Since then it has been a key document guiding MED governments\u2019 policy towards the private enterprise sector. At the same time it is also a platform for Euro-Mediterranean (Euro-Med) cooperation, as the Charter has been generated within the process of Euro-Mediterranean industrial coop- erationconductedwithintheframeworkoftheBarcelonaprocess (2) .The Charter is structured in 10 policy dimensions and incorporates several features of the European Charter for Small Enterprises. ThereportisajointpublicationoftheEuropeanCommission,theOrgani- sation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) and the Eu- ropean Training Foundation (ETF), in consultation with the European In- vestment Bank (EIB) (hereinafter,\u2018the partner organisations\u2019). The report summarises the results of an eight-month assessment process started in September2007andcompletedinmid-April2008.Thereportfocuseson the evaluation of policies towards the enterprise sector elaborated and implemented by central government institutions. Whilst MED countries have been fully involved in all the stages of the exercise, the contents of the report reflect the final decisions made by the partner organisations. M E T H O D O LO G Y The assessment was instigated by the MED countries, when they re- quested assistance from the Commission in order to improve the Char- ter monitoring. The Commission responded to this request by launch- ing a pilot project that was conducted with the direct participation of MED countries in both the elaboration of the policy indicators used for the assessment as well as in the assessment phase. The methodology applied was originally developed by the OECD un- der the Investment Compact Programme for South East Europe. (This methodology was also used for the assessment of the implementation of the European Charter for Small Enterprises in the western Balkans in 2006\u201307.) Building on this experience, MED countries and partner organisations elaborated analytic indicators for each of the 10 dimen- sions of the Charter, capturing key policy features. In total, 77 policy indicators were used, forming the MED assessment grid. Five levels of policy development were defined for each policy indicator, outlining a policy development path that ranges from level 1 (no structured policy intervention in place) to level 5 (policy incorporates key elements of in- ternationally recognised good practice). According to the level of com- plexity, dimensions were divided in subdimensions. Assessment results are aggregated at dimension and subdimension level. Indicators are weighted according to their relative importance (see Annex I). The final assessment and the assignment of scores for each policy in- dicator are based on the synthesis of two distinct, albeit parallel, as- sessment processes that are based on the common MED assessment grid (see Annex I). Each country conducted a self-assessment led by a national Charter coordinator, using inputs from relevant government institutions and key stakeholders.The partner organisations completed a parallel and independent assessment, based on inputs collected by a team of local experts and supported by interviews with experts and private sector representatives. This independent assessment also com- bined data and information from international organisations, bilateral donors and other published sources. Forthepurposeofthisreport,\u2018enterprisepolicy\u2019isdefinedasasetofpol- icies and measures aimed at improving the business environment and operational conditions for enterprises.The 10 Charter dimensions cover the typical sequences in the life cycle of an enterprise, including estab- lishment, expansion, maturity and closure, as well as a wide spectrum of issues relevant for enterprise development, ranging from administrative simplification to the tax regime to human capital development. Enterprise policy is consistent with a horizontal approach to policymak- ing, seeking to improve conditions for the largest possible number of enterprises. It is therefore substantially different from vertical policies (particularly traditional industrial policies), which tend to target inter- ventions on a limited number of priority sectors or sometimes even enterprises, selected as national champions.

It does not exclude measures aimed at promoting development in priority sectors, provid- ed they are not market distorting.Traditional vertical industrial policies relyinsteadondirectgovernmentintervention,usingmeasuressuchas concessionary financing, state ownership and external protection, us- ing high customs duty and non-tariff barriers. The Charter assessment gives a good indication of the extent to which the MED countries are implementing a market-based horizontal policy approach.However,anumberofdimensionscriticalforacountry\u2019sover- allsocioeconomicdevelopment(suchaslabourmarketpolicy,corporate governance, competition and anti-corruption policy) are not covered by the Charter and therefore fall outside the scope of this report. The distinction between horizontal and vertical enterprise policies is highly relevant to the MED region. Most of the MED countries conduct- ed active vertical industrial policies for decades \u2014 in several cases up to the 1990s \u2014 before moving to a horizontal policy. Egypt, Algeria and Syria followed vertical industrial policies. Jordan, Morocco, Israel and Tunisia retained only limited elements of a traditional industrial policy and were among the first to move away from this approach. Lebanon andthePalestinianAuthority,foranumberofreasons,neverintroduced traditional industrial policy measures. The Charter assessment, therefore, measures how much countries ap- ply policies that are different from traditional enterprise policies. The assessment thus shows the extent to which countries are bringing their policy approaches closer to that of the EU, setting the stage for further opening their economies in view of the establishment of the Euro-Med free trade zone targeted for 2010. K E Y F I N D I N G S A N D CO N C LU S I O N S The main conclusion of this report is that the process of convergence towards the policy guidelines set in the Charter is advancing in the MED region.However,convergenceismovingmorerapidlyinsomecountries than others. For instance, progress has been most notable in Egypt, Jor- dan, Morocco and Tunisia, countries that over the last five years have increasingly adopted a horizontal policy approach and systematically improved the business climate. Lebanon and the Palestinian Authority have made less marked progress, largely due to the consequences of armedconflictandpoliticalinstability.InAlgeriaandSyria,thetransition from traditional industrial policy to a horizontal enterprise policy is at an early stage. The economies of these countries are largely dependent on the hydro-carbon sector while private enterprise remains underde- veloped. However, both countries have started to introduce elements of enterprise policy and to recognise that private enterprises \u2014 and particularly SMEs \u2014 should progressively take a leading role in driving economicdevelopment.Therecentincreaseinoilandgasrevenuesmay provide the resources to move faster in the policy transition; however, it may also have the opposite effect, lifting the pressure to reform. Israel is the only MED country that has reached levels comparable to those of most OECD countries in terms of per capita income, economic structure and policy development, particularly in the areas of innova- tion and availability of risk capital through venture capital funds. How- ever, the assessment has highlighted that there are still areas open to improvement, such as regulatory reform and human capital develop- ment. From a regional perspective, the assessment shows that most of the MED countries have been relatively successful in developing policy tools to promote enterprise creation, as in the cases of the develop- ment of the microfinance industry in Morocco, and the Social Fund for Development in Egypt. A number of good practices have developed in several MED countries that could be extended to other countries in the MED region. This is a good start, but much remains to be done to ef- fectively promote and support entrepreneurship, in particular among women and young graduates, filling the gap in this area in relation to other fast-growing emerging economies. The MED region has also been relatively successful in improving com- panyregistrationprocedures,buttheMEDcountriesareonlystartingto tackle administrative barriers to enterprise development. The results are more mixed in relation to support to high-growth en- terprises. Skill development is at a very early stage. Innovation policy is also only incipient in most of the countries. Even in the best performing countries in this policy area (such as Egypt andTunisia), innovation pol- icy is just now evolving from pilot projects into structured intervention. However, nearly all the MED countries have developed industrial mod- ernisation processes over the years that in most cases have been quite successful, providing the basis for launching more advanced policies. Having completed this first pilot assessment, the partner organisations and the national Charter coordinators believe that the next step is to address the policy areas where the need for improvement is urgent. Those areas have been highlighted in the\u2018Way forward\u2019section of each country chapter in Part III of this report. At the level of the MED region, prioritiesare:humancapitaldevelopment(education,trainingandskills improvement), access to finance, access to markets, and innovation. K E Y F I N D I N G S P E R P O L I C Y D I M E N S I O N Dimension 1: Simple procedures for enterprises Dimension 1 is made up of three policy subdimensions: institutional framework for enterprise policy, better legislation and administrative simplification,andcheaperandfasterstart-ups.InmostoftheMEDcoun- triesthebuildingblocksofacomprehensiveenterprisepolicyframework are now in place. However, interministerial policy coordination is still generally weak and there are outstanding issues regarding clear assign- ments of tasks and competencies in enterprise policy elaboration and implementation among economic ministries and government executive agencies. Finally, no country in the MED region has adopted a compre- hensive enterprise development strategy \u2014 although Egypt incorpo- rated many elements of an enterprise policy strategy in its 2005 indus- trial development strategy. Israel, Egypt and Morocco have made most progress in this subdimension, while the Palestinian Authority, Algeria and Syria have a relatively weak enterprise policy framework. Enterprises in the MED countries still face cumbersome laws and regulations. Across the entire region, regulatory reform is at an initial stage of development, although a number of countries have launched targeted programmes. However,onlyEgyptandIsraelhavelaunchedcomprehensiveregulatory reformprogrammes.Regulatoryimpactanalysisonnewlegislationisnot practisedintheMEDregion.Companyregistrationprocedureshavegen- erally improved across the region, with significant cuts in the cost and time required to obtain a company registration title. A number of coun- ",
        "Page 17 tries (Egypt, Jordan, Morocco, Tunisia, Lebanon) have developed \u2018one- stop-shops\u2019, although there are variations in terms of configuration and scope. Syria, Algeria and the Palestinian Authority still have problematic company registration procedures. Israel also needs to further improve its performance on company registration and develop a one-stop system. Dimension 2: Education and training for entrepreneurship While education and training are increasingly recognised as key contrib- utors to competitiveness in all MED countries, learning systems generally lack the policy thrust required to ensure strategic inputs into an entre- preneurial economy.The objective of Dimension 2 is to encourage those countries participating in the Charter to develop and promote entrepre- neurial leaning, in a lifelong learning perspective, as a central pillar in the wider effort to promote competitive economies. \u2018Entrepreneurial learn- ing\u2019referstoallformsofeducationandtraining(bothformalandnon-for- mal),includingwork-basedlearning,whichcontributetoentrepreneurial spirit and activity, business creation and employability development. Two lines of development should be considered for Dimension 2. \u2022 Develop a policy partnership with strategy building involving edu- cation, employment and industry ministries, as well as employers, workers and other non-government interest groups.This would en- courage the education system to promote entrepreneurial attitudes (such as creativity, autonomy and risk-taking) and entrepreneurial- specific skills (such as book-keeping and business planning).Tunisia isafrontrunnerinthisareaandmayoffergoodpracticetobeshared with other MED countries. \u2022 Raise awareness that the entrepreneurial mind-set should be devel- oped as a key competence particularly in all compulsory education levels.The understanding of the concept and potential of entrepre- neurship as a key competence (as well as its implications for the overall system in terms of curriculum development, teacher training and school management) is required for all countries in the region. Dimension 3: Improved skills Workforcecompetenciesshouldberegularlyimprovedandthetraining market continuously developed to ensure that the manpower require- mentsofcompaniesaremet.Improvedcompetenciescannotonlypro- motetheestablishmentofnewbusinessesandensuretheirsurvivalbut can additionally promote the growth of businesses, reinforcing com- petitiveness and access to international markets. There is a lack of data on enterprise training, including start-ups and expanding business. In order for the participating countries to move forward on Dimension 3, systemic data developments should be considered. A regular and com- prehensive survey of the enterprise community to track training needs and training take-up, as well as to determine current and future skill needs, could improve policymaking and the targeting of resources. Another area of development is training for enterprise growth. Given well-developed practice on training for expanding enterprises (particu- larlyinEgypt,Israel,Jordan,MoroccoandTunisia),aknowledge-sharing framework would give all countries access to information on policy toolsandfinancingarrangements.Theframeworkwouldenableamore developed impact assessment for the region, by bringing together the network of national bodies involved in the training effort, co-working through peer learning on areas of common development interest. Dimension 4: Easier access to finance and investment- friendly taxation The \u2018access to finance\u2019 component of Dimension 4 is made up of two subdimensions: credit environment and financial facilities for en- terprises. Across the MED region, there has been more progress in developing financial facilities for enterprises than in improving the credit environment. Asset-backed bank lending is the main source of external financing for enterprises. However, collateral requirements are generally very high. Access to (and reliability of) information from cadastres is limited in many countries.With the exception of Israel and Tunisia, credit information services are not yet fully developed. But mostoftheMEDcountrieshaveestablishedcreditguaranteeschemes, some of which operate in partnership with commercial banks (Jordan, Morocco, Tunisia and Egypt). Microfinance facilities are also well de- veloped in a number of MED countries, such as Morocco, Egypt, Israel and Lebanon. Access to capital markets for SMEs is still problematic and the availability of risk capital is very limited. However, Egypt, Mo- rocco andTunisia have made gains in this area, while Israel has a com- petitive venture capital industry. Syria, the Palestinian Authority and Algeria need to focus on improving access to finance, while Tunisia should increase its efforts in improving its credit environment. The tax policy assessment has been hampered by a lack of information. Therefore, it has not been possible to assign country scores. As a gen- eral remark, governments in the region have not yet applied systematic methods of evaluating the tax regime and the tax compliance require- ments imposed on small and medium-sized companies. Dimension 5: Better market access Dimension 5 includes three policy subdimensions: a proactive trade pol- icy, simplification of procedures for international trade, and agreements on conformity assessment and acceptance of industrial products (ACAAs). Few countries in the MED region (Israel and Egypt) have a national export strategy. However, most have established government export agencies andexportpromotionprogrammes.Thelevelofregionaltradeintegration \u2014 measured by the number of intra-MED free trade agreements (FTAs) in place \u2014 has recently improved. But implementation of the main regional FTAs is at an early stage. Egypt, Jordan, Morocco and Tunisia are more ad- vanced in terms of regional trade integration, while Algeria is the least in- tegrated. International trade procedures are becoming simpler across all the MED countries (moving fast in Egypt, Israel and Tunisia and lagging in Algeria). In preparation for the ACAAs, significant efforts are needed in legislative alignment and strengthening of the institutional framework. Dimension 6: Innovative firms The assessment framework on enterprise innovation includes four in- dicators: development of a strategy on enterprise innovation and re- search and development (R & D); government action to link firms to ",
        "Page 18 technology and research centres, and promote inter-firm cooperation; support for innovative firms; and support for business incubation. In all MED countries, policymakers recognise innovation as a source of long-term prosperity, and most countries have taken steps to establish components of an innovation system.These efforts have tended to con- centrate on creating linkages between business and university, develop- ing business incubators, upgrading human capital and implementing a range of enterprise-level technology upgrading ( mise \u00e0 niveau ) pro- grammes, some of which have a sector-specific focus. Most MED coun- tries possess innovation and technology centres (Egypt and Morocco stand out in terms of institutional strength in this area) although across the region the number, sophistication and track record of these institu- tionsvaryconsiderably.However,withtheexceptionofIsrael,MEDcoun- tries have yet to take a significant position on the global stage as sources of technological innovation. While all MED countries have launched ini- tiatives on research and innovation, the volume of investment in R & D is limitedfortheregionasawhole;andinsomecasesthedevelopmentofa comprehensive innovation strategy is still incipient (including the Pales- tinian Authority, Lebanon and Syria). Dimension 7: Strong business associations Dimension 7 is made up of two subdimensions: public\u2013private con- sultations, and networks and business associations. All MED countries have introduced practices of public\u2013private consultations. However, practices vary considerably in terms of institutional framework, fre- quency and degree of transparency. Israel, Palestinian Authority, Egypt, Morocco and Tunisia have adopted relatively well-developed consulta- tion mechanisms. Public\u2013private consultation practices in Algeria and Syria are largely formal, but the consultation mechanisms are evolving. Private sector organisations in the MED countries are gaining strength in terms of advocacy and ability to provide services to their members. The largest private sector organisations are the chambers of commerce and industry and manufacturers\u2019/employers\u2019 organisations. However, the more established the institution, the higher the risk that it repre- sents the insiders \u2014 well-connected, dominant companies. Private sec- tor organisations are strong in Israel, Egypt, the Palestinian Authority, Morocco andTunisia; they are relatively well organised in Lebanon and Jordan, but have still limited advocacy functions in Algeria and Syria. There are signs of networks of entrepreneurs operating in new and high-value sectors, of women entrepreneurs and young entrepreneurs in several MED countries. Dimension 8: Quality business support schemes and services TheassessmentframeworkforDimension8oftheCharterincludesfour indicators designed to capture the various business support schemes available throughout the MED countries. It underlines the need for ac- cess to support for new entrepreneurs and start-ups (typically family- run, micro- and small enterprises in the MED region), and the provision ofservicestoestablishedfirmswithgrowthpotential.AllMEDcountries have programmes to help small firms overcome problems associated with market failures in the provision of services, and thus target spe- cific populations, such as the Moroccan Moukawalati programme sup- porting youth entrepreneurship, the Palestinian Authority programme targeting women entrepreneurs and Israel\u2019s 28 small business develop- ment centres, which operate with local minority communities. Business establishment support centres (usually industrial parks or zones) aim to upgrade enterprises with growth potential, such as the upgrading pro- grammes of mise \u00e0 niveau in Tunisia, Morocco and Algeria, and indus- trial zones in Jordan, Israel, Egypt and Syria.There has been substantial technical and financial assistance in all MED countries to develop a full range of services for start-ups and established companies (for example, in Lebanon the Industrial Modernisation Centre helps facilitate access to finance). However, there is still an information gap as programmes are not widely advertised. Furthermore, there is a paucity of monitor- ing and evaluation tools to evaluate the effectiveness of programmes which are consuming sizeable resources. Dimension 9: Strengthening Euro-Mediterranean networks and partnerships The assessment framework comprises three indicators. These look at networks and partnerships in place between businesses and between business service providers, and assess whether they are embedded in a broader strategy for enterprise development. They also assess their sustainability, their upscaling prospects, the range of sectors covered and the extent of Euro-Med connections. The assessment shows that some experience has been accumulated at Euro-Mediterranean level in networking and partnerships between businesses and between business service providers, often with donor support. Yet it reveals that there is much scope for using networks and partnerships in more strategic, sustainable and ambitious ways, for bet- ter exploiting pilot projects and previous results, and for learning from successful experience across the Euro-Mediterranean area. Dimension 10: Clear and targeted information for enterprises TheassessmentofDimension10ismadeupoftwoindicators:tradition- al channels of information (such as government gazettes) and online information. There is a significant need across the region to improve the quality of information for enterprises and to make it more acces- sible by bundling sources of information, especially online. Information lacks detail, reliability, updates, accessibility and usability. Egypt, Israel, Morocco and Tunisia have made the most substantial efforts to tackle these problems, namely through interactive websites, government agencies and in some cases even Internet portals or networks of infor- mation centres.

( 5 ) In the tables, the following abbreviations are used for the MED countries: AG, EG, IS, JO, LE, MO, PA, SY,TU; and for the regional average: MED. The objective of this report is to assess progress in implementing the Euro-Mediterranean Charter for Enterprise (hereinafter\u2018the Charter\u2019) (3) in the EU Mediterranean partner countries and territories (hereinafter\u2018MED countries\u2019). The Charter is seen by the MED countries as a key instrument to guide reforms in enterprise policy. It provides guidelines on 10 policy dimen- sions (4) relevant for the development of the private enterprise sector. Its structure and contents are modelled on the European Charter for Small Enterprises, a European Union (EU) document defining policy guidelines in the area of enterprise and small and medium-sized enterprise (SME) development, adopted in the framework of the Lisbon agenda to improve cooperation on enterprise policy issues within the EU and between EU Member States. The report covers the MED countries that have endorsed the Charter: Algeria, Egypt, Israel, Jordan, Lebanon, Morocco, the Palestinian Authority, SyriaandTunisia (5) .ItcontainsananalysisofthelevelofimplementationforeachoftheCharter\u2019s10dimensionsatregionallevel,andanevaluation of the performance of each country and territory in implementing the Charter\u2019s policy guidelines, based on a common set of indicators. The report focuses on the evaluation of policies for the enterprise sector elaborated and implemented by central government institutions. It does not review policy measures taken by local administration and non-government institutions to support private enterprise development, although those institutions play an important part in policy elaboration and delivery, particularly towards the small enterprise sector. The report is structured in three parts: \u2022 Part I contains the introduction, background and methodology, as well as an overview of the key economic and social data for the Mediter- ranean partner countries. \u2022 Part II contains an assessment of the degree of implementation of each of the 10 Charter dimensions, with an analysis of trends and key issues, and comparisons of the different countries and territories. \u2022 Part III presents profiles of all the MED countries, highlighting strengths and areas for improvement in policy design and implementation. Introduction ",
        "Page 22 One of the aims of the Barcelona process, launched in November 1995 and reinforced in 2004 by the European neighbourhood policy, is to build a Euro-Mediterranean region of shared prosperity through an economic and financial partnership and the gradual establishment of a free trade area.The Euro-Mediterranean free trade area, to be complet- ed by 2010, will cover the EU, Turkey and the EU\u2019s nine Mediterranean partners: Algeria, Egypt, Israel, Jordan, Lebanon, Morocco, the Palestin- ian Authority, Syria andTunisia. To meet the goals of the Barcelona process, the MED countries en- gaged in industrial cooperation with the EU. Industry ministers adopted the Euro-Mediterranean Charter for Enterprise at the Euro- MediterraneanMinisterialConferenceonIndustryheldinCaserta,Ita- ly,inOctober2004.ByendorsingtheCharter,Mediterraneanpartners committed to use it as a tool to implement microeconomic reforms and to boost the competitiveness of their enterprises, with the aim to attract higher levels of domestic and foreign direct investment. Following the adoption of the Charter, all MED countries established in- stitutional structures to implement the Charter, led by a national Char- ter coordinator (senior governmental representative from the Ministry of Industry, national SME agency or equivalent). In 2006, the European Commission issued a regional progress report on the implementation of the Euro-Mediterranean Charter for Enterprise on the basis of national reports produced by Mediterranean partner countries. The report described recent developments and examples of good practice. It compared strengths and weaknesses in the Euro- Mediterranean region (hereinafter \u2018MED region\u2019), and formulated rec- ommendations on next steps. At the Sixth Euro-Mediterranean Ministerial Conference on Industry in Rhodes, Greece, in September 2006, Industry ministers decided to pro- ceed with the Charter implementation. The national Charter coordina- tors sought the European Commission\u2019s help to improve the planning, monitoring and evaluation of the Charter implementation. They called for a more systematic and analytical tool to track policy developments and identify gaps in policy elaboration and implementation at the na- tional and regional levels.When the MED national Charter coordinators met in Berlin on 6 June 2007, they agreed to launch a pilot project for an in-depth evaluation of government policies for the 10 dimensions of the Charter in the MED region. In response to the MED countries\u2019request for assistance, the European Commissioncameforthwithaprocessandamethodologyalreadytest- ed for the assessment of the implementation of the European Charter for Small Enterprises in the western Balkans (6) in 2006\u201307. The Com- mission invited the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Devel- opment (OECD), the EuropeanTraining Foundation (ETF) and the Euro- pean Investment Bank (EIB) (hereinafter \u2018the partner organisations\u2019) to participate in an assessment of the implementation of the Charter in the MED region, building on the western Balkan experience. In September 2007, experts from MED countries, in cooperation with the partner organisations, developed a Charter implementation as- sessment grid to measure progress on the 10 dimensions of the Euro- Mediterranean Charter for Enterprise and composed of a common set of policy indicators. In October 2007, the assessment grid was adopted by the Working Party on Euro-Mediterranean Industrial Cooperation and the assessment was launched.

        "Page 23 The Euro-Mediterranean Charter implementation assessment grid and the assessment methodology The assessment grid is designed to provide the MED governments with a tool to monitor the implementation of their policy towards the en- terprise sector, based on the policy guidelines presented in the Char- ter. The grid allows governments to assess the level of implementation within each dimension covered by the Charter and across the spectrum of the 10 Charter dimensions. The grid makes it possible to identify strong and weak points in policy elaboration and implementation, as well as inconsistencies within and across policy dimensions. Govern- ments can use the results for policy planning, allocating resources and structuring the policy dialogue with stakeholders and donors. At the MED regional level, the Charter assessment could help to iden- tify common priorities, exchange experience, learn from each other\u2019s activity and introduce elements of peer pressure. However, it must be made clear that the purpose of this pilot project at the MED regional level is not to rank countries by level of performance. The MED region covers countries with very different economic structures, institutional configurations, endowment of natural resources and economic policy approaches. A number of MED countries embarked some years ago on a reform process to improve the business environment, and developed tools, schemes and institutions to support this process. Others have launched this process much more recently, hampered by major politi- cal and budgetary constraints, armed conflict and political instability, or the legacy of a centralised and planned economy. It is therefore not prudent to compare performances across countries without taking into account those considerations. Box 1: Steps in the Charter assessment process 1.

        "Page 24 T H E A S S E S S M E N T G R I D The assessment grid blended the structure of the Euro-Mediterranean Charter for Enterprise with an assessment approach developed by the OECD for evaluating the European Charter for Small Enterprises in the western Balkans. The framework has been fine-tuned to reflect the conditions of policymaking in the MED countries (7) . Theassessmentgridisstructuredalongthe10dimensionsoftheEuro- Mediterranean Charter for Enterprise. Within the assessment grid, most policy dimensions are further di- vided into subdimensions that capture the critical themes of policy development. Each subdimension consists of a set of indicators, rep- resenting key and detailed policy features. For instance, Dimension 5 (better market access) includes three subdimensions: implementing a proactive trade policy, simplification of procedures for international trade, and agreements on conformity assessment and acceptance of industrial products (ACAAs).The subdimension ACAAs, for example, is then further broken down into six detailed policy indicators. For each indicator, five levels of policy development have been defined, outlining policy development paths that range from level 1 to level 5. At level 1, there is no structured policy intervention, only limited ad hoc measures; at level 2, pilot projects have been developed, but there is not yet a consistent policy approach; at level 3, there are the basic ele- ments for adopting a consistent policy approach (legislative framework completed, relevant institutions established), but policy implementation has not yet started; levels 4 and 5 correspond to an increasing degree of implementation/enforcement. In particular, at level 5, policy practices are largely in line with internationally recognised standards and good prac- tices.Toattainlevel5,acountryshouldshowstrongevidencethatpolicies are widely implemented, monitored and independently evaluated.Where countries are clearly in transition between two levels, or where the actual situation combines elements of two levels, a half point is attributed. THE CHARTER ASSESSMENT PROCESS The final assessment and the assignment of scores for each policy in- dicator have resulted from the synthesis of two distinct but parallel assessment processes, based on the common assessment grid. Each country conducted a self-assessment, using inputs from the rel- evant government institutions and key stakeholders for each policy area. This process was led by the national Charter coordinator. The partner organisations completed in parallel an independent assess- ment, using inputs collected by a team of local experts (and support- ed by interviews with public and private sector representatives) and combining data and information from international organisations, bilateral donors and other published sources. In particular, UNIDO and the Commission delegations in the MED countries provided valuable inputs and logistic support in completing the independent assessment. Other valuable inputs were provided by the OECD Mid- dle East and North Africa Investment Programme. The OECD, in close consultation with the Commission, coordinated the independent as- sessment and elaborated the final synthesis between the two assess- ments.The ETF directly conducted assessments for Dimensions 2 and 3 (education and training for entrepreneurship, and improved skills), while the EIB participated in the assessment of the\u2018Access to finance\u2019 component of Dimension 4. Finally, the Commission (Enterprise and Industry DG) formulated the external assessment for the ACAAs\u2019sub- dimension and for Dimension 9 on Euro-Mediterranean networks and partnerships.

        "W E I G H T I N G O F T H E I N D I C ATO R S To improve the presentation of results of the assessment exercise, scores have been aggregated at the level of subdimension and dimen- sion. In order to do so, a weight has been assigned to each indicator, according to its perceived importance in relation to enterprise policy development. The same process has been repeated for the subdimen- sions. The weights have been assigned through a process of consulta- tion between the four partner organisations and the national Charter coordinators. The weighting system ranges from 3 (most important) to 1 (least important). The final score assigned to each policy dimension is therefore calculated as a weighted average of subdimensions and indicators (8) . L E S S O N S L E A R N E D F R O M T H E P I LOT P R O J E C T A strong point of the process is that it is based on a participative ap- proach, where the methodology and each step in its application have been elaborated and completed with the direct participation of the Charter coordinators and endorsed by the main policy stakeholders in the MED countries. Due to this close consultation it has been possible to reach a consensual synthesis of the results of the two parallel assess- ment exercises that reflects the views of the partner organisations as well as the national Charter stakeholders in all the nine participating MED countries. However, the partner organisations are well aware that the pilot project has yielded a number of lessons. \u2022 The transformation of qualitative indicators into quantitative scores involves a significant degree of approximation and discretion, as policies do not always evolve in sequence and the indicator descrip- tions are necessarily general and incomplete, in order to fit very dif- ferent country situations. \u2022 While the collection of data and information on the legal and insti- tutional framework for each policy dimension does not generally present significant measurement problems, the evaluation of the status of policy implementation for a number of indicators, particu- larly in relation to levels 4 and 5, is very difficult in the absence of independent evaluation exercises, statistical data and/or company surveys.The impact of government policies is even more difficult to evaluate: it has been impossible to conduct such surveys and ex- tensive data collection on policy implementation within the scope of this pilot project. However, partner organisations and Charter coordinators plan to address this issue for a selected number of pri- ority dimensions. Initial steps have been taken to cooperate with UNIDO and other organisations to complement the Charter assess- ment with the collection of data and information at the company level. \u2022 There is a shortage of comparable statistical data on the structure and the sectoral specialisation of the enterprise population. In ad- dition, the available data do not reflect the full picture of enterprise development, and particularly SME and micro-, small and medium- sizedenterprise(MSME)developmentintheregion,asinmanyMED countries a considerable number of enterprises operate in the infor- mal sector of the economy. \u2022 Finally, although the 10 dimensions of the Charter cover a good spectrum of the policy areas that affect enterprise development, a number of other highly important policy areas, such as labour market, anti-corruption, competition and trade, are not included. The Charter assessment is a pilot exercise that needs to be comple- mentedbyotherpolicyassessmentsinordertoformafullycompre- hensiveviewofthestatusofprivatesectordevelopmentintheMED countries.

        "1.1. Introduction Complex procedures and heavy regulatory compliance requirements stiffen enterprise growth by diverting resources from the creation of value-added activities to non-productive ones. The burden of complex procedures is disproportionally higher on small companies than on large ones, as administrative and managerial resources are scarcer and costs cannot be spread over a large turnover. Over the last few years policymakers, as well as economists and man- agement experts, have turned their attention to how to rationalise and improve the efficiency and quality of the regulatory framework. This trend is not limited to OECD and EU countries. Governments in emerg- ing economies have also understood the importance of regulatory re- form, thanks to a new stream of analytical research and benchmarking exercises. The MED economies have been well known in the past for the complex- ity of the regulatory environment and for the high barriers imposed on new market entrants. The themes of enterprise policy and regulatory reform are relatively new to the MED region, but over the last few years there has been noticeable progress as presented here below. However, regulatory reform cannot be looked at in isolation. To better understand the direction of reforms in the MED region, this assessment must begin by looking at broad policies for the development of a com- prehensive enterprise policy framework. 1.2. Assessment framework The assessment framework for Dimension 1 of the MED Charter in- cludes three subdimensions. Each is related to a critical block within the domain of enterprise policy, moving from a broad policy perspec- tive to the area of legal and regulatory reform and simplification, and finally focusing on specific instances of reform, such as company reg- istration. The first subdimension covers the main features of the country\u2019s en- terprise policy framework. It provides a picture of the institutions that guide government policy towards the enterprise sector, examining their roles in policy elaboration, implementation and monitoring, while reviewing policy coordination mechanisms and looking at the setting established in strategic documents. The second subdimension looks more specifically at government ac- tion in the broad area of regulatory reform and regulatory simplifica- tion.The analytical indicators review the role of the institutions leading the regulatory reform process and the strategic approach adopted by the MED countries. A set of three indicators captures the main policy options available to government, progressing from a simple review and rationalisation of existing laws and regulations to a more radical approach aimed at substantially reducing the number of existing laws and regulations. The last indicator looks at whether new legislation is subject to regulatory impact analyses. Dimension 1: Simple procedures for enterprises Page 31 ",
        "Page 32 The third subdimension deals specifically with measuring performance in the process of company registration, de-registration and business closure. This area has been extensively reviewed, following the work conducted by theWorld Bank with its annual DoingBusiness report.The subdimension combines a range of indicators constructed specifically forthisexerciseandanumberofindicatorstakenfrom DoingBusiness (9) . Thepurposeistocoverindetailthethreemaincomponentsofthebusi- ness establishment process, from incorporation-registration to notifica- tion and compliance. 1.3. Analysis E N T E R P R I S E P O L I C Y F R A M E WO R K Enterprise policy encompasses a wide spectrum of policy dimensions and covers all the sequences in the company life cycle: from establish- ment to expansion, maturity and company closure. The population of companies in most countries is extremely differentiated in terms of business size, sector specialisation, location, legal form and ownership structure, etc. In order to be effective, enterprise policy has to be both comprehensive (operating simultaneously on a number of dimensions and reaching the widest number of enterprises) and targeted (in order to address specific issues). In other words, an effective policy should be broad enough to have an impact on macroeconomic targets (such as value-addedandemploymentgeneration),butspecificenoughtoinflu- ence company behaviour. It is up to the government and stakeholders to find the right mix between broad policy measures (such as changes in the standard corporate tax rate or the elimination of general licens- ing requirements) that aim to improve the operational environment for the largest number of companies, and targeted measures addressing specific market failures (such as the introduction of credit guarantee schemes for some categories of SME, schemes supporting innovation and entrepreneurship training programmes). Therefore, clear assignment of mandates, missions and tasks to gov- ernment institutions as well as an advanced level of interministerial coordination are essential for good standards in policy elaboration and implementation, and the right policy mix. A strategic document that defines medium-term targets for private sector development and the enterprise policy strategy needed to reach those targets will help en- sure consistency in government policy, secure consensus around gov- ernment action and send clear signals to private enterprises on the di- rection of policy.The enterprise policy strategy should be elaborated in close consultation with representatives of the key stakeholder groups. It should be endorsed by the government and be consistent with and complement other strategic government papers, such as industrial or innovation policy strategies.Well-developed public\u2013private sector con- sultation mechanisms are vital for the quality of the overall enterprise policy. The analysis of the institutional policy framework is therefore closely connected with that conducted in Dimension 7 of the Charter. The institutional policy framework in the MED countries is highly differ- entiated,duetodifferentgovernmentandconstitutionalstructures,and policy practices. For some of the MED countries, such as Algeria and Syr- ia, the concept of enterprise policy is relatively new, as these countries had traditionally placed an emphasis on vertical, sector-based policies. For a number of years other countries, such as Jordan, Israel, Morocco andTunisia,havedevelopedhorizontalpoliciesinparallelwithmoretra- ditional sector-based policies, while the Palestinian Authority and Leba- non have never placed an emphasis on traditional sector-based policies. Egypt, traditionally a bastion of vertical policy, started to change course in 2004 and adopted a comprehensive horizontal policy approach. Thescoresontheinstitutionalframeworksubdimensionbroadlyreflect these dividing lines.

        "Page 33 enterprisepolicyhasjuststartedorisnotyetcompleted,thedelegation of responsibility and the assignment of tasks and mandates are not yet well defined. This creates scope for overlapping of competences and potential policy inconsistencies. By taking this approach, the MED countries could be divided into two groups. \u2022 The first group is made up of countries with a relatively well-devel- oped institutional policy framework, in terms of delegation of re- sponsibilities, policy coordination, enterprise development strategy and task assignment.This group includes Israel, Egypt, Morocco,Tu- nisia and Jordan. \u2022 The second group is made up of countries with an institutional policy framework still in the initial phase of evolution, with open is- sues about policy coordination and assignment of tasks. This group includes Algeria, the Palestinian Authority, Lebanon and Syria. In both groups the weakest point is interministerial policy coordination. In Egypt, policy towards the private sector is driven by two key min- istries, the Ministry of Trade and Industry and the Ministry of Invest- ment, as well as a special purpose institution, the Social Fund for De- velopment, which is in charge of developing and implementing policy towards micro- and small enterprises. Each institution supervises the activity of a number of executive agencies. In particular, the Ministry of Trade and Industry is responsible for sectoral policies, but also for a number of horizontal policies, such as innovation and Euro-Med coop- eration, and plays a major role in steering the national competitiveness programme. There are no institutionalised mechanisms of policy coor- dination (besides high-level coordination conducted by the Cabinet of the Prime Minister), but there is in practice a significant level of cooper- ation. Across-the-board participation at the level of executive agencies ensures programme coordination. A similar situation prevails in Jordan where the Ministry of Industry andTrade is preparing an industrial pol- icy that includes provisions for all of the specialised executive agencies. Egyptistheonlycountryintheregionwhichhaselaboratedsomething close to a comprehensive enterprise policy strategy (the 2005 industrial development strategy) with significant private sector inputs. Though its name emphasises its industrial orientation, the strategy covers a number of policy areas specific to enterprises, such as competitiveness, innovation, human capital development and regulatory reform. In Morocco, the Ministry of Commerce and Industry is responsible for SME policy as well as the implementation of the new sectoral develop- ment plan. Policy coordination is ensured at high level by the Ministry of Economic and General Affairs, and by a number of interministerial committees and commissions. Tunisia has a similar governance struc- ture, with a high-level National Commission for Investment chaired by the Head of State, in charge of setting policy guidelines and monitoring the achievement of policy targets. Israel has traditionally adopted a pragmatic approach to enterprise policy, focusing on specific programmes, seeing government interven- tion as temporary and directed to addressing specific market failures. Consequently, Israel never developed a multi-year comprehensive pol- icy strategy. However, the Ministry of Industry, Trade and Labour uses yearlyworkplanstosetpolicytargetsandagendasfortheimplementa- tion of enterprise policy measures. In Algeria, a country belonging to the second group, policy competen- cies for private sector development are split between the Ministry of Industry and Investment (responsible for the implementation of the national industrial policy and investment promotion) and the Ministry of SMEs and Handicrafts. Policy coordination is conducted at a high level but there is large scope for improvements. The scores for Lebanon and the Palestinian Authority largely reflect the stalemateingovernmentactivitycausedbyarmedconflictandpolitical instability. With regard to enterprise policy strategy, Morocco and Tunisia have gonefarinsettingpolicyguidelines,butthesearereflectedinanumber ofgovernment-endorseddocumentsandnotinasinglestrategypaper. Algeria, Syria andTunisia operate all on the basis of five-year economic plansthatincludeelementsofaprivatesectorreformagenda.However, the accent, in the case of Algeria and Syria, is very much on achieving quantitative targets and outlining investment plans, while in Tunisia quantitative targets are complemented by qualitative objectives.

This requires ac- tion on several fronts (legislative, institutional and organisational) over a number of years and affects a considerable number of economic sectors. Legislative and administrative simplification is the outcome of regulatory reform. Policy coordination plays a considerable role, as does political commitment. As stated in the Charter, an effective way to work towards a high-quality business regulation environment is to structure government intervention based on a medium-term strategy, reinforced by a solid in- stitutional framework and supplemented by regulatory assessment tools. Although still very much in its infancy, regulatory and administrative reform is gaining momentum on the regional enterprise policy map, most evident in the recent efforts made to smooth company registra- tion procedures throughout the region (11) . Israel\u2019s efforts to simplify enterprise legislation and administrative pro- cedures revolve around several targeted strategies led primarily by the Ministry of Finance in cooperation with the Ministry of Industry, Trade and Labour and the Ministry of Interior. For example, in August 2005 the government established an interministerial committee to which private sector representatives were invited. The aim was to come up with a strategy for the simplification of business licensing. Tunisia has also made good progress within this subdimension. A number of laws and provisions have been passed and several special units have been put in place to simplify administrative procedures, overlooked by a high-level coordination body at prime ministerial level. To date, in 80 % of the cases, administrative authorisations have been replaced by general requirements. While Morocco has no enterprise sector simplification strategy, since 1999 it has examined 750 procedures and simplified 200 which affect enterprises. Lebanon and Jordan have a solid institutional framework in place for legislative and administrative simplification, but it is not explicitly targeted to enterprise policy. In Jordan, this gap could be filled through the enterprise strategy that is currently under way. In Lebanon, the Ministry of Economy and Trade, the Office of the Min- istry of the State of Administrative Reform and the Ministry of Finance have cooperated to simultaneously work on the review and simplifica- tion of current legislation. Redundant pieces of legislation and regula- tion have been identified, yet limited efforts have been made, with the exception of company registration. In Syria, the Ministry of Local Administration is drafting a new law on the streamlining of procedures in local administrations. Furthermore, the Ministry of Industry\u2019s current five-year plan contains a chapter on revising business regulations, and the Commission is embarking on a project with the same focus. The business environment is still heavily regulated, but these projects could bring some tangible benefits.

This type of analysis greatly im- proves enterprise-related policy instruments and avoids unnecessary legislation and regulations. Yet despite these benefits, systematic cost-benefit analysis is rarely ap- plied to draft enterprise legislation in the region. In fact, Egypt is the only country with concrete plans to apply comprehensive cost-benefit analyses to new enterprise legislation. Within the Errada programme (see box above), a forthcoming pilot project called the\u2018Regulatory im- pact assessment development strategy\u2019will provide a clear-cut type of cost-benefit analysis for enterprise legislation. ( 11 ) Company registration is covered in the next section of this report.

        "In Israel, although there is no law in place, there is an ongoing and sys- tematic practice of conducting cost-benefit analysis on new enterprise legislation and regulation. C H E A P E R A N D FA S T E R S TA R T-U P A N D C LO S I N G The simplification of company registration procedures is a specific application of legislative and regulatory reform. The formal process of establishing a business entails three main phases: \u2022 the delivery of a company registration title, or incorporation act where the process leads to the establishment of a new legal entity, by an assigned public authority; \u2022 the notification of the establishment of a new company to various branches of the central and local public administration (e.g. the tax administration, employment and labour agencies, customs admin- istration, the office of statistics, etc.) and the delivery of company identification numbers; \u2022 the compliance with national and local laws and regulations; these vary according to the nature of the business activity and compliance is certified by the delivery by the relevant public body of licences and permits. The performance of the business establishment process is measured in terms of time, steps and costs required to complete each of the three mainphasesandtheentireprocess.Goodpracticeinthisareaistomini- mise time, steps and costs, aiming at lowering entry barriers and allow- ing the entrepreneur to concentrate time and resources in the develop- ment of its business activities instead of dealing with the requirements of the public administration. In Australia, the most advanced country in this area according to Doing Business 2008 (12) an entrepreneur can complete the entire business establishment process in just two days, with just two steps and at a very minimum cost.

In addition, the government concentrates on improving the performanceofthemostcommonformofbusinesslegalconfiguration. Entrepreneurs are interested in the performance of the overall process from the preparation of the documentation to the starting of business activity. It is therefore vital that governments and business associations work together to identify and address barriers and inefficiencies in the business establishment process.

The difference between this set of indicators examining time, steps and costs and the indicators in the previous paragraph is that this set includes data on procedures and fees of government agen- cies as well as private professional service providers. The picture that emerges from this last set of indicators is that registra- tion procedures for limited liability companies are rather cumbersome in most of the MED countries. In addition, if we compare the DoingBusi- ness analysis of the business registration process for each of the MED countries with the data collected through this assessment process, it appears that, at least in the case of a limited liability company, the bulk of the registration process costs are associated with the payment of professional fees (notaries and lawyers), and are often justified by the complexity of the documentation requirement. However, according to Doing Business the overall trend in the MED countries is towards a reduction of overall time and costs associated with the registration pro- cess, with countries like Egypt leading the overall reform process and Jordan improving the operation of its one-stop-shop. O N E-S T O P-S H O P (O S S) A well-experimented solution to improve the overall efficiency of the pro- cess is to establish a network of one-stop-shops through the country.

Today the process of company registra- tion, obtaining a certificate for the simplest type of legal entity can be completed online in a matter of minutes. The MED region presents several examples of OSS configurations. Tu- nisia has taken the lead, establishing its first OSS unit in 1989. Under theOSSsystemallthecentralandlocalgovernmententitiesinvolvedin the company registration certificate (and in most cases the operational licences for ordinary business activities) are together in one location. The entrepreneur can complete the sequence of registration, notifica- tion and compliance in a matter of a few hours and leave the OSS with all the necessary authorisations to start operations. SimilarsystemsareinplaceinEgypt,JordanandMorocco.Egypt,besides the standard court registration procedure, offers different registration options according to company type and size. For instance, medium and large-sized companies can complete company registration procedures withtheGeneralAuthorityforInvestment;microenterprises,ontheother hand, use the registration structure of the Social Fund for Development. Lebanon has recently revamped its company registration system, with the assistance of the International Finance Corporation (IFC). Prior to this, it was costly and time-consuming (as shown by the DoingBusiness indicators). A noticeable innovation has been the use of the network of post offices to process the business registration application \u2014 intro- ducing at the same time a single-teller solution and avoiding the estab- lishment of a dedicated network of company registration offices. Algeria, Syria, and the Palestinian Authority have introduced schemes to facilitate company registration, but they have not yet established a fully-fledged OSS. In Algeria, entrepreneurs who intend to apply for government fiscal incentives to promote new investments can com- plete the registration and application procedure all at once at the in- vestment development centres established by the Ministry of Industry and Investment and operated by the Algerian National Investment Pro- motion Agency (ANDI). A similar system exists in Syria, where special registration facilities are available only to companies established in the government-sponsoredindustrialzones.Israelhasrecentlysetupanin- terministerial group to redesign and simplify the company registration system, featuring particularly long notification procedures. The Pales- tinianMinistryofNationalEconomyisplanningtofurthersimplifycom- pany registration, as part of the process of introducing a new harmo- nised company law that will apply equally to theWest Bank and Gaza. \u2018Silence is consent\u2019, a system to enforce reasonable processing times to the public administration, is currently applied only in Egypt, and in some cases in Tunisia. A system of online registration is only available inTunisia, on an experimental basis, while Egypt and Israel are currently working on system development. 1.4. Synthesis The analysis indicates that the MED region is improving the policy and regulatory framework. However, progress has been uneven across the three subdimensions covered in Dimension 1 of the Charter and across the MED countries. Progress has been more limited in the critical area of building a well- structured and coherent enterprise policy framework. In particular, ac- tions are needed in several countries (Algeria, Jordan, the Palestinian Authority and Syria) to clarify the delegation of responsibilities among ministries and agencies. Coordination among ministries and govern- ment agencies, a critical element for an effective enterprise policy, re- mains another weak point in several MED countries and should be the target of major efforts all across the region. However, there have been positive developments in the establishment of institutions and agencies in charge of the implementation of specific Box 3: Company surveys Company surveys are a useful tool to evaluate policy impact.

The MED region is building a solid institutional base and moving up on the learning curve of how to structure and manage a wide range of enterprise support programmes. Legislation and regulations for enterprises are still cumbersome in the MED region. All countries should conduct a systematic review of their business legislation and regulations, by applying tools such as the Guil- lotine Review. Cost-benefit analyses are another tool that can improve the regulatory environment for enterprises in the long term. Only Israel conducts cost-benefit analysis of new enterprise legislation and only Egypt has concrete plans to do so in the near future. Looking at the average score for Subdimension 1.3 and the main find- ingsoftheanalysisconductedabove,itcanbeconcludedthatcompany registrationproceduresareimprovingacrosstheMEDregion.InTunisia, Egypt, Israel, Jordan, Lebanon and Morocco, registration is no longer a major barrier to business establishment for the most common type of business configuration. Algeria, Syria and the Palestinian Authority still have ground to catch up. As demonstrated by the cases of Egypt and Lebanon, progress may be quite fast if the government is determined to cut through the web of regulations and procedures, and if it is willing to adopt flexible and innovative solutions, in addition to being ready to invest in information technology (IT) infrastructure. However, there are indications that procedural entry barriers remain quite high and company registration procedures for limited liability companiesrelativelycumbersomeandcostly.Inparticularseveralstud- ies indicate that the main obstacles rely on obtaining licences and per- mits. This is a complex area and so far there have been very few cross- country performance surveys. 5.0 4.0 3.0 2.0 1.0 0.0 A l g e r i a E g y p t I s r a e l L e b a n o n J o r d a n M o r o c c o P a l e s t i n i a n A u t h o r i t y S y r i a T u n i s i a Figure 3 : Dimension 1 overall scores ",

Introduction With increasing interest in the contribution of education and training to the competitiveness agenda, the Euro-Mediterranean Charter for Enterprise puts considerable emphasis on the potential of education systems to more directly contribute to the competitiveness drive. The objective of Dimension 2 is to prompt policy improvements (including concrete measures) within the participating countries with the aim of contributing to more entrepreneurial young people, more enterprising workers and a more robust entrepreneurship culture. More specifically, the Charter poses a succinct question: how can education better foster entrepreneurship? It is this question which lies behind five pilot indica- tors formulated in September 2007 by a group of experts (educators, policymakers, representatives of enterprise) from the nine countries participating in the Charter. In elaborating the five indicators, experts drew on proposals and re- commendations from a number of EU policy areas: \u2022 lifelong learning: entrepreneurship to be addressed at all levels of the education system, including non-formal learning (see be- low) (14) ; \u2022 entrepreneurship key competence: the potential for the education experience to develop the mind-set, traits and attitudes of young people conducive to more entrepreneurial behaviour (15) ; \u2022 policy partnership: the need for a policy framework comprising all key stakeholders (public and private sectors), supported by national strategies against which priority actions can be devel- oped (16) . This chapter discusses the outcomes of the assessment for the five in- dicators. It closes with concrete recommendations which the countries could consider to bring forward developments on entrepreneurship education and training. 2.2. Assessment framework The five indicators addressed: (a) the policy framework for entrepre- neurial learning; (b) entrepreneurship promotion in lower secondary education; (c) entrepreneurship promotion in higher secondary educa- tion;(d)disseminationofgoodpracticeinentrepreneuriallearning;and (e) non-formal entrepreneurial learning (17) . While each of the indicators was considered as a separate unit in the assessment, taken as a pack- age,thefiveindicatorshadaggregatevalueinprovidingafirstreviewof the national entrepreneurial learning effort. In particular, the indicators examined the links between policy and practice. P O L I C Y F R A M E WO R K F O R E N T R E P R E N E U R I A L L E A R N I N G The policy indicator seeks to provide a comprehensive policy framework to support lifelong entrepreneurial learning. The rationale behind the in- dicator is that any effort to promote an entrepreneurial society requires inputs from all levels and forms of education and training (formal and non-formal).Thisrequiresdialogue,recognitionandsequencingbetween the various contributors involved in a country\u2019s learning system.The indi- cators\u2019descriptors foresee a number of concrete steps. These allow for a phased development of a comprehensive policy environment, involving strategy building, planning, implementation, monitoring and evaluation of the entrepreneurial learning effort. Given its emphasis on both formal and non-formal learning, and its bridging of policy and practice, this in- dicator is critical to the Charter\u2019s multi-constituency community in each country (policymakers, education and training practitioners, enterprises). It also acts as a driver for the remaining indicators within Dimension 2. LOW E R S E CO N DA RY E D U C AT I O N The rationale behind the indicator for entrepreneurship promotion in lower secondary education (ISCED 2) (18) is founded on the premise Dimension 2: Education and training for entrepreneurship ",
        "Page 40 that \u2018entrepreneurship, or certain facets of it, can be taught\u2019 (19) . The indicator emphasises the promotion of entrepreneurship as a key competence. Unlike more specific entrepreneurship skills (e.g. book- keepingorbusinessplanning),theentrepreneurshipkeycompetence comprises a subset of competences and attitudes: creativity, oppor- tunity identification, risk assessment and risk-taking, and resource management \u2014 all of which are considered important traits of an en- trepreneurial character. The indicator aims to generate understand- ing and application of the key competence concept in compulsory level education. The important issue here is that the entrepreneur- ship key competence is not developed through a specific subject in the curricula or by a specific teacher. Rather, the existing curriculum (e.g. geography or mathematics) is adapted to draw out the key cog- nitive and behavioural elements of the entrepreneurship key compe- tence (e.g. creative thinking, opportunity-seeking behaviour). As the challenge is considerable, the indicator foresees a phased roll-out of curriculum adjustments and teacher training across lower secondary education. U P P E R S E CO N DA RY E D U C AT I O N The upper secondary education indicator (ISCED 3) foresees a con- tinuation of the entrepreneurship key competence promotion but complemented by harder entrepreneurship knowledge, skills and experience (e.g. specific business-oriented modules or subjects, busi- nessplanning,marketing).Countriesgenerallyapproachthisbywayof compulsory or elective subjects, as well as outside-school activities, in- cludingcooperationbetweenschoolsandenterprises.Again,aphased development of entrepreneurship at upper secondary level schooling is encouraged. G O O D P R AC T I C E Theinterestinintroducinganentrepreneuriallearning\u2018goodpractice\u2019indi- catorwasbasedonconcernthatentrepreneuriallearningisverymuchan uncharted area in education. Further, it is often characterised by a myriad of activities involving a diverse range of players, with little structured in- formation readily available.The result is that it is difficult to identify good practice in entrepreneurial learning. It is often isolated and locked inside its delivery organisations. With a more developed information exchange mechanism, the assumption is that good practice could be more easily accessed and adapted into other entrepreneurial learning environments. This would make for more enhanced quality and efficiency in the entre- preneurial learning effort.The\u2018good practice\u2019indicator works towards this end. It encourages a systematic exchange of experience between entre- preneurial learning environments both in-country and internationally. N O N-F O R M A L E N T R E P R E N E U R I A L L E A R N I N G The rationale behind the non-formal entrepreneurial learning indicator is that significant opportunities for self-development lie outside the formal education process. In local communities and workplaces, for example, there is considerable effort in entrepreneurial learning being made by a range of different agents (including enterprise associations, non-govern- mental organisations and community groups), as well as within enterprises themselves. Given that non-formal entrepreneurial learning is not subject totherigorsofassessmentandexaminationtypicalofthewidercurriculum offeredbyschoolsanduniversities,itallowsforgreaterflexibilityincontent and timing, thereby promoting an entrepreneurial learning culture.The in- dicator aims to develop awareness and engagement of all parts of society, including the press, into the promotion of entrepreneurial learning.

They point to an overall weakness in the region in terms of policy and delivery of entrepreneurial learning within secondary level schooling. Two performance clusters are clearly identifiable: Israel, Tunisia and Egypt above the regional average of 1.7 and the remaining countries falling below. A closer look at the scores of the individual indicators highlights mixed results for the better-performing countries in particular, as well as the challenges facing the weaker performers. Box 4: Entrepreneurship education and training: policy framework Tunisia has a clearly established policy framework for entrepre- neurial learning for all levels of education. In particular, a national education strategy clearly defines entrepreneurial spirit and skills as key competencies in compulsory education as well as pre- school provision (20) . Particular efforts are being made to imple- ment this policy at secondary education level (ISCED 2 and ISCED 3) (21) . Further, a network of 135 vocational training centres gives specific emphasis to training for self-employment promotion (CFPTI) (22) . Indicator W AL EG IS LE JO MO PA SY TU MED 2.1.

Given that entrepreneurial learn- ing is the concern of many different stakeholders, the problem is that it does not have one \u2018policy home\u2019. Rather, policy responsibility is stretched across a range of government bodies. The challenge is to ensure the necessary connections between the key policy players to ensure an orderly and comprehensive development. Although co- herence between the range of policy areas is weak, the assessment finds good examples of policy interest dotted across a range of pol- icy areas. Egypt\u2019s youth employment strategy, for example, prepares youth for self-employment; Algeria\u2019s microcredit strategy pays atten- tion to training; and the Palestinian Authority makes a considerable effort to promote entrepreneurship through its vocational training developments. The hallmark of Tunisia\u2019s good policy credentials is two-fold: a clear policy line within its national development plan for entrepreneurship education and training; and specific requirements for developing the entrepreneurship key competence within na- tional legislation. Key policy documents in all MED countries should acknowledge that entrepreneurship has its place in the education and training agenda. This is a first step towards getting the various partsofthelearningsystemtorespondtotherequirementsofamore entrepreneurial economy. Governments should also ensure that the range of stakeholders engage in a coherent vision for entrepreneurial learning promotion. Interestingly, the Charter assessment process in Syria opened a cross-stakeholder dialogue on strategy building for entrepreneurial learning. A next step there, as with all countries, could be to establish a working group or policy partnership to bring the dialogue forward. Getting coherence, commitment and recogni- tion for a more integrated entrepreneurial learning strategy (includ- ing any follow-up measures) can only happen through cross-ministry cooperation and in full partnership with the private sector and non- governmental interest groups. LOW E R A N D U P P E R S E CO N DA RY E D U C AT I O N Ensuring that entrepreneurship is systematically introduced into sec- ondary schooling is the biggest challenge within the Dimension 2 indicator package. In particular, the assessment team was aware that the entrepreneurship key competence requirements (for both ISCED 2 and 3 indicators) were particularly demanding for a number of reasons. Firstly, the concept of the key competence is a relatively new phenom- enon in education discourse. While the assessment team was able to identify varying degrees of familiarity with the concept, concrete evi- dencethattheentrepreneurshipkeycompetencewasbeingintegrated into curricula and teaching practice was thin. Tunisia, nonetheless, makes a positive effort to translate its key competence policy commit- ment into practice. And there are clearly grounds for progress in other countries. In its national plan, for example, Syria underlines the impor- tance of a wider batch of key competences (e.g. science, languages) to its economic development to which entrepreneurship could be added. Jordan, likewise, could build on its positive efforts on wider key compe- tence development to include the entrepreneurship key competence. ",
        "Page 42 Secondly, while policy is a primary building block, getting the schools and teachers to accommodate the changes in both curriculum and teachingpracticewillbeasignificantchallenge.Demonstrationschools, well-financedandmonitoredandwithaclearpolicy-orientedmandate, could be considered. The objective of policy pilots should be to ensure any eventual reform objective is workable, based on tried-and-tested curriculum adjustments and teaching models to be gradually main- streamed across the school environment. For a policy pilot initiative to succeed, it will need good political commitment and leadership. Its success would also be reinforced with an information and consultation framework to ensure that all constituents (teachers and school manag- ers included) see the benefit of a more open, flexible and innovative learning environment which the key competence developments require. While the upper secondary education indicator (ISCED 3) underlines the importance of continued promotion of the entrepreneurship key competence, it differs from lower secondary education in that it addi- tionally advocates the development of harder entrepreneurship skills (e.g. book-keeping, business planning, marketing, etc.). While perform- ance on the upper secondary education indicator was generally com- promised by the weak developments on the key competence criterion, the assessment nonetheless highlighted positive efforts to promote harder entrepreneurship skills. For example, Egypt\u2019s national education strategic plan requires that all pupils follow book-keeping, while Jordan offers selective courses for its pupils in areas such as business studies, accounting and marketing. However, a general trend in the region is that entrepreneurship promotion within upper secondary education is confined to students following vocational courses. That entrepreneur- shipis\u2018vocationalised\u2019isnotsurprisinggiventhatvocationalcoursesare more geared to the labour market. However, this bias will need to be broken if the Charter\u2019s objective of\u2018entrepreneurship education for all\u2019 is to be achieved. G O O D P R AC T I C E Overall,effortstodisseminategoodpracticeinentrepreneuriallearning proved to be one of the better performing indicators in the assessment. However, the good performance is particularly skewed by three coun- tries (Israel, Tunisia and Egypt) where national entrepreneurial learning providers are well networked. It is this strong network which ensures that information and know-how is disseminated. Given that most of the countries in the region have a sizable diaspora in a range of regions (North America, European Union, Gulf region), creating links with both the business and learning communities abroad could bring a double advantage: access to expertise abroad for back-home developments; and outlets for sharing good practice from the domestic environment outside the country. A key principle of the \u2018good practice\u2019 indicator is that information and experience is systematically made available be- tween the range of entrepreneurial learning providers at home. This is generally poorly developed in all countries. Networking involving all parts of the formal and non-formal learning environment needs to be developed. Clearly, the advantages of information and communication technologies,intermsofwebsitemarketingofgoodpracticeanddevel- opment of virtual communities of practitioners, remain to be explored. N O N-F O R M A L L E A R N I N G A key finding from the overall assessment of the nine countries is that most effort in entrepreneurial learning lies outside the formal educa- tion system and is administered by a range of different agents. Good examples include first business skills for young people (SEBC in Syria), general business skills and start-up training (ANSEJ in Algeria and YEP in the Palestinian Authority), with the involvement of press and media providing good coverage to a range of entrepreneurial learning initia- tives (ITC in Egypt and Dragon\u2019s Den in Lebanon). The contribution of the non-formal learning environment, therefore, is an important con- tribution to an enterprising society. This Charter indicator determines the extent to which non-formal learning interfaces with the formal education system. A first conclusion from the assessment is that there is good evidence that enterprises and enterprise associations provide inputs into school-based developments. These are for the most part ad hoc arrangements in select localities, driven by individuals from the schools and enterprises. Rarely do they feature in the policy agenda nor are they captured by a general information system.The sporadic nature of these arrangements means that the majority of schools and young people do not benefit. That said, one Lebanese initiative stands out for its contribution to more systemic education developments. InJaz, a young people\u2019s business support organisation (and part of a wider network of young people\u2019s enterprise support organisations originally set up in Jordan in 1999 and later replicated in neighbouring countries) is working directly with the education authorities to see how entrepre- neurship can be better integrated into careers guidance and counsel- ling developments. It is this type of initiative which demonstrates the added value of partnership between formal education, business and enterprise-interest organisations in the wider bid by a country to build a more entrepreneurial society. 2.4. Synthesis In order for the participating countries to move forward on the Dimen- sion 2 indicators, consideration could be given to two lines of devel- opment: policy partnership and entrepreneurship key competence de- velopment. Taken together, the two development lines work towards system-buildingandsustainableprogressinacountry\u2019sentrepreneurial learning development. P O L I C Y PA R T N E R S H I P A more concerted effort is required between state authorities (educa- tion, economy and employment ministries, in particular) and enterprise (including its representative organisations) to strategically cooperate in the development of a more comprehensive and integrated policy framework for entrepreneurial learning.The objective should be a\u2018one- system\u2019 approach to lifelong entrepreneurial learning development. Leadership and institutional commitment are central to this process: they require the fullest engagement, particularly of the education au- thorities which will be instrumental in providing the foundations of an entrepreneurial culture. Strategic agreements should be backed up by actions plans, financed and monitored by the institutions working in partnership. Adjustments and improvements to both strategy and ac- tion plans over time will be necessary to reflect the dynamic of fast- changing economies.

Of importance here will be policy recognition and institutional support for the pilot schools, including a consultation and consensus-building drive to ensure that whatever changes are envis- aged have the support of wider society. 5.0 4.0 3.0 2.0 1.0 0.0 A l g e r i a E g y p t I s r a e l L e b a n o n J o r d a n M o r o c c o P a l e s t i n i a n A u t h o r i t y S y r i a T u n i s i a Figure 5 : Dimension 2 overall scores ",

Introduction Continuous upgrading of skills is increasingly recognised as a direct contributor to the competitiveness of a national economy. While the Charter\u2019s Dimension 2 concentrates particularly on the development of entrepreneurial learning, Dimension 3 is concerned more with man- agement and trade skills within enterprises. Since the Charter\u2019s primary message is that workforce competencies should be regularly reviewed and improved, policymakers and the training community are encour- aged to continuously monitor human capital development to ensure training and wider human resource measures meet evolving demands. This includes training for establishment of new businesses (as well as follow-upsupporttoensuretheirsurvival).Itadditionallyinvolvestrain- ing for expanding businesses where wealth and jobs are created. This chapter discusses the outcomes of the assessment of five pilot in- dicators drawn up in September 2007 by a group of enterprise policy and human resource development (HRD) experts from all nine partici- pating countries. It concludes with a number of proposals which the countries could consider in the bid to improve enterprise manpower developments. 3.2. Assessment framework The assessment framework comprised the following indicators: (a) availability of training, (b) start-up training, (c) general enterprise train- ingeffort,(d)enterprisegrowth,and(e)accesstointernationalmarkets. Whiletheindicatorsasawholehaveaninherentpolicyfocusandarefor themostpartqualitativeinnature,mostoftheindicatorscontainquan- titative criteria. Again, as with Dimension 2, while each of the indica- torsisconsideredasaseparateunitintheassessment,allfiveindicators have a collective value in providing a primary assessment framework for enterprise HRD in the participating countries. AVA I L A B I L I T Y O F T R A I N I N G The rationale behind the\u2018availability of training\u2019indicator is that a well- developed training market gives enterprises access to training, which in turn enhances business performance. More specifically, the objective of the indicator is that participating countries promote quality train- ing services in key economic sectors (23) . The indicator also prompts the countries to regularly update and evaluate data on the training offer as part of a national enterprise development plan. S TA R T-U P T R A I N I N G The purpose of this indicator is to encourage the development of train- ing for start-ups and to ensure an extension of services (e.g. coaching) for a defined period, as one factor in increasing survival rates of new ventures. Key to meeting the criteria for this indicator will be data which demonstrates where start-up training has been delivered as well as the duration of support/coaching services made available in the post-start- upperiod.GivenaspecificinterestoftheChartertoensuregenderequity within the policies and measures it promotes, this indicator additionally requires evidence that efforts to promote start-ups give particular con- sideration to supporting training of women in new venture creation. E N T E R P R I S E T R A I N I N G The\u2018enterprise training\u2019indicator is designed to determine the level of training take-up by enterprise. As such, it acts as a policy barometer to measure the HRD health of a country\u2019s enterprise community and al- lows for appropriate policy responses. E N T E R P R I S E G R OW T H This indicator focuses on training within expanding enterprises where HRD investment in new markets, products and services create busi- ness opportunities. Central to the indicator is that national policy and support structures are available to provide HRD support to businesses ready to take the growth route; and that HRD investment in enterprise growth strategies is systematically monitored by government and en- terprise partners to determine the impact of the policy framework. ACC E S S TO I N T E R N AT I O N A L M A R K E TS The objective of the \u2018international markets\u2019 indicator is to support a country\u2019s external trade effort, with particular reference to technical Dimension 3: Improved skills ",

Analysis Thissectionconsidersthefindingsfromtheassessment.Withanoverall average of 2.3, the results break the countries into two groups: Egypt, Israel, Jordan and Tunisia are all above average and significantly skew the overall data; the remaining countries make up a weaker performing group, although Morocco falls just short of meeting the MED average equal to 2.3. A primary constraint to the assessment process was the lack of read- ily available data on enterprise training against which the bulk of the indicators could be assessed. This is seen in Table 9 where the\u2018enter- prise training\u2019 indicator ranks lowest in the Dimension 3 package. This is the most significant finding and prompts the question as to the importance attributed to enterprise training by the countries, if reliable and available empirical data are not at hand to support the policy process. AVA I L A B I L I T Y O F T R A I N I N G The assessment points to well-developed networks of training providers inallcountries,forthemostpartpublicorganisationsdeliveringnational- ly and/or internationally financed training programmes. These networks generally assure good geographical coverage. In their efforts to promote access to training, Israel and Morocco, for example, ensure training provi- sion is backed up with good websites which enable enterprises to de- termine viability and location of the training offer. One question raised during the assessment was the extent to which the training provision is driven primarily by a social agenda (i.e. training designed to get young people or the unemployed into jobs) or a competitiveness agenda (i.e. training geared specifically to enterprise operations and those already employed in industry).This is an important distinction. Notwithstanding that both objectives contribute to workforce improvement, any eventual follow-up to the 2008 Charter process should investigate the balance of policymotivation(socialpolicyversuscompetitivenesspolicyobjectives) andconsequentdeliveryacrossthetrainingnetworks.Itwillthenbepos- sible to determine the real extent to which publicly supported training provision is a function of a competitiveness agenda.

Firstly, the enterprise training indicator deter- mines the extent to which enterprises are involved in training in each country. The assessment found only Egypt and Israel had a compre- hensive data set against which the indicator could be assessed. Other countrieshadinformationsystemswhichweregenerallyproject-based. Such micro-data sets do not capture a sufficient sample of enterprises to fulfil the demands of the indicator. The lack of comprehensive data on enterprise training suggests an undefined or poorly defined policy position on the role and contribution of human resources to a country\u2019s competitiveness drive. Further, it also implies that there is no overall tracking of enterprise training needs or priority-driven investment in enterprise training, and increases the risk of incorrect targeting of re- sources. A similar conclusion applies to the start-up indicator where systematic data on training for start-ups, including follow-up support, were gen- erally not obtainable. Again, the assessment team was able to identify project-based data. For example, 2007 data from one training provider of the Palestinian Authority (Young Entrepreneurs Palestine) highlight the value of start-up training statistics. These data highlight how 30 % of start-up trainees go on to set up an enterprise, although company registrationsaremarkedlylow.Thisisanimportantoutcomeofthedata and (assuming other start-up training providers report similar trends) demonstrates the value of data for policy reflection. The start-up indicator required a breakdown of training data by gen- der. Interestingly, despite significant efforts in all countries to raise the policy profile of women in the labour market and business, obtaining empirical data on training support for women\u2019s start-ups was difficult. Evidence gathered through the assessment fact-finding missions was generally confined to anecdotal reports or, at best, project-based data. For example, Algerian microenterprise data suggest that some 14 % of start-ups are female. However, in this instance, the statistics are only a subset of a wider data set required by the indicator. Israel makes con- sistent efforts to gather data on its wider start-up efforts but hard data on training for women\u2019s start-ups were not available. For the purposes of this assessment, an academic publication on women\u2019s enterprises in Israel was the primary source for concluding on the gender component of the start-up indicator. Assuming follow-up to the pilot assessment process, one-off research projects would not be sufficient to meet the requirements of the indicator. Rather, a more developed tracking and monitoring framework on developments in the entrepreneurial activ- ity of women in the Charter area will be necessary. This recommenda- tionhasalreadybeenputforwardbyvarioushigh-profileEuropeanand Euro-Mediterranean advisory bodies (24) . E N T E R P R I S E G R OW T H This enterprise growth indicator finds Tunisia, Jordan, Lebanon Moroc- co, Israel and Egypt in a common grouping with above-average assess- ment, offering a range of services to meet the training requirements of expanding businesses. All six countries have earmarked funds to sup- port training for enterprises with clear expansion criteria (e.g. product development, marketing and staff training).The assessment found that trainingforexpandingenterprisesinvariablyaddressesproduct/service quality assurance, HRD, strategic planning, marketing, financial man- agement, IT skills, coaching and performance management. Jordan\u2019s Enterprise Development Corporation stands out for its rigorous human resource and management analysis of enterprise business plans sub- mitted for financial support. However, only Egypt satisfied the level 4 data demands of the indicator with research statistics available from its Industrial Modernisation Centre. The centre plays a pivotal role in the country\u2019s assistance to the enterprise sector and where HRD support standsalongsideotherstrategicdevelopmentareassuchastechnology transfer, R & D, quality systems and export development. This is clearly one of the more successful areas for human resource de- velopment falling under this Charter dimension. Assuming interest and readiness to share their know-how, the experience of the six better per- formers could be readily culled and disseminated amongst all nine par- ticipating countries.This would allow for identification of good practice in terms of policy support, (co)-financing of training, funding criteria, monitoring and impact assessment, and allow for options to improve on training for growth enterprises across the region. ACC E S S TO I N T E R N AT I O N A L M A R K E TS Training on international standards and markets is generally well devel- oped in the region. Success on this indicator is due to a range of serv- ices provided by the general enterprise support organisations (which invariably provide export-related information and training), coupled with more developed technical advisory and training services, particu- larly on international standards, provided by specialist institutes, test- Box 5: Improved skills: start-up support Algeria Job creation is a high priority for Algeria and particular attention is given to self-employment and microenterprise creation as a way to reduce unemployment.

In addition to training and coaching services, the ANSEJ network concentrates primarily on young people aged 19 to 35 years and also provides information services and wider awareness-raising events. Jordan The Jordanian Hashemite Fund for Human Development (JOHUD) has a network of 50 community centres providing training and advice to potential microentrepreneurs, especially women and youth.

Israel offers a sophisticated web of information, training and technical support to enterprises working (or intending to work) on international markets in- volving its national standards authority and a network of sector-based intermediaries and sectoral branches. 3.4. Synthesis In order for the participating countries to move forward on Dimension 3, two areas could be considered: systemic data developments, and good practice sharing on training for expanding businesses. S YS T E M AT I C DATA D E V E LO PM E N TS There is a lack of systematic data on training across the enterprise com- munity in all countries. This does not bode well with what is clearly a significant investment from the public purse in labour market and enterprise training, as well as financial support in the form of specific programmes, by a range of international operators in most countries, and where priority identification and more targeted resource allocation would apply. In order to move forward on Dimension 3, there is a clear need for the enterprise sector and the enterprise policy organs of the state to reflect on the data scenario in each country vis-\u00e0-vis enterprise training and wider HRD issues. The most pragmatic response to this proposal would be a regular and comprehensive survey of the enter- prise community to: capture the extent of training take-up, determine skill gaps and skill weaknesses, and identify new skills and knowledge requirements evolving in the business world. All data collection should allow for gender differentiation. A good research or business support institution could easily provide the data collection service through the range of enterprise associations and industrial sector organisations. The resulting data would provide evidence and argument for priority- setting and policy adjustment and enable a more developed impact as- sessment. Finally, a regular and comprehensive data set on enterprise training needs would be a primary reference point for the range of education and training providers against which training programmes could be better articulated. Consequently, a more systematic tracking of enterprise training requirements would enable a closer fit between demand and supply of training.

A common knowledge-sharing effort could also spin out into a more developed impact assessment for the region, involving the network of national bodies involved in the training effort, co-working through peer learning on areas of common development interest. 5.0 4.0 3.0 2.0 1.0 0.0 A l g e r i a E g y p t I s r a e l L e b a n o n J o r d a n M o r o c c o P a l e s t i n i a n A u t h o r i t y S y r i a T u n i s i a Figure 7 : Dimension 3 overall scores ",
        "Page 48 4.1. Introduction Dimension 4 of the Euro-Med Charter for Enterprise covers two compo- nents that are vital for enterprise development: access to finance and taxation. External finance (in the form of debt, equity or other financial products) allows companies to leverage their initial capital base, bet- ter manage cash-flow fluctuations, embark on investment plans and expand turnover at a faster rate than if the company had to rely exclu- sively on internally generated funds. Taxation is an equally important factor in determining enterprise devel- opment. A well-structured and transparent tax regime and a light tax compliance system promote entrepreneurship and investment, par- ticularly among SMEs. The components of Dimension 4 are analysed in separate sections and the assessments results are presented separately. ACCESS TO FINANCE 4.2. Assessment framework The assessment framework for access to finance in this report does not contain a complete evaluation of access to finance in the MED coun- tries. This would require a full review of demand for each type of finan- cial instrument by companies and their supply by financial institutions, as well as the related prices. Rather, the assessment framework is de- rived from the Charter and focuses on areas where government policy can promote and facilitate access to finance. In this context, the report evaluates areas where government policy can build an environment conducive to the development of markets. The assessment framework for Dimension 4 includes two subdimen- sions: credit environment and financial facilities for enterprises. In look- ingatcreditenvironment,thereportevaluatesfiveindicators:collateral and provisioning requirements, cadastre, law on distressed companies and bankruptcy, registration system for movable assets, and credit in- formation services. In terms of financial facilities available to enterpris- es, the report covers another five indicators: credit guarantee schemes, risk capital, capital markets, microfinance, and leasing.

        "4.3. Analysis Despite this somewhat narrow scope of the assessment framework, the research conducted for this report has confirmed that limited access to finance in the MED countries is one of the key constraints on private sector growth and development, especially for micro-, small and medi- um-sized enterprises (MSMEs). The financial systems in all of the MED countries are still developing. However, there are significant differences among their levels of devel- opment in terms of financial institutions, the regulatory and supervi- sory framework, monetary policy, financial openness and institutional environment. Despite these differences, the financial systems in the MED countries reveal some common features. The banking sectors dominate the financial systems, and even the more developed banking sectors in the MED countries are rather conservative in extending loans to (private) enterprises, especially to MSMEs. In addition, financial mar- kets and non-bank financial institutions are even less developed than the banking sectors. Consequently, there is room to improve access to finance for enterpris- es in these countries. Better access to external finance (debt, equity and other financial instruments) would make it possible for enterprises to leverage their capital base, spread and better manage financial risks, and grow faster than by using only internally generated funds. C R E D I T E N V I R O N M E N T In order to help facilitate access to finance, government policy can be especiallyhelpfulintheareaoflegislationwhichsupportsbetteraccess to finance. For instance, improvement in functioning of registries (land, claims on movable assets, credit records) includes enacting supporting legislation. Such registries facilitate the use of assets as collateral (ca- dastre, registry of claims on movable assets) or reduce asymmetric in- formation (registry of credit records), making it easier for banks to lend. Cadastre AregistryoflandisinplaceinallMEDcountries.Infouroutofninecoun- tries (Israel, Jordan, Morocco andTunisia), property titles have been fully documented,butonlyinIsraelcadastreensuresthatlandcanbeconsist- ently used as collateral for bank loans. In the other MED countries, prop- erty titles are not always fully documented. In particular, the Palestinian Authorityisstillfacingdifficultiesinimprovingpropertytitlesandestab- lishing a properly functioning cadastre due to the constraints posed by the fact that 60 % of the territory is under Israeli jurisdiction. Registration system of claims on movable assets A registration system of claims on movable assets (e.g. stocks, equip- ment, machinery, vehicles) is only known in three out of the nine MED countries (Egypt, Israel and the Palestinian Authority). The system is most advanced in Israel, where enterprises can use movable assets as collateral. In Egypt, the registration system is in place, but not fully op- erational, while the Palestinian Authority is drafting legislation to es- tablish such a registration system. The lack of such a registry prevents enterprises from using their assets and banks from accepting them as collateral. Credit information services MED countries vary significantly in terms of the availability of credit information services. In Syria, such services are not available, while Algeria and the Palestinian Authority restrict credit information to financial institutions. In Egypt, Lebanon, Jordan, Morocco and Tunisia credit records are available also to the public, but they are not compre- hensive and regularly updated, as they are in Israel. Laws on distressed companies and bankruptcy Lenders may be reluctant to extend loans to enterprises in the absence of a bankruptcy law or if such law does not function properly. A review of bankruptcy legislation has confirmed that laws on distressed com- panies and bankruptcy are in place in all MED countries, but they are not fully implemented except in Israel, and to a lesser extent in Jordan, Morocco and Tunisia. While the Palestinian Authority and Lebanon have such laws, they are outdated and undermined by weak judicial systems. Page 49 ",

Information on collateral and provisioning requirements is not easily available in MED countries. Nevertheless, available informa- tion reveals that in most countries collateral requirements for bank loans to enterprises are relatively high, ranging from 150 to 200 % of the loan amount and in some cases even above 200 %. However, col- lateralrequirementsarelessstringentinIsrael:Israelibanksofferloans without collateral for amounts of up to EUR 10 000, while above that amount collateral requirements range between 50 and 100 % of the loan amount. Box 6: Jordan Loan Guarantee Corporation In 1994, the Jordan Loan Guarantee Corporation (JLGC) was estab- lished as a public shareholding company, with the mission to en- hance sustainable economic growth in Jordan by improving the credit environment available to economically viable SMEs by pro- viding loan guarantees through its small business loan guarantee programme. In 1997, the JLGC developed an export credit guaran- tee programme, expanding its mission to enhance national exports by providing enterprises with credit guarantees. Its function is to facilitate access to finance through the instruments it provides, by fully or partially covering the risks of loans granted by banks and financial institutions.The JLGC stipulates that loans should bedirectedtowardsestablishingeconomicprojectsorexpandingex- istingones,particularlythoseinindustrialsectors,inordertoincrease production capacity, marketing efficiency, job opportunities and for- eign currency earnings or savings. Notably, it develops tools includ- ing the guaranteeing of credit operations in line with the doctrines of the Islamic law (sharia) and those which realise JLGC objectives. Major JLGC shareholders include the Central Bank of Jordan (47.75 %), commercial banks (23.66 %), private companies (6.55 %), governmental and semi-governmental institutions (8.49 %), and in- dividuals (13.55 %) (http://www.jlgc.com/index.htm).

In some MED countries, some of them are either not available or very limited. However, this does not mean that governments should provide them in order to increase their supply. Credit guarantee schemes Credit guarantee schemes can support access to credit by reducing col- lateralrequirements.AlltheMEDcountrieshaveatleastonecreditguar- antee scheme available (except for Syria, where such a scheme is under preparation). In most of the countries, the schemes are publicly funded, but they operate in close cooperation with commercial banks. From this point of view Jordan presents an interesting example of cooperation between public institutions and commercial banks. Another interesting example is the Kafalat credit guarantee scheme in Lebanon. Neverthe- less, the competition level in the guarantees market remains low. This implies that there is room for a broader range of guarantee products and more competitive prices in most of the MED countries, which would make guarantees available to more enterprises, especially smaller ones. Risk capital The private equity industry in MED countries remains small, while de- mand for risk capital appears to be unmet. A number of specific fac- tors seem to constrain the development of this sector in MED countries. Information on markets is crucial for investors to properly assess risk. However, market data are hardly available for most of these countries. In addition, regulations for private equity funds and companies do not necessarily comply with best international practices. Moreover, Algeria, Jordan,SyriaandthePalestinianAuthorityhavenolegislationrelatedto investment funds. Nevertheless, some risk capital is available in Algeria andJordan.RiskcapitalfacilitiesaremoredevelopedinEgypt,Lebanon, Morocco and Tunisia, where they are supported by special legislation.

Israel stands out in terms of the risk capital industry.There are about 80 venture capital funds oper- ating in the country, which have raised about EUR 6.5 billion and made investments in over 1 000 start-up companies. Many of these compa- nies have gone through a successful initial public offering. Capital markets Algeria and the Palestinian Authority are at an early stage in develop- ing the stock market legislative and regulatory framework. In addition, Syria does not yet have an operating stock market. The equity markets in Lebanon, Morocco and Tunisia are relatively illiquid. Stock markets in Israel, Jordan and Egypt are more liquid, but still significantly less than the most developed markets worldwide. Furthermore, most of the stock marketsinMEDcountriesexhibitahighconcentrationofmarketcapitali- sation within a group of a few large companies. Egypt and Morocco have launched a market for companies with smaller market capitalisation, ex- panding access to equity finance to a broader range of companies. Microfinance Morocco is a leader in microfinance in the region. The country has a legal and institutional framework for microfinance in place and a wide range of sustainable microfinance institutions. The majority of the re- cipients of microfinance in Morocco are women, and the recovery rate of loans is 99 %. Egypt, Israel and Lebanon follow with relatively well- developed microfinance industries, but do not have any legislation re- lated to the sector. In the other MED countries microfinance is relatively less developed and state or donor funded. Leasing Legislation that supports leasing is closely related to the abovemen- tioned legislation underpinning different registries. Except for Syria and the Palestinian Authority, MED countries have a leasing law in place. In Syria leasing law is under approval. The Palestinian Authority has pre- pared several drafts of a law, but none has been submitted to the leg- islative council. Indicator W AL EG IS LE JO MO PA SY TU MED 4.1.6.

        "4.4. Synthesis The analysis of selected indicators on access to finance has shown that government policies in the MED countries could improve the function- ing of registries, especially the registry of claims on movable assets, which together with a better functioning cadastre would facilitate the use of assets as collateral. In addition, there is room for improvement in credit information services and with respect to laws on bankruptcy and distressed companies. Such improvements in the credit environment would make it easier for banks to lend to enterprises. In order to help deepen and broaden the financial markets, govern- ment policies should ensure that the legal and regulatory framework is conducive to market development. In this regard, the promotion of good international practices could help develop non-bank financial in- stitutions such as private equity funds. 5.0 4.0 3.0 2.0 1.0 0.0 A l g e r i a E g y p t I s r a e l L e b a n o n J o r d a n M o r o c c o P a l e s t i n i a n A u t h o r i t y S y r i a T u n i s i a Figure 9 : Dimension 4a overall scores INVESTMENT\uf6baFRIENDLY TAXATION 4.5. Introduction Theassessmentframeworkforinvestment-friendlytaxationoftheMEDChar- teraimstoassesscountriesontheirtaxpolicyandpracticesinthetreatment ofenterpriseswithregardtofivekeyareasrelevanttoenterprisegrowthand tax compliance. Given the relative complexities involved in the area of taxa- tion, a crucial element in the development of tax policy measures is imple- menting, applying and drawing main results from suitable analytical frame- works to inform policy decisions. In this sense, the assessment framework for investment-friendly taxation of the MED Charter calls for assessments of enterprisetaxpolicywithanemphasisontaxpolicydevelopment. Under the MED Charter, the assessment considers a subset of issues rel- evant for enterprise tax policy. In particular, certain considerations are not covered here, such as the need to measure effective (average and marginal) tax rates on enterprises, which involves the use of micro-data analysis and micro-simulation models. These issues are also relevant to assess the overall effective tax burden on enterprises and tax distor- tions to investment in enterprises. Page 52 ",

Similarly, tax advantages accompanying the placement of savings outside the domestic enterprise sector may make it more difficult (more expensive) to raise external financing from local investors. ( 26 ) Effective tax rates on dividends and retained profits should factor in integration relief (if provided) in respect of dividend income and capital gains. ( 27 ) The European Commission, for example, reports survey findings that compliance costs for corporate income tax andVAT are about 2.6 % of turnover for small businesses, versus0.02%forlargerenterprises(see Europeantaxsurvey ,2004,Directorate-GeneralforTaxationandCustomsUnion,WorkingPaperNo3).Recentanalysisfordeveloping countries finds similar evidence (see, for example, South Africa: Tax compliance burden for small businesses: A survey of tax practitioners, 2007 , Foreign Investment Advisory Service(2007),Table7,whichreportscompliancecostsinSouthAfricaofroughly4.6%ofturnoverforfirmswithaturnoverbelowroughlyEUR25000versus0.1%forfirms with a turnover in excess of roughly EUR 500 000). 4.6. Assessment framework The assessment framework includes five indicators under two catego- ries: basic income tax design features and compliance costs of concern to small enterprises. B A S I C I N CO M E TAX D E S I G N F E AT U R E S F O R E N T E R P R I S E S The topics under this category address two basic design features of business income tax systems relevant to assessing potential tax distor- tions to the financing of investment in enterprises: scope for double taxation of business profits, and the treatment of risk (business losses and capital losses on enterprise shares). Certain other basic features of tax systems that may be discouraging to enterprise financing are not considered here (25) . The first indicator (4.2.1) assesses whether policymakers analyse and take into consideration possible tax distortions to enterprise financial policy and neutrality implications of alternative integration approach- es/measures to avoid double taxation of equity income. In this sense, policymakers are asked whether they explore the implications of dou- ble taxation of enterprise profits in their economy and whether they measure and use effective tax rates on distributed profits and retained profits of incorporated enterprises held by resident taxpayers in such analysis (26) . The second indicator (4.2.2) assesses whether policymakers address the tax treatment of risk-taking, and the potential for taxation to dis- courage risk-taking (e.g. in young innovated firms) by making cross- country comparisons of business loss offset provisions, and capital loss offset provisions for enterprise shares. The treatment of losses is particularly important for investment in early-stage enterprises, where losses may be expected for one or more years following the creation of a business. CO M P L I A N C E CO S TS O F CO N C E R N TO S M A L L E N T E R P R I S E S The total tax burden on business is determined not only by the amount of tax liability that business owners must bear (as deter- minedbytaxrulesandregulations,andafirm\u2019sabilitytopossiblyshift partoftheburdenontohigherpricesand/orreducedwages).Itisalso influenced by the cost of complying with the tax system. Depend- ing on the tax system, compliance costs may be significant, consist- ing of the time and resource costs involved with complying with the tax system (e.g. registering for tax purposes, ensuring that tax forms are completed and submitted, tax payments are made, tax audits are accommodated, and possibly contending with appeals procedures). Such costs, which consist largely of a fixed cost component, tend to be particularly burdensome for small enterprises (high relative to to- tal turnover) (27) . The third indicator (4.2.3) analyses whether policymakers make assess- ments of tax compliance costs of enterprises linked to tax policy and ",
        "Page 54 tax administration, and whether tax administration has been adjusted where compliance costs are found to be too high, to encourage enter- prise compliance and business activities. The fourth indicator (4.2.4) assesses whether policymakers consider thepros/consofalternativetaxpolicymeasurestoreducethetaxcom- plianceburdenonenterprises,toencourageenterprisetaxcompliance and business activities (e.g. basic income tax and basic value-added tax (VAT) systems, versus presumptive tax regime for enterprises, VAT exemption for enterprises). Finally, the fifth indicator (4.2.5) covers whether taxpayer assistance and education service programmes are in place to reduce the tax com- pliance burden on enterprises. 4.7. Analysis The countries\u2019responses to the questionnaire have been limited. Only five countries submitted partial responses (Egypt, Israel, Lebanon, Jordan and the Palestinian Authority). Some of these countries could therefore only be scored partially (i.e. not across all the indicators) and the remaining four countries (Algeria, Morocco, Syria andTunisia) have not been scored at all. Therefore, given the limited range of available data,ithasnotbeenpossibletoproduceanaggregatedscorereflecting the performance on investment-friendly taxation for the whole MED region. The results of the overall assessment show that only some participat- ing countries assess tax compliance costs for enterprises and the im- plications of alternative tax policy regimes to apply to enterprises to address these compliance costs. However, in general most countries provide some kind of assistance and education services to reduce tax compliance costs. Egypt has taken a leadership role in the group by adopting simplified regimes for enterprises, encouraging e-filing and e-payment by granting incentives to taxpayers and providing free call centres to respond to taxpayers\u2019 questions. Additionally, Egypt and Israel have organised training sessions for taxpayers and tax profes- sional to improve their tax knowledge and have organised awareness campaigns in newspapers and on television to educate taxpayers. The income and sales tax department in Jordan also has a call centre and an open window for taxpayers\u2019complaints and information. Addition- ally, the chief executive officer (CEO) of the department has a day per week allocated to receiving taxpayers with complaints. In Lebanon, seminars, special advertising and other strategies have also been used to actively disseminate tax information to businesses. Thereisawiderdispersionacrosscountriesregardingtheconsideration of possible tax distortions to enterprise financial policy and investment. EgyptandIsraelhaveundertakenstudiesonspecialtaxincentivestoin- crease financing of small enterprises, although only in the case of Egypt have these studies been reported to the Minister for Finance. In the re- maining countries, tax officials have not undertaken studies examining implicationsforenterprisefinancingandinvestmentofdoubletaxation of distributed and retained profit. (However, Lebanon reported that it took the integration principle into consideration when it designed its new draft personal income tax law.) Egypt was the only country that reported to have undertaken some studies on tax impediments to risky investment in enterprises and re- ported the main results to senior Ministry of Finance officials. 4.8. Synthesis The results of the assessment may be used to help identify areas where analytics and capacity could be enhanced through technical training for host country tax officials. This will help participating countries to move forward on the indicators. In addition, main findings of assess- ments may feed into a follow-up exercise that will involve tax policy assessments examining specific tax policies adopted and suggestions of options for possible tax reform to improve enterprise growth and tax compliance. These suggestions will draw on findings emanating from applications of best practices and will also involve consideration of findings from assessments under other (non-tax) components of the Charter.

Better market access means lower barriers to trade and in- vestment, but also better policies to strengthen the regulatory frame- work, reduce transaction costs and favour the adoption of international technical standards. For several decades most MED countries had pro- tected their domestic markets with high tariff and non-tariff barriers and imposed controls on trade and investment flows. This has significantly changed over the last few years.The MED countries are opening domestic markets through a reduction of customs duties, have started to dismantle trade barriers, and have opened up to foreign direct investment. The pace of economic integration has accelerated. In fact the MED region is managing three simultaneous processes of eco- nomic integration and trade liberalisation: one with the European Union basedontheassociationagreementsandleadingtotheestablishmentof a Euro-Med free zone by 2010; the second at a regional level, with the es- tablishment of a network of multilateral and bilateral trade agreements; andfinallyatagloballevel,intheframeworkofWorldTradeOrganisation (WTO) negotiations and through the establishment of preferential trade and investment agreements with the most important trade partners. Although this trend is visible across the whole region, the degree and speed of economic opening varies. Small economies, such as Jordan, Lebanon and Tunisia, have opened up quickly to trade and investment and display a diverse import and export structure. Other countries, such as Algeria and Syria, have a more imbalanced trade structure with ahighconcentrationofexportsonhydrocarbonsandahighrelianceon imports for virtually all other commodities. 5.2. Assessment framework The assessment of this Charter dimension on market access is divided into three parts. Subdimension 5.1 deals with trade policy and its im- plementation as well as intra-MED trade agreements. Subdimension 5.2 covers the simplification of procedures for exporting enterprises and the quality and dissemination of information for these. It also deals with the ICT application on trade procedures and the access to online facilities for the completion of procedures. Subdimension 5.3 deals with the agreements on conformity assessment and accept- ance of industrial products (ACAAs), which are an important element in the process of economic integration with the EU and account for an important component in the Euro-Med industrial cooperation pro- gramme.

Analysis E X P O R T P R O M OT I O N S T R AT E G Y Trade is a complex area and the presence of a well-articulated export promotion strategy, that links trade policy with the simplification of trade procedures, the reduction of transaction costs, the organisation of promotion activities and the provision of services for exports, may greatly contribute to structure government policy in this area, define priorities,buildsynergiesamongprogrammesandinstitutions,andpro- mote dialogue and cooperation between public institutions (customs and tax administration, trade officials, export promotion agencies) and exporters. In many countries governments have established export promotion agencies and other trade-specialised institutions (such as export credit guarantees and import\u2013export banks) to support exporters and imple- ment the country\u2019s export promotion strategy. In particular, the most active export promotion agencies are able to provide a wide range of services to exports, including personalised services of market intelli- gence, market research, and search of trade partners, and to maintain a presence in all the most important export markets though commercial offices. Israel has both a clear export strategy and a number of government programmes and institutions supporting exporters. The Israel Export andInternationalCooperationInstituteisthemaininstitutionincharge of export promotion in Israel. The Foreign Trade Administration in the Ministry of Industry, Trade and Labour is in charge of trade policy and international trade agreements of Israel. It also maintains an extensive network of trade offices abroad. Egypt, Tunisia and Morocco are also relatively advanced in this area. Egypt adopted a new, comprehensive export promotion strategy in 2004 to meet the goals set out by a high-level economic reform team. Part of the strategy was to simplify cumbersome and costly procedures for international trade. Beside the General Organisation for Export and Import Control (GOEIC), a second agency, the Egyptian Export Promo- tion Centre (EEPC), was established by the Ministry of Trade and Indus- try. In terms of SME-specific programmes, the Export Development Bank of Egypt provides banking services, including upgrading and modernising those enterprises with export potential. Tunisia has established a number of programmes to help domestic companies to enter export markets.Tunisia\u2019s export strategy is decided by a high-level council presided by the president (Conseil Sup\u00e9rieur de l\u2019Exportation et de l\u2019Investissement) (28) . An export promotion agency has been established under the Ministry of Commerce (Centre de Pro- motion des Exportations (CEPEX)) with a mandate to gather commer- cial intelligence, examine the impact of export assistance programmes and organise export promotion activities such as commercial missions, trade fairs, etc. while the high-level presidential council secures inter- ministerial participation. CEPEX has established an initial network of commercial offices in the main export markets in Europe, North Africa and the Middle East. In Morocco, the Ministry of External Trade is in charge of elaborating an export promotion strategy, which still lacks sectoral action plans. Linked to the ministry are a number of executive bodies and high- level steering committees whose roles range from export promotion, to regulation, to conforming to standards and to the simplification of procedures.ThesebodiescatertoexportstoEurope,whichisMorocco\u2019s biggest export market, and facilitate trade with Morocco\u2019s numerous regional trading partners. In addition, the Moroccan exporters\u2019associa- tion (ASMEX) helps simplify procedures in trade. Jordan and Lebanon have embraced substantial efforts for export pro- motion, but are so far missing a comprehensive strategy and/or insti- tutional framework. In Jordan, the Jordan Enterprise Development Corporation (JE) is currently working with several donors to develop a formal national strategy in 2008 and an export promotion programme, funded by the European Commission, will help with implementation starting in 2009. In Lebanon, despite the importance of export to the Lebanese econ- omy, there is currently no export promotion strategy. Although a law was drafted in 2006 for the creation of an export promotion agency, it is not yet operational. A number of efforts by both the public and pri- vatesector(andsupportedbydonorinstitutions)arepromotingLeba- nese exports and companies in the industrial/manufacturing sector. Furthermore,thereareanumberofEU-fundedprojectssuchasaqual- ity upgrading programme for exports to the EU (Qualeb) and the in- tegrated SME support programme (in collaboration with the Chamber of Commerce, Industry and Agriculture) which have an export promo- tion component for SMEs. The Investment Development Authority of Lebanon is also known for other export promotion and matchmaking, although its efforts are concentrated on the agricultural sector. Trade Point,partoftheglobalinformationnetwork,wasestablishedinLeba- non in 1996. Based in the Ministry of Economy andTrade,Trade Point\u2019s objective is to facilitate trade between Lebanese and foreign partners through matchmaking, provision of statistical information, etc. In Algeria, and Syria, most of the activities to support export promotion occur ad hoc. However, Algeria has established an export promotion agency (ALGEX) with a wide mandate to promote non-hydrocarbon exports and Syria has a national Commission to Promote and Develop (non-oil) Exports.

In addition the MED countries have signed bilateral free trade agree- ments among themselves and with Turkey, a member of the Euro-Med trade cooperation.

AG R E E M E N TS O N CO N F O R M I T Y A S S E S S M E N T A N D ACC E P TA N C E O F I N D U S T R I A L P R O D U C TS ( AC A A S) The basic requirements for an ACAA (agreement on conformity assess- ment and acceptance of industrial products) between the European Communities and their Member States, and a partner country, are leg- islative alignment and the necessary infrastructure capacity for imple- mentation of that legislation. The ACAA concept has been designed for industrial product sectors covered by new or old approach legisla- tion (30) , i.e. those industrial sectors where legislation is harmonised at Community level. The ACAA concept is based on the experience of the PECA (31) agreements concluded with some candidate countries in the pre-accession phase. The horizontal legislation covering standards, metrology, certification, accreditation infrastructure and market surveillance in accordance with the EU system in these areas must be transposed and implemented by the partner country. Institutionally, the separation between the regulatory, standardisation, accreditation and certification functions is necessary for proper implementation of the legislation. Ideally, public authorities should retain solely legislative and enforcement (market surveillance) functions and ensure that the system of third-party con- formity assessment to regulatory requirements has sufficient technical competence and independence by means of competent and recog- nised accreditation. Standards should be voluntary technical specifications. For each prior- ity sector, all relevant harmonised European standards will need to be adopted as national standards and consequently all conflicting national standardswillhavetobewithdrawn.Thepartnercountrystandardisation body should implement EU and international standards. They should be affiliate members of the European and international organisations. Accreditation is the means used in the designation of conformity as- sessment bodies. It gives formal recognition of competence to carry out specific conformity assessment tasks. The partner country should establishitsownnationalaccreditationbodyandshouldseeksignatory statustothemultilateralrecognitionagreementsoperatedatEuropean and international levels. Certification by a conformity assessment body is the procedure by which a third party gives written assurance that a product, process or serviceconformstothespecifiedrequirements.Conformityassessment bodies from partner countries should be assessed to determine if they are technically competent and capable of carrying out the relevant conformity assessment procedure, and can demonstrate the necessary level of independence, impartiality and integrity. Thelegislativealignmentandinfrastructurecapacitymustbeinplaceand verified before the official negotiations on the agreement can begin. The prioritysectorsidentifiedwillneedtobeinstableform(legislationaligned and implemented with the relevant infrastructure in place) with a realistic expectation to come into force before the initialling of the agreement. The ACAA is seen as a mechanism to facilitate the free movement of goodsintheinternalmarket.Theadoptionofcommonregulatorystruc- tures could also contribute to the longer-term goal of a Mediterranean free trade area.The adoption of an ACAA will be a strategic partnership withtheEU,increasingstabilityandprosperitywithpoliticaladvantage. The ACAA will also contribute towards upgrading of the quality infra- structure and technical development in the partner country. The advantages for partner countries include: \u2022 free movement of goods into the EU/EEA area; \u2022 onceanACAAisconcludedwithotherpartnercountriesinthesamesec- tors, the possibility of the free movement of goods into their territory also (i.e. regional area for free movement of goods in specific sectors); \u2022 recognition of coherence with the EU system; \u2022 upgrading of quality infrastructure; \u2022 improved safety of products on basis of EU experience; \u2022 reduced cost for industries of conformity assessment procedures as the tests will be done locally; \u2022 encouragement for local enterprises to innovate.

Once the ACAA is con- cluded with many Mediterranean partner countries, there might be a possibility for free circulation of industrial products in specific sectors in the region.

A work programme detailing the actions to be taken to reach an ACAA has been set up in some countries, describing tasks, responsibilities and deadlines. Mostcountries(Algeria,Egypt,Israel,Jordan,Lebanon,MoroccoandTu- nisia) have submitted some pieces of horizontal and sectoral legislation to Commission services. Commission services have verified their com- patibility with the acquis and have helped the countries to identify the regulatory gaps to be bridged. After full alignment, this draft legislation should go through adoption by partner countries\u2019 parliaments. Many countries are benefiting from technical assistance projects to support them in the harmonisation of their legislation. Most countries (Algeria, Egypt, Israel, Jordan, Lebanon, Morocco and Tunisia) have started to adopt harmonised European standards in their priority sectors and to abolish conflicting national standards. Jordan has finalised the adoption of the harmonised European standards in the toys sector and Egypt for low-voltage equipment. Most countries (Algeria, Egypt, Jordan, Lebanon, Morocco andTunisia) have started to upgrade and restructure their quality infrastructure, including their conformity assessment bodies. Quality infrastructure in Israel has an adequate level. Many countries (Algeria, Israel, Jordan, Lebanon and Morocco) already have internationally accredited labo- ratories in one or two of their priority sectors. Many countries have benefited from technical assistance projects in upgrading their infra- structure. Egypt, Israel, Jordan and Tunisia are affiliated members of the Europe- anCommitteeforStandardisation(CEN);IsraelandTunisiaareaffiliated members of the European Committee for Electrotechnical Standardi- sation (Cenelec). Israel has signed bilateral agreements with Euro- pean Cooperation for Accreditation (EA); Egypt and Israel are liaison members of the European Association of National Metrology Institutes (Euramet). Most countries have technical assistance projects that support: har- monisation of technical regulations; the adoption of standards; the upgrading of conformity assessment bodies, standardisation bodies and accreditation bodies; and the setting up of an efficient market sur- veillance system.Twinning projects run by experts from Member States in the partner countries provide a real transfer of know-how and ex- change of experience.To meet the needs of partner countries, seminars providing in-depth explanation of the EU acquis, short-term EU expert visits in the countries or partner countries\u2019 expert visits in EU Member States are regularly organised. No partner country is ready to sign the agreement but two or three of them could be ready by 2009\u201310. 5.4. Synthesis Of the three subdimensions analysed above the most problematic across the entire MED region is that related to the ACAAs, where sig- nificant efforts are needed to move forward in the legislative alignment and to strengthen the institutional framework. There have been achievements in a number of MED countries (Israel, Egypt,MoroccoandTunisia)inthecomputerisationoftradeprocedures and in the dissemination of trade information. The countries that are only starting to work on the simplification and computerisation of for- eign trade procedures, such as Algeria and Syria, could learn from those experiences. Page 59 ",
        "Page 60 The operational and institutional framework for supporting exporters is still far from complete across the MED region. Israel has a framework that compares well with that of OECD countries, while Egypt, Tunisia and to a certain extent Morocco have set the basis for a more proac- tive export policy. All other countries, and in particular the oil- and gas- exporting countries, have to invest in this area, starting with elaborat- ing well-structured export promotion strategies and strengthening the institutions in charge of export promotion and the provision of services to exporters. 5.0 4.0 3.0 2.0 1.0 0.0 A l g e r i a E g y p t I s r a e l L e b a n o n J o r d a n M o r o c c o P a l e s t i n i a n A u t h o r i t y S y r i a T u n i s i a Figure 12 : Dimension 5 overall scores ",

Most have taken steps to establish key components of an innovation system. These efforts have tended to concentrate on fostering linkages between business and university, developing business incubators, upgrading human capital, and implementing a range of enterprise-level tech- nology upgrading ( mise \u00e0 niveau ) programmes (some of which have a sector-specific focus). However, with the exception of Israel, MED countries have yet to take a significant position on the global stage as sources of technological innovation. While all MED countries have launchedinitiativesonresearchandinnovation,thevolumeofinvest- ment in R & D is limited for the region as a whole and in a number of casesthedevelopmentofacomprehensiveinnovationstrategyisstill incipient. 6.2. Assessment framework In this context, the assessment framework for Dimension 6 of the Euro- Med Charter for Enterprise includes four indicators (primarily related to technological innovation): \u2022 6.1.Thefirstindicatorlooksattheextentofdevelopmentofanover- arching strategy on enterprise innovation and R & D. It examines the process that led to the strategy, the key features of the strategy and the commitment of resources. The emphasis is on linkages to uni- versities and research centres as sources of \u2018radical innovation\u2019 (i.e. innovation that is research-based and more far-reaching than the incremental improvements in products and processes that in many firms are a feature of everyday business development). \u2022 6.2. The second indicator looks more specifically at government ac- tion to foster innovation networks, linking firms to technology and research centres, and promoting inter-firm cooperation. \u2022 6.3. The third indicator captures information on support for innova- tive firms, with an emphasis on financial support measures, includ- ing financial engineering to generate venture capital. This subdi- mension also examines the process by which support is designed. \u2022 6.4. The fourth indicator considers a specific instrument for develop- inginnovativeenterprises:businessincubation.Theindicatorincludes information on the presence and development of an incubation strat- egy, the expansion of incubation schemes and the adoption of opera- tional standards considered best practice in the OECD context.

Analysis INNOVATION POLICY AND SUPPORT TO INNOVATIVE FIRMS In OECD economies, policymakers concerned with accelerating inno- vation focus their attention on a wide range of institutional and policy settings. This breadth of focus reflects the fact that innovation is an outcomeofmultipleeconomicandinstitutionalconditions.Thesecon- ditions range from the quality of physical and virtual infrastructure to the level of available skills, degree of competition in markets, tax treat- ment of R & D, sophistication of markets providing services to business (including specialised forms of finance) and the broader environment enabling business growth. There is no configuration of policy settings thatguaranteesanoptimallevelofinnovation.Progressmustbeaimed for across the board, with governments and other stakeholders finding the mix of policy measures most apt for each circumstance. However, policy must recognise that innovation takes many forms and varies across companies of different sizes and across sectors. For instance, research shows that innovation in SMEs is project- rather than portfolio-based and tends to generate innovations of lower value than in larger firms. And radical innovation in SMEs usually arises in only a few sectors, while incremental innovation is impor- tant in SMEs in all sectors. Innovation in SMEs also depends crucially on external linkages and skills, capital and knowledge.This external dependence reflects the limited internal division of labour present in most small firms. Indeed, a lack of partners is often cited by SMEs as the most significant barrier to innovation, with finance and skills also being important (32) . Hence the appropriateness of indicator 6.2 and its concentration on networks, as well as the focus on busi- ness incubators (indicator 6.4) (which should foster information and knowledge-sharing among firms co-located on the incubator\u2019s premises).

E N H A N C I N G E N T E R P R I S E I N N OVAT I O N The policy framework for innovation in the MED countries is highly differentiated. A number of countries have innovation-related pro- grammes but have not yet adopted a comprehensive innovation strat- egy.Withsomevariation,theseincludethePalestinianAuthority(which has no innovation strategy) and Lebanon and Syria (where innovation strategies are currently being formulated). Jordan is also at the early stages of strategy formulation, but an e-trans- action law has come into effect and plans are under way for promoting e-government, e-commerce and e-finance, and using information and communicationstechnologyineducation.Moroccohasalsoprepareda national e-strategy (e-Maroc 2010) to be launched under the guidance of a committee presided by the Prime Minister and comprising repre- sentatives of the public and private sectors. Egypt and Tunisia both achieve relatively high scores on this indicator. In Egypt\u2019s case, innovation is a centrepiece of the country\u2019s industrial development strategy. Egypt is home to a significant number of inno- vation-related institutions, including many technology-related institu- tions operating in fields ranging from plastics to furniture. And Tunisia has implemented a wide-ranging set of innovation-related policies in- cluding the industrial upgrading programme (1996), a law on technop- oles (2001), the industrial modernisation programme (2003) and a law on competitive clusters (2006). University\u2013industry linkages are many, and the creation of an agency for the promotion of research and inno- vation is set for 2008. Furthermore, Tunisia possesses one of the most highly skilled workforces in the region, a critical factor given the central role of skills in the development and absorption of new technologies and work practices. E S TA B L I S H M E N T O F I N N OVAT I O N A N D T E C H N O LO G Y C E N T R E S International experience demonstrates that technology and innovation centres must be demand-oriented.This is essential in terms of financial sustainability (bringing about a degree of cost-recovery from fees for services). It is also essential in terms of relevance: willingness-to-pay is an ideal measure of usefulness, and even cash-starved small firms will often find a way to pay for services that provide benefits that exceed costs. Such centres also need to be proactive in their outreach to the SME sector because entrepreneurs in many small firms are not fully awareofalltheirassistanceneeds,andareoftenunabletodedicatesig- nificant time to the search for reliable partners and sources of advice.

        "Page 63 Most of the MED countries possess innovation and technology centres, although the number, sophistication and track record of these institu- tions varies considerably. Egypt stands out in terms of institutional strength in this area. A network of technology transfer and innovation centres (ETTIC) has been created within the Ministry ofTrade and Industry. Each is privately managed and has a board that includes representatives from the private sector. Public funding is significant, but services are also charged for, helping to pro- vide a demand orientation. These centres also cooperate with technol- ogy transfer organisations internationally, particularly in Europe. In Morocco, by July 2004, 16 structures existed to facilitate university\u2013 industry linkages. In addition, 17 skills centres and nine industrial technical centres were established between 1996 and 2007, along with a variety of other projects such as the R\u00e9seau de diffusion tech- nologique (RDT), R\u00e9seau Maroc incubation et essaimage (RIME), R\u00e9seau g\u00e9nie industriel (RGI), the Innov\u2019act programme and the Eureka pro- gramme. Tunisia has a national programme of technopoles, and various public research centres in fields deemed strategic. The STREN network (R\u00e9seau d\u2019\u00e9change des r\u00e9sultats scientifiques et technologiques) aims to foster cooperation betweenTunisia and the EU in the field of innovation. Jordan is establishing 50 technology transfer units in different academ- ic institutions, private sector companies and research centres through support to the research and technological development project (SRTD) funded by the European Commission.

S U P P O R T F O R I N N OVAT I V E E N T E R P R I S E S The range of potential support schemes for innovative enterprises is broad, and a number of MED countries are engaging the private sector in service provision. A set of support initiatives is under development in Algeria, with financial support foreseen for SMEs developing innovative projects, in addition to significant fiscal exemptions for companies investing in R & D. Major resources are allocated for support programmes in Egypt. No- tably, the Industrial Modernisation Centre (IMC) and the Ministry of State forScientificResearchhavesignedacooperationprotocolforafundofEUR 12 million to link industry with R & D. The IMC also organises the National Awards for Excellence, which encompasses innovation. And the Ministry of Higher Education and Scientific Research recently announced a grants pro- gramme provided by the EU\u2013Egypt Innovation Fund (EEIF), the main com- ponent of the research, development and innovation (RDI) programme. FundedbytheEuropeanCommission,theRDIprogrammeshouldenhance Egypt\u2019s economic growth and international competitiveness. The EEIF will support projects for applied research on a competitive basis. Israel\u2019s outstanding position in technological development is in part due to a government policy of support for industrial R & D of the Office oftheChiefScientistattheIsraeliMinistryofIndustry,TradeandLabour (see Box 7). Jordan\u2019s\u2018Upgrading and modernisation programme\u2019(JUMP) was estab- lished as part of a governmental commitment to develop companies\u2019 managerial capabilities and technological capacities. JUMP works as an umbrella for all industrial upgrading activities. It is managed by a board of 12 members from the private and public sectors, and headed by the Minister for Industry andTrade. However, JUMP is financially and administratively independent. Fiscal provisions also aim to support R & D and training. In Lebanon, business development centres have been established in four regions with financial support from the EU. The centres bring together a range of partners including universities, chambers of com- merce, municipal governments and private firms all aiming to help firms become more innovative. A private company, Berytech, was awarded the business innovation centre (BIC) quality certification by the European business network, based on 18 excellence criteria. Bery- tech became the first centre in the Middle East to obtain this certifica- tion. Lebanon also operates a financial guarantee scheme for innova- tive firms. Morocco and Tunisia provide a host of support programmes. Mo- rocco offers tax incentives for investment in R & D and subsidies for business services supporting innovation, along with programmes aimed at introducing e-business applications in SMEs, support in project management, training, a scheme to make use of the business skills of expatriated Moroccans, and a seed capital fund for innova- tive start-ups. Box 7: Israel\u2019s approach to funding start-ups The Office of the Chief Scientist (OCS) is part of Israel\u2019s Ministry of Industry, Trade and Labour. With a budget of around USD 300 million, it runs a suite of programmes to support entrepreneurs through grants and loans: it delivers critical seed funds to selected companies engaged in R & D projects. OCS support not only pro- vides financial assistance to the entrepreneurs, it also sends an important signal to the venture capital community through rigor- ous due diligence and other tests it applies prior to disbursement. Contrary to typical government practice, the OCS can earn roy- alties on sales if a start-up becomes a commercial success. These royalties are then used to co-fund future grants (along with public funds). The main OCS programmes are: \u2022 theR&DFund,opentoallIsraelifirmswishingtoengageintech- nological R & D; grants are provided as a percentage (up to 50 %) of the total approved R & D expenditures; the grants constitute a conditional loan: a commercial success pays royalties (3\u20135 % of the value of sales) whereas cases of non-commercialisation involve no royalty payment; \u2022 technological incubators; \u2022 a pre-seed fund (theTNUFA programme); \u2022 Matimop (Israeli Industry Center for R & D); \u2022 bi-national funds supporting technological collaborations; \u2022 Magnet and Magneton consortia. The OCS also runs several programmes that support basic and applied research in generic technologies. ",
        "Page 64 B U S I N E S S I N C U B ATO R S International experience suggests that business development should take centre stage over job creation in the design and evaluation of in- cubation programmes. Job creation is best attained through successful business outcomes. OECD experience also indicates that the develop- ment of professional incubator associations should be encouraged in order to disseminate best practices, create benchmarks and implement training (indeed, the success of incubation programmes often turns on the quality of management). Associations can also create accreditation programmes. It is therefore encouraging to see that a national incuba- tor association (the Egyptian Incubator Association) serves as the ex- ecutive agency for Egypt\u2019s Social Fund for Development. Broader initiatives to raise interest in entrepreneurship should comple- ment incubation, in order to raise demand for incubation services. In- cubation sponsors should aim to achieve scale (many of the incubation initiatives in the region accommodate only a small number of firms): greater scale opens possibilities for cost and risk reduction, as well as theleveragingofprivatefinance.Whenitisgiven,publicsupportshould come at the initial stages, not through the subsidy of operational costs. Without exposure to commercial disciplines, the incubator is unlikely to provide competitive services. Business incubators are a widely used policy instrument in the MED re- gion. For instance, in Jordan seven incubators are in operation, all of which are donor funded. Furthermore, many academic and business institutions have established business incubators, including the Jordan Forum for Business and Professional Women and the JordanYoung En- trepreneurs Association. In Morocco, 12 incubators operate, and a need for better exit strategies has been identified. Syria has a number of in- cubators, including the InformationTechnology Incubator in Damascus and 40 incubators in rural development centres. Tunisia has a national programme, launched in 1999, to establish incubators in higher educa- tion institutions, following a framework agreement between the Minis- tries of Higher Education and Industry.The Palestinian Authority is also exploring a strategy on business incubators, and currently operates a small number of pilot incubators (usually funded by donor organisa- tions), the best known being the Palestine Information and Communi- cationTechnology Incubator (PICTI). Incubators have been established with a variety of objectives. For in- stance, encouraging local entrepreneurship, favouring innovative busi- ness projects and supporting entrepreneurship among university grad- uates are all goals of the incubation programme supported by Algeria\u2019s Ministry of Small and Medium Enterprise. EgypthassetuptechnologyincubatorswithintheMinistryofTradeand Industry.OneexampleistheFashionandDesignCentre,providingtech- nical assistance, training, financial support and mentoring. Other incu- bator schemes and technology parks are under study. An Incubators Department also operates within the Social Fund for Development. Careful evaluation of incubation programmes is essential. Experience with the incubation instrument in some OECD countries has been dis- appointing, and in many cases the evidence base with which to judge success is weak. It would be unfortunate if MED countries were to re- peat patterns of error experienced in the OECD area.To help avoid this, it could be advantageous for incubation associations in the MED area, as well as public agencies responsible for incubation programmes, to develop links with highly experienced industry bodies such as the Na- tional Business Incubation Association (NBIA) in the United States, or the United Kingdom Business Incubation (UKBI). 6.4. Synthesis Thischapterhasprovidedanoverviewoftheinnovationsupportlandscape for enterprises in the MED countries. Public support has tended to con- centrate on creating linkages between business and centres of research, developingbusinessincubatorsandprovidingvariousformsofenterprise- level technology upgrading. But in many countries the development of a comprehensive innovation strategy is still in the early stages. MED countries generally invest relatively small shares of their national wealthinR&D.Thisinvestmentsharewillneedtoriseifinnovationisto expand significantly. However, in strategic terms, some developmental advantages can result from being a technology follower, rather than a technology leader. This can occur if domestic firms eventually benefit fromR&Dthatispaidforabroad.Buttoabsorbforeigntechnologyand reap such a \u2018second-mover\u2019 advantage requires an overall policy envi- ronment that is conducive to innovation, along with many well-trained engineers and scientists, abundant access to technical information, and extensive private and public technical support, especially for SMEs. Future work on innovation in the enterprise sector in the MED countries couldgivegreaterfocustothepreciseoperationsofdifferentprogrammes. Aroundtheglobe,similarsupportprogrammes(incubators,equityguaran- teeschemes,trainingorotherschemes)haveprovidedexamplesofsuccess as well as examples of failure. Success sometimes depends on subtle dis- tinctions in programme design and implementation. For instance, business incubators often fail to generate the benefits they could because incubator managers do not encourage the sharing of information on areas of com- monconcerntomostbusinesses,suchascash-flowmanagement.Andgov- ernments often rush to build incubation schemes, spending public funds unnecessarily on buildings (when guarantees against rents for private pro- viders of real estate have worked well in many OECD countries). Similarly, public policy often concentrates on the supply of funds for investment in innovative SMEs, when the evidence suggests that improving investment proposals in potential investee firms is more crucial. Further work at the programmelevelisneededtohelpshareknowledgeaboutbestpracticein the design and implementation of support for innovation in SMEs. ",
        "Page 65 In addition, it cannot be emphasised too strongly that skills \u2014 spe- cific technical skills, as well as foundation skills such as literacy, nu- meracy and problem-solving \u2014 are at the heart of any country\u2019s innovation performance.Therefore, it will be vital to assess the effec- tiveness and efficiency of national education and training systems. Success in this area will go beyond the obvious focus on tertiary edu- cation and adult learning, important though these are. It will require long-term investments that begin with a focus on early childhood education. This is a cost-effective way for governments to develop in young people the cognitive skills and positive attitudes to learn- ingthatwillmakethemopentoacquiringvocationalandspecialised technical skills. 5.0 4.0 3.0 2.0 1.0 0.0 A l g e r i a E g y p t I s r a e l L e b a n o n J o r d a n M o r o c c o P a l e s t i n i a n A u t h o r i t y S y r i a T u n i s i a Figure 14 : Dimension 6 overall scores ",
        "Page 66 7.1. Introduction Effective mechanisms enabling public\u2013private consultation are es- sential to improve the quality of government policy towards the pri- vate enterprise sector. Consultations are critical to fill the information gap between government and the enterprise world, build consensus around key policy objectives and understand how government meas- ures affect the private sector. Successful public\u2013private dialogue re- quires an open and transparent approach by policymakers and gov- ernment bodies in charge of policy elaboration and implementation. It also calls for strong business associations to represent the diverse members of the business community, engage in a multi-level dialogue (ranging from participation in working groups to high-level consulta- tions), respond to government initiatives and propose constructive solutions to enterprise policy issues.The ultimate responsibility for the country\u2019seconomicpolicy,thestructureofthelegalandregulatoryen- vironment, fiscal policy and the allocation of public funds belongs to the government and the political leadership. It is up to policymakers to find the right balance among all the different interests. Public\u2013private sector consultations are not a substitute to political initiative, but they can help avoid costly mistakes. They enable the government and the privatesectortofindreasonablesolutionsandmoreoptimaloutcomes topolicyissues,oftensuperiortothoseelaboratedbythepublicsector acting alone. However, in order to produce a positive tangible impact, consultations have to go well beyond the simple exchange of informa- tion; furthermore, the process should not be derailed by narrow inter- ests of private sector groups, nor by the immediate political considera- tions of public counterparts. 7.2. Assessment framework The assessment framework of Dimension 7 is based on two building blocks, or subdimensions. The first deals with public\u2013private consulta- tion practices by assessing the main features of the consultation frame- work,frequencyofconsultationsanddegreeofopennessandtranspar- ency. The second subdimension focuses on private associations and in particular on their advocacy functions, i.e. their ability to present the views of their members to policymakers and to influence government policy, their internal governance rules and their provision of services to members. Strong private sector associations are needed to channel information to private enterprises and particularly to SMEs, which can benefit from guidance in dealing with administrative and tax obliga- tions or in applying for government support schemes.

        "Page 67 7.3. Analysis P U B L I C\u2013P R I V AT E CO N S U LTAT I O N S The practice of social dialogue in the MED countries is widespread, involving government, trade unions and private sector employers, dealing primarily with broad policy issues such as wage policy, tax and the content of the budget law. However, these tripartite consultations are often turned into opportunities to forge consensus around govern- ment objectives rather than to conduct specific policy discussions. There is, instead, relatively less experience, in some of the MED coun- tries, in establishing a constructive policy dialogue with private sector organisations around specific enterprise policy issues, such as access to finance, innovation and service provision to enterprises (both on the side of the government and the private sector).Therefore, although the MEDaveragescoreforthesubdimensionisrelativelyhighat3.5,thereis a significant variance in the country performances across the region. According to EU and OECD experience, effective consultations should be organised around an agreed and well-structured framework. They have to be conducted regularly, at various levels, not only on the occa- sion of major policy measures or in response to critical situations. Dia- logue should be taking place at multiple levels, from involving private sector experts in the technical work to conducting high-level consul- tations. Consultations have to be well prepared; for instance, govern- ment proposals have to be presented to private sector organisations well in advance, allowing enough time for representatives of the pri- vate sector to study the proposals and consult with their members.The government must be open to discussion with the most representative private sector organisations, avoiding discriminations based on politi- calaffiliationsandeconomicinfluence.Forexample,governmentsmust avoid choosing to work with the representatives of large enterprises, neglecting SME and professional associations. Governments must be ready to review policy proposals and alternative measures proposed by the private sector. The content of consultations must be made pub- lic to avoid collusion with special groups of insiders, and governments should regularly report on the implementation of measures agreed at the consultation table. In the MED region, there are currently several models of consultation framework related to enterprise policy issues, responding to different enterprisepolicylegalandpoliticaltraditions.However,withintheMED region, it is possible to identify three groups of countries. \u2022 The first group is made up of countries that have a relatively stable, open consultation framework and adopted a number of good prac- tices mentioned above. This group includes Egypt, Israel and the Palestinian Authority. \u2022 The second group consists of Jordan, Morocco and Tunisia, coun- tries that have put in place consultation mechanisms, but do not have all the elements of the framework equally developed. Jordan and Morocco are, for instance, relatively weaker on frequency, and Tunisia on openness and transparency. \u2022 The third group is made up of Algeria, Lebanon and Syria, countries in which the consultation mechanisms are still in a phase of develop- ment (Algeria and Syria) or are not fully operating due to political in- stability affecting government operations, as in the case of Lebanon. The analysis conducted below highlights differences in consultation practices across the MED region. In Israel, Morocco and Tunisia, there are highly institutionalised con- sultation systems and private sector representation is assigned to one umbrella organisation. In Israel, all major economic policy decisions are discussed in advance by the government with the Manufacturers As- sociation of Israel (MAI), the sole body representing the private sector in high-level consultations. However, this centralised system is comple- mentedbyanintensedialogueconductedatalowerlevel,withthepar- ticipation of experts nominated by the Federation of Israeli Chamber of Commerce and Lahav (chamber of independent organisations in Israel) in working groups and commissions. There is a longstanding practice of public\u2013private sector cooperation, including the participation of private sector organisations in monitoring and assessing the impact of government measures. In Morocco, the employers\u2019association (CGEM) is often consulted in dis- cussions of important government decisions and finance law. The revi- sion of the work code in 2004 and the presentation of the Livre Blanc (an action plan which contains suggestions for the development of a vibrant economy and for SME development in Morocco) by CGEM to the government in January 2008 are examples of the inclusion of the private sector in public decision-making. Morocco sets an example for diversified and open policy dialogue in public\u2013private consultation: for instance, THE ANPME (the national SME agency) conducts regular con- sultations with private sector organisations and major stakeholders on a wide range of policy issues. In Tunisia, the law assigns to the Union Tunisienne de l\u2019Industrie, du Commerce et de l\u2019Artisanat (UTICA) the role of sole institutional repre- sentative of the private sector. The government therefore has a unique counterpart in public\u2013private consultations: UTICA is represented in all the main policymaking bodies as well as on the board of executive gov- ernment agencies. Although the consultations are well organised, they do not yet systematically monitor the impact of government measures using independent evaluation systems. In other countries, the consultation mechanisms are less structured, conducted at various tables, and involve a number of private sector organisations. In Egypt, private sector organisations help shape government poli- cies. For instance, the Egyptian National Competitiveness Council has emerged as a leading forum for policy analysis and debate. Since several members of the current government economic team come from the private sector, understanding has greatly improved and the government has adopted a more open attitude towards private sec- tor proposals. The Palestinian Authority has traditionally had a policy of open and intense dialogue with numerous private sector organisa- tions and NGOs. The Palestinian Authority has also established a Na- tional Economic Dialogue Committee. In addition, the Prime Minister meets several times a year with representatives of private sector or- ganisations. In Jordan there is an established practice of public\u2013pri- vate consultations and a good degree of openness and transparency; however, consultations are mostly conducted on an ad hoc but fre- quent basis. Lebanon has a tradition of relatively open dialogue, but there is no structured consultation framework and the dialogue is conducted mostly on an ad hoc basis. In Syria, public\u2013private dialogue is devel- ",
        "Page 68 oping, although the consultation framework is still relatively weak. Private sector organisations, namely the Chamber of Commerce and the Federation of the Chambers of Industry, are formally consulted during the elaboration of legislative measures and the five-year eco- nomic plan. In Algeria, the framework for public\u2013private dialogue is still relatively weak. However, the government has established a National Consulta- tive Council for the Promotion of SMEs and it has brought representa- tives of the private sector into the drafting of the country\u2019s industrial strategy.

On the other hand,itcanquestiontheefficiencyoftheadvocacyfunctionsoflargeand horizontal organisations, and in particular their capacity to meet the de- mandforrepresentationcomingfromtheenterprisesectorandtogivean equal voice to the different categories of enterprises, including MSMEs. Thereistheriskthatlargecentralisedorganisationstendtorepresentthe interests of their more powerful members and special interest groups, playing upon the influence of large companies versus SMEs, and incum- bents versus new entrants. It is also important that those private sector organisations apply clear and transparent internal governance rules. In the majority of the MED countries, the two main groups of private sector organisations are the system of chambers of commerce and in- dustry, and the employers\u2019 or manufacturers\u2019 associations. In addition, mostofthecountriesalsohaveactiveprofessionalandsectoralassocia- tions, as well as bilateral chambers of commerce and SME associations; but they tend to play a subordinate role in relation to the major organi- sations and they are often either federated or associated to one of the two groups of organisations. The chambers of commerce and industry in Algeria, Morocco andTuni- sia are organisations of public interest with a status determined by law and a well-defined institutional role. Membership is compulsory, with membership fees set in relation to company size.Therefore these types of chambers have a very wide membership, with a clear prevalence of SMEs, handicrafts persons and microenterprises.The chambers of com- merce and industry (particularly those with compulsory membership) act as a partner to government. Given their widespread membership baseamongMSMEsandtheirstronglocalroots,theyaremoreengaged in dialogue at the national level on issues of trade, retailing, transport, construction, handicrafts, etc. The chambers of commerce and industry in the Mashreq countries of the MED region tend to operate as non-profit organisations with voluntary membership. This gives them a strong advocacy role and reinforces their independence, but makes them representative of only a cross-section of the enterprise population, usually made up of the larger and more organised enterprises. In both models, the local chambers are organised in a national federation. As the chair- manship of the chamber federation is a position of high prestige, the nomination usually goes to a highly respected and influential busi- ness person. The chambers have extensive local networks and provide a number of official services, such as the delivery of certificates of origins and the carnet ATA (a tool used to simplify customs procedures), as well as a widerangeofbusinessservicesfortheirmembers.Thelargestandbet- ter organised chambers of commerce and industry conduct training services for their members and are active on the international trade front. The employers\u2019 or manufacturers\u2019 associations tend to represent the larger and more organised enterprises. The associations are gener- ally structured by territorial and sectoral associations, each one with a relatively high degree of autonomy and federated at national level. In addition to the advocacy function, they provide a range of services to their members, disseminating technical and commercial information, organising training courses and helping their members in dealing with government agencies and organisations. Taking a broad overview of the private sector organisations in the MED countries, the assessment shows that Israel, Egypt, Morocco, the Pales- tinian Authority and Tunisia have well-structured organisations, active in advocacy and providing services to their members. In Lebanon and Jordan, private sector organisations are strong in advocacy, but less in service provision. In Algeria and Syria private sector organisations have still relatively weak advocacy functions, but they are improving the range of services offered to their members. In Israel, the MAI is the sole representative body of all industrial sectors. Itrepresentsmorethan2000companies(directmembersandaffiliates) and its president serves as chairman of the Federation of Israeli Eco- nomic Organisations (a body that encompasses 15 organisations from all economic sectors). MAI has a well-staffed Department of Economic Researchandstrategythatmonitorseconomictrends,conductsregular company surveys and elaborates policy proposals. ",

InEgypt,thereisextensiveconsultationwiththeFederationofEgyptian Industries (FEI) in developing Egypt\u2013EU cooperation. There is also pri- vate sector involvement in decision-making thanks to the appointment of leading businesspersons to high-level Cabinet positions. In Jordan there are two key private sector associations: the Chamber of Industry (uniting all the individual chambers into one organisation) and the Union of Trade Chambers (representing all trade chambers in Jordan). The Chamber of Industry hosts several service programmes for its members that include training and public seminars. The Cham- ber of Industry is home to the European Information Centre, a master\u2019s programme in business administration in collaboration with Durham University and a business training programme funded by the European Commission. In Lebanon, the Chamber of Commerce, Industry and Agriculture, the Association of Lebanese Industrialists, and other private sector associa- tions (sector-specific trade associations, professional associations, eco- nomic associations) perform advocacy functions and provide a limited range of services for their members. The Palestinian Authority has several private sector organisations (33) and NGOs representing civil society with a traditionally central role in proposing and addressing enterprise policy issues and providing sup- porttolocalenterprises,balancingtherelativeweaknessofgovernment institutions and providing a valuable channel for donor assistance. In Algeria, private sector organisations are still refining their advocacy and service functions, reflecting the limited diversification of the econ- omy.The main institutional private sector representative is the Algerian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, but in addition there are several employers\u2019and professional organisations, such the Centre des Jeunes Dirigeants (CJD), the Conf\u00e9d\u00e9ration G\u00e9n\u00e9rale des Entreprises Alg\u00e9ri- ennes (with more than 14 000 members) and the Employers Forum. In Syria, the Federation of the Syrian Chambers of Industry and Com- merce has traditionally represented the private sector and has been the main service provider to private enterprises. Over the last few years a number of associations and organisations representing the emerging private sector (such as the Mawred Businesswomen\u2019s Association and Associations of Textiles Manufacturers) have registered as NGOs. The government, with the assistance of the Syrian-European Business Cen- tre, is working on new legislation on professional associations, aiming at improving the legal status and defining the role of private sector or- ganisations. ( 33 ) For a map of private sector organisations in theWest Bank and Gaza, see http://www.portlandtrust.org/A%20Map%20of%20Palestinian%20Private%20Sector%20Development%20Organisations.pdf Box 8: Public\u2013private consultation The Palestinian Authority has traditionally had a long and deep- seated conviction in the leading and complementary role of its private sector in meeting the aims of economic development. The consultation between the government and the private sector on enterprise policy issues is particularly dynamic and transparent as a result. Private sector organisations such as the Federation of Chambers of Commerce, Palestinian Businessmen Association, Palestinian Trade Centre (Paltrade) and Palestinian Federation of Industries play a considerable role in shaping and implementing enterprise policy measures. Coordination between these institutions is led by an explicit private sector coordinating body: the Private Sector Institu- tions Coordinating Council. Several frameworks for public\u2013private consultations are in place. More than five high-profile meetings are convened each year, usual- ly involving the Prime Minister, Ministers for Economy and Finance, and other senior officials. Participants from the private sector and civil society organisations are invited and they are usually heavily represented. The agenda of the consultative meetings is circulated in advance and the private sector is given the opportunity to pro- vide inputs on the agenda and call for meetings.The minutes of the meetings are often published in the form of brochures, while main conclusions and recommendations are well covered in local media. Open invitations are also advertised in local papers. The Palestinian Authority is planning to formulate a declaration on organising public\u2013private dialogue and partnership at the Invest- ment Conference in Bethlehem (May 2008). This initiative under- scores the fact that continuous efforts are made by the Palestin- ian Authority towards real national partnership and cooperation between the public and private sectors. ",

Synthesis In relation to public\u2013private consultation frameworks and private sec- tor organisation development, the MED countries can be divided into three main groups. \u2022 The first group is Morocco, Tunisia, Israel, Egypt and the Palestin- ian Authority, where there are structured consultation frameworks, a good practice of public\u2013private dialogue at all levels, and strong and well-organised private sector organisations. \u2022 ThesecondgroupismadeupofJordanandLebanon,wherepublic\u2013 private consultations are conducted more on an ad hoc basis, but there is a good network of private sector organisations. \u2022 The third group is composed of Algeria and Syria. In these countries public\u2013private consultation practices are still limited, but evolving. Privatesectorrepresentationisstilldelegatedmainlytothechambers of commerce and industry structures and the ability of private sector organisations to autonomously advance policy proposals is limited. Over the medium term the countries belonging to the first group should aim to build a real public\u2013private partnership through the en- tire cycle of policymaking, from elaboration to implementation and finally to evaluation and impact assessment. While consultations dur- ing the policy elaboration phase are satisfactory, there is room for im- provement in the joint development of indicators and mechanisms for monitoring project implementation (although Israel and Egypt are well advancedinthisarea).Finallyitisimportantthatpublicandprivatesec- tor representatives agree on the mechanisms to evaluate the costs and benefits of government policies and assess their impact on private sec- tor development, making sure that the results of analysis are used to improve the quality of the national enterprise policy.

This will require involving the private sector organisations from the beginning of the policy elaboration phase and not (as often hap- pens now) asking for the views in the final approval phase. It will neces- sitate a regular consultation calendar and agreement on a system for the timely circulation of information. It is equally important that while fixing those rules and procedures, mechanisms are put in place to as- sure a good level of openness and transparency, with full disclosure of the consultation results.

The enterprise population is rapidly changing, with the development of new sectors, a new class of entrepreneurs and the opening of the econ- omies. Governments have to make an effort to listen to the new entre- preneursandpayattentiontotheneedsofthedifferentcomponentsof the enterprise world (including the micro- and small enterprises). They have to promote an open policy debate and make sure that the consul- tation process is not monopolised by well-connected incumbents and insiders. Page 71 ",
        "8.1. Introduction Dimension 8 of the Euro-Mediterranean Charter for Enterprise under- lines the importance of business support institutions in the develop- ment of the enterprise sector.This dimension focuses on both the types and ranges of service provision (i.e. from common facilities to more technical services). It also underscores the importance of the quality of services available to meet the diverse needs of enterprises in their establishment and start-up phases. The ultimate test of the quality of services provided to enterprises is the willingness of firms to pay for these services. There are, however, a number of internationally recog- nisedgoodpracticesinthedesignofbusinesssupportwhichbydefault set parameters for evaluation.These good practices include but are not limited to: \u2022 offering services throughout the territory to promote enterprise development beyond the capital and main metropolitan areas; \u2022 engaging in public\u2013private partnerships to ensure sustainability and buy-in from enterprises; \u2022 personalising services to meet the unique needs of each enterprise; \u2022 using technology to bridge the information gap and advertise the availability of services; \u2022 monitoring and evaluating to improve existing schemes and better adapt services to enterprises\u2019needs; \u2022 investing in building infrastructure such as industrial parks/zones and ready-to-use premises which are at the disposal of entrepre- neurs. Business support schemes take a variety of forms and can be financed from different sources of funding. Whatever the design of a particular business support scheme, putting into practice the criteria listed above can help create an enabling environment for the enterprise sector in a given community. The right policy mix can increase the chance of sur- vival for a local entrepreneur, and in the best of cases can serve as a launching pad for new business activities. 8.2. Assessment framework The assessment framework for Dimension 8 takes into account inter- nationally recognised good practice as outlined in the action lines of the Charter; however, it is also adapted to capture the various schemes and services which are offered in the MED region.Two types of schemes are generally available throughout the MED countries: those which seek to support new entrepreneurs and start-ups, and those which aim to provide services for established firms. The term \u2018start-ups\u2019 refers to newly created enterprises which have a limited operating history. These are typically observed in the MED region as family-run, micro- or small enterprises, many of them operating in low value-added service and light manufacturing industries. The second group refers to enterprises which already have a track record of opera- tion.Withinthisgroupofestablishedbusinessestherearetwocatego- ries of firms: those demonstrating low growth and those demonstrat- ing high growth.

        "Page 73 Distinguishing between these groups of enterprises is important in the design of the indicators, as the distinction implies that govern- ment policy aimed at business service provision must take a multi- track approach: each approach must target a distinctive group of en- terprises with services addressing their different needs. To this end, the assessment framework for Dimension 8 of the Charter includes four indicators: \u2022 access to business services; \u2022 business establishment support services; \u2022 range of business services; \u2022 availability of information on business services. Business support schemes and services Range of business services Information on business service providers Access to business services Business establishment support services Figure 17 : Assessment framework Dimension 8 8.3. Analysis ACC E S S TO B U S I N E S S S E RV I C E S This indicator is relevant for assessing access to basic business services for all types of enterprises but in particular those targeted to SMEs and MSMEs, start-ups, SMEs in least developed zones, or small firms headed by young and women entrepreneurs. These basic business services are usually aimed at helping small firms overcome the problems associated with market failures in the provision of services. Often, services are pro- vided in accessing finance, in various forms of technical support and advice (such as devising a viable business plan) and in information. The programmes are usually financed by national or local governments and can be supported through a donor programme. Ideally, in a pilot phase, publicly supported business services will be offered in a limited number of locations and their cost-effectiveness thoroughly evaluated. At a more advanced stage, and based on positive evaluation findings, service centres can be spread throughout the territory, well funded and well structured. In the MED region, a variety of programmes are designed to increase access to business services. These services can be grouped into two categories: those supported by a special institution, such as business development centres (BDCs) (as in Israel, Morocco,Tunisia, Jordan, Leb- anon and Algeria); and project-based initiatives operated by NGOs or private organisations (as in Egypt, Syria and the Palestinian Authority). MED countries may have a mix of both types of service categories. In Israel, a well-established government-funded programme exists, targeting specific population groups such as the Haredim (ultra-ortho- dox Jews) and the Arab-Israeli communities. Israel has set up 28 small business development centres (MATI) that offer services in partnership with local community organisations. A number of philanthropic organi- sations also offer services to encourage young entrepreneurs to turn good ideas into successful businesses. Tunisia\u2019s programme for support services is offered through the three regional business centres in both the developed northern region of the country and the less developed southern region. Jordan\u2019s enhanced productivity centres (IRADA) can provide services to start-ups with a minimum capital averaging EUR 3 600 to a maximum of EUR 63 000 and employing at least three people. In addition, there are several support entities and projects such as the BDC that provide firm-level business development services and projects financed by the National Fund for Enterprise Support (NAFES). ",
        "In Lebanon, business services offered through the BDCs target the de- velopment of SMEs. The BDCs, like those in other MED countries, part- ner with NGOs and local municipalities. Several government schemes offered through the BDCs in Algeria are still in a pilot phase, and aim to promote young entrepreneurs. In both cases, the services do not have an extensive territorial spread and do not cover the least developed zones, although in Lebanon the aim is to establish a sustainable local network throughout the country. For start-ups in Egypt, the Social Fund for Development (SFD) offers services to firms, often on a cost-sharing basis. SFD\u2019s complementary role as a microfinance institution also makes it a type of one-stop-shop in service delivery. In Syria, there is a mix of publicly and privately funded business service providers; however, most service projects (especially those targeting young entrepreneurs) are in a pilot phase. Most services in the Palestinian Authority are funded and operated through international development institutions, or donor-funded pub- licly operated initiatives. Most notable is the EU-supported programme to the Palestinian Authority that helps women entrepreneurs during the business inception phase. As noted in the overview of good practice described above, services must address the real needs of the entrepreneur and should be easily accessible. In order to gauge programme effectiveness, monitoring and evaluation are essential. In a majority of MED countries there is no sys- tematic monitoring and evaluation of such programmes.The exception is Israel, where there have been several studies conducted by research- ers in academic bodies and in-house evaluations supported by the re- spective organisations offering services. B U S I N E S S E S TA B L I S H M E N T S U P P O R T S E RV I C E S Business establishment support centres (usually industrial parks or zones) are location-specific and targeted to established enterprises. The aim is to upgrade enterprises currently performing at low levels of growth but which have high-growth potential. These programmes can also target high-growth enterprises with innovation potential. Services should address the needs of both categories of enterprises, and be available in the full range (whether provided in-house or from public or private sources that are off-site but easily accessed). The co-location of enterprises serves a number of purposes: it not only facilitates the de- velopment of networks and information sharing among firms in areas of common concern (although such outcomes usually require deliber- ate actions on the part of programme managers), it can also lower the unitcostsofprovidingservicesandbasicinfrastructure.Industrialparks or zones are also sometimes associated with other incentives for the entrepreneur to grow, such as tax incentives. Tunisia\u2019s two business establishment support programmes, the enter- prise upgrading programme (PMN) and the industrial modernisation programme (PMI), cater to low-growth and high-growth enterprises, re- spectively.ThePMNisofferedthroughoutthecountryatbusinesscentres, and has benefited nearly 4 000 enterprises through early 2008. The PMI prepares enterprises to enter the Euro-Med FTA, and therefore seeks to encourage the competitiveness of enterprises by promoting innovation. Moroccohasasimilarprogrammeaimedatenterpriseupgrading,financed bytheEU,UNIDOandanumberofbilateraldonors.Theprogrammeisop- erated out of the SME agency and has contributed to the technological and managerial upgrading of a significant number of SMEs. Establishment support services usually involve local authorities, and sometimes garner support from national authorities either indirectly (through financing) or directly (in managing the daily operations). This type of initiative should involve public\u2013private partnerships, especially among the academic/research and the business communities.Tunisia\u2019s PMI is administered through public\u2013private partnerships that ensure that the greatest number of enterprises benefit from the services. As these programmes are resource-intensive, they are often launched in a pilot phase before investments are stepped up. In a more advanced stage, there should be a wide geographic spread. Both the PMN and PMI programmes in Tunisia are funded by EU donor assistance, as are the similar enterprise upgrading programmes in Morocco and Algeria. In Syria, six industrial zones focus on the provision of basic establish- ment services. Box 9: Good practice in business support services The Government of Morocco established the Moukawalati pro- gramme to encourage entrepreneurship among youth. The pro- gramme aims to establish 30 000 small enterprises by 2008 by walk- ing young entrepreneurs through three phases. Before the creation of the enterprise, the programme helps develop a robust business plan and dossier to obtain finance. During the start-up phase, the programme helps the entrepreneur to achieve the targets set in the business plan.Then the programme accompanies the entrepre- neur for one year after the creation of the enterprise, identifying the strong and weak points of the business. Regional centres for enter- prise creation have been established in cooperation with universi- ties, banks, and other regional and national associations. Based on the success of the Moroccan model, Syria has chosen to adapt the Moukawalati programme to its own context. Page 74 ",

Goods produced in ap- proved industrial zones in Egypt, Israel and Jordan are granted duty- and quota-free access to the US market, as long as Egypt and Jordan incorporate inputs from Israel, and vice versa. This is an initiative supported by the Office of the United States Trade Representative. In Jordan the QIZ initiative is operated by the Jordanian Industrial Estates Corporation (JIEC), a public\u2013private entity. The JIEC also of- fers both tax and operational incentives to develop manufacturing industry in Jordan in annexed industrial zones. The Egyptian govern- ment also has a number of industrial zones offering services similar to those in Jordan; these are operated through the government-run Industrial Development Corporation.The EU donor-supported Indus- trialModernisationCentre(IMC)inEgyptofferspersonalisedbusiness establishment services in seven different regional business resource centres.

Because of their limited internal division of labour, small businesses tend to need a broader range of services. Owners of small businesses often lack the experience to clearly specify their needs for external services, or to efficiently manage the services they pay for. Support services can range from common facilities (photocopying, reception and telephone services) to more technical services (book- keeping, IT support), skills development (training and coaching) and strategic assistance (advice and consulting). They can also be offered at reduced/subsidised rates, although the rationale for subsidisation requires careful consideration. Governments can introduce a range of schemes through which to offer services, from subsidised agencies through subsidised consul- tancies. Often, schemes are financed by the government and sup- ported by the contribution of international donors. Ultimately, this is an unsatisfactory situation if it discourages the search for pro- gramme models that have high levels of sustainability (it should be borne in mind, however, that full financial sustainability of support services for start-ups and vulnerable target groups is rare, even in OECD economies). In the MED region, there are numerous business services operating un- der the auspices of programmes (such as those of enterprise upgrad- ing schemes ( mise \u00e0 niveau ) marked by different levels of activity and different stages of development. The funding for these programmes is usually supported by EU donor assistance. Within these programmes throughout the MED region, two categories can be identified: those government-run programmes offering a large variety of services (in- cluding technical services), targeted to enterprises with high-growth potential; and those programmes offering basic services which may be offered at an initial stage through government-supported service pro- grammes, but which are eventually outsourced to private domestic op- erators (this contributes to the development of a domestic consultancy service industry). In Israel, Egypt and Jordan, with the help of significant technical and fi- nancial assistance, the respective governments have developed a wide rangeofservicestooffertoenterprises.Moroccoandanumberofother MED countries are currently developing the range of services to be of- fered to enterprises. The Israeli MATI provides consulting services, access to export promo- tion opportunities and assistance in accessing finance. The private Is- raeli organisations (MAI, Federation of Israeli Chambers of Commerce and Lahav) have an advocacy function in addition to providing per- sonalised services to enterprises. These services are usually offered at a small fee to enterprises. The Egyptian SFD\u2019s services range from assistance in the start-up phase (such as drafting a business plan) to guidance in accessing finance and developing human resources. The SFD caters to small firms, usually in low-growth activities. However, it also has a network for entrepreneurs with the potential to create innovative projects. The Jordan Enterprise Development Corporation (JE) offers a multitude of services targeted to enterprises in different industries (e.g. electron- ics, agriculture, and garment and textiles). In Morocco, the ANPME along with other institutions such as the Na- tional Employment and Competency Promotion Agency (Agence Nationale de Promotion de l\u2019Emploi et des Comp\u00e9tences \u2014 Anapec) provide services to SMEs. There are centres (Centres de Gestion et de Comptabilit\u00e9 Agr\u00e9es \u2014 CGCA) offering accounting and management services specifically to microenterprises, designed to smooth the transi- tion from the informal to the formal sector of the economy. ",
        "Page 76 In most other MED countries, the range of services offered to enterpris- es may be more limited and vary according to what operators (such as chambers of commerce and professional associations) provide. Often, these institutions deliver services (including training courses and infor- mation on export opportunities) to the greatest number of enterprises. AVA I L A B I L I T Y O F I N F O R M AT I O N O N B U S I N E S S S E RV I C E S For entrepreneurs in the start-up or in the business establishment phase, the opportunity cost of sacrificing daily work responsibilities to seek out information on business service schemes is high. Furthermore, if there are several competing service providers, the entrepreneur must havetherightinformationathandtomakeaninformeddecisiononthe services being sought. Information systems, networks and services that are easy to access and understand, and are relevant to business needs, are critical to bridge the information gap between entrepreneurs and business service providers. Information systems should have databases of types of services, and providers.Theyshouldbeeasilyaccessible,andlocatedinlocalinforma- tion centres and online. Information must be targeted to the needs of the entrepreneur, updated and user-friendly. Chambers of commerce, business associations and other organisations with large networks ca- tering to the enterprise community can play a central role. In most of the MED countries, there are a number of means to dis- seminate information on business service providers: private sector or- ganisations (such as business associations and chambers of commerce) channelinformationrelevanttotheirmembers.Generally,thisindicator is one of the least developed areas among those under Dimension 8, especially in Algeria, the Palestinian Authority and Syria. While in Syria a database for business services has been developed and is made avail- able by the chambers of commerce at the Syrian Enterprise Business Centre (SEBC), the coverage of the database is not extensive. In countries with BDCs, such as Israel, Tunisia and Lebanon, information is provided on-site; however, the effectiveness depends on the number of centres and the accessibility of such centres to entrepreneurs. In Egypt, the SFD also has locations offering information to entrepreneurs. Morocco\u2019s SME Agency has recently set up\u2018front offices\u2019in a number of big cities; the purpose of these offices is to promote the various busi- ness support schemes, and to inform enterprise owners of the condi- tions for eligibility. Morocco\u2019s novel approach has the potential to be further developed and diffused throughout the country. In some countries, making information available on the web would also servealargenumberofbusinesses.InJordan,theJE(throughtheJUMP programme) has created a website listing registered service providers by specialisation. 8.4. Synthesis Monitoring and evaluation (particularly of publicly funded business serv- ice programmes) calls for further development in the MED region, given that the assessment results show far too little attention being paid to this facet of policy. In all the MED countries, very sizeable resources (whether public or donor funds) are being pooled into programmes of enterprise upgrading and basic business services. Such services can be critical in ad- dressing market failures and ensuring better opportunities for business development throughout a country\u2019s territory. However, MED countries must develop innovative monitoring tools to get feedback from the com- panies benefiting from programmes, helping to assess how many firms (including their type and location) obtain different forms of support. Monitoring must be complemented by evaluation of the impacts of these programmes (because simply knowing that a service has been received does not indicate that the service has resulted in an outcome better than the\u2018do nothing\u2019situation, or better than some other form of publicly sup- ported service). Proper monitoring and evaluation is in fact a relatively sophisticatedundertaking,andmonitoringandevaluationdatabasesand tools may need to be established in cooperation with donor institutions. 5.0 4.0 3.0 2.0 1.0 0.0 A l g e r i a E g y p t I s r a e l L e b a n o n J o r d a n M o r o c c o P a l e s t i n i a n A u t h o r i t y S y r i a T u n i s i a Figure 18 : Dimension 8 overall scores ",

Expected benefits include increases in trade flows and investments, more innovation, transfer of technology, shar- ingofknowledgeandknow-how,andbetterintegrationintotheglobal economy. 9.2. Assessment framework The assessment framework comprises three indicators. These look at networks and partnerships in place between businesses and between business service providers, and assess whether they are embedded in a broader strategy for enterprise development. They also assess their sustainability, their upscaling prospects based on evaluation, the range of sectors covered and the extent of Euro-Med connections.

Analysis Acknowledging the potential benefits of Euro-Mediterranean networks and partnerships, Israel, Egypt andTunisia use a number of vehicles for strengthening innovation and internationalisation. These countries of- fer interesting examples of how Euro-Mediterranean business coopera- tion can be encouraged in a strategic, sustainable way. In Israel, the areas of research and innovation have been identified by thecountryascrucialforitseconomicdevelopment.In1996,ISERDwas established as a non-profit organisation by a number of ministries to promote EU\u2013Israel cooperation in the areas of research and innovation, notably under the EU framework programme for research and develop- ment. In Egypt, the industrial development strategy encourages twinning between local technology centres and competent foreign partners. It recommends positioning these local technology centres in networks of centres for transferring state-of-the-art technology. The 25 Egyptian technology transfer and innovation centres (ETTICs) are encouraged to work on concrete projects with their counterparts in the EU. In Tunisia, innovation and integration in the global economy are at the heart of the economic development strategy. The 10 technopoles that providehigh-valueservicestoinnovativecompaniescooperatewithin- ternational partners, including France, Germany and Italy. Agencies like API, CEPEX and FIPA that help enterprises to operate internationally are encouraged to establish lasting cooperation with corresponding agen- cies in the EU. ",
        "Page 78 ( 34 ) The \u2018Enterprise Europe network\u2019 was launched by the European Commission in early 2008. It is made up of close to 600 partner organisations in more than 40countries,promotingcompetitivenessandinnovationatthelocallevelinEurope and beyond. Jordan, Morocco, Lebanon and the Palestinian Authority belong to a second category of countries where cooperation initiatives tend to be conducted on an ad hoc basis. Finally, Algeria and Syria are at an early stage in Euro-Mediterranean network development. The role of the private sector in supporting networks and partnerships appears to be particularly strong in Israel. For instance, the Israeli Mati- mopIndustryCentreforR&Dwasfoundedasanon-profitorganisation bythethreemajorassociationsofmanufacturersinIsraelasaninterme- diarybetweenIsraelicompaniesandtheirinternationalcounterpartsto promote joint developments of advanced technologies. In 2004 Mati- mop became a governmental agency. In Egypt, the private sector is increasingly involved in steering agencies, like the Industrial Modernisation Centre and the ETTICs that engage in networkingactivities.Inaddition,theEgyptianchambershaveestablished bilateral associations with 13 chambers in the EU under the umbrella of CEEB, the Confederation of Egyptian-European Business Associations.

To progress towards economic inte- gration,theEUhassubstantiallysupportednetworksofbusinesses and of public and private business service providers.The European Commission has provided the lion\u2019s share through its regional and bilateral cooperation programmes. EU Member States, the FEMIP, EU agencies, regions, cities and European business organisations have also contributed to these efforts. With their help and the as- sistance of other international donors, Euro-Mediterranean net- works have developed among business creators, women entrepre- neurs, innovation key players, exporting craftspeople, etc. Some networks are closely linked to trade agreements. For instance, the EU backs the implementation of the Agadir Agreement between Egypt, Jordan, Morocco and Tunisia and the business-to-business contacts organised within that framework. Business-to-business cooperation has also been supported in EU bilateral programmes with Morocco and Syria. Furthermore, business support agencies like the Egyptian GAFI and SFD, the Tunisian FIPA and regional development offices, and the Moroccan ANPME have been urged to network with counterpart organisations in the EU, as a way of building their capacity to help enterprises to engage in interna- tional cooperation. The Barcelona process itself is monitored by Euro-Mediterranean councils, committees and working groups. The Working Party on Euro-Mediterranean Industrial Cooperation is one of these groups. Together with the informal network of Charter coordinators, it pro- motes Euro-Mediterranean economic integration and steers the Charter implementation. All the countries are equally targeted by associations created by the private sector at Euro-Mediterranean level such as UMCE BusinessMED, theUnionofMediterraneanConfederationsofEnterprises,andAscame, theMediterraneanAssociationofChambersofCommerceandIndustry. These associations play a growing role in encouraging Euro-Mediterra- nean cooperation within the business community and with public part- ners. For instance, UMCE BusinessMED, Ascame and Eurochambres are part of a consortium that runs the\u2018Invest in MED\u2019regional programme. This EU-funded, three-year programme was launched in 2008 and fea- tures Euro-Mediterranean business-to-business meetings to develop investments and trade. Although networks and partnerships are widely recognised to be use- ful, they face a number of challenges. Sustainability is certainly one of them. As many networks and partnerships are supported by donors for a limited period of time, they must learn to survive when that pe- riod ends. Partnerships that are embedded in a broader strategy for economic development as in Israel, Egypt and Tunisia have better sustainability prospects. The Egyptian ETTICs combine a demand-driven approach with public\u2013private steering and services delivered on a cost-sharing basis that will help ETTICs to be sustainable and develop sustainable partnerships. One way of encouraging sustainable networking is to help organisa- tions to join strong networks rather than create new ones. For instance, the MEDIbtikar regional programme has helped innovation players from Syria, Egypt and Morocco to prepare an application for joining the \u2018Enterprise Europe network\u2019 (34) . The network offers support and advice to businesses across Europe and is made up of close to 600 partner ",
        "Page 79 organisations in more than 40 countries. In Israel, ISERD and Matimop help organisations to integrate into the European research area and to be part of the strong partnerships that are set up under the EU research and development framework programmes. The type of activities of the networks and partnerships between service providers poses another challenge. They organise numerous events (such as seminars and fairs) for the business community.While these activities succeed in bringing together key players to exchange information, there are not many examples of networks between serv- ice providers that lead to cross-fertilisation, actual cooperation and transferofpractice.AninterestingexceptionistheEU-supported\u2018Edu- cation and training for employment\u2019 regional programme that is im- plemented by the EuropeanTraining Foundation.The programme has networked organisations that help create an enterprise. Jordan and Israel have adopted some good practices developed in the UK to help young people to set up their own company. Egypt and Lebanon have adopted an approach developed in Sweden, while Syria has chosen to adapt the Moroccan Moukawalati programme to its own context (as described in Box 9 above). Thepilotprojectnatureofmanynetworksandpartnershipsalsopresents hurdles: there is little evidence that careful evaluation is performed, previousresultsfullyexploitedandthemostsuccessfulnetworksscaled up. Such an approach is illustrated by a successful experience in Mo- rocco where three clusters were piloted with the support of UNIDO (in the sectors of leather in Fez, wood in Essaouira and pottery in Safi) and in cooperation with similar structures in the Piedmont region in Italy. A project was then developed to implement clusters on a larger scale. 9.4. Synthesis Some experience has been accumulated in networking and partner- ships at Euro-Mediterranean level, often with donor support. There is much scope for using networks and partnerships in more strategic, sustainable and ambitious ways, for better exploiting pilot projects and previous results, and for learning from successful experience across the Euro-Mediterranean area. The new \u2018Invest in MED\u2019 programme (35) and the \u2018Enterprise Europe network\u2019 offer interesting opportunities to progress in these areas. Box 12:\u2018Fashion to the future\u2019 One network that has built on the results of previous cooperation is the \u2018Fashion to the future\u2019 project that involves 38 Euro-Mediterra- nean partners, including four from Morocco andTunisia.The project builds on the results of three textiles projects to promote techno- logical and innovation transfer in the Euro-Med region (www.fash- iontofuture.eu). Box 11: ANIMA The ANIMA Euro-Mediterranean network of investment promotion agencies offers an interesting example of how a temporary consor- tium set up to run a project could establish itself on a more per- manent basis. ANIMA started as an EU-funded project in 2002 to reinforcethecooperationbetweenEuropeanandMediterraneanin- vestment promotion agencies.

This is true for even the most basic enterprise demographic statistics. They give policymakers a broad view of the strengths and weaknesses of their enterprise sec- tor, allowing them to steer policies in the right direction. Data on, for example, entry and exit rates, businesses\u2019 stock and related measures are necessary to understand the dynamics of the sector, as a measure of an economy\u2019s ability to shift resources to growing and more produc- tive areas and to meet consumers\u2019changing needs. Enterprises, on the other hand, need sound statistics to enhance their competitiveness. Enterprise data give them a view of what their competitors are up to and of market and sector trends, and can thus be used as intelligence for market strategies and ultimately innovation. Enterprises also need other types of information (such as legislative and regulative updates) to be able to adapt their activities to new legislations or regulations on time. Dimension 10: Clear and targeted information for enterprises Clear and targeted information Information through traditional channels Online information Figure 21 : Assessment framework Dimension 10 10.2. Assessment framework The assessment of this dimension is made up of two indicators, the first one focusing on traditional channels of information relevant to enter- prises(suchasgazettesordatabaseslocatedinministriesorgovernment agencies),thesecondfocusingontheavailability,qualityandaccessibility of online information relevant to enterprises. To secure information that is accurate and up to date, the administration needs a well-established systemfordatacollectionandupdating.Theinformationshouldbeavail- able across the country in centres that handle information requests on a case-by-case basis. It should also be easy to find online: all the necessary websites and databases should be linked to a single online portal for en- terprises.This portal should ideally be interactive, providing the possibil- ity of filing tax returns or requesting information, for example. 10.3. Analysis Overall, enterprise statistics in most of the countries of the MED region have a variety of shortcomings. Most notably these include: \u2022 weak international comparability; \u2022 low accessibility and usability; ",
        "Page 81 \u2022 inadequate level of detail and limited reliability; \u2022 lack of updates of existing information; \u2022 paucity of information online. Additionally, companies throughout the countries remain insufficiently aware of the services and information available to them on issues such as tax or standards and regulations. Most advanced nevertheless, and closest to the described best practice, isIsrael.Anumberofpublicandprivateorganisationscollect,analyseand disseminate economic, legislative and regulatory information relevant to enterprises.

Furthermore, the information is also provided through Internet portals that allow interaction between enterprises and the administration. Sound information for enterprises is also available in three other coun- tries: Egypt, Morocco and Tunisia. However, these countries have not yet established dedicated and consolidated IT interlinked information centres for enterprises. Currently, Egypt offers both online and traditional methods of informa- tion dissemination on economic, legislative and regulative information. Information is available online through numerous interactive websites, althoughabusinessportalhasnotyetbeenestablished.(However,only 5.4 million people are currently categorised as Internet users, according to 2006 figures from Egypt\u2019s State Information Services.) InTunisia,anumberofgovernmentportalsarededicatedtoprivatesec- tor interests.The API\u2019s portal is particularly tailored to entrepreneurs on key areas of interest (such as tax, labour, standards and regulations) (36) . Still, some of these portals have overlapping information, underlining the need for a consolidated format. Morocco has witnessed a significant improvement in the quality, range and dissemination of government information to enterprise. A large amount of information has been posted on the websites of various pub- lic institutions and agencies. Further improvements could be achieved by completing the arsenal of intelligence mechanisms, eliminating re- dundant or obsolete information, standardising information presenta- tion and linking more closely the information that is available online for enterprises through the construction of a single portal for all enterprise affairs. Box 13: Online interaction between enterprises and administration in Lebanon In Lebanon, there have been a number of initiatives to make e- government work more effectively. The Office of the Minister of State for Administrative Reform launched the Central Office for Administrative Information in 2002. This one-stop information shop has a phone helpline (1700) and an Internet website (www.informs.gov.lb) where a number of adminis- trative forms, including processes related to company registration, can be easily searched and downloaded. TheMinistryofIndustry,andtheMinistryofEconomyandTradepro- vide additional information on administrative procedures specifical- ly related to enterprise operations.

Basic economic and legislative in- formation is available and disseminated, mainly through the network of the chambers of commerce and industry. However, more sophisticated economic information (such as the database combining trade and invest- mentdataandinformation,developedwithUSsupport)isnotyetaccessi- ble to users. Information on business and economic activity related to en- terprises is widely available online, but is scattered on several websites. In the remaining countries, online information available to enterprises is limited; information is available through traditional channels spread across different institutions. In Syria, for example, several institutions analyse and disseminate the bulk of the information available for en- terprises: the Central Bureau for Statistics, relevant ministries, and the chambers of commerce and industry. The information is not system- atically collected and there are inconsistencies among institutions and throughout the country. 10.4. Synthesis There is a serious need across the region to improve the quality of information for enterprises and to make it more accessible by bun- dling all relevant information, especially online. Ideally, online portals should be established, linking all the relevant websites and databases for enterprises. Yet only a few MED countries have such portals. Many of the information provision projects are currently donor funded and will require government support once that ends (online services and information portals have considerable maintenance costs). Govern- ments should establish realistic budgets for their ongoing mainte- nance and development. Furthermore, online information for enter- prises should focus on practical information and relevant data rather than news about government activities. Israel\u2019s information portals are closest to focusing on practical information for enterprises and entrepreneurs. 5.0 4.0 3.0 2.0 1.0 0.0 A l g e r i a E g y p t I s r a e l L e b a n o n J o r d a n M o r o c c o P a l e s t i n i a n A u t h o r i t y S y r i a T u n i s i a Figure 22 : Dimension 10 overall scores ",

Each country chapter has been divided into six sections: 1. Country overview 2. Enterprise policy and public\u2013private consultation framework 3. Operational environment 4. Services for enterprises 5. Human capital 6. The way forward Section 1 provides an overview of the enterprise sector in each country, tracking key reforms that have influenced the design of policy in the coun- try.This section relies on data from government sources and international organisations. Section 2 covers part of Dimension 1 (Subdimension 1.1 on the institutional framework for enterprise policy), Dimension 7 (strong business as- sociations) and Dimension 10 (clear and targeted information) of the Charter.These three Charter areas are complementary and thus are grouped together to examine the comprehensiveness of the enterprise policy framework in the respective country.This includes examining the context in whichenterprisepolicyisdesigned,thenatureofpublic\u2013privateconsultationsinthedesignofenterprisepolicy,andwhetherinformationrelevant to enterprises is presented in a clear and targeted way and is accessible to entrepreneurs and policymakers alike. Section 3 provides an overview of the operational environment for enterprises, covering parts of Dimension 1 (Subdimension 1.2 on better leg- islation and administrative simplification, and Subdimension 1.3 on cheaper and faster start-up), Dimension 4 (access to finance and investment- friendlytaxation)andDimension5(bettermarketaccess)oftheCharter.ThesethreeCharterdimensionsstudythepolicytools,facilities,legislation and regulatory framework in place which facilitate operations for an enterprise. It should be noted that the country-specific results for Subdimen- sion 4.2 on investment-friendly taxation are still under elaboration for a number of countries and therefore have not all been included in this draft of the report. Section 4 covers three Charter dimensions on services for enterprises: Dimension 8 (quality business support schemes and services), Dimension 6 (innovative firms) and Dimension 9 (strengthening Euro-Mediterranean networks and partnerships). As these areas of the Charter reinforce one another, they have been considered together. Section 5 considers the human capital dimensions of the Charter by examining the following: Dimension 2 (promoting entrepreneurship educa- tion and training) and Dimension 3 (training activities in the business environment). Finally, each country chapter concludes with a section on the way forward, examining the individual strengths and areas of improvement for each country. ",
        "Page 86 Algeria 1. Country overview The Algerian economy has traditionally been dominated by the hydro- carbon sector, which represents about half of gross domestic product (GDP), accounts for nearly all the country\u2019s exports and generates 75 % of total fiscal revenues. Large and often state-owned enterprises, oper- ating in capital-intensive sectors (such as chemicals, steel and cement), account for the bulk of industrial production, while SMEs are largely present in the retail, construction, transport and agro-business sectors. The SME population density is low by regional standards and many of the micro- and small enterprises operate informally. SMEs in Algeria contribute only 12 % to total formal employment. Economic growth over the last three years in Algeria has been volatile and below potential, in spite of high oil and gas prices. This is due to hydrocarbon production constraints and the lack of competitiveness in the non-hydrocarbon sector. Labour productivity has been stagnant over the last five years and non-hydrocarbon exports registered only very modest growth. Over the medium term, the Algerian economy faces a number of criti- cal challenges. It needs to generate a considerable number of jobs in ordertoabsorbafast-growingandprogressivelymoreeducatedlabour force. At the same time it needs to modernise its hydrocarbon sector, restructure state-owned and loss-making enterprises, and upgrade the infrastructure network. The government has set out to establish: a policy framework capable of delivering fast and sustainable growth, through progressive sector diversification; the opening of the economy to international trade and foreign investment; and the implementation of a major investment programme in infrastructure, public housing and priority sectors. This strategy, articulated in the \u2018Complementary programme for growth support\u2019(2005\u201309) and in the industrial development strategy, calls for a significant expansion of the private enterprise sector, even if starting from a relatively limited base. 2. Enterprise policy and public\u2013private consultation framework T H E I N S T I T U T I O N A L P O L I C Y F R A M E WO R K Since the 1960s, the country has pursued a vertical industrial policy, focusing on a limited number of strategic sectors, and relying on a high level of tariff protection, direct credit allocation and state capital injections. Since the mid-1990s, Algeria has adopted a more market-led approach to economic reforms, shedding some of the more traditional interventionist tools. The transition from a vertical to a horizontal enterprise policy is still far from complete, as the institutional policy framework retains elements of the traditional approach together with new tools and institutions. Ten institutions are responsible for the elaboration of enterprise policy in Algeria (37) . The Ministry of Industry and Investment Promotion (MIPI) (resulting from the merger of the Ministry of Industry and the Ministry of Participation and Investment Promotion) and the Ministry of SMEs and Handicrafts (MPMEA) are the two institutions that play a leading role in this area. They reflect the government\u2019s two-track approach of promoting large investment projects and attracting foreign direct in- vestment (FDI), and supporting the development of SMEs. In addition, there is a National Investment Council which plays an essential role in the design of investment policy, and in approving and overseeing the implementation of large investment and FDI projects. Coordination between the ministries and governmental institutions is assured at the highest level, through the Prime Minister\u2019s office. This two-track approach is also reflected in the competencies assigned to the two main executive government agencies supporting enter- prises. The National Investment Promotion Agency (ANDI) is in charge of investment promotion, facilitation and management of investment incentives, while the National SME Development Agency (ANDPME) provides services and support to SMEs, including the management of the national enterprise upgrading programme. The resource allocation reflects the priority given to supporting industrial development and at- tracting FDI over SME development. There is some degree of coopera- tion between the two key ministries and their executive agencies. For instance, there are regular monthly meetings on the implementation of the enterprise upgrading programme. However, there is consider- able scope for streamlining the coordination between horizontal policy measures aimed at improving the operational environment for the en- terprise sector and for fine-tuning the management of the enterprise/ industry support programmes. There is no medium-term enterprise strategy. In 2007, on the heels of an extended debate, the government approved the industrial devel- opment strategy. This defines a new set of priority sectors; connects industrial development and diversification with human resource de- velopment, innovation and measures to improve competitiveness; and atteststothefactthattheAlgeriangovernment,specificallyMIPI,isem- bracing measures to improve information exchange, define competen- cies and streamline activities among the concerned institutions. P U B L I C\u2013P R I V AT E CO N S U LTAT I O N F R A M E WO R K Since 2003 there has been an institutionalised consultative framework under the auspices of the National Consultative Council for SME Pro- motion, an organ which encourages tripartite dialogue among SMEs, their professional associations and the public sector, and is chaired by a representative from the private sector. Among the dozen or so profes- sional and stakeholder associations representing the private sector, the Algerian Chamber of Commerce and Industry (CACI) is the association which has been historically consulted by the public sector and carries a privileged role in public\u2013private sector debate. Consultations among these bodies take place at lengthy intervals, usually on an ad hoc basis, with limited disclosure of the content of policy debate.

        "elaboration of the industrial development strategy opened the door for the first time to an intensive process of consultation on strategic issues with a variety of stakeholders, a practice that should be extended to other policy areas. C L E A R A N D TA R G E T E D I N F O R M AT I O N In general, there is no comprehensive system for the collection of in- formation related to enterprises. Apart from the customs and national statistics agencies, the Algerian public administration has not made an effort to put into place a structured system to collect, handle and dis- seminate economic, legislative and regulative information related to enterprises.Thishasbeensingledoutasapointforimprovementbythe government. While online mechanisms have not been developed for this purpose, traditional information dissemination has been possible due in large part to the 14 SME facilitation centres spread throughout the territory. 3. Operational environment A D M I N I S T R AT I V E S I M P L I F I C AT I O N The business operational environment in Algeria is one of the most problematic in the MED region, as highlighted by several surveys and reports, including DoingBusiness .The most critical areas for enterprises deal with rules and regulations and access to finance. In 2001, the government commissioned a report on administrative re- form, proposing a number of recommendations to reduce the layers of bureaucracy associated with enterprise policy.There is no specific insti- tution to oversee the process of administrative simplification and regu- latory reform. To date, there is neither a strategy for regulatory reform, norasystematicreviewoflegislation.Algeriahasonlybeguntosimplify administrative procedures for company registration. CO M PA NY R E G I S T R AT I O N There is a two-track approach to company registration in Algeria de- pending on the type of company. \u2022 The first track caters to companies eligible to receive investment in- centives.Companyregistrationcanbecompletedatregionalinvest- ment facilitation centres operated by ANDI.The process is similar to that of a one-stop-shop. \u2022 The second track caters to all other companies which must follow standard registration procedures: companies must register at the commercial registry. For the most common type of enterprise, regis- tration can be obtained in one day, upon completion of seven steps. It costs approximately EUR 50 to obtain a company identification number. The regional spread of investment facilitation centres is limited consid- ering the size of the country, although there are plans to set up centres in each of the country\u2019s 48 governorates and transform them over the medium term into one-stop-shops. Moreover, for limited liability com- panies, the number of steps, the number of days, the minimum capital requirements and the costs connected with company registration and closing a business remain burdensome, according to DoingBusiness . ACC E S S TO F I N A N C E Access to finance remains one of the biggest operational handicaps according to managers of enterprises operating in Algeria. At the ag- gregate level this is reflected in an extremely low ratio of private sector credit to GDP which stands at around 12 %. Bank credit is channelled mainly towards large state-owned and privately owned enterprises, whileSMEsrelylargelyonself-financing.However,thebankingsectoris going through the first phase of an extensive process of reform, includ- ing the partial privatisation of large state-owned banks, the abolition of credit allocation constraints, closer banking supervision and increased competition. Elements of the legal and regulatory framework that facilitates access to finance are in place. The country has a law on distressed companies and bankruptcy. Access to cadastre and credit information is available for relatively large borrowers. However, recovering bad loans in court is difficult and therefore banks traditionally practice very conservative policies towards lending to SMEs. Bank lending is largely based on the provision by the borrower of real estate guarantees, with collateral re- quirementssetveryhigh,furtherlimitingaccesstocreditforundercapi- talised SMEs. Financial facilities such as credit guarantee schemes have been put into place to ease access to finance and limit the impact of the restric- tive collateral requirements. They remain solely government funded and managed. The Investment Credit Guarantee Fund (CGCI) provides guarantees for investment credit. The SME Guarantee Fund (FGAR) ca- ters specifically to SMEs and acts as a guarantor for the creation of an enterprise, the renovation of equipment and the expansion of the SME activities. However, the number of approved guarantees remains limit- ed. In addition, enterprises, especially SMEs, are often unable to register immovable or movable assets, and the use of these assets as collateral is therefore limited. Credits to microenterprises are authorised by ANGEM, a specialised government agency. In addition, there are a number of microcredit agencies operating in rural areas. However, the microcredit sector in Algeria has not reached the same level of development, in terms of ter- ritorial spread, number of institutions and product diversification as in other Maghreb countries. Legislation passed in 2006 enabled the creation of two investment funds. The equity fund sector is still at an early stage of development.

        "Page 88 I N V E S T M E N T-F R I E N D L Y TAXAT I O N Despite some current partial tax reforms (including VAT simplification and reduction of corporate income tax rate), the tax system in Algeria is still complex.The current budget still relies heavily on oil and gas rev- enues, and a reform of the tax administration is still needed. ACC E S S TO M A R K E TS Currently, there is no formalised export promotion strategy for enter- prises (even in the energy sector). The Ministry of Commerce, which disposes of a Special Export Promotion Fund (FSPE), and the Export Agency (ALGEX) seek to promote export and to simplify procedures for international trade. However, the fund is underused and the plans for export promotion have not yet materialised. AC A As To be ready for the signature of an ACAA with the EU, the partner coun- try should have adequate infrastructure in the fields of standardisation, accreditation, conformity assessment, metrology and market surveil- lance, and should have adopted the relevant parts of the acquis . Algeria has started upgrading the infrastructure and harmonising the horizon- tal legislation. The alignment of the legislation in the priority sectors chosen by Algeria (construction products, low-voltage equipment, sim- ple pressure vessels, energy efficiency of refrigeration appliances and toys) has not yet started. The adoption of European standards in the prioritysectorsandthewithdrawalofnationalconflictingstandardsare in progress. 4. Services for enterprises B U S I N E S S S U P P O R T S E RV I C E S Enterprises have access to a range of business services through either donor or public-funded providers. The services include technical and financial assistance, training, advice and expertise on business man- agement and access to finance, in addition to technical standards and certification. There is an EU-funded enterprise upgrading mise \u00e0 niveau programme dedicated to providing enterprise creation and upgrad- ing services for Algerian SMEs and MSMEs, with five centres across the country. It is reported, however, that these services are not widely used by enterprises. This may be partly due to the fact that there is no data- baseofbusinessserviceprovidersavailabletoenterprises,althoughthe German agency GTZ is working to establish such a system in collabora- tion with the MPMEA. I N N OVAT I O N P O L I C Y Up until recently innovation had not been identified as a policy priority for enterprises or public actors; consequently little time and resources have been devoted to developing services catering to innovative enter- prises.Algeriahasnotyetadoptedaninnovationstrategy.Nevertheless some ad hoc activities in this area have been conducted through the MPMEA, the MIPI and the Ministry of Higher Education and Scientific Research (MESRS).The National Agency for Research andTechnological Development (ANVDRET), which operates under the MESRS, has been working since 1998 to develop linkages between universities and en- terprises. It should be noted that both enterprises and academics have critiqued ANVDRET\u2019s efforts, citing that its bureaucratic structure and its rigidity in operation have left little room for creativity. The MPMEA has been tasked to set up incubators throughout the country (this has been done in collaboration with the MESRS); as a result, a number of incubators are now operational in technology parks. The incubator programme aims to have regional spread and to attract innovative ac- tivities by developing entrepreneurial skills, implementing innovative projects launched by researchers and engaging young graduates to set up businesses. To date, there has been little coordination in efforts among the various institutional actors dealing with implementing innovation policies. In response to this, in December 2007 the government commissioned a report to take stock of current innovation and R & D activities in Algeria and to regroup the various actors working in this policy area.

Nevertheless, participation in the Euro-Mediterranean networks has been identified as an area where little has been done and which requires further development. 5. Human capital This section considers the human capital dimensions of the Charter: Algeria\u2019s efforts to promote entrepreneurship education and training (Dimension 2) as well as training activities in the business environment (Dimension 3). The Charter underlines the importance of both areas in the drive for competitiveness. Firstly, the assessment concentrated particularly on the policy frame- work for entrepreneurship education and training, looking closely at how education, training and employment policies support entrepre- neurial learning. While there is a very clear effort in promoting entre- preneurial learning, particularly outside the formal education system (e.g. youth employment agency, national fund for continuing train- ing, microcredit agency), there are no linkages between the range of national support instruments. Nor is there an overarching policy framework which would ensure synergy of effort. Further, on general education (an area where the Charter puts considerable emphasis in terms of promoting the entrepreneurship mind-set from an early age through its entrepreneurship key competence provisions), there is little in the way of policy development. The key competence provisions of the Charter on secondary education (ISCED 2 and 3) remain to be ad- dressed. Unless a joined-up policy framework is established to promote entrepreneurial learning (which is the thrust of the Dimension 2 policy indicator), efforts to promote entrepreneurship education and training will continue to be project-oriented. Project-driven developments al- low for little synergy between the range of actions.They rarely ensure a sequencing of entrepreneurship promotion across the various parts of the learning system (including the non-formal provision) which could bring better efficiency and effectiveness to the overall effort. Getting to a more coherent policy framework for lifelong entrepreneurial learn- ing should be considered by the Algerian authorities as a response to ",
        "the Charter: they should build on the dialogue and discussion that has been generated amongst the range of stakeholders through the Char- ter assessment process. Turning to enterprise skills (Dimension 3), the assessment finds that training services to support the up-skilling of workers are generally well developed across the country. This includes good efforts at training for enterprise start-ups (e.g. ANSEJ). Some 14 % of new microenterprises run by women are accessing training and coaching services.These data could be supplemented with statistics on training for wider enterprise training (including training for start-ups disaggregated by gender).This will help Algeria\u2019s efforts to improve its performance on the range of Dimension 3 indicators. INPED\u2019s good efforts on training for expanding businesses, for example, were noted in the assessment. However, the enterprisegrowthindicatorcallsforconcretestatisticsontraininginthe growthenterprisebracketinordertocapitaliseonexistingeffort.Thisis whereAlgeria\u2019scompetitivestandingcouldbeenhanced,withclearpo- tential to create wealth and jobs. Finally, the assessment team had dif- ficulty in accessing information on enterprise training for external trade (e.g. standards training, international markets).This could be facilitated by key sector associations working with the Charter coordination and ensuring availability of the information demands of the \u2018international markets\u2019indicator. 6. The way forward In Algeria, there are concrete signals that the government intends to move away from traditional policy directly supporting priority indus- trial sectors, and that it intends to pursue a strategy of diversification of the country\u2019s economic base, lowering reliance on the hydrocarbon sector. However, the country is at an early phase in this transition, as indicated by the low scores demonstrated by the country across all 10 dimensions of the Charter. The top priority should be, therefore, to increase the size of the SME sec- tor, both in terms of number of active enterprises and in terms of con- tribution to employment and value-added generation. This requires in- terventions on a number of fronts, including addressing the structure of policyframework,facilitatingaccesstofinance,improvingpublic\u2013private consultation and implementing effective entrepreneurship training. On the basis of the Charter assessment, the following priorities have been identified. \u2022 Enterprise policy framework. Greater coordination is necessary between the Ministry of Industry and Investment Promotion, and the Ministry of SMEs and Handicrafts. A new strategy would favour enterprise creation and leveraging horizontal measures directed at improving the business environment, instead of relying (as now) mainly on tax incentives linked to investment plans validated by government agencies. \u2022 Company registration. A key priority should be the further simplifi- cationofcompanyregistrationproceduresforalltypesofenterprises, notonlyforthosewithaccesstoinvestmentincentives.Thiswillsend a positive signal to new entrepreneurs, especially if this is linked to programmespromotingentrepreneurship,andifwell-fundedmicro- finance facilities are launched. These combinations of reforms could lead to substantial improvement in the rate of enterprise creation. The experience of Egypt, with the Social Fund for Development, or Morocco\u2019s Moukawalati programme (on entrepreneurship promo- tion) and its NGO-led programmes in microfinance could serve as valuable models for good practice. The latest reform on company registration launched by Lebanon\u2019s LibanPost programme that lev- erages the extensive network of post offices to collect and deliver company registration titles is a fine model for good practice. \u2022 Regulatory reform and administrative simplification. In order to sustain SME growth the government should consider reviewing and simplifying the current regulatory framework, examining regula- tions that limit market access or distort competition, providing an unfair advantage to informal companies. \u2022 Public\u2013private consultation. The government should consider establishing regular consultations directed towards including the MSME sector, building on the limited experience of the Consulta- tive Council for SMEs. Discussions should be opened with potential entrepreneurs, especially at a local level using existing forums for public\u2013private consultation. Interventions in other areas (such as innovation, facilitating market access and implementing support schemes and services for enterprises) should be developed within the framework of a multi-year strategy for the enterprise sector, in consultation with the private sector. Page 89 ",
        "Page 90 \u2022 Human capital. Two recommendations are made here. Firstly, the education and training authorities, with the private sector, need to move from ad hoc arrangements for entrepreneurial learning to a more integrated framework which would allow for a sequenced development of entrepreneurship promotion through compulsory schooling and higher education, while interfacing with develop- ments outside the education system. Working in partnership, the range of key stakeholders should consider the development of a lifelong entrepreneurial learning strategy, backed by actions that address the priority areas of the Charter indicators (e.g. entrepre- neurship key competence). Secondly, given the statistical require- ment of Dimension 3 (improved skills), a more developed data system to track enterprise human resource development (HRD) ac- tivities should be considered. Employer organisations and/or secto- ral representations would be ideally placed to take this initiative but with clear government support to ensure that data feeds into poli- cymaking and resource allocation. All data developments should be gender-sensitive. 5.0 4.0 3.0 2.0 1.0 0.0 1 S i m p l e P r o c e d u r e s 2 E n t r e p r e n e u r s h i p 3 I m p r o v e d S k i l l s 4 A c c e s s t o F i n a n c e 5 M a r k e t A c c e s s 6 I n n o v a t i v e F i r m s 7 B u s i n e s s A s s o c i a t i o n s 8 B u s i n e s s S e r v i c e s 9 E u r o - M e d N e t w o r k s 1 0 C l e a r I n f o r m a t i o n Figure23: Algeria: Overall scores per Charter dimension ",
        "Egypt 1. Country overview The process of structural reforms in the Egyptian economy began in the early 1990s. At the outset, the reform process lacked continuity and only made modest progress in changing the government\u2019s approach towards private sector development and reducing the dominant role of the government in the industrial and financial sectors. The appoint- ment of a reform-minded cabinet in 2004, including a number of min- isters with a strong private sector background, signalled a major policy change and prompted a brisk acceleration in the pace of economic reform. As a first act, the government cut the weighted external tariff from 14.6 % to 9.1 %, indicating a break with the traditional practices of protectionism concerning domestic industry and a clear sign of the intention to push for the integration of Egypt into the global economy. Reforms were also implemented under a comprehensive tax reform, cutting the standard corporate tax rate, lowering personal rates and closing loopholes in the corporate rate regime. Four years after its launching, the tax reform has largely met its three main objectives of broadening the tax base, significantly increasing tax revenues and im- proving the transparency of the tax regime. Simultaneously, the government has accelerated the process of priva- tisation, opening to FDI and actively promoting domestic private in- vestment. The process started with state-owned banks and has been extended to state-owned industrial companies and to fast-growing sectors, such as cement and retailing. On the investment side, the gov- ernment revived and expanded the role of the General Administration for Investment (GAFI), cut red tape and enhanced the establishment of free and industrial zones. Finally, the government decided to systemati- cally tackle the issue of improving the business environment.The 2005 industrial development strategy (IDS), elaborated through a process of consultation with private sector organisations and key stakeholders, outlined an ambitious programme of reforms at the micro-level, cover- ing a broad spectrum of enterprise policies. The strategy has already met some of its short-term targets, with aims to achieve a real growth rate in industrial production of 9 %, raise the industrial investment rate to 30 %, and increase manufacturing exports to EUR 36 billion and em- ployment to 2 million by the year 2020. Theresultsofthenewreformimpetushavebeenimpressiveandwidely recognised. The World Bank ranked Egypt the world\u2019s top business en- vironment reformer in 2007 (38) . It also became an observer of the OECD Committee of Investment and Multinational Enterprises in 2007, a rec- ognition of the progress made in opening up the economy to foreign direct investment and in improving the transparency of the investment climate. The pace of economic growth has accelerated from an annual average of 3.5 % from 2001/02 to 2003/04 and 6.2 % for the period 2004/05to2006/07,thankstotherapidgrowthofindustryandservices, andsupportedbytheexpansionofthehydrocarbonsector,increasesin the Suez canal and tourism revenues, and workers\u2019remittances. With an increasingly educated labour force and a low production cost base, Egypt has all the potential to become a major service and manufacturing powerhouse in the MED region. However, the poten- tial unleashed by the progressive integration of Egypt into the global economy is still largely untapped and the challenges for Egypt remain considerable. Increasing job generation remains an absolute priority, in order to absorb the quickly expanding labour supply and to reduce youth unemployment, particularly among young college graduates.

Enterprise policy and public\u2013private consultation T H E I N S T I T U T I O N A L P O L I C Y F R A M E WO R K Egypt\u2019s framework for enterprise policy is articulated, resulting from years of direct government intervention in steering the economy and from the establishment of new institutions to direct and implement the reform process. It is based on a unique combination of ministerial bodies, government executive agencies and public\u2013private institutions with NGO status, responsible for broad policy areas. There are four key governmental institutions responsible for different areas of policy, operating in the area of enterprise development. Each of these institutions has its own set of priorities; however, they are ex- pected to contribute to the achievement of the overarching goals in terms of growth, investment targets, export development and employ- ment generation set by the priorities of the national economic reform team since 2004 (39) . ( 39 ) A high-level economic reform team was assembled with the task of identifying key reform priorities for the government. Reforming trade policies, the banking sector and taxation were the three policy areas identified as critical to meet the following goals: achieve economic growth levels of 6 %; provide employment opportunities to the 650 000 new entrants to the job market; and double both the foreign direct investment inflows and total trade, through more integration into the world economy.

In terms of institutional coordination, a high-level economic committee, chaired by the Prime Minister, meets monthly to coordinate economic policies, and the GAFI, SFD and IDA benefit from interministerial boards. Policy coordination is largely made possible by the good level of harmony within the current team of economic ministers and by the exten- sivenetworkofpersonalcontactsandtheinfluenceofkeypolicymakers. P U B L I C\u2013P R I V AT E CO N S U LTAT I O N F R A M E WO R K Over the last five years, the government has strived to include and/or consult the private sector in its strategic decision-making, to ensure Egypt\u2019s competitiveness. Examples that illustrate the enhanced en- gagement with the private sector include: ",
        "Page 93 \u2022 the involvement of the Egyptian Junior Business Association in set- ting up and operating the National Competitiveness Council; \u2022 the extensive consultation of the Federation of Egyptian Industries (FEI) in developing Egypt-EU cooperation; \u2022 the appointment of leading businesspersons to high-level cabinet positions. During the last few years, the majority of laws and regulations, espe- cially those related to private sector development and business activi- ties (such laws and regulations include the income tax law, the unified housing law and the new real estate law), have also been discussed and sometimes even initiated by business associations. For instance, the Business Advisory Committee (made up of members from the private sector including chambers of commerce and business associations) has taken a major role in drawing up and delivering the strategy for regula- tory reform and administrative simplification (Errada). Nevertheless, mistrust from the private sector (especially at the level of micro- and small enterprises) towards the public sector still persists. Per- haps this is due in part to the fact that business associations and enter- prisenetworks,advocatingonbehalfoftheenterprisecommunity,main- lyrepresentbigcompanies,andarethusunabletocapturetheinterestof underrepresented MSEs (92.7 % of the enterprise population in Egypt). C L E A R A N D TA R G E T E D I N F O R M AT I O N Currently, Egypt offers both online and traditional methods of informa- tion dissemination on economic, legislative and regulative information. Information is available through numerous interactive websites, al- though a business portal has not yet been established. Although infor- mationisavailableonline,traditionalchannelsstillprevail.Theavailabil- ity of online information is anyway less acute as only 7 million people (41) are Internet users (2006 figures \u2013 Egyptian State Intelligence Service). 3. Operational environment A D M I N I S T R AT I V E S I M P L I F I C AT I O N The government, through the SME Unit of the Ministry of Finance, is currently adopting a strategy for regulatory reform and administrative simplification (Errada). In2008,theprojectwillreview,simplifyandeliminatetensofthousands of regulations across several ministries. The strategy aims to revisit all regulations and legislation related to economic activity including the issuanceofthenewtaxlaw,simplifiedtariffscheduleandtheeconomic courts law which is about to be issued (42) . CO M PA NY R E G I S T R AT I O N In terms of cheaper and faster start-ups, Egypt has taken a two-track approach to improving the operational environment for enterprises: improving the business environment for investors; and improving the business environment for its domestic population of enterprises. For the first track, the GAFI caters to investors by becoming an investor business partner, and offers one-stop-shop services to carry out all li- cencesrequiredfortheestablishmentandoperationofprojects.Forthe second track, the Social Fund for Development (SFD) has established one-stop-shops in most of the governorates to lessen the time and cost burden associated with company registration. While Egypt has re- duced the number of days for the completion of company registration, licensing still requires 30 days to get necessary approvals from various agencies and for the assignment of the company nationalidentification code. A network of chambers of commerce and industry offers registra- tion services to enterprises for little additional cost, and has succeeded insubstantiallyreducingthetimeburdenonenterprisesbyactingasan intermediary in the registration process. ACC E S S TO F I N A N C E Over the last five years the Egyptian government has taken a proac- tive role in easing constraints on access to finance for SMEs. Tangible progress has been made in restructuring, re-capitalising, merging and privatising large commercial banks, which have begun to develop a more client-oriented approach and to upgrade the range of products and services dedicated to SMEs. This progress is matched by equal improvements of the credit environment. While standard collateral re- quirements remain high and based largely on real estate assets, in 2006 Egypt passed new regulations facilitating the registration of real estate assets and improving access to cadastre information. In addition, since 2001, it has been possible to use immovable assets as loan collateral. The Credit Guarantee Company (CGC), with a shareholding made by ninecommercialbanksandoneinsurancecompany,hasbeeninopera- tion since 1991. It provides a range of guarantees for short-term financ- ing, investments and start-ups, in addition to providing export credit guarantees. In 2005, the first private credit bureau, jointly owned by the SFD, and backed by the Central Bank of Egypt and IFC, opened its doors. The low spectrum of the credit market is served by microfinance facili- ties provided by a number of private and public banks (which operate on a commercial basis), and by non-profit organisations (which operate under the umbrella of the SFD, and are funded by the government and donor organisations including the EU). The national strategy for micro- finance, in place since 2005, provides a platform for coordinating the efforts of donors, multilateral agencies and government institutions such as the SFD. Still, microfinance institutions are struggling to match thegrowingdemand.Theproductrangeformicrofinanceisalsolimited with many providers offering only micro-loans and no additional finan- cial services, such as deposit-taking and insurance. The Egyptian government is also promoting its equity fund. A venture capital committee was established by the Ministry of Finance in 2004 and the project of launching a government fund targeting SMEs is well advanced. Nine private equity funds already operate in Egypt, but less than 10 % of the funds are allocated to SME projects. The launching of a new separate stock market for small and medium-sized capitalised companies in October 2007, the Nilex, will contribute to the expansion of equity funds with an SME orientation.

        "Page 94 However, in spite of these achievements, access to finance for SMEs re- mains highly problematic. Small companies rely mainly on internally generated funds or informal lenders. Companies with funding require- ments above the thresholds of microfinance institutions, but below the threshold to attract the interest of commercial banks, are facing the big- gest obstacles. INVESTMENT-FRIENDL Y TAXATION Egypt has taken a leadership role among the participating countries on their tax policy and practices in the treatment of small and medium-sized enterprises. Egypt has undertaken studies on special tax incentives to in- crease financing of small enterprises and on tax impediments to risky in- vestment in SMEs, and reported main results to senior Ministry of Finance officials for discussion. Egypt is also the only participating country that has adopted simplified regimes for SMEs to reduce tax compliance. Addition- ally, Egypt encourages e-filing and e-payment by granting incentives to taxpayers and provides free call centres to answer taxpayers\u2019questions.Tax seminars, workshops and round tables, with the participation of chambers ofcommerce,wereheldtoexplainnewtaxrules. ACCESS TO MARKE TS In 2004, the Ministry of Trade and Industry (MoTI) adopted a new export promotion strategy aimed at meeting the goals set out by the high-level economic reform team. Part of the strategy aims at simplifying cumber- some and costly procedures for international trade. Reforms include au- tomatingtheGeneralOrganisationforExportandImportControl(GOEIC) and setting up a one-stop-shop at the GOEIC locations. Evidence shows that these reforms have had an impact: \u2022 customs clearance was reported to have fallen to 1 day from over 20 days in 2003; \u2022 cargo storage time in warehouses dropped from 28 to 2 days thereby reducing costs; \u2022 the drop in costs has translated into a 15 % decrease in import prices and a 17 % increase in export margins. Beside the GOEIC, a second agency, the Egyptian Export Promotion Centre (EEPC), was established by the MoTI. In terms of SME-specific programmes, the Export Development Bank of Egypt provides banking services, including upgrading and modernising those enterprises with export potential. AC AAs To be ready for the signature of an ACAA with the EU, the partner country should have adequate infrastructure in the fields of standardisation, ac- creditation, conformity assessment, metrology and market surveillance, and should have adopted the relevant parts of the EU acquis . In Egypt the upgrading of the infrastructure has begun but the horizontal legislation hasnotbeenharmonisedwiththe acquis .Thealignmentofthelegislation in the priority sectors chosen by Egypt (construction products, electrical appliances, pressure equipment, medical devices and gas appliances) has started. The adoption of European standards in the priority sectors and the withdrawal of national conflicting ones are well advanced. 4. Services for enterprises BUSINESS SUPPORT SERVICES Business services range from assistance in the start-up phase, to drafting a business plan, to accessing finance, developing human resources and, finally, for the most advanced enterprises, assistance in delivering inno- vative projects. They are generally provided on a cost-sharing basis, for smaller firms through the SFD, and for larger ones through the Industrial Modernisation Centre (IMC). Business services developed out of the MoTI\u2019s 1997 industrial modernisa- tion programme (IMP), a programme that received substantial financial support from the EU and which benefited from other donor-led initia- tives.Afteralmostfiveyearsofimplementation,theIMPwasgivenamore demand-driven orientation and evolved into the IMC, a public\u2013private institution, operating under the auspices of the MoTI and the Federation of Egyptian Industries (FEI). The IMC\u2019s personalised business services are delivered at business resource centres established in seven regions and by local and multinational firms. In addition to helping small enterprises access finance, the SFD provides establishment services through its one-stop-shop network. The SFD also funds social and human resource development projects and is itself sup- ported by a number of donors including the EU. Other service providers from the public sector are the IDA and GAFI whose one-stop-shop helps tosetupcompanies.PrivatesectorserviceprovidersincludetheEJBAand the domestic and international chambers of commerce. INNOVATION POLIC Y The government\u2019s innovation strategy is embedded in the IDS, which sets objectives for technological development and transfer. The strategy is at an initial stage of implementation. For the medium term, the IDS envi- sions that the country establishes sustainable technology transfer. In the long term, the IDS sees the possibility of shifting from policies of adapta- tion to policies of innovation. Currentlythereareanumberofprojectsworkingtowardsthesegoals.The Egyptiantechnologytransferandinnovationcentres(ETTICs)developR& Dcapacitiesincertainstrategicindustries.ETTICscompleted12newtech- nologycentres,raisedtheefficiencyof13existingtechnologycentresand initiated four programmes to enhance technological capabilities. ETTICs arelimitedgeographicallytoeitherGreaterCairoorAlexandria.Theyoffer training and technical assistance in sector-specific areas (such as marble and quarries, food technology, textiles and clothing, etc.) and are often linked to European or international service providers. ETTICs are steered bypublic\u2013privatepartnershipsandtheiroperationisdemanddriven.Two technology parks have also been established: the Mubarak City for Scien- tific Research andTechnology Applications, and the Egypt SmartVillage. The IMC also cooperates with the Ministry of Higher Education and Sci- entific Research to link industry with R & D. To this end, it has brought together research centres, private sector representatives and industrial companies to create linkages and to nurture the development of sci- ence research that can be applied to the industrial sector. The Egyptian incubator programme was launched in 1995 by the SFD, the World Bank and the Egyptian Incubator Association (EIA), which ",
        "Page 95 has launched a pilot project for business and technology incubators, although its focus is more on employment generation than innovation. The EIA provides technical assistance in setting up the incubators. EIA also serves as a representative body for the incubators.

These partnerships will be further encouraged by EU-funded programmes such as the new\u2018Invest in MED\u2019programme, and by the association of Egypt to the\u2018Enterprise Europe network\u2019. 5. Human capital TurningtothehumancapitaldimensionsoftheCharter,theassessment focused on Egypt\u2019s efforts to promote entrepreneurship education and training (Dimension 2) as well as enterprise training activities (Dimen- sion 3), both considered key to promotion of a more entrepreneurial and skills-effective enterprise environment. Firstly, the assessment explored the policy context for more developed entrepreneurship education across all levels of education. While some national strategies individually contribute to entrepreneurial learning (e.g. a youth employment strategy that favours self-employment), the Charter objective of a coherent strategic framework for lifelong entre- preneurship education and training requires more discussion with key stakeholders. Of importance here will be how the contents of existing policies interface, including how the formal education system and the non-formal education environment could be more improved and syn- ergised. More specifically, the national education strategy still misses specific acknowledgement of entrepreneurship as a key competence. This will be important for progress on the secondary education indica- tors (ISCED 2 and 3). The policy position on employment and vocational training addresses occupationalskillsonly.Anentrepreneurshipdimensioncouldreinforce its objectives and potential. Further, interviews with high-ranking offi- cials from the Ministry of Higher Education confirmed particular inter- est in developing \u2018across-campus\u2019 entrepreneurial learning to build on existing efforts to foster entrepreneurship in technology/engineering faculties. This provides a good opportunity for ensuring that the upper levels of the learning system (ISCED 5 and 6) are engaged in broader lifelong entrepreneurial learning developments. Given that the policy indicator is a driver for the remaining indicators on Dimension 2, the Egyptianauthoritiescouldconsideranopendiscussiononhowthevar- iouspartsofthelearningsystem(includingenterprise)couldcooperate with a view to creating a sequential or lifelong entrepreneurial learn- ing framework. Given its nodal position, the Education, Training and Employment Observatory could lead this dialogue, but the leadership and support of both education ministries will be critical. The process would be significantly reinforced with the strategic engagement of the National Competitiveness Council (already pushing for a better contri- bution of the learning system to Egypt\u2019s competitiveness drive). How- ever, the Ministry of Education is pivotal to all systemic developments inentrepreneuriallearning:itmustengagewithandbeengagedbythe other key stakeholders. Secondly, on enterprise skills, training services supporting Egyptian busi- nesses in international trade are well established, addressing both inter- national standards and marketing with good examples of training on export management (e.g. Japanese-Egyptian cooperation initiative) and international e-business (e.g. Egypt International Trade Point). Likewise, good efforts are being made to promote training within expanding busi- nesses with a range of financing instruments backing businesses taking the growth route.While training on general management and trade skills is well developed across the country, a lack of data on enterprise take-up of training, including start-up support, will constrain progress on Dimen- sion 3 indicators unless a more systematic tracking mechanism is estab- lished. Enterprise and trade associations, along with government bodies, would do well to consider a regular review of enterprise training. A train- ingneedsassessmentwouldprovideabarometerontheHRDconditionof the economy and pointers as to how public investment in training could befine-tunedtomeettheevolvingrequirementsofenterprises.Giventhe emphasis on gender-specific data within the start-up indicator, data col- lection methods should ensure disaggregation of data by gender. 6. The way forward Egypt\u2019s performance reflects the significant progress made in develop- ing a comprehensive enterprise policy approach across all 10 dimen- sions of the Charter with the exception of Dimension 2: Education and training for entrepreneurship. Egypt\u2019s strong points include policy elaboration and strategic orientation, resulting from the determination of the economic ministerial team and the participation of dynamic rep- resentatives from the private sector. Policies in most areas incorporate internationally recognised good practices. ThemainchallengesforEgyptlieaheadwithpolicyimplementationex- tending to the whole country and generating broad benefits. In a large economy such as that of Egypt, there is a need to build a critical mass of reforms, reaching the largest possible numbers of enterprises before reforms can have a significant impact on the economy and overall well- being.Egypthasapositiveimplementationrecordinseveralareas,from microfinance to innovation and the provision of business services, but the scale of the intervention must expand in order to satisfy the diverse needs of the enterprise sector, including SMEs. On the basis of the Charter assessment, the following priorities have been identified. \u2022 Regulatory reform implementation. Egypt remains a heavily reg- ulated economy, burdened by a bloated and often inefficient public administration, particularly at a local level.The government has giv- en high priority to regulatory reform and has set the basis for a well- structured reform programme. However, international experience shows that resistance builds up as reforms reduce the power and influence of the various levels of bureaucracy. The potential gains generated by an extensive regulatory reform programme could be significant enough to transform the business environ- ment, especially as it is coupled with the extensive tax reform conducted over the last few years. \u2022 Access to finance. Microfinance schemes, commercial banking reforms and privatisation efforts are having a beneficial impact on access to finance for micro- and well-capitalised medium-sized en- terprises. However, small enterprises continue to be excluded from access to credit. There is a need to pursue with the improvement ",
        "Page 96 of the credit environment, to increase technical assistance to small enterprises on finance and business plan formulation, to intensify competition in the banking sector, and to expand the credit guar- antee schemes. \u2022 Innovation. The government has set the basis for an innovation policy and produced encouraging results in policy implementa- tion, with the establishment of the ETTICs. However, the needs of the economy are huge. Actions conducted by the IMC must be fol- lowed through to support basic technological upgrading over a large number of sectors, including the service sector. At the same time, there is a need to focus on the priority sectors already iden- tified, further strengthening the links between research centres, universities, vocational training and education in general. \u2022 Human capital. Recommendations are made here for Dimen- sions 2 and 3. Firstly, to capitalise on accomplishments in en- trepreneurship education and training, the general and higher education authorities need to be directly engaged in all subse- quent policy discussions and developments. This should allow for a more inclusive policy development process for lifelong en- trepreneurial learning. Secondly, Egypt\u2019s progress on Dimension 3 indicators will be compromised unless a regular and reliable monitoring system on enterprise training is put in place. The au- thorities, with the private sector, should determine how existing data sources could be integrated as well as ensuring that data gaps (including gender-related data for start-up training) are ad- dressed. 5.0 4.0 3.0 2.0 1.0 0.0 1 S i m p l e P r o c e d u r e s 2 E n t r e p r e n e u r s h i p 3 I m p r o v e d S k i l l s 4 A c c e s s t o F i n a n c e 5 M a r k e t A c c e s s 6 I n n o v a t i v e F i r m s 7 B u s i n e s s A s s o c i a t i o n s 8 B u s i n e s s S e r v i c e s 9 E u r o - M e d N e t w o r k s 1 0 C l e a r I n f o r m a t i o n Figure 24: Egypt: Overall scores per Charter dimension ",
        "Page 97 Israel 1. Country overview Since the early 1990s the Israeli economy has gone through a major process of restructuring and transformation. In a relatively short period of time Israel, which had an economic base traditionally dominated by agro-business, light industry and other labour-intensive sectors, has evolved into a knowledge-based economy and built a highly competi- tive and advanced high-tech sector.Today Israel has one of the highest R & D intensity rates in the world and is a leader in technology develop- ment. Theturningpoint,fromtheeconomicpointofview,canbetracedtothe late 1980s and early 1990s. An injection of highly qualified and strongly motivated human capital, resulting from the immigration inflows of the 1990s, led the government to embark on policies that fostered en- trepreneurship, instead of relying on the expansion of social support programmes. Thanks to close public\u2013private sector cooperation, and significant US assistance, Israel has been successful in replicating and adaptingmanyofthecriticalelementsthatcontributedtothedevelop- ment of the high-tech sector in the USA, such as university\u2013industry project collaboration, cross-industry spillovers and application of inno- vation generated by defence R & D activities to civilian sectors, shorten- ing of time lag between research and development to application, and the building of a dynamic venture capital industry. The shift towards a more entrepreneurial economy was supported by the introduction of an extensive tax reform, sector liberalisation and large privatisations, reducing significantly the role of the state in the economy in the early 2000s. As a result, the country has recorded growth rates for a sustained period of time comparable to those of the Asian tigers. The phase of rapid economic development was brought to a temporary halt during the Second Intifada in 2001\u201303, but growth has resumed at a fast rate since then, with GDP growing at an average of 5.25 % in 2006 and 2007, bringing unemployment down from a peak of 10.8 % in 2003 to 7.5 % in 2007. The Israeli economy is highly integrated at global level, but much less at regional level. Israel is linked by longstanding FTAs with the USA and the EU (each one absorbing about 40 % Israeli exports), and with Turkey. Since the Second Intifada, the Israeli indus- try has significantly reduced its reliance on activities subcontracted to Palestinian enterprises and cut down the number of jobs offered to Palestinian workers in Israel. Fast economic growth led by technological progress has transformed the country, but it has also generated deep imbalances. Productivity and salaries in the traditional service and manufacturing sectors have been lagging well behind those of the high-tech sector. Income distri- bution has become polarised. Over the medium term, Israel needs to consolidate its leadership in the high-tech sectors, spread productivity gains to more traditional industries and increase the rate of economic participation of minority groups. 2. Enterprise policy and public\u2013private consultation T H E I N S T I T U T I O N A L P O L I C Y F R A M E WO R K The main institution directly responsible for enterprise policy in Israel is the Ministry of Industry,Trade and Labour (MoITL), although several other ministries are responsible for specific or related policy areas (43) .The MoITL focuses on policy elaboration and monitoring, and on programme man- agement for medium-sized and large companies. SME policy elaboration and implementation is instead covered by the Israel Small and Medium Enterprises Authority (ISMEA, also known as the Small Business Authority of Israel, a non-profit association linked to the MoITL).The MoITL monitors support programmes that upgrade SMEs, like the mentoring, innovation, design and quality management programmes. ISMEA\u2019s mission is to en- courage enterprise creation, help deliver SME support programmes and act as a coordination body for the harmonisation of enterprise policy.The authority, established in 1993, coordinates the network of small business developmentcentres(MATI),workscloselywithSMEassociationsandplays an important advocacy role on behalf of micro- and small businesses. A number of relevant agencies and institutions established under the MoITL serve investment and export purposes. These institutions are re- sponsible for different areas of enterprise policy, including the Industrial Cooperation Authority (ICA) and the Foreign Trade Administration (in co- operation with the Ministry of Agriculture), which are responsible for in- dustrialcooperation,exportandtradepromotion.TheInvestmentPromo- tion Centre works with foreign investors interested in direct investment and joint venture opportunities. Generally, these institutions are well staffed, fully operational, and sufficiently financed to fulfil their mandate. Since 1993, the government has created a map for identifying responsi- bilities in enterprise policy for each institution, and government action is conductedandcoordinatedaccordingtotheagreedstructure.TheMoITL nurtures coordination with other ministries and stakeholders through a number of specialised committees dealing with enterprise policy areas ranging from licensing and business registration, to SME participation in government tenders. TheMoITL\u2019sapproachisthatgovernmentinterventionshouldbetarget- ing critical market failures. It should be temporary and directed to build the conditions for the entry of private operators and to deliver results by market-led mechanisms. An end in government intervention should be planned from the very beginning, identifying the exit conditions, as in the case of the Yozma programme for the venture capital sector or the business incubator programme. Policy measures are closely moni- tored and readjusted to meet policy targets. For example, the MoITL is going to conduct an in-depth review of all policy support programmes over the next two years. In fact, Israel had developed over the years a pragmatic approach to- wardsenterprisepolicywithpriorityontheimplementationoftargeted programmes. Hence Israel has purposely never elaborated a compre- hensive enterprise policy. However, the MoITL uses yearly work plans (as the recently drafted work plan for 2008) to set policy targets and agendas for the implementation of enterprise policy. ( 43 ) Other ministries include the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry ofTourism, the Ministry of Agriculture, the Ministry of Justice, the Ministry of Education and the Ministry of Immigrant Absorption.

At a very strategic level, stake- holders have been involved in the design of institutional and policy frameworks, including the establishment of the ISMEA, ICA, etc. At a verypracticallevel,stakeholderstakepartincommitteeswhichoversee specific policy areas linked to business operations, such as the Commit- tee on Business Registration. Generally, the public\u2013private consultation process is characterised by informal involvement of the private sector. In Israel, there is no compulsory membership in private sector organi- sations; however, membership is encouraged through a system of fi- nancial incentives and disincentives. The Manufacturers\u2019Association of Israel is the main body responsible for the manufacturing sector and plays a pivotal role in high-level consultations with the government. The association also plays a liaison role for a number of sectoral and professional organisations. In general, consultation occurs at all levels and on a wide range of issues. Other private sector organisations in- volved in public\u2013private consultation include the Lahav (Chamber of the Independent Organisations in Israel), representations for liberal professions and the FICC. C L E A R A N D TA R G E T E D I N F O R M AT I O N There are a number of public and private organisations that collect, analyse and disseminate economic, legislative and regulatory informa- tion relevant to enterprises. Information is shared through traditional channels via the MATI located in 28 locations throughout the country. The Lahav, the FICC, the MoITL (including the Foreign Trade Associa- tion) and the Israel Institute for Export and International Cooperation all provide targeted information, especially in areas related to export. The information is provided through portals which allow interaction between enterprises and the administration. 3. Operational environment A D M I N I S T R AT I V E S I M P L I F I C AT I O N The call for a programme-based approach led the government to put fewer efforts in the implementation of broad policy initiatives. As an example, regulatory reform has started later and is moving at a slower pace than reform in other policy areas. Israel still scores below the OECD average in several of the World Bank 2008 Doing Business indicators that measure interaction with the public administration. In August 2005, the governmentestablishedaninterministerialcommittee;theFICC,theMAI and the Centre of the Union of Local Authorities were invited to help hammer out a strategy for the simplification of business licensing. TheMinistryofInteriorsharesresponsibilitywiththeMoITLforoversee- ing the process of administrative simplification for business licensing procedures. Key targets are being met: the simplification of business licensing and tax reform is off to a good start, with plans to review, sim- plifyandeliminateredundantcurrentlegislation.Atthisstage,asystem ofcost-benefitanalysisofnewenterpriselegislationhasbeenapproved but not yet implemented. CO M PA NY R E G I S T R AT I O N Despiteeffortstosimplifyproceduresthecompanyregistrationprocess in Israel remains somewhat cumbersome and has been labelled as a barriertomarketentryforsomeonewhowishestoestablishabusiness. For a private limited company (a standardised company) the number of days and number of steps necessary for registering are relatively sig- nificant: it takes three days to obtain company registration documents certified by an attorney; the documents must be filed at the registrar for companies in the Ministry of Justice to obtain the unique company identification number, which takes one day (it should be noted that a single identification number is used to identify the company in all func- tionsofthepublicadministrationprocess);thenthecompanymustreg- ister at the Ministry of Finance for income tax and VAT purposes, which takes a total of about 16 days; finally, the company must register with the National Insurance Institute, which takes approximately 14 days. According to theWorld Bank DoingBusiness report, these lengthy proc- esses are extended to closing limited liability companies. While Israel has not yet established a one-stop-shop for registration, plans to establish such a system have been approved and include an online system for company registration. ACC E S S TO F I N A N C E Israel has a well-developed financial sector, operating in a sound legal and regulatory environment. There is a fully-functioning cadastre system in place which can be easily accessed by anyone in the Land Registry (for a fee of around EUR 50) and a number of other sources (44) . There is a registration system for movable assets, which in turn are accepted by banks as collateral. Bank- ruptcy laws ensure transparency and efficiency in all the receivership and bankruptcy processes. The banking sector is dominated by two major banks which control over 65 % of the market (Hapoalim and LEUMI), although, following the banking sector reform of 2005, insurance companies are penetrat- ing the credit and guarantee markets. Credit allocation is generally efficient, but financing gaps still plague some segments of the enter- prise sector, as the two biggest banks target services and facilities to the middle market (for clients requiring loans of EUR 600 000 to EUR 12 million or more), leaving the financing of smaller companies to smaller cooperative banks. In general, there is relatively high competition in the banking sector for business customers. Nevertheless, banks have stringent lending requirements: not only must a business demonstrate a good business model, with steady clients and good products; it must also have solid collateral. For any loan above EUR 10 000 collateral re- quirements can range from 50 % to 100 % of the credit. A law on credit rankings makes it possible for the banking sector to obtain information about an applicant\u2019s credit history (the services are offered via an inter- nal scheme through two private companies).

The Israeli Land Administration (ILA) is the government agency responsible for managing this land.Therefore, ownership usually means having leasing rights from the ILA for 49 to 98 years. ",
        "The microfinance sector operates thanks to the State Guarantee Fund; the fund is run by a private firm that manages the disbursements of funds designed for businesses that cannot obtain bank credit due to lack of collateral. There are also a number of other public and private funds which extend small loans. Nevertheless, government funds to high-tech SMEs or microenterprises are smaller than private funding such as equity, venture capital and initial public offerings (45) . Israel is well known for its innovative and successful venture capital fi- nancing system called \u2018Yozma\u2019, established in 1992 with seed govern- ment funds, which led to the establishment of a successful equity fund industry, and has been a major driver for growth of the high-tech sec- tor in Israel. The existence of a liquid, dynamic and well-regulated Tel Aviv Stock Exchange open to lowly capitalised companies provides ad- ditional opportunities for fast-growing innovative companies to raise risk capital.

Israel has also undertaken studies on special tax incentives to increase financing of small enterprises, although these studies have not been reported to senior Ministry of Finance officials for consideration. SME taxpayer assistance to reduce the tax compliance burden is in an advanced stage in Israel.Tax returns, tax information and supporting documentation are widely available to taxpayers; tax information is actively disseminated to businesses; a toll-free telephone service staffed by adequately trained tax specialists responds to taxpayers\u2019questions; and regular discussions are held with national chambers of commerce and other bodies to consider how tax- payer assistance and education could be improved. ACC E S S TO M A R K E TS As the domestic market is relatively limited and the regional market largely inaccessible, Israel has given high priority to secure access and develop exports to overseas markets, in particular to the USA and the EU. Therefore it has developed a strong strategy and the tools to im- plement it. The Foreign Trade Administration is the main institution in charge of export promotion in Israel; it is an arm of the MoITL.The FICC and the Israel Institute for Export and International Cooperation are easing access to the Israeli market and encouraging Israeli companies to export. There are a number of SMEs with technological orientation (usually funded through venture capital) interested in building projects with foreign partners. Facilities such as the ICA and the Israel Institute for Export and International Cooperation try to build mechanisms to sustain contact.To promote exports among young entrepreneurs there are a number of training programmes offered, including through the MATI as operated by ISMEA. The Israeli government has taken steps to simplify procedures for for- eign trade, including computerising procedures for foreign trade, and setting up a virtual one-stop-shop to accommodate exporters. Up-to- date information is available on the MoITL website (and its affiliates\u2019 websites) and through monthly publications. AC A As To be ready for the signature of an ACAA with the EU, the partner coun- try should have adequate infrastructure in the fields of standardisation, accreditation, conformity assessment, metrology and market surveil- lance, and should have adopted the relevant parts of the acquis . Israeli infrastructurehasanadequatelevel.Harmonisationofthelegislationin the priority sectors chosen by Israel (good manufacturing practices for medicinal products, medical devices and pressure equipment) is well advanced, but the horizontal elements of the new approach have to be integrated in the Israeli legislation on medical devices and pressure equipment. The adoption of European standards in these sectors and the withdrawal of national conflicting ones are under way. 4. Services for enterprises B U S I N E S S S U P P O R T S E RV I C E S Most business services which cater to SMEs are offered through the MATI, spread throughout the country in 28 locations. The centres pro- vide consulting services, access to export promotion opportunities and access to finance. The MAI, the FICC and the Lahav also provide similar services in addition to advocacy functions (as elaborated in Section 2 above). One of the top priorities of ISMEA is to promote enterprise crea- tion among members of the Haredim and the Arab-Israeli community. For this purpose it has located MATIs within the targeted communities and launched a series of targeted services, designed in association with the community representatives.

Human capital ThissectionconsidersthehumancapitaldimensionsoftheCharter:en- trepreneurship education and training, and enterprise skills. Firstly, while entrepreneurial learning promotion at different levels of the education system is well developed, it lies for the most part outside the formal learning system and is not set against a policy or strategy. It is this issue which the Charter particularly recommends to ensure co- herence and efficiency of a country\u2019s overall effort on entrepreneurial learning. More specifically, a national lifelong entrepreneurial learning strategy, involving all parts of education in cooperation with the world of enterprise, would reinforce the already good effort by addressing gaps in the curriculum (e.g. entrepreneurship key competence provi- sion). Additionally, it would prompt a sequencing of entrepreneurship educationacrossthelearningsystemallowingforanincrementalbuild- up of entrepreneurial awareness, knowledge and skills. It would addi- tionally guard against overlaps in curricula which can happen when entrepreneurship education is developed and delivered without a stra- tegic framework. Given the thrust of the Charter on education\u2019s contribution to the en- trepreneurial mind-set, and the consequent recommendations for promoting entrepreneurship as a key competence (e.g. promotion of creative thinking, opportunity identification, risk-taking, resource man- agement), Israel\u2019s performance on lower and upper secondary entre- preneurship education would quickly advance if the key competence recommendations were taken up, and resulting in adjustments to exist- ing curricula and teaching practice. Intermsofdisseminationofgoodpractice,Israel\u2019sperformanceparticu- larly stands out in terms of how entrepreneurial learning is promoted through Jewish communities worldwide. And here there is a range of excellent examples including entrepreneurship education for technol- ogy start-ups promoted by the Office of the Chief Scientist in coopera- tion with the Centre for International Cooperation (Mashav). Regarding enterprise skills (Dimension 3), Israel demonstrates a strong training provider market supported by the national budget and backed up with databases (e.g. ISMEA, MATI) on training provision, allowing en- terprises easy access to information on the training offer. Further, key sectoral organisations (tourism, agriculture, financial services, construc- tion) assure specific services for their members. Similarly, Israel scores highly on its training for international trade with well-established services offered by a range of providers, for example ISMEA, the Israel Export and International Cooperation Institute and the Standards In- stitution of Israel (SII). While data on enterprise training are generally available through the training provider network, there is no single data reference point which could facilitate policymaking and better target- ing of resources. This is something which could be considered. Finally, disaggregated data on training for women\u2019s start-ups were not identifi- able during the assessment although data to satisfy this component of the start-up indicator were sourced from an academic paper. Academic research is generally one-off and unless regularly updated would not satisfy the data demands of the Dimension 3 indicators. In closing, a regular survey of both training providers and enterprises on training needs and training acquisition would satisfy the quantitative require- ments of the Dimension 3 indicators in a future Charter assessment. 6. The way forward The Charter assessment has shown that, over the years, Israel has had a sound and effective enterprise policy, with a good record both in policy elaborationandinimplementation.Insomeareas,suchastheavailabil- ity of risk capital and innovation, Israel\u2019s performance is in line with that of the most advanced OECD countries. Nevertheless there are still areas for improvement. \u2022 Institutional framework for enterprise policy. Israel has adopted a pragmatic approach to enterprise policy and decided not to organise its intervention around a comprehensive enterprise policy strategy. However, the risk of this approach, particularly when government tries to address market failures at a micro-level channelled through highly targetedpolicyactions,isthatpublicinterventionisspreadoveralarge number of small projects, causing issues of coordination and lack of consistencyinapproach.Thegovernmentshouldmakesurethatagen- cies targeting the same sector of entrepreneurs work together and fa- vour the exchange of experience across agencies and project teams. \u2022 Betterlegislationandadministrativesimplification. Progressinthis area has been slower than in other dimensions, perhaps as a conse- quence of this targeted non-comprehensive approach. Israel should move ahead with a systematic programme of legislative review and simplification, and conduct regulatory impact assessments on new legislation and regulations. Page 101 ",

Israel could consider a more concerted effort to pro- mote entrepreneurship as a key competence within regular school curricula.Intermsofoverallefficiencyandcontributionoftheschool- ingsystemtoentrepreneuriallearning,theauthoritiescouldconsider the articulation of a more integrated framework for entrepreneurial learning to ensure a sequencing of effort up through the education system. More effort on promoting an entrepreneurial mind-set in lower and upper secondary education should be considered, with particularattentiontothedevelopmentofkeycompetenceslikecrea- tive thinking, opportunity identification, risk-taking, problem-solving and resource management. Existing curricula and teaching practice should be adjusted accordingly. Promoting entrepreneurship as a key competence would also bring added value to the range of non- formal entrepreneurial learning activities already being delivered. On Dimension 3, to meet the data demands of the indicators, a regular survey of enterprise training, including knowledge/training needs, would allow for better targeting of public resources for business- related training, while ensuring training providers are more able to fine-tune training provision to demand. Gender-disaggregated data on start-up training should feature in any data development effort. 5.0 4.0 3.0 2.0 1.0 0.0 1 S i m p l e P r o c e d u r e s 2 E n t r e p r e n e u r s h i p 3 I m p r o v e d S k i l l s 4 A c c e s s t o F i n a n c e 5 M a r k e t A c c e s s 6 I n n o v a t i v e F i r m s 7 B u s i n e s s A s s o c i a t i o n s 8 B u s i n e s s S e r v i c e s 9 E u r o - M e d N e t w o r k s 1 0 C l e a r I n f o r m a t i o n Figure 25: Israel: Overall scores per Charter dimension Page 102 ",
        "Page 103 Jordan 1. Country overview Jordan has a long and largely positive track record in implementing structural economic reforms. The first cycle of reforms was sparked by the foreign debt crisis and the ensuing urgent need for targeted fiscal consolidation and macroeconomic stabilisation in 1988\u201389. In the late 1990s, the government conducted a number of high-profile privatisa- tion and liberalisation processes and started to reduce barriers to trade and foreign direct investment (FDI).The latest cycle of reforms is focus- ing on the improvement of the business climate, the completion of the privatisation programme and the development of large public\u2013private projects in the energy and transport sectors. At the same time the gov- ernment is pushing for further opening of the economy through the establishment of a network of free trade agreements (FTAs) with strate- gic commercial partners. Jordan recently signed FTAs with the USA (its main export market) and Turkey. It is a member, together with Egypt, Morocco and Tunisia, of the Agadir FTA and it is moving towards the dismantling of tariff barriers on imports from the EU by 2011. Lacking natural resources and an efficient agricultural sector, and ham- pered by the chronic shortage of water, the country has capitalised on its role as: a regional trade, transport and service hub; a supplier of qualified labourtotheGulfstates;andanattractivetourismdestination.Economic growth over the last three years has been strong, averaging over 6.7 % per year, led by a construction boom and underpinned by a growing in- flow of remittances and FDI, particularly from the Gulf states. Jordan is located at the centre of an area of high political instability and its high dependence on energy and food imports made it vulnerable to frequent external shocks. Particularly delicate is the economic inter- dependence between Jordan and Iraq. So far, Jordan has skilfully man- aged to navigate through periodic phases of regional turbulence. The industrial sector plays a relatively marginal role in the Jordanian economy, with a contribution to GDP of around 20 %. However, beside traditional capital-intensive sectors such as phosphates, basic chemi- cals and cement, the country has developed a niche specialisation in pharmaceuticals and a new export-oriented garment sector. The latter emerged over the last few years as a result of the qualifying industrial zone (QIZ) arrangement with the USA (47) . The service sector has a good growth potential, particularly in ICT services, business process out- sourcing, healthcare services and business consulting services for the regional market. Jordancurrentlyfacesthreechallenges:highendemicunemployment and poverty rates (around 14 % each), and an inflation rate of 11 % in the first quarter of 2008. In order to increase gainful employment, reduce poverty and withstand inflation, Jordan must focus on high value-added production whether in services or industry. Furthermore, itshouldgeneratedomesticemploymentforitsrapidlygrowingwork- force. 2. Enterprise policy and public\u2013private consultation T H E I N S T I T U T I O N A L P O L I C Y F R A M E WO R K Jordan has established a number of agencies implementing enter- prise policy in different areas. They include the Jordan Investment Board (JIB), the Jordan Institution of Standards and Metrology, the Jor- dan Industrial Estate Corporation (JIEC), the Free Zones Corporation (FZC) and the Jordan Enterprise Development Corporation (JE), which is in charge of trade, export promotion and enterprise development. The JE\u2019s role has been recently strengthened by being the sole imple- mentationbodyforalltheenterprisesupportingprogrammes,includ- ing the Jordan upgrading and modernisation programme (JUMP), the largest and most developed programme for direct company support that received funding from the EU.The EU will further expand the JE\u2019s capacity by providing technical assistance and grants for upgrading enterprises in manufacturing, agriculture and services.The capacity of the executive agencies could be improved through a monitoring and evaluationsystemtomeasuretheimpactoftheexecutiveagencieson the business environment. Exchange of information and programme coordination is assured by interministerial meetings, by the fact that the Minister for Industry and Trade chairs the board of each one of the executive agencies, and by a system of cross-board representation. There will be stepped-up coor- dination when the Jordan Agency for Economic Development (JAED) becomes fully operational, as the JAED has a mandate to improve coor- dination and exchange of information on enterprise policy. It will serve as a framework to group all development entities under one umbrella. The JAED is also expected to secure private sector orientation in enter- prise governance. Jordandoesnothaveyetacomprehensiveenterprisepolicystrategy,al- thoughapaperisbeingdraftedwiththesupportofUSAID.TheMinistry of Industry andTrade (MoIT) is drawing up industrial policy and sector- specific development strategies, but they have not been published yet.

C L E A R A N D TA R G E T E D I N F O R M AT I O N Jordan has received external assistance for elaborating and disseminat- ing information to the enterprise sector. Basic economic and legislative information is available and disseminated, mainly through the network of the chambers of commerce and industry. However, more sophisticat- ed economic information, such as the database combining trade and investment data created with US support, is not yet accessible to users. Information on business and economic activity related to enterprises is widely available online, but is scattered on several websites, as there is not a single interactive portal for enterprise affairs. 3. Operational environment A D M I N I S T R AT I V E S I M P L I F I C AT I O N Jordanhasestablishedaministrymandatedto:developthepublicsector\u2019s performance and productivity; improve service delivery; and streamline administrative procedures. Nevertheless, there is a limited role for the Ministry of Public Sector Development (MoPSD) in improving legislation and administrative simplification of enterprise operations. Some of the executive agencies are taking initiatives on an ad hoc basis. The enter- prise strategy that is being prepared with the help of USAID should pro- vide for a full review of procedures and legislation affecting enterprises. No attempt has been made to introduce regulatory impact analysis. Nevertheless, financial cost-benefit analyses are performed on legisla- tions dealing with tax or customs tariffs. CO M PA NY R E G I S T R AT I O N Significant progress has been achieved in reducing time for company registration. A one-stop-shop was established at the Jordan Investment Boardin2004,whereinvestorscandealwithsevenministriesandseveral governmental agencies (e.g. Greater Amman Municipality, Department ofLandandSurvey)inchargeoftheregistrationandlicensingofprojects at once. Although the one-stop-shop is fully operational, private sector representatives have complained that permits are not always granted on the spot and instead only a receipt of the application is granted. Good progress has been made in developing a system of online regis- tration:companiescannowregisterthroughthewebsiteoftheMinistry of Industry andTrade and send the application electronically. However, the law on e-signature has not yet been approved and the applicant must visit the service desk in order to sign the application form in front of the government official. Registration fees can also only be paid in person or though a designated representative who has proof of power of attorney. The Ministry of Information and Communication Technol- ogyhasstartedanevaluationofexistingadministrativeproceduresand madedetailedproposalsfortheintroductionofonlineregistration(cur- rently 52 % of government organisations are represented online). Further improvements can be introduced. For instance, the principle of\u2018silence is consent\u2019is not yet applied to company registration proce- dures in Jordan.

Jordan has a leasing law, which assigns the MoIT as the ministry in charge of its implementation. However, there are certain implementation problems, such as the lack of a registry of movable assets or the sales tax regula- tions which stipulate double taxation if the lease is conducted with a leasing company instead of a bank. Microfinance facilities are mainly state or donor funded. Although a number of equity funds are operat- ing in Jordan, the regulatory and legal framework is not yet completed. Minimum capitalisation requirements for the listing on the Amman Stock Exchange are relatively low, but few medium-sized companies are listed on the market. I N V E S T M E N T-F R I E N D L Y TAXAT I O N There are as yet no assessments of tax impediments to SME equity financing and to risky investment in SMEs, or assessments of compli- ance costs for SMEs. However, the Ministry of Finance is conducting a study of the impact of taxes on the individual. Additionally, important progress has been made regarding taxpayer assistance to reduce the tax compliance burden. The Income and Sales Tax Department has a call centre and an open window for taxpayers\u2019complaints and informa- tion. The CEO of this department hears taxpayer complaints one day a week. Additionally, a tax information website and an e-filing system are currently available. ACC E S S TO M A R K E TS Better market access is a Charter area that can be further developed in Jordan. No export promotion strategy is in place, although the JE is currently working with several donors to develop a formal national strategy in 2008 and an export promotion programme (funded by the Commission) will help to implement it starting in 2009. Computeris- ing procedures for foreign trade have been launched. For instance, the Customs Department is using Asycuda++, a computerised customs management system, which covers most foreign trade procedures.The system handles manifests and customs declarations, accounting proce- dures, transit and suspense procedures. AC A As To be ready for the signature of an ACAA with the EU, the partner coun- try should have adequate infrastructure in the fields of standardisation, accreditation, conformity assessment, metrology and market surveil- lance, and should have adopted the relevant parts of the acquis.

Services for enterprises B U S I N E S S S U P P O R T S E RV I C E S With the help of technical and financial assistance, a number of mainly public and donor-funded business service providers have developed their activities over the years. The JE provides a range of services to all types of enterprises ranging from basic training to technological train- ing aimed at upgrading enterprises. The JUMP programme targets the upgrading of SMEs and has created a website listing registered service providers by specialisation. Similar information is also available from the professional organisations. I N N OVAT I O N P O L I C Y There is a growing perception of the need for more innovation policy in Jordan, where the country is moving from a phase based on ad hoc pilot and donor-supported projects, to a more structured programme, although the country does not have a formal innovation strategy yet. The Jordan Industrial Estates Corporation has set up a network of in- novation centres to promote cooperation between industry and uni- versities. In addition, Jordan Innovation Centre (JIC) is building a net- work of innovation centres and incubators; currently there are seven incubators in operation with two more planned for the end of 2008. There are plans to establish an additional two in cooperation with the\u2018Support to research and technological development and innova- tion initiatives and strategies\u2019 project. Three business incubators are in operation at Irbid University and one at Jordan University. In addi- tion there are a number of incubators (operational or planned) with a sector specialisation, such as the one located within the Amman ICT City. Different academic and business institutions have helped launch business incubators, including those established by the Jordan Forum for Business and ProfessionalWomen, and the JordanYoung Entrepre- neurs Association. On the institutional side, a Higher Council for Science and Technology brings together all the main ministries, institutions and private sector organisations, and coordinates national initiatives in the area of science and technology. In order to be fully effective, these initiatives will have to integrate into a broader policy encompassing for instance the pro- motionofentrepreneurshipandtheavailabilityofseedcapitalforstart- ups and risk capital for high-growth enterprises. E U R O-M E D N E T WO R K S Euro-Mediterranean networking activities between enterprises and be- tween business support services are limited to a few initiatives taken by the Jordan innovation centre network and the Jordan Chamber of Industry.There is considerable scope for developing them and the new EU bilateral and regional programmes promoting export and invest- ment will undoubtedly help Jordan to do so. 5. Human capital This section considers the human capital dimensions of the Charter. More specifically, the assessment concentrates on entrepreneurship education and training developments (Dimension 2) as well as the sup- port framework for developing trade and management skills for enter- prises (Dimension 3). On entrepreneurship education and training, the assessment con- cludes that, while there are good efforts being made to promote en- trepreneurial learning, this tends to be addressed in a singular manner, withoutlinkagesandnoconcertedvisionofwhereJordanisgoingwith entrepreneurial learning. This forms the crux of the Charter policy indi- cator, whose objective is to encourage a sequencing of entrepreneur- ship promotion across the entire learning system. Particular emphasis by the Charter is also afforded to entrepreneurship key competence development (this includes soft skills like creativity, opportunity iden- tification and risk-taking). This remains to be addressed within the sec- ondary school curricula, and which would be supplemented by more developed business skills in the latter parts of the education system. That said, there are clearly good foundations on which the Jordanian authorities and enterprise world could build. Firstly, the national educa- tion strategy makes clear strides towards the development of broader keycompetences(e.g.languages,mathematics).Thiscouldbeenlarged to include the entrepreneurship key competence across compulsory education. Secondly, the vocational education and training strategy could reinforce the emphasis given to vocational skills with specific business skills. Thirdly, the national agenda provides a clear framework for university curricula reform in tune with a knowledge society. This could be supplemented with debate as to how the universities respond to the needs of an entrepreneurial society, in particular through cross- campus entrepreneurship education promotion. Progress on the Char- ter policy indicator could be made reasonably quickly if an established cross-stakeholder body considered the options for a comprehensive lifelong entrepreneurial learning policy framework, while ensuring that the various parts of the learning system interface to create a sequential delivery framework. The Higher Council for Human Resource Develop- ment would be well placed to bring this recommendation forward. On enterprise skills, while there is a well-established network and fi- nancing support framework for training provision across the country, thereisnosystematictrackingoftrainingtake-up.Lackofdatacompro- mises Jordan\u2019s performance particularly on the indicators addressing general training activity by the enterprise community, start-up training and training for expanding businesses where good efforts in manage- ment development for growing enterprises are noted. Similarly, Jor- dan\u2019spromotionoftrainingforinternationalmarketsiswellestablished, and developments in training on e-business would be a step forward in this area. To move forward on Dimension 3, the enterprise world and public au- thorities would do well to establish a systematic survey of businesses. Resulting data would have a number of spin-offs. Firstly, reliable data should help policymakers to evaluate investment in enterprise-related training while allowing for better targeting of resources. Secondly, data on enterprise training should flag up training gaps, weaknesses and fu- tureskills\u2019requirementstobesharedwithtrainingproviders.Thiswould make for a more responsive training market and improved efficiency in the training effort by prompting a closer fit between demand and supply of training.

Jordan was one of the first countries in the MED region to build an articulated institutional enterprisepolicyframeworkandtoassignpolicyimplementationtospe- cialised government executive agencies. However, policy development has stalled recently.

Country overview Overthelastthreedecades,theLebaneseeconomyhasshownremarkable resilience,copingsincethemid-1970swithaprotractedcivilwar(1975\u201390), with recurrent conflicts and invasions by Israel (1982, 1996 and 2006) and witharmedconflictandprolongedpoliticalinstability(2005\u201308). GDP grew strongly between 1991 and 1997, thanks to a massive recon- struction programme started at the end of the civil war but growth stalled in the early 2000s, as the reconstruction costs and external debt piled up. The economy progressively accelerated from 2002 on, reaching a peak of 7.5 % in 2004. The assassination of Prime Minister Hariri in February 2005 brought in its wake a new phase of high political instability that produced a sharp deceleration of economic growth. The 2006 conflict caused wide- spread destruction of infrastructure and housing units. Nevertheless GDP growth rebounded in 2007, with a preliminary estimated growth rate of 4 %, supported by an extensive and largely donor-funded reconstruction programme. The resilience of the Lebanese economy is largely based on the flexibility of its economic structure (made up almost exclusively of small and me- dium-sized family-run companies), the strong entrepreneurial spirit of its population, and the solidity of its financial and banking sector. Lebanon had traditionally adopted a laissez faire approach towards policymaking. Theeconomyiswidelyopentotradeandinvestment;labourandotherfac- tor markets are flexible and competitive. The economy is largely based on the service sector, which accounts for around 70 % of GDP, while the share of industry and particularly of the manufacturing sector has been steadily declining.Manufacturingactivitiesaccountedfor11.4%ofGDPin2006. Decades of conflicts, high political instability and major security risks have led to a significant deterioration of the business environment, once one of the most attractive in the region. They also left a heavy social legacy with largesectionsofthepopulationlivingindeprivedconditions,excludedfrom any form of social assistance, where basic health and education services are only provided by NGOs and religious organisations.The protracted political stalemateofthelasttwoyears,resolvedwiththeMay2008DohaAgreement between the various political factions, has heavily constrained the ability of thegovernmenttosteertheeconomy,conductaproactiveenterprisepolicy and address private sector development issues.

Enterprise policy and public\u2013private consultation T H E I N S T I T U T I O N A L P O L I C Y F R A M E WO R K There are several institutions in Lebanon responsible for different areas of enterprise policy. These include the Ministry of Economy and Trade (MoET), the Ministry of Industry (MoI), the Investment Development Authority of Lebanon (IDAL), and the Economic and Social Fund for De- velopment (ESFD). The MoI plays a role in the area of industrial policy, primarily by promoting local industry and improving business regula- tions. The IDAL operates as an independent investment promotion agency.The ESFD was set up to operate in microfinance and to serve as a business development service programme in south Lebanon. It over- sees the disbursement of government funds in the area of microcredit. There is room for improving ministerial coordination and the govern- menthasnotyetestablishedanoverarchingstrategyforenterprisepol- icy. Nevertheless, some coordination efforts are made. For example, the MoET, in partnership with the MoI and the EU (which provides funding) plays an active role in the elaboration of enterprise policy, specifically for SMEs. In 2005 an integrated SME support programme (ISSP) was es- tablished through this partnership The ISSP is based on four pillars of activity: SME support; policy, legislation and regulations; services; and finance.The programme has the potential to improve coordination but its implementation has been slow. A high-level interministerial administrative simplification programme supported by the Prime Minister and the International Finance Coop- eration (IFC) involving the Lebanese post office LibanPost has recently been established. Finally, interministerial committees on economic re- formsalsoensuredialoguebetweenthevariousparties,althoughthere is no specific focus on enterprise policy. P U B L I C\u2013P R I V AT E CO N S U LTAT I O N F R A M E WO R K Professional associations have traditionally been very strong and able to influence policy decisions and protect the interest of their members, sometimes at the cost of the other categories. Involvement of the private sector in Lebanon takes place on an ad hoc basis. The representatives from the private sector, such as the Chamber of Commerce, Industry and Agriculture (CCIAB) and the Association of Lebanese Industrialists (ALI), are invited to governmental meetings regarding sector-specific issues. (CCIAB keeps regular minutes of these meetings.) In addition to advocacy functions, the CCIAB, ALI and a number of other private sector associations (trade associations which are sector specific, professionalassociations,economicassociations)eachperformadvocacy functions and provide a range of services for their members. To increase theirsphereofinfluenceonthegovernment,anagglomerateassociation has been formed grouping the interests of four chambers of commerce, the six largest trade associations and three business associations. Never- theless, their capacity to influence decision-making is somewhat ham- pered by a lack of structure, limited resources and political differences. A number of advisory and steering committees have been formed in the ISSP to provide strategic guidance and institutional advice to policymak- ers. For example, the SME-specific strategy under the ISSP project was finalised following consultation with Lebanese business representatives.

A number of donor-funded initiatives have assisted in establishing databases such as the Euro Infor- mation Centre through the Centre for Economic Research of the CCIAB, which collects and disseminates economic information.

        "COMPANY REGISTR ATION In September 2007, a high-level interministerial administrative simplifica- tion programme supported by the Prime Minister and the IFC developed a project to reduce the overall time and costs required to open and reg- ister a business. By setting up one-stop-shops in the national post offices LibanPost, and by developing an easily accessible standard form for busi- ness registration (available in hard copy at the post office or online), the projecthasbeenabletodramaticallyreducethecost,thenumberofsteps and the time required to obtain the company registration certificate.

ACCESS TO FINANCE The credit environment in Lebanon is relatively well developed with a number of projects and laws under way to facilitate access to credit.

Banks have at their disposal credit information services, which are offered through the Central Bank. Finally, while there is currently a law on bankruptcy and on distressed companies, it is outdated and in practice it takes a very long time to settle commercial disputes in court. Financial facilities in Lebanon range from secured lending to risk capital. While the Central Bank of Lebanon is enforcing more strict rules on bank lending practices (by recommending minimum levels of collateral), banks have flexibility to manage their portfolios and a majority of banks ask for high collateral for SMEs and start-ups. Although leasing is not a common practice, there is a law fully implemented in this area with three leasing companies in operation. The credit and guarantee institution, Kafalat, cooperates with several banksandoperatesunderthesupervisionoftheCentralBank.Todate,Ka- falathasguaranteedmorethan5000loans,withanaverageloanamount of EUR 65 000. Microfinance is a relatively large industry in Lebanon, where government operators have provided credit of up to EUR 18 million (based on 2003 statistics) (48) . There are a number of institutions that facilitate access to sources of microfinance from the public sector and NGOs. Despite these positive developments, access to finance is one of the most significant barriers to enterprise creation and development. The government Economic and Social Fund for Development (ESFD) helps entrepreneurs who are too small to obtain loans from banks. It op- erates in the area of microfinance, and the maximum amount of a loan is EUR 20 000. The ESFD gives credit for fixed or for working capital.

The ESFD has disbursed EUR 10 billion to entrepreneurs through an enterprise support facility in partnership with the EIB. In terms of private equity, there are a few recently established funds oper- ating at investment banks and other financial institutions. A new EUR 10 millionfundspecialisedinSMEswascreatedinJuly2007.Theprivatecom- pany Berytech has established a seed/early-stage fund with the mandate to invest in promising technology companies. At this stage, only highly capitalised companies are listed on the Beirut Stock Exchange (BSE). INVESTMENT-FRIENDL Y TAXATION In Lebanon, tax officials have not studied the implications for enterprise financing and investment of double taxation of distributed and retained profit. However, Lebanon reported to have taken into consideration the integration principle when designing its new draft personal income tax law. Assessments of the average cost to SMEs of complying with certain main taxes are currently taking place in Lebanon. Additionally, SME tax- payer assistance to reduce the tax compliance burden is quite advanced. Tax returns, tax information and supporting documentation are widely available to taxpayers; tax information is actively disseminated to busi- nesses through, for example, seminars organised at local level; and a toll- free telephone service with adequately trained tax specialists is provided to respond to taxpayers\u2019questions. ACCESS TO MARKE TS Despite the importance of export to the Lebanese economy, there is cur- rently no export promotion strategy. In 2006, a law was drafted for the creation of an export promotion agency; the law still awaits final ratifica- tion by the parliament. There are a number of ad hoc efforts by both the public and private sectors, and supported by donor institutions, to pro- mote Lebanese exports and companies in the industrial/manufacturing sector. There are also a number of EU-funded projects such as Qualeb (a quality upgrading programme for exports to the EU) and the ISSP (in col- laboration with the CCIAB), which have an export promotion component for SMEs. The IDAL is also known for other export promotion and match- making, although its efforts are geared at promoting the agricultural sector. Based in the Ministry of Economy and Trade (MoET), Trade Point facilitates trade between Lebanese and foreign partners through match- making, provision of statistical information, etc. The only private sector intervention is through the ALI which has created an export promotion council representing the interests of industry. As part of its administrative simplification programme operating out of the OMSAR and in cooperation with the Ministry of Finance, Lebanon is creating an automation application, and computerisation developments have been undertaken at the level of customs.

Lebanon has begun upgrading the infrastructure and harmonising horizontal legis- lation. The alignment of the legislation in the priority sectors chosen by Lebanon (construction products, electrical appliances and pressure equipment) has not yet started.The adoption of European standards in the priority sectors and the withdrawal of national conflicting ones are under progress. 4. Services for enterprises B U S I N E S S S U P P O R T S E RV I C E S Business services for enterprises are offered through both public and private channels. The ISSP has established four business development centres(BDCs)indifferentregionsofthecountrytargetingthedevelop- ment of SMEs. These BDCs were established in cooperation with mu- nicipalities, NGOs and local enterprises in order to create a sustainable network. The BDCs provide services to innovative businesses by stimu- lating public\u2013private cooperation on the creation of innovations. The Euro-Lebanese Centre for Industrial Modernisation (ELCIM) is an EU-funded programme for industrial modernisation. It operates through the MoI to improve performance of manufacturing companies and facilitate access to long-term financing and capital investment.The programme is hosted in the Industrial Research Institute (IRI) and offers consulting, facilities of technology transfer and improving product effi- ciency. IRI/ELCIM supports a few clusters in sectors like food and bever- ages, software, packaging and media. The business associations, such as the CCIAB and ALI, are reported to offer limited services to enterprises. Information on business services is not easily available to enterprises, except for the limited number who have access to the BDCs. I N N OVAT I O N P O L I C Y While the ISSP and ELIMC programmes offer services in developing in- novativeenterprisesinLebanon,thepolicyareahasnotbeenidentified as a priority.The impetus to stimulate innovation is coming from the re- searchanduniversitysectors.InApril2006,thescience,technologyand innovationplan(STIP)wasestablished.Itistheonlyinnovationresearch programme with a vision for innovation development in the country. It has emerged out of a joint effort of a large number of Lebanese profes- sionals, scientists and international experts (National Council for Scien- tific Research (CNRS)). Furthermore, there are a number of programmes targeting innovative enterprises, including the Lebanese industrial research achievements programme (LIRA), which was launched in 1997 in collaboration with ALI, CNRS, MoI, universities and a number of private organisations. Its aim was to match the activities of researchers with the needs of in- dustry. The LIRA programme is also in the first stages of establishing a technopole to train engineers and to develop new technologies. A technopole in the area of biotechnology and medicine will be added to the Berytech pioneer initiative led by St Joseph\u2019s University to supply incubator, counselling and technical support services to start-ups. Two additional technopoles are being developed by the private sector: the EddeGlobalVillageinJbeil(amediazoneproject)andtheMakseIndus- trial Park in the BekaValley. E U R O-M E D N E T WO R K S Lebanon has been connected to a number of EU networks for enter- prises over the past years and is considering participating in the EU competitiveness and innovation framework programme as a way to maintain and upgrade these connections. 5. Human capital This section addresses the human capital dimensions of the Charter, set against a growing awareness that a skilled and knowledgeable workforce is critical to competitive enterprises.The Charter also affords particular emphasis to entrepreneurship education and training, seen as key to developing awareness and readiness of young people to con- sider entrepreneurship as a realistic career option. On entrepreneurship education and training, the assessment points to limited developments in terms of policy and delivery in lower and up- per secondary education. While there are some excellent projects pro- moting entrepreneurship at selected lower secondary schools (e.g. the InJaz initiative), the Charter\u2019s recommendations go wider. The Charter recommends that all school children have access to entrepreneurial learning and particularly that entrepreneurship as a key competence be mainstreamed across the formal education system. It additionally encourages harder business skills development (e.g. business plan- ning,book-keeping,start-uptraining)offeredascompulsoryorelective subjects from upper secondary education onwards.To ensure that such developments take place, a national dialogue, with a view to policy and strategy building for lifelong entrepreneurship education, could be considered. This would immediately ensure the progress of Lebanon on the \u2018policy\u2019 indicator. Dialogue could build on the national educa- tion strategy; this already gives specific attention to entrepreneurship promotion at third-level education, but the dialogue could go wider to early education and R & D developments (where there is already good recognition of the need for entrepreneurship incentives by the STIP). The objective of strategy building should be to create a comprehen- sive framework for entrepreneurship education bringing together all parts of the education system and interfacing with enterprise and serv- ices already offered by an active non-governmental sector. Assuming a national commitment to strategy building, the curriculum authority (CERD) would require technical and financial assistance to see through the implications for curriculum adjustment, teacher training and school management.Giventhechallengeofthe\u2018across-system\u2019developments, international support to the national authorities could be sought. One feature of the assessment which stands out particularly in terms of policy innovation is the development of entrepreneurship as a primary pillar of careers guidance and counselling. Although still in an early phase of development, this is clearly an area for policy learning by fel- low countries in the Euro-Mediterranean region and beyond. It could be considered by the education authorities as an area to be eventually brought forward for regional dissemination. ",
        "Page 111 In terms of skilled manpower within the enterprise environment, Leba- non stands out for its efforts in promoting trade skills for enterprises and particularly management development for expanding businesses at four regional enterprise centres where public and private funds are dovetailed to good effect. However, if Lebanon is to make better head- way on this area of the Charter, a concerted effort is required to build baseline data on enterprise training needs and training take-up. This will be important to determine effectiveness, particularly of start-up training where significant public funds are allocated, and where policy adjustments and more efficient resource allocation are needed. 6. The way forward Lebanon has received relatively poor scores in most of the Charter di- mensions,withtheexclusionofaccesstofinanceandinnovationpolicy. Particularly critical has been the assessment of entrepreneurship train- ingandskillsdevelopment.Ontheotherhand,theanalysisaboveshows that Lebanon has a relatively well-developed institutional framework and has the capacity to conduct innovative and effective reforms, as demonstrated by the recently introduced company registration reform. The country\u2019s relatively poor performance is due largely to internal po- litical strife and the legislative stalemate that has affected the country since the assassination of Prime Minister Hariri, and the aftermath of the 2006 conflict, which shifted efforts to emergency reconstruction, putting economic reforms at a lower level of priority. On the basis of the Charter assessment, the following priorities have been identified. \u2022 Institutional policy framework. The first priority is to reactivate work on the enterprise policy agenda set in 2005, taking into con- siderationnecessarychangesandintegrationtofittothenewpoliti- cal and economic context. In particular, the country should further develop the integrated SME support programme, launched in 2005, and resume work on the four pillars of the programme. This will re- quire relaunching consultations with the private sector in order to redefine priorities and update the work programme. \u2022 Regulatory reform. The priority is to resume the work started un- der the framework of the strategy for simplification of administra- tive procedures through the MoET, the OMSAR and the Ministry of Finance, focusing on the administrative constraints imposed on small enterprises, the bulk of the Lebanese productive sector. \u2022 Business support schemes and services. There is a need to ex- pand the networkofthebusinessdevelopmentcentresthroughthe country, upgrading their structure and using them as a channel to deliver government and donor-funded programmes. Morocco and Tunisia have created similar structures and their experience could be valuable to Lebanon. \u2022 Humancapital. WithrespecttoDimension2,theeducationauthorities should initiate a dialogue with the private sector, non-governmental interestgroupsanduniversitiestodeterminehowamorecomprehen- sive effort to promote entrepreneurial learning could be established. Secondly, the good initiative to promote entrepreneurship through school guidance and counselling services should be brought further with an objective to share experience regionally and beyond. On Di- mension 3, baseline data on enterprise training (management and occupational skills) for enterprises need to be established. Differentia- tion of start-up data by gender will be important for Charter monitor- ing purposes. This would allow for more effective policymaking and better targeting of public funds for enterprise training. 5.0 4.0 3.0 2.0 1.0 0.0 1 S i m p l e P r o c e d u r e s 2 E n t r e p r e n e u r s h i p 3 I m p r o v e d S k i l l s 4 A c c e s s t o F i n a n c e 5 M a r k e t A c c e s s 6 I n n o v a t i v e F i r m s 7 B u s i n e s s A s s o c i a t i o n s 8 B u s i n e s s S e r v i c e s 9 E u r o - M e d N e t w o r k s 1 0 C l e a r I n f o r m a t i o n Figure 27: Lebanon: Overall scores per Charter dimension ",

Country overview OverthelastfiveyearstheMoroccaneconomyhasgonethroughmajor transformations resulting from an extensive process of economic re- forms, a progressive opening to trade and investment, and increasing integration with the EU economy. Economic growth between 2001 and 2007 has been strong, at an aver- age yearly rate of 5.4 %, and significantly higher than in the previous decade. The medium-term economic outlook remains positive. Most importantly, the share of industry and services in GDP and total em- ployment has grown significantly, partially lowering the high depend- ence on output from the agricultural sector, which has been subject to large fluctuations caused by frequent droughts. Theperformanceoftheexport-orientedsectors,suchaselectroniccom- ponents, textiles and garments, has been particularly strong. However, the last two sectors suffered a temporary setback in 2005\u201306 following the abolition of Multi-Fibre Agreement quotas and the liberalisation of imports into the EU (the main Moroccan export market) from China and other Far East producers. The performance of the tourism sector has been particularly dynamic, growing at 10\u201315 % per year over the lastthreeyearsandproducingsignificantspilloversfortheconstruction and transport sectors. At the same time, following the privatisation and liberalisationofthetelecommunicationssector,anewadvancedservice sector linked to ICT and business processing outsourcing is emerging. According to the national company register (OMPIC), more than 95 % of Moroccan enterprises are SMEs. Those enterprises account for 50 % of total employment, 30 % of total exports and 40 % of total private investment. Thanks largely to the growth of the SME sector, total un- employment fell below the 10 % mark in 2007. Annual new company registrations more than doubled between 2000 and 2007, stabilising at around 30 000 new registrations per year, an indication of the impact of reforms engaged since the 1990s, of the reduction of entry barriers and of the multiplication of business opportunities. However,theSMEsectorstillpresentsanumberofstructuralweakness- es such as a low value-added sector, undercapitalisation, poor produc- tivity and limited management skills. Moroccan SMEs are struggling to developlinkageswiththegrowingnumberofmultinationalcompanies establishing production facilities in the country.

Enterprise policy and public\u2013private consultations T H E I N S T I T U T I O N A L P O L I C Y F R A M E WO R K The leading institution for elaborating and coordinating enterprise policy in Morocco is the Ministry of Industry, Commerce and NewTech- nologies. Specific policies set by the Ministry of Economy and Finance, the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries, the Ministry of Tourism and Handicrafts, the Ministry of Foreign Trade and the Ministry of Interior contribute to defining the operational environment for business. In addition, the Ministry of Economic and General Affairs plays a role of overseeing the overall economic reform agenda, including areas such as corporate governance or competition. In 2002, with the approval of the SME Charter (Law 53-00), the govern- mentsetthestageforitspolicytowardstheSMEsector.TheCharterclari- fied competencies among government institutions and established a new proactive policy to promote the development and creation of SMEs in partnership with the private sector. It also established the National Agency for SME Promotion (ANPME). As the operational public sector in- stitution dealing with the promotion and support of SMEs, the ANPME\u2019s main mission is to pilot and implement the national competitive mod- ernisation programme. Operating as an executive agency, it also plays an important role as an advocacy body in the government policy debate. At the same time, the government adopted the Rawaj Vision 2020 strat- egy specific to the trade sectors. The approval of the Plan Emergence in 2006setthestrategicobjectivesforthecountry\u2019smedium-termindustrial policy to 2015, identifying priority sectors and upgrading policy tools. Sector-specific strategies have been designed that relate to tourism ( Plan Azur ), ICTs (e-Maroc 2010), transport, energy, audiovisual industry and handicrafts.

The level of coordination among relevant government institutions is generally good and is reinforced in high-level interministerial commit- tees focusing on competitive modernisation of enterprises, enterprise creation and corporate governance.

C L E A R A N D TA R G E T E D I N F O R M AT I O N There has been a significant improvement in the quality, range and dis- semination of government information to enterprises. A large amount of information has been posted online and is available on the websites of various public institutions and agencies. Further improvements could be achieved by completing the arsenal of intelligence mecha- nisms, eliminating redundant and obsolete information, standardising information presentation and linking more closely the information that isavailableonlineforenterprises,forexamplethroughtheconstruction of a single portal for all enterprise affairs. 3. Operational environment A D M I N I S T R AT I V E S I M P L I F I C AT I O N In 1992 the Moroccan government took action to simplify administra- tive procedures and regulation for enterprises, including using ICTs and seeking local players\u2019 cooperation. For instance, a commission estab- lished in 1999 has examined 750 procedures, 200 of which have been simplified. The ministry responsible for modernising the public sector also took steps for the benefit of both individuals and companies. De- spitethesesuccesses,across-sector,multiannualsimplificationstrategy has yet to be defined. Moreover, Morocco could introduce a system of cost-benefit analysis for new enterprise legislation and regulation. CO M PA NY R E G I S T R AT I O N One area where administrative simplification has made significant progress is in the reduction of the time and number of steps required for an enterprise owner to open and close a business. An enterprise can be registered in 48 hours upon presentation of a single form (requires only one step) during a visit to a one-stop-shop in the 16 regional in- vestment centres (CRIs) throughout the country. Registration proce- dures for limited liability companies still remain burdensome and long, requiring more than 10 administrative steps. Registering and closing a limited liability company remains costly for enterprise owners. Morocco hasnotyetimplementeda\u2018silenceisconsent\u2019practiceforadministrative registration. ACC E S S TO F I N A N C E Since the 1990s, Morocco has performed relatively well amongst its peers, with regard to improving access to finance and developing a sound and competitive banking and financial sector. The country has worked hard to improve the legislative and regulatory environment for financial institutions, strengthen the banking sector through privatisa- tion, recapitalise local banks, open up to foreign investment and diver- sify the supply of financial services. A number of developments have improved access to credit: over the last few years, Moroccan banks have started to take a keener interest in SMEs, designing specific products and services for different types of en- terprisesaswellascentresdedicatedtotheirSMEclients.Theyareintro- ducing a credit rating system complying with international standards. Eleven credit guarantee schemes funded by the state and operated by twospecialisedentities(CCG) (50) andDarAddamane)areworkingclose- ly with the commercial banks whose approach in terms of collateral re- quirements remains conservative. For over a decade, Morocco has been building microfinance facilities; it has become a leader in this field in the MED and greater Middle East re- gion.MicrofinancefacilitiescanprovideloansofuptoEUR4500.Theyare run by a number of specialised NGOs and offer a wide range of products. Currentlytheyboastover1millionbeneficiaries,morethan60%women. The availability of risk capital in Morocco has been growing due in part to the support of the EIB. The regulatory framework is set to improve, thanks to 2006 legislation that gives incentives to venture capital fund managers to invest in SMEs as defined by the SME Charter. The reform of the stock market, the development of a new listing reserved for com- panies with low capitalisation and the creation of fiscal incentives have openedupnewoptionsforequityfundsandnewopportunitiesforrais- ing risk capital.

Despite these improvements, micro- and small enterprises and new en- trepreneurs regularly claim that access to finance remains a problem. Thiscanalsobesaidforenterprisesinthemiddlemarketsegment(mid- dle-sized companies by definition do not fall under microfinance) that do not have sufficient fixed assets to back their financing needs. Prob- lems are also rooted in enterprises themselves: in addition to the lack of financial information, many enterprise owners (who would otherwise be eligible for credit) are unaware of banking and alternative sources of financing, such as leasing and factoring. I N V E S T M E N T-F R I E N D L Y TAXAT I O N Morocco has been engaged in well-structured fiscal reforms for several years. The VAT system has been the subject of recent tax reform, while currently Morocco is moving forward with plans to reform its system of personal and corporate income taxation. Additionally, Morocco is spearheading fiscal transparency efforts by reporting and publishing tax expenditures from October 2005.

These bodies cater to exports to Europe (Morocco\u2019s biggest export market) and facilitate trade with Morocco\u2019s numerous regional trading partners. The country has made some headway in simplifying proce- dures, with approval for the creation of a one-stop-shop for export. A pilot project has been launched to migrate from paper medium to the computerisation of foreign trade procedures. Regulatory and procedural information relating to foreign trade can be found on a number of governmental websites, in addition to private associations (i.e. ASMEX). AC A As TobereadyforthesignatureofanACAAwiththeEU,thepartnercountry should have adequate infrastructure in the fields of standardisation, ac- creditation, conformity assessment, metrology and market surveillance, and should have adopted the relevant parts of the acquis. In Morocco the upgrading of the infrastructure has started and harmonisation of the horizontal legislation is well advanced. The alignment of the legisla- tion in the priority sectors chosen by Morocco (machinery, construction products, electrical appliances, gas appliances and toys) has started.The adoptionofEuropeanstandardsintheprioritysectorsandthewithdraw- al of national conflicting ones are under progress. 4. Services for enterprises B U S I N E S S S U P P O R T S E RV I C E S A number of publicly funded institutions supported by donors and privately-run professional associations offer a range of services to enter- prises. In order to facilitate access to such services across the country, the ANPME has put in place the R\u00e9seaudesintervenantsr\u00e9gionauxpourla modernisationcomp\u00e9titivedesentreprises based on the provincial delega- tions of the Ministry of Industry, Commerce and New Technologies. The role of this network is to promote services to enterprises and entrepre- neurs and to inform them about the conditions of access. Theprovisionoftargetedservicestoenterprisesthroughthevariouspro- grammes of enterprise upgrading has been very important. These pro- grammes have been managed by THE ANPME, with the support of the European Commission, UNIDO and a number of bilateral donors. These programmes have significantly contributed to the technological and managerial upgrading of a good number of SMEs. Information on services to enterprises can be found on a number of on- line sources. One challenge is to keep this information up to date. In ad- dition, there are still some gaps in the expertise, the regional coverage needs to be further improved and the funding remains insufficient. In terms of enterprise creation, the government of Morocco has estab- lishedtheMoukawalatiprogrammepromotingentrepreneurshipamong youth. (For more information on this programme, refer to Box 9.) I N N OVAT I O N P O L I C Y The country has made promoting high-growth and innovative enter- prises a priority. Strategies have been defined for sectors such as ICTs, while programmes actively support R & D and innovation. Their design and implementation is increasingly based on wide-ranging consultation and public\u2013private partnerships like those involving universities and research centres (and in a few cases the local branches of multinational enterprises). Funding is provided by the state and falls short of meeting the set objectives. Interestingly, innovation promotion mechanisms in- clude fiscal incentives. Knowledge and technology transfer networks, industrial technical centres supported by the EU, innovation parks and centres,innovationawards,guaranteeschemestoeaseaccesstofinance, awareness-raising and matchmaking events are catering to the supply anddemandfortechnologicalservices.Inaddition,12enterpriseclusters have been set up since 1995. Also, six incubators networked throughout the country offer a range of services including financial assistance during thestart-upphase,accompanimentandsupportwithprotectinginnova- tions (especially in intellectual property rights). Start-ups have difficulty in exiting these incubators because of the lack of seed and risk capital and industrial land. At this stage the business incubator system is still in a pilot phase and good policy practices on service support, accreditation criteria, incubator size and orientation are slowly developing. The country has not yet put legal instruments for coordinating the vari- ous strategies, programmes and instruments in place. Establishing moni- toring programmes to gauge whether these tools are meeting targets and determining the level of their use particular by SMEs could be useful for the eventual scaling up of successful pilot projects. E U RO-M E D N E T WO R K S With the support of donors, in particular UNIDO, the European Com- mission and Italy, some limited experience has been gained in network- ing local or sector specific clusters, service providers and enterprises at Euro-Mediterranean level.There is considerable scope for increasing and strengthening such networks. The three-year Euro-Med \u2018Invest in MED\u2019 programme supported by the European Commission will help Morocco to do so, and the country can apply to participate, for example through the ANPME, in the\u2018Enterprise Europe network\u2019 (51) among other networks to develop the export and innovation potential of its enterprises. 5. Human capital Turning to the human capital dimensions of the Charter, the assess- ment considered developments on entrepreneurship education and training (Dimension 2) and the skills context of the enterprise sector (Dimension 3). Onentrepreneurshipeducationandtraining,theassessmentexamined existing education and training policies and how these contribute to a more entrepreneurial mind-set and behaviour, particularly of young ( 51 ) The\u2018Enterprise Europe Network\u2019was launched by the European Commission in early 2008. It is made up of close to 600 partner organisations in more than 40 countries, promoting competitiveness and innovation at the local level in Europe and beyond. ",
        "Page 115 people. Firstly, the education and training Charte nationale (a macro- policy framework for education, training and research) lays particular emphasisonpromotionoftheentrepreneurialmind-set.Italsoprovides for more developed entrepreneurship skills within the general and vo- cational education environment. Secondly, the Livre Blanc sets the cur- riculum framework for entrepreneurial learning (confined to vocational education, economic streams and certain areas of higher education). Taken together, these two documents provide a sound basis for Mo- rocco to move forward in developing a more comprehensive approach to entrepreneurship education involving all levels of the learning sys- tem. This will require that the range of interest groups (public, private, non-profit) consider how the existing policies could be adjusted and/or complemented to ensure a more lifelong entrepreneurial learning pol- icy perspective, including monitoring of an eventual work programme to see through the priorities. Turning to entrepreneurship promotion in secondary education (ISCED 2 and 3), the assessment found good efforts being made in developing entrepreneurship skills, including excellent examples of school\u2013enterprise cooperation through the \u2018one school, one enter- prise\u2019 initiative. Still missing in the curricula, however, is the promo- tion of entrepreneurship as a key competence, considered by the Charter as critical to developing the entrepreneurial characteristics and mind-set which would have potential spin-off later in life.The key competence agenda calls for reflection on how existing curricula and the teaching process allow young people to acquire entrepreneurial learning attitudes and traits (e.g. creativity, opportunity identification, riskassessment,resourcemanagementskills).Thiscouldbebuiltupon with more specific entrepreneurship skills (e.g. business planning, book-keeping, start-up training) later in the formal and non-formal education and training environments. The Charter lays considerable emphasis on good practice dissemina- tion in the bid to ensure that other education and training environ- ments benefit from the experience of tried-and-tested entrepreneurial learning promotion. The assessment finds that, while there are exam- ples of Moroccan good practice being shared and adapted by other entrepreneurial learning environments outside the country (e.g. the Moukawalati initiative), there is no regular and systematic exchange of experience and know-how within the country. Given the wealth of ini- tiatives on entrepreneurial learning, education and training providers would benefit from a systematic sharing and dissemination of activities in-country.This forms the crux of the\u2018good practice\u2019indicator. In terms of enterprise skills (Dimension 3), Morocco demonstrates a well-developed training market, including start-up training and serv- ices for expanding businesses, with web-based information allowing enterprises to easily research the training offer. However, Morocco\u2019s performance generally on Dimension 3 is compromised by a lack of systematic data on enterprise training which would allow for a better appreciation of national investment and priority-setting. To conclude, employers and national authorities could consider a regular survey of the enterprise environment which would establish a data set against which existing enterprise and training policies, including investment, could be measured and adjusted. 6. The way forward Morocco is making steady progress in building an effective enterprise policy framework. The results of the Charter assessment show that the countryisbuildingthebasisforsoundpolicy,workingonstrengthening institutions, building the legal and regulatory framework and learning from good practices.The country has adopted a participative approach to policy development, putting the emphasis on consultation and on reachingaconsensussharedbygovernmentinstitutionsandkeypolicy stakeholders, as indicated by the relatively high score achieved under Dimension 7. While a participative approach may slow down the pace of reform, it contributes to the quality of government policy. However, muchremainstodoinseveralCharterareas,particularlyrelatedtohuman capital development. In general terms, government strategy appears to be well-structured and balanced.The problems lie more with regard to resources available tosupportgovernmentactions,andmaximisingresourcestobuildsyn- ergies among the various programmes, particularly in the area of skills development and innovation. On the basis of the Charter assessment, the following priorities have been identified. \u2022 Regulatory reform and administrative simplification. Morocco should ramp up its efforts in this Charter area and plan to move from a strategy that puts the emphasis on public sector reform, to a systematic review and simplification of the legislative and regu- latory framework covering business activities. It should also start to build the groundwork to perform regulatory impact analyses on major new legislation and regulations affecting the business sector. \u2022 Accesstofinance. Moroccohasachievedgoodprogressinthisarea, particularly in microfinance and in the development of a diverse range of financial products for SMEs. However, access to finance, even for dynamic SMEs, is still constrained by low company capi- talisationandbythewidespreaduseofnon-transparentaccounting practices. In order to address these challenges it is necessary to op- erate both on the tax front, creating incentives for entrepreneurs to declare and to reinvest profits into their company, and on the train- ing and education of the entrepreneurs. \u2022 Innovation policy. Morocco should adopt a systematic and stra- tegic approach to review the scope of existing instruments and to create synergies among the different ad hoc programmes in opera- tion. For instance, the network of business incubators should be ex- tended throughout the country and should focus more on sector specialisation.There is scope to develop synergies by setting guide- lines for company graduation and to create joint partnerships with entrepreneurship development programmes and with universities/ higher education institutions. More emphasis should be placed on developing linkage programmes between Moroccan and foreign- owned companies, in order to extend the range of local suppliers, and increasing their technical and managerial skills. \u2022 Human capital. On Dimension 2, good policy efforts could be maximised by way of an overarching framework for lifelong entre- preneurial learning to ensure that each part of the learning system contributes to an ordered sequence of entrepreneurship promotion from primary education through to tertiary level. Secondly, the cur- riculum authorities could consider how the entrepreneurship key competence could be developed through primary and secondary education.Pilotschoolswithapolicymandatewouldaccommodate this recommendation. Thirdly, better value could be made of the ",

Country overview The Palestinian Authority was established in 1994, as a result of the Oslo Agreement.ThePalestinianAuthorityhasjurisdictionovertheWestBank andGazaterritories,occupiedbyIsraelsince1967.InrealitythePalestin- ian Authority\u2019s administrative powers are heavily curtailed. At the time of writing of this report, Israel controls most of the external borders of the West Bank and Gaza territories. Internal and external movement of people and goods are subject to systematic security controls and re- strictions. Some 60 % (52) of the West Bank is designated as Area C, upon which Israel has full security and most of the administrative control. In addition,Israelmaintains580securitycheckpoints (53) .TheGazaStriphas been increasingly isolated since 2007 and only humanitarian aid and a limited quantity of fuel and basic commodity supplies are allowed in. ThePalestinianAuthority\u2019straderegimeisbasedonacustomsenvelope with Israel, according to the Paris Protocol, which also assigns to Israel the task of collecting import duties and VAT on imported goods. Nearly all external trade is conducted with or through Israel. Goods shipments are channelled through five crossing points between theWest Bank and Israel and one crossing point between Israel and Gaza. The territories lack significant natural resources. The economy is heav- ily dependent on imports of basic inputs. Its exports have traditionally been fresh agricultural products for the Israeli market, cut flowers, tex- tiles, garments and other light industrial products produced through subcontractingarrangementswithIsraelicompanies.Stoneandmarble is the West Bank\u2019s biggest export product.The economic activity in the West Bank and in the densely populated Gaza Strip is therefore heavily dependent on access to the Israeli market and to Israeli port and trans- port facilities. Following the Oslo Agreement, improved market access conditions and relative political stability led to a phase of rapid expan- sion of the Palestinian economy, with an annual average growth rate in excess of 6 %. The starting of the second Intifada in 2000, coupled with increased security measures by Israel, signalled the beginning of a sharp economic recession (2000\u201302), followed by a weak recovery in theWest Bank and a general rise in unemployment, which at the end of 2007 was close to 23 %, up from 10 % in 2000. With a rapidly expand- ing labour supply, the employment outlook is very problematic. Fur- thermore, the economy in the Gaza Strip has continued to deteriorate, with a sharp contraction over the last year and the virtual stop of any manufacturing activity. The downturn has wrought significant changes to the economic struc- ture. Private sector activity has ceased to be the main force driving eco- nomic growth and job generation. There has been instead a significant expansionofpublicsectorexpendituresandpublicsectorjobs.ThePales- tinian Authority\u2019s budget is very heavily dependent on external aid, and since2006,governmentfunctionshavebeenseverelyconstrainedbythe lack of financial resources. Unless the economy is put again on a growth path and workable market access conditions are re-established, income per capita will continue to contract, and the dependence on external aid and remittances will further increase, leaving room only for low-level re- tail and service activities and subsistence agriculture. On the other hand, the economy has proved to be resilient to continued shocks and acute politicalinstability,thequalityoftheworkforceisgenerallygood,thePal- estinians are highly entrepreneurial, there is a good dialogue between the public and the private sectors, and the volume of committed donor support is considerable, ensuring the basis for a possible recovery. 2. Enterprise policy and public\u2013private consul- tation T H E I N S T I T U T I O N A L P O L I C Y F R A M E WO R K Under the current arrangements, the Palestinian Authority has direct competence over most of the enterprise policy areas, from business regulations to access to finance, education and training. However, it has no control de facto over the external trade policy and little juris- diction over the establishment of industrial and trade zones, as Israel retains the final decision powers over large real estate projects.There- fore the Palestinian Authority has powers to enact policy measures that may improve the business environment, but, alone, it has no lev- erage over the removal of the most important barriers to economic development, notably pertaining to trade and territorial manage- ment. Progress in those areas is directly linked to the implementation of the peace process. International donors play a determinant role in shaping the policy towards the private sector, through budgetary contributions to the Palestinian Authority and through direct project implementation for the benefit of the Palestinian Authority, or often conducted in partnership with local NGOs and civil society partners, without direct intervention by the Palestinian Authority. Government action over the last two years has been significantly im- paired by the lack of funds and by political instability. There is no for- malised government strategy for promoting enterprise development. Policymaking is conducted on an ad hoc basis. There are a number of documentselaboratedbyinternationalinstitutions,theEuropeanCom- mission and bilateral donors. Private sector organisations and NGOs, with donor support, have organised workshops aimed at formulating strategies for specific sectors, but the efforts have so far lacked continu- ity, and in most cases resulted in lengthy reports, whose recommenda- tions have not been implemented. The Ministry of National Economy is responsible for most of the enter- prise policy areas and supervises the activity of the Palestinian Invest- mentPromotionAgency,thegovernmentexecutiveagencyinchargeof FDIanddomesticinvestmentpromotionandsupport,aswellasofother specialised bodies such as the Standards and Metrology Institute. Theactualimplementationprocesscanbeidentifiedasoneoftheleastde- veloped areas within enterprise policymaking.There is no clear structure in place for monitoring implementation (e.g. implementation deadlines, monitoring of goals and progress in implementation, etc.). Legislation is passed without clear indication of when and how it will be implemented. Private sector representatives have observed a particular stalling of the implementation process since the legislative elections of January 2006. ( 52 ) At the beginning of 2008.

        "Page 118 P U B L I C\u2013P R I V AT E CO N S U LTAT I O N An essential element for effective policymaking is the establishment of a close dialogue on the cooperation between the Palestinian Authority institutions, the private sector, civil society and the donor community, through all the phases of policy elaboration and implementation. Pri- vate sector organisations such as the Federation of Chambers of Com- merce, the Palestinian Businessmen Association, the Palestinian Trade Centre (Paltrade) and the Palestinian Federation of Industries play a considerableroleinshapingandimplementingenterprisepolicymeas- ures. Coordination between these institutions and the government has improved significantly since the establishment of a private sector coor- dinating body, the Private Sector Coordinating Council.Yet overlapping and inconsistencies persist. Public\u2013private dialogue has traditionally been open and sound. Sev- eral frameworks for public\u2013private consultations have been operating since the establishment of the Palestinian Authority, most notably the National Economic Dialogue Committee. More than five high-profile meetings are convened each year, usually involving the Prime Minister, Ministers for Economy and Finance, and other senior officials. Partici- pants from the private sector and civil society organisations are invited and they are usually heavily represented. The agenda of the consulta- tivemeetingsiscirculatedinadvanceandtheprivatesectorisgiventhe opportunity to provide inputs on the agenda and to call for meetings. The minutes of the meetings are often published in the form of bro- chures, and main conclusions and recommendations are well covered in local media. Open invitations are also advertised in local papers. C L E A R A N D TA R G E T E D I N F O R M AT I O N The public sector has no clear and systematic programmes to collect, handle, analyse and disseminate economic, legislative and regulative information relevant to enterprises. Some private sector associations (e.g. chambers of commerce and specialised sectoral industrial federa- tions) do perform some of these services sporadically. Some specific in- formationforbusinessescanbefoundonline,butondifferentwebsites. The amount of information available is usually limited, and there is little possibility for interaction. 3. Operational environment A D M I N I S T R AT I V E S I M P L I F I C AT I O N Since its establishment, the Palestinian Authority has created a com- plex legal situation. One of the first acts was to declare Israeli military orders that have regulated economic activity in the territories since 1967 inapplicable. In order to avoid a legal vacuum the Palestinian Au- thority decided to revert to the pre-1967 legal framework. However, the West Bank and the Gaza Strip had very different pre-1967 legal systems and diverse legal traditions, creating a web of legal problems for private enterprises and requiring an extensive action of legal and regulatory harmonisation and modernisation. Progress in this area has been patchy, in spite of considerable donor assistance. For instance, there are still two different company laws applicable in the West Bank and in the Gaza Strip, which sometimes causes serious problems for stakeholders. Work on a new company law as well as on a new com- mercial code has been going on for several years, with donor support. There has been a renewed effort towards simplification and harmoni- sationofcurrentbusinesslegislationrecently,whenanexpertcommit- teewascommissionedbytheMinisterforEconomytoformulateanew company law to be enacted in 2008. There are no plans to review cur- rent legislation or eliminate redundant legislation related to enterprise policy and there is no systematic cost-benefit analysis targeted at draft enterprise policy. CO M PA NY R E G I S T R AT I O N The Palestinian Authority has relatively cumbersome and lengthy proc- esses for starting up a company, in particular when it is administered in local offices. According to private sector organisations, it requires an average of two to three weeks to be completed. The delays and costs are due to the assembly of the documentation for registration and to obtaining permits and licences. The company registration itself, with the Ministry of National Economy, is relatively fast. Registration fees are quite low, but in addition there is a capital fee amounting to 0.1 % of the registered capital.There is only one company identification number allotted for each firm. Online registration facilities are not available. ACC E S S TO F I N A N C E Access to finance for small businesses remains very problematic. On one side, the legal and regulatory framework is incomplete. Laws on bankruptcy are outdated and undermined by the weak judicial system and law enforcement institutions. A cadastre system is in place, but constrained by the fact that only 30 % of land is registered in the ca- dastre,andtherestisrecordedthroughtheMinistryofFinanceregistra- tion (i.e. by virtue of taxation registers). This is viewed as a valid form of land title yet it is not of the same legal standing as land registered in the cadastre. Furthermore, nearly 60 % of land area is under Israel\u2019s jurisdiction, which entails very severe restrictions in its use for collateral purposes. On the other side, given the volatile political and economic situation, banks are taking a risk-averse approach, providing essentially short-term credit facilities and asking for high collateral requirements, exceeding on average 200 % of the market value. Given the political and economic context, the banking sector is quite well structured with 22 banks in operation and the Palestinian Mon- etary Authority increasing banking supervision functions. In addition, it is building a database of firms according to credit-worthiness. A Loan Guarantee Facility was established in July 2007, through a joint arrangement involving the Aspen Institute, the Cooperative Housing Foundation and the Palestinian Investment Fund. The European Pal- estinian Guarantee Facility supported by the European Commission is alsoavailableandprovidesguaranteesforoverEUR8million.Twolocal banks have already signed on, and several others are still negotiating terms of collaboration. Microfinance facilities are available through several microfinance programmes. These are sponsored by interna- tional donors and managed by local NGOs or non-profit companies (54) , with products targeted for specific groups, such as young and women entrepreneurs.

Moreover, plans are being developed by central government to improve its taxpayer service. ACC E S S TO M A R K E TS Israel is by far the most important trading partner for the Palestinian Authority, accounting for around 90 % of exports and 70 % of imports. Diversifying trading partners is impeded by the restrictions imposed by Israel on the mobility of goods and persons. However, there is a fairly strong and active export promotion institution, called the Palestinian Trade Centre (Paltrade), but because of numerous obstacles this institu- tion conducts trade initiatives (such as trade missions and trade fairs) largely on an ad hoc basis. AC A As To be ready for the signature of an ACAA with the EU, the partner country should have adequate infrastructure in the fields of standardisation, ac- creditation, conformity assessment, metrology and market surveillance, and should have adopted the relevant parts of the acquis .The Palestinian Authority has not yet started the upgrading of the infrastructure and the horizontallegislationhasnotyetbeenharmonisedwiththeEU acquis .The alignment of the legislation in the priority sectors chosen by the Palestin- ian Authority (construction products, stone and marble, and pharmaceu- ticals) has not started.The adoption of European standards in the priority sectors and the withdrawal of national conflicting ones have not started. 4. Services for enterprises B U S I N E S S S U P P O R T S E RV I C E S Structured business services are available mostly through collaborative public and private sector institutions. Funding for such service schemes is channelled through international donor institutions. In addition to services provided by chambers of commerce and other private sector institutions listed in Section 1, important business service providers in- clude Development Alternatives International (which is a USAID-assist- ed company that provides capacity-building services in firms) and the German GTZ private sector development programme.The EU supports a number of business inception programmes targeting women entre- preneurs. There is no database of business service providers available to enterprises (neither by public nor by private sources). I N N OVAT I O N P O L I C Y The Palestinian Authority\u2019s innovation policy is still very much in its in- fancy.Noinnovationstrategyexists,legislationisprepared(forinstance on intellectual property rights) but not enforced. However, some con- crete actions have been taken to promote cooperation on innovation among enterprises and research centres in local universities, funded by international donor institutions. Prominent examples of such innova- tion centres include the South Korea Centre of IT and An-Najah Univer- sity and the Food and Drugs Testing Laboratory \u2014 Birzeit University. A number of business incubator initiatives have been launched during the past decade, mostly on a pilot basis. Such initiatives are funded by donor institutions, they are often managed jointly with local business organisations and their purpose is more oriented towards employment generationthansupportinginnovativeenterprises.Thebest-knownex- ample of an incubator focusing on innovation is the Palestine Informa- tion and CommunicationTechnology Incubator (PICTI). E U R O-M E D N E T WO R K S A number of Euro-Mediterranean networks have developed between enterprises, business support services and business clusters but their scope is limited and they receive technical and financial assistance that is limited in time. 5. Human capital This section provides an assessment of the human capital dimensions of the Charter: entrepreneurship education and training (Dimension 2) and enterprise skills (Dimension 3). The assessment is set against a highly unstable and unpredictable political environment that particu- larlyunderminesthebusinesscommunityandthewidereducationand training environment. This is reflected in the overall results of the as- sessment. Firstly, entrepreneurial education and training does not feature in na- tional education policy although there are clear efforts to promote en- trepreneurship, particularly through vocational education and training projects. The Charter particularly encourages the sequencing of entre- preneurship promotion from early education through to university-lev- el education, including training and management development, which is generally undertaken outside the formal education system. It is this factor which lies behind the Charter policy indicator: the development of a lifelong entrepreneurial learning strategy backed up with an ac- tion programme and resources to see it through.The assessment found no evidence of a discussion amongst the range of stakeholders to de- termine how the various parts of the learning system could contribute to a more developed entrepreneurship culture. Clearly, the Palestinian Authority\u2019seconomicandpoliticalcontextandconsequentgovernance arrangements remain a constraint to any effort for a concerted and in- tegrated entrepreneurial learning strategy and delivery environment. Assuming that the range of government and private sector stakehold- ers from the Palestinian Authority considered an all-encompassing en- trepreneurship education and training strategy were possible, progress could be achieved by way of an open dialogue on options and issues for more strategic entrepreneurship promotion. Donor finance and technical assistance could be considered for strategy building, while selected actions at the various levels of the learning system could be piloted. That said, pilot actions should be particularly linked to policy and backed up by commitment from the national authorities to ensure that successful piloting is translated into more systemic reforms within the learning environment. Strategic piloting could be integrated within the Palestine education initiative, given efforts here to introduce more ",
        "Page 120 student-centredlearningwhichiscentraltoentrepreneurshipkeycom- petencedevelopmentsandwhichremainstobeaddressedwithincom- pulsory education. Secondly, on skills for enterprises, although the Palestinian Authority has a well-established network of training providers (public and private sector), backed up with both national and donor finance, until data are developed particularly on enterprise training, including statistics on training for start-ups and businesses in the expansion phase, there will be no progress on these indicators. Consequently, the Palestinian en- terprise community and national authorities, supported by an able re- search organisation, could consider the establishment of a regular sur- vey of enterprise HRD activity to systematically determine the extent of enterprise engagement of training services, including the identification of training needs. Regular, reliable data on enterprise human resources will additionally allow for an evaluation of the training investment as well as ensuring a better targeting of public resources against more clearly defined demand. Finally, despite significant trade restrictions impacting on demand for export-relatedtraining,therearegoodexamplesoftrainingforexternal trade promotion in select sectors provided by the Investment Promo- tion Agency (PIPA) and bilateral donors. 6. The way forward The results of the Charter assessment show that the Palestinian Author- ity\u2019s enterprise policy is heavily constrained by curtailed administrative powers, security restrictions applied by Israel, lack of budgetary re- sources and persistent political instability. In spite of these constraints, policy performance is solid in public\u2013 private consultation involving strong business associations. This good level of public\u2013private partnership should be preserved and further strengthened, as it is the cornerstone on which to build an effective pri- vate sector development policy. Performance is much weaker in all the other Charter areas. The issues facing the Palestinian Authority are multiple and all equally pressing. However, the Charter assessment provides some initial ele- ments for a first list of policy priorities. \u2022 Enterprise policy framework. In a context where companies have to deal daily with a highly unstable and challenging operational en- vironment, it is important that government action support enter- prises and does not further generate uncertainties and instability. It is therefore necessary that the Palestinian Authority make an effort to pursue continuity and clarity in the policy areas under its compe- tence, such as taxation and provision of services.The Palestinian Au- thority must make efforts to ensure the application of its own laws and regulations across the whole territory to avoid discriminatory practices. \u2022 Access to finance. It is important that the government activate, in collaboration with donors and international organisations, all finance channels, such as: credit guarantee schemes, equity funds specialised in SMEs, microfinance facilities based on cash-flow lend- ing, and access to finance for private enterprises. The country must overcometheconstraintsfacedbylocalbanks,duetothedifficulties in securing real estate or other forms of collaterals. Several projects have been launched in this area with the support of the donor com- munity. Now it is time for the government to focus on implementa- tion, removing all possible regulatory and legislative obstacles. \u2022 Business supporting schemes. The first priority should be to progress in project implementation, as there are already several donor-funded initiatives targeting this Charter area; donors should create the conditions for the medium- to long-term sustainability of the funded schemes. Particularly important are programmes sup- porting new companies in the establishment phase, such as busi- ness incubators, industrial zones and business parks.These types of projects could act as catalysts for supporting policy elaboration and action in areas including support to innovative SMEs and skills de- velopment. ",
        "Page 121 \u2022 Human capital. While appreciating the Palestinian Authority\u2019s dif- ficulties of governance arrangements, government departments, with the private sector and the more able non-governmental or- ganisations, should consider a more integrated plan for develop- ment of entrepreneurial learning across the school and university system, interfacing with the already good developments which lie outside the formal education environment.This effort could include an identification of priorities for support from both national and in- ternational finance, which could include entrepreneurship key com- petence promotion in primary and secondary schooling. Secondly, more systematic data on enterprise training, including training re- quirements, need to be established to include gender-disaggregat- ed data for start-up training.This would help with policymaking and resource allocation. Assuming trading resumes between the Pales- tinian Authority and the region, particular efforts could be made in supporting businesses with training for external trade promotion. 5.0 4.0 3.0 2.0 1.0 0.0 1 S i m p l e P r o c e d u r e s 2 E n t r e p r e n e u r s h i p 3 I m p r o v e d S k i l l s 4 A c c e s s t o F i n a n c e 5 M a r k e t A c c e s s 6 I n n o v a t i v e F i r m s 7 B u s i n e s s A s s o c i a t i o n s 8 B u s i n e s s S e r v i c e s 9 E u r o - M e d N e t w o r k s 1 0 C l e a r I n f o r m a t i o n Figure 29: Palestinian Authority: Overall scores per Charter dimension ",

Country overview Syriahasamixedeconomicsystembasedonafast-growingprivatesec- tor that dominates the service, trade and light manufacturing sectors; and a diminishing but still significant state sector, made of a number of state-owned and often underperforming companies.This state-owned and mostly unreformed corporate sector consists mainly of cement, metals,chemicals,textilesandagro-businessenterprisesthatwerebuilt mostly in the late 1960s, 1970s and early 1980s. Syria became a medium-sized oil producer in the 1990s, but is gradu- ally losing this position. Until 2003 oil revenues accounted for over 14 % of GDP and nearly 50 % of total government revenues. Crude oil exports over recent years have been steadily declining, as a result of the depletion of oil fields while imports of oil products have been rising due to fast-growing domestic demand. As a result, the country became a net importer of oil as of 2007. Oil revenues still provide the bulk of the country\u2019s exchange earning, complemented by non-oil exports, tourism earnings and remittances from expatriated Syrian workers. After a decade of weak growth, economic expansion has soared since 2004,reaching6%in2007.Expansionhasbeensupportedbyhigheroil prices, private sector expansion and growth in non-oil exports to other Arab countries, favoured by the entry in force of the Greater Arab Free Trade Area. The influx since 2003 of an estimated 1.5 million Iraqi refu- gees contributed to the growth of domestic demand, but also strained the provision of public services. The government is well aware that over the medium term it has to promote a broad diversification of the economy, expand its fiscal base (through the introduction of a VAT system) and restructure the state- owned industrial sector in order to secure long-term growth and generate jobs for its young and rapidly growing population. The 10th five-year development plan, approved in 2006, has set the agenda for a comprehensive programme of economic reforms and the expan- sion of key priority sectors such as industry and tourism. However, the economy is still subject to a wide range of administrative controls and characterised by a low level of domestic and external competition. Pro- gressive economic liberalisation should therefore be a key component of the economic reform programme. 2. Enterprise policy and public\u2013private consultation T H E I N S T I T U T I O N A L P O L I C Y F R A M E WO R K Syria has traditionally adopted an interventionist approach to the economy, pursuing an active vertical industrial policy and assigning to government institutions and state-owned companies the role of steering economic development. However, in recent years Syria has started to progressively open its economy to private investment and to develop elements of a horizontal policy, aimed at lifting some of the constraints imposed on private companies and improving the opera- tional environment. In Syria, there is not yet in place a fully-fledged enterprise policy. Responsibilities for broad private sector development issues are spread across a number of ministries. Effective coordination is thus difficult and no formal interministerial coordination mechanisms are in place to deal with specific private sector development issues. However, the Deputy Prime Minister acts as coordinator of the over- all programme of economic reforms. The Ministry of Economy and Trade has made a proposal to establish and chair a national commit- tee for SMEs composed of representatives of the relevant ministries (the adoption of this proposal is pending approval from the Prime Minister\u2019s office). The Syrian Enterprise Business Centre (SEBC), a non-governmental organisation, is assisting in the formulation of an enterprise policy, and has recently produced a draft SME policy strategy. The SEBC emerged from the EU-funded Syrian European Business Centre. Although no explicit enterprise development strategy exists in Syria, the five-year plan, which structures industrial policy from 2006 to 2010, sets the policy guidelines towards the private sector and provides an agenda of economic reform. The targets are time-bound and imple- mentation has started. P U B L I C\u2013P R I V AT E CO N S U LTAT I O N F R A M E WO R K Public\u2013private consultations in Syria mostly take place during the draft- ing phase of major legislative reforms.This exchange is particularly de- veloped between senior policymakers and the federations of chambers of commerce and chambers of industry. Both chambers, for instance, wereconsultedinthepreparationofthefive-yearplanandareinvolved inmonitoringitsimplementation.Additionally,theprivatesectorisrep- resented in several government committees. Nevertheless, no formal transparencyrequirementsexistinSyriathatassurefullopennessofthe consultation process. Small companies in particular have voiced con- cernsaboutthegovernmentandfederations\u2019preferentialdialoguewith the largest companies. In this respect the SEBC is taking an increasing advocacy role on behalf of SMEs. A law for professional associations is under preparation. Although the network of chambers of commerce and industry is well established and spread throughout the country, other types of private sector representation and/or professional associations are rare. Hardly any sectoral or industry-specific representations exist and the same is true for foreign chambers. A new law is currently being introduced to encourage the establishment of private sector associations. C L E A R A N D TA R G E T E D I N F O R M AT I O N The following institutions analyse and disseminate the bulk of the in- formation available for enterprises in Syria: the Central Bureau for Sta- tistics, relevant ministries and the chambers of commerce and industry. The information is not systematically collected, handled and analysed and there are inconsistencies among the data produced by different institutions and throughout the country. The ministries and chambers have placed some of the information online, but it is often outdated and incomplete. ",
        "Page 123 3. Operational environment A D M I N I S T R AT I V E S I M P L I F I C AT I O N Regulatory simplification is starting to grow in importance on Syria\u2019s policy map. Although there is no explicit regulatory simplification strat- egy yet and only sporadic efforts have been undertaken by the Ministry of Economy and Trade to simplify regulations that affect enterprises (e.g.simplificationofcustomstariffs),thecurrentfive-yearplancontains a chapter devoted to the revision of business regulations. Furthermore, the Ministry of Local Administration is currently drafting a new law on the streamlining of procedures in local administrations and the govern- menthasreceivedaEUR5milliongrantfromtheEuropeanCommission to simplify business regulation. No plans, however, exist to introduce cost-benefit analyses to new enterprise legislation and regulation. CO M PA NY R E G I S T R AT I O N Starting up a company in Syria is still expensive, cumbersome and time consuming.Various fees need to be paid such as a stamp fee (0.05 % of company\u2019s capital) or a fee for the tribunal court (approximately EUR 14). Several different ministries handle the registration and licensing process, which slows down the process significantly, and five different registration and identification numbers need to be obtained at five dif- ferent authorities. Facilitation services exist only for companies operat- ing in government-sponsored industrial zones and online registration facilities are not available. TheMinistryofIndustryhasjustdevelopedadraftlawonindustry,aim- ing at giving local administrations the mandate to deliver licences in 24 hours. ACC E S S TO F I N A N C E Access to finance remains one of the key problems for enterprises oper- atinginSyriaandparticularlyforSMEs.ThegovernmentandtheCentral Bank have started a process of progressive liberalisation and upgrading of the banking and financial sector, but the legal and regulatory envi- ronment remains relatively underdeveloped and the range of banking and financial services for the enterprise sector is still limited. There are no credit information services and the Central Bank is in the process of establishing a credit monitoring system for big borrowers. Syria has a relatively well-functioning cadastre in place and property titles are documented at the General Directorate of Real Estate. Legisla- tion on bankruptcy and distressed companies is in place and the gov- ernment is acting to bring it to international standards. However, there is no registry in place for movable assets. Since the abolition of the state monopoly in banking activities in 2001 (when the banking sector was opened up to private and foreign in- vestors), Syria has a mixed banking system, consisting of a number of state-ownedspecialisedbanks,andanumberofprivatebanks,partially owned by banking groups from Arab countries. A credit guarantee scheme is currently under preparation with assist- ance from KfW (a German development bank) and the support of the Ministry of Finance, the Central Bank of Syria and private and public banks. Few microfinance facilities exist and most of these operate as pi- lot projects. There is no legislation covering equity funds; indeed there are no equity funds operating in the country. The government has re- cently licensed a number of holding companies, in order to mobilise equity funds from private entrepreneurs. I N V E S T M E N T-F R I E N D L Y TAXAT I O N A number of changes to the Syrian tax system have been introduced in recent years, with reform efforts getting under way in 2003. The re- sults have been a simpler and more transparent tax system and a more modern tax administration. However, further reforms are needed, tax evasion is still a problem and the current budget still relies heavily on oil revenues.The government is currently analysing the introduction of value-added taxation. ACC E S S TO M A R K E TS The National Commission for Developing and Promoting Exports, es- tablished in 2005 and affiliated to the Ministry of Economy and Trade, is in charge of implementing export promotion programmes. A broad export promotion strategy is currently being elaborated by a high-level committee, headed by the Deputy Prime Minister. Syria is a signatory of the GAFTA and has also signed a free trade agreement with Tur- key. A project to computerise customs procedures has recently been launched by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and the United Nations Conference onTrade and Development (Unctad). AC A As TobereadyforthesignatureofanACAAwiththeEU,thepartnercountry should have adequate infrastructure in the fields of standardisation, ac- creditation,conformityassessment,metrologyandmarketsurveillance, and should have adopted the relevant parts of the acquis . In Syria the upgrading of the infrastructure has started but the horizontal legisla- tion has not been harmonised with the EU acquis .The alignment of the legislation in the priority sector chosen by Syria (electrical appliances) has started. The adoption of European standards in the priority sectors and the withdrawal of national conflicting ones are under progress. 4. Services for enterprises B U S I N E S S S U P P O R T S E RV I C E S There is a mix of publicly funded and private business service provid- ers in Syria. Examples of publicly funded services include the Syrian Investment Agency and the General Establishment of Free Zones. Ex- amples of private business services include the chambers of commerce and industry and the SEBC. The chambers of commerce and industry provide a set of services to their members (such as regular publications andbulletins,exportopportunitiesandtrainingcourses).Afragmented database of these business services is made available by the chambers and the SEBC. Several schemes provide financial and technical support as pilot projects for young enterprises such as the SyriaTrust for Development. ",
        "Page 124 There are also six industrial zones spread throughout Syria, which focus on the provision of basic establishment services. I N N OVAT I O N P O L I C Y Policies to foster innovation in enterprises are in their infancy in Syria, particularly at national level. The Higher Commission for Scientific Re- search is elaborating a framework for innovation policy along the fol- lowing four pillars: elaborating a comprehensive national policy for scientific research and technological development, providing full co- ordination among the scientific research bodies, supporting scientific research organisations to achieve their goals, and strengthening the mechanisms linking scientific research organisations with public and private production and service sectors. There are several operational incubators in Syria, for instance the pilot project run by the Syrian Computer Society establishing an information technology incubator in Damascus. A technology park is being planned by the Syrian Ministry of Telecommunications and Technology and will be located in Dimas, close to Damascus. An e-village will specialise in ICT and will include an incubator. E U R O-M E D N E T WO R K S Through the EU-funded SME support programme, the SEBC works to- wards establishing some business-to-business contacts, notably by or- ganising annual Syrian-European contact days. In addition, the country is establishing a connection to the \u2018Enterprise Europe network\u2019. These developments can be seen as first steps in the development of Euro- Mediterranean networks. 5. Human capital This section provides an appraisal of Syria\u2019s performance on the human capital dimensions of the Charter. Briefly, with increasing understand- ing that quality manpower is key to more competitive enterprises, the Charter puts considerable emphasis on human capital along two policy lines: entrepreneurship education and training (Dimension 2) and im- proved skills for businesses (Dimension 3). Firstly, the assessment focused on the policy context for entrepreneur- ship education and training, including efforts being made to promote entrepreneurship particularly through secondary level schooling. On policy, while the five-year plan does well in underlining the importance of the schooling system in promoting key competences (e.g. sciences, languages), entrepreneurship as a key competence remains to be in- troduced into the teaching and learning process. While there are some excellent examples of entrepreneurship promotion, particularly involv- ing enterprises (e.g. the Shabab programme) these efforts lie outside the general curriculum and are limited to a select group of schools. The Charterindicatorsunderlinetheimportanceofentrepreneurshipeduca- tion being mainstreamed through compulsory education, such that all youngsters have access to courses and other activities that will cultivate themind-setandskillsofamoreentrepreneurialculture.Thiswillrequire athoroughreflectiononthepolicyoptionsbyallstakeholders,including a clear identification of implications for curriculum adjustment, teacher training and school management. The assessment already identified a commitment by the education authorities, State Planning Commission and employers to strategically reflect on how lifelong entrepreneurship educationandtrainingcouldbemoresystematicallydevelopedtomeet the Charter objectives. This is a good start. Assuming this interest is fol- lowed up with the elaboration of an entrepreneurial learning strategy which addresses all levels of the education system, it should translate into improved performance particularly on the Dimension 2 policy indi- cator. Further, given that the policy indicator additionally acts as a driver for the remaining Dimension 2 indicators, strategy building will be an importantpre-conditionforprogressonentrepreneurshippromotionin both lower and secondary education, as well as non-formal entrepre- neurial learning, prompting progress on these respective areas. Secondly, regarding skills for enterprises, the most significant finding from the assessment is that, despite a considerable training effort, there is little in the way of data on enterprise training demand or take-up of the training offer. More particularly, there is no systematic tracking of training investment in start-up or follow-up training by new ventures which could be instrumental in promoting business survival rates. Nor aretheredataavailableontraininginvestmentinexpandingbusinesses. This suggests that both economic and, more specifically, enterprise pol- icy does not adequately recognise the potential of human resource de- velopment as a factor in promoting competitiveness. To move forward on this area of the Charter, Syrian enterprise associations and govern- ment, acting in partnership, should consider establishing a systematic business survey to determine skill gaps and skill weaknesses as well as identifying evolving skill requirements, against which both private and publicly supported training programmes could respond. A facilitator organisation such as the SEBC could support government in develop- ing this intelligence. Such a development would make for a better fit between the training offer and demand, while promoting more efficient use of scarce public resources in enterprise training. Any effort to de- velop more systematic data on enterprise training should ensure that gender-specific statistics are included. Mawred, the women\u2019s economic empowerment NGO, could support this process. 6. The way forward Syria is still in the process of making a strategic choice between the tradi- tionalindustrialpolicy(basedoninterventionbysectorsandontheprom- inent role of state-owned companies and state-controlled institutions) and a horizontal enterprise policy. The two policy approaches coexist in a difficult compromise: policy is not yet fully structured, interventions are mostly ad hoc and institutional tasks are not clearly assigned. These dif- ficulties are reflected in the relatively low scores recorded by the country across all the 10 dimensions of the Charter. However, there are signs that a policy debate is under way and the government is open to experiment with new solutions and new forms of dialogue with the private sector, as indicated by the relatively more positive score in Dimension 7, related to public\u2013private dialogue and the role of private sector associations. Inthiscontextthegovernmentshouldconcentrateonalimitednumber of priorities, aiming in a first phase on building the necessary capacity, elaborating and managing policy reforms and sending clear signals to the private sector about the direction of the reform process. \u2022 Enterprise policy framework. The first priority is to clarify respon- sibility for the elaboration and coordination of enterprise policy. It is important that competences between line ministries are clarified and implementation monitoring mechanisms are introduced in ad- dition to the quantitative measurements set under the five-year de- velopment plan.This is necessary in order to avoid overlapping and inconsistencies between vertical and horizontal policies. However, ",
        "Page 125 in the initial phase of reforms it is important that the supervision and coordination of the reform agenda is retained by a higher cabi- net authority in order to address resistance from vested interests. \u2022 Company registration. This is an area where reforms are needed and can be achieved in a relatively short period of time, as demon- strated by other countries in the MED region (Egypt and Lebanon), provided that there is good interministerial coordination. Concrete results in this area will build confidence and establish government credibility as a determined reformer. \u2022 Access to finance. Government action in this area should tackle boththeupgradingoftheregulatoryandlegislativeframework,and the opening and restructuring of the banking sector. A good start- ing point would be the establishment of a credit guarantee scheme builtasapartnershipbetweenthepublicandtheprivatesector,tak- ing as reference, for instance, the experience of Jordan. \u2022 Public\u2013private sector dialogue. It is important that the govern- ment open the dialogue with a wide range of private sector rep- resentatives, often representing the most dynamic section of the private enterprise population. For this purpose, approval of the pro- posed law on professional associations could send a positive signal to private enterprises. At the same time, the government should consider conducting consultations on key policy issues, not only on specific measures, using as a base, for instance, the document on SME strategy elaborated by the SEBC. \u2022 Human capital. The Charter assessment identified a clear commit- ment by the national authorities to drawing up a lifelong entrepre- neurial learning strategy. Full engagement by employers into this endeavourwillbecritical.Thestrategybuildingshouldbeaccompa- nied by the development of an action plan where entrepreneurship key competence development is a priority. Secondly, a more devel- opedintelligencesystemforenterprisetrainingwillbeanimportant institutional development for the country. This could be led by a national agency or government department. Alternatively, a private or non-governmental organisation that already provides enterprise support services (e.g. the SEBC) could meet the data development demands. All data developments should be gender-sensitive. 5.0 4.0 3.0 2.0 1.0 0.0 1 S i m p l e P r o c e d u r e s 2 E n t r e p r e n e u r s h i p 3 I m p r o v e d S k i l l s 4 A c c e s s t o F i n a n c e 5 M a r k e t A c c e s s 6 I n n o v a t i v e F i r m s 7 B u s i n e s s A s s o c i a t i o n s 8 B u s i n e s s S e r v i c e s 9 E u r o - M e d N e t w o r k s 1 0 C l e a r I n f o r m a t i o n Figure 30: Syria: Overall scores per Charter dimension ",
        "Page 126 Tunisia 1. Country overview Over the last 10 years, Tunisia has achieved economic integration with the EU and with its main MED partners: a key element of its develop- ment strategy. Economic relations with the EU have been expanding rapidly after the signing of the association agreement in 1995, which granted free access to the EU market forTunisian industrial exports and improved access for exports of agricultural products. Today the EU is Tunisia\u2019s largest economic partner, accounting for three quarters of for- eign trade flows and the source of two thirds of the total FDI inflow. SinceJanuary2008,economicrelationswiththeEUhaveenteredanew phase with the arrival of the EU\u2013Tunisia free trade agreement, the first such agreement to have been implemented with a MED country. The agreement lifts all restrictions on imports of industrial products from the EU. At regional level, Tunisia has been an active promoter of the Agadir FTA, involving Morocco, Egypt and Jordan. In 2004 it signed an FTAwithTurkey.Ithasalsodevelopedcloseeconomicrelationswiththe United Arab Emirates. This strategy of international economic integration, supported by a range of policy measures among which the most important has been the establishment of an offshore regime for export-oriented and for- eign-owned companies, has largely paid off. Economic growth over the last five years has been strong, showing an upwards trend, in spite of the fluctuations caused by changes in yearly agricultural output. Over the period 2001\u201306, Tunisian GDP grew by 4.63 % on average, while exports have grown over the last five years at an average annual rate of nearly 10 %. The FDI stock as a percentage of GDP has doubled over the last 10 years and the ratio FDI to GDP, at over 70 %, is the high- est in the MED region and is set to increase considerably given the large volume of commitments in the real estate sector made recently by in- vestors from the Gulf. However, in spite of these remarkable results, the Tunisian economy faces a number of critical challenges. Unemployment remains high, at around 14 % in 2007. Youth unemployment, particularly among the fast-growing number of young graduates, is around 40 %. At the same time, companies are signalling a shortage of specialised skills. Exports and investment have been the main drivers of economic growth. However, exports are highly dependent on the performance of the textiles and garment sector that is highly exposed to competition from low-cost Far Eastern producers. With total revenues of over EUR 3 billion per year, this sector accounts for about 50 % of total exports and over250000jobs.Ontheinvestmentside,overthenextfewyearsmany of the incentives granted under the offshore regime will have to be re- viewed, as they are not compatible with WTO rules. The government will therefore be required to modify its approach to private investment promotion,decreasingitsrelianceonfiscalincentivesandplacingmore emphasis on improvement of the business climate. The government intends to respond to these challenges by diversify- ing the economy into new sectors such as chemicals, bio-chemicals, engineering and electrical industries, and by promoting, in the textiles sector, a move from subcontracting to joint-contracting and to public tender. A major source of new jobs is expected to come from a further expansionoftheservicesector,whichalreadyaccountsforaround70% of GDP, and in particular from tourism, ICT and business process out- sourcing services. 2. Enterprise policy and public\u2013private consultation T H E I N S T I T U T I O N A L P O L I C Y F R A M E WO R K Over the years Tunisia has developed an active and well-articulated policy of promotion and of support to private enterprise.The approach is at the same time pragmatic and dirigiste, with an emphasis on direct service provision for targeted sectors and types of enterprises. The sys- temofpolicymakingandpublic\u2013privatedialogueisrelativelycentralised, although efforts are made to implement programmes across the whole country. The High Commission for Investment and Export, chaired by the Head of State, is in charge of overall policy coordination and the definition of strategic targets. A number of interministerial committees ensure coor- dination in relation to specific policy areas. TheMinistryofIndustry,EnergyandSMEsisresponsiblefortheelabora- tion and coordination of enterprise policy.The policy guidelines are set by the Directorate-General for Industrial Strategy and by the Directo- rate-General for SME Promotion, the latter set up as part of a new na- tional priority to support the creation and development of SMEs. Policy implementation is assigned to a number of well-staffed and resourced executive agencies, each one with a clearly defined mission operating under the direct supervision of the ministry. In particular, the Industrial Promotion Agency (API) plays a central role as a support structure for enterprises and entrepreneurs, being in charge of the implementation of the main industrial modernisation programmes. Further specialised executive agencies are in charge of various facets of enterprise development (e.g. development of indus- trial zones, FDI promotion, and investment in the agriculture and agro- business sectors). Medium-term economic objectives and policy priorities are set by the 11th five-year economic development plan, covering the period 2007\u2013 11. The presidential programme of 2005\u201309 also places enterprise creation among the country\u2019s national priorities. Both documents com- bine the activities and instruments of the various institutions in order to meet objectives for enterprise support and creation; nevertheless, there is no single document which lays out a comprehensive strategy on enterprise policy. P U B L I C\u2013P R I V AT E CO N S U LTAT I O N A framework for public\u2013private consultations has been legally estab- lished inTunisia, assigning the role of sole private sector representative to the Union Tunisienne de l\u2019Industrie du Commerce et de l\u2019Artisanat (UTICA),whichrepresents17sectorfederationsandboastsanextensive network throughout the country.

However, while UTICA is regularly consulted about policy elaboration and implementation, there is not yet a mechanism for independent monitoring and evalua- tion of policy measures. Further progress could also be achieved in en- hancing the transparency of the consultation process, with the private sector playing a more prominent role in making policy proposals, and with more voice given to new and innovative entrepreneurs. C L E A R A N D TA R G E T E D I N F O R M AT I O N A number of government portals are dedicated to private sector inter- ests with relevant information available to enterprises. The API\u2019s por- tal is particularly tailored to enterprise owners and entrepreneurs on key areas of interest (such as tax, labour, standards and regulations) (55) . Still, some of these portals have overlapping information which dem- onstrates the need for a consolidated format. Moreover, companies throughout the country remain insufficiently aware of the services available to them. 3. Operational environment A D M I N I S T R AT I V E S I M P L I F I C AT I O N Tunisia has passed a number of laws and provisions, and set in place special units with the task of simplifying administrative procedures. A high-level coordination body (56) has been established at prime ministe- rialleveltooverseesimplificationinitiatives.Toimprovetheoperational environment for enterprises, in 80 % of the cases administrative author- isations have been replaced by general requirements imposed on com- panies: the idea is to speed up the administrative process, especially in thecaseofopeningabusiness.Theimpacthasnotbeenfullyevaluated yet. Further measures include one-stop-shops delivering services in a number of areas located across the country. CO M PA NY R E G I S T R AT I O N In Tunisia, no registration fee is required for setting up a company that is totally export oriented. The establishment of one-stop-shops has remark- ably shortened and simplified the process of opening a business.There are currently14one-stop-shopslocatedinmajorcitiesthroughoutthecountry, with plans to extend such services to every governorate by 2008.TheTuni- sian government has also set up a system of online registration for compa- niesthatmeetcertainconditions.Thissystemappliestothreetypesofcom- panies: private limited company, limited liability company and one-person limited liability company.

ACC E S S TO F I N A N C E Over the last decade, the Tunisian government has sought to facilitate access to finance for private enterprises by strengthening the legal and regulatory framework, launching publicly funded schemes and incen- tives, developing the capital market and expanding the supply of finan- cial products. Thebankingsectorismadeupof20universalbanks(withamixedcapi- talofdomestic,foreignandpublicshareholders),10leasingcompanies, two factoring companies, two investment banks and eight offshore banks. Two public banks are devoted to financing investment and pro- viding credit to SMEs.The Banque de Financement des PME operates in the EUR 45 000 to 2.8 million loan bracket and reports a recovery rate of 96 % of the loans it disburses.The BanqueTunisienne de Solidarit\u00e9 is a microfinance institution providing microcredit of up to EUR 45 000. These institutions target mainly youth and entrepreneurs and have at their disposal a number of national funds and supporting schemes in- cluding Fonapram (for microenterprise), Foprodi (new entrepreneurs) and RIITI (start-ups in the ICT sector). The Sotugar credit guarantee scheme is specially targeted to SMEs and helpstomitigatetherisk-averseattitudeofcommercialbanks.However the perception is that collateral requirements remain high and funding hard to access. Recently, cluster-based mutual funding has been tested as an innovative way for new entrepreneurs to fund their projects. Venture capital started to develop in the country as early as 10 years ago with the support of the EU. Tunisia has substantially increased and diversifiedthesupplyofventurecapitalwiththelaunchingoftwotypes of equity funds: the SICAR (providing minority equity contributions in projectsfinancedbypubliclyfundedschemessuchasFoprodi,RIITIand Fosdap (57) , and the FCPR (58) . Although the 40 operating SICARs mainly provide portage facilities, a group of experienced fund managers has been formed and a range of investment vehicles has been established. The SICARs and the FCPRs could in the future play a significant role in fi- nancing high-growth and innovative enterprise and channelling funds from international investors. I N V E S T M E N T-F R I E N D L Y TAXAT I O N Tunisia has been engaged in well-structured fiscal reforms for several years. In 2006 Tunisia took the initiative in the Maghreb to follow the global trend of cutting marginal tax rates in order to stimulate invest- ment and growth. Initially highly dependent on tariff and duties rev- enues,Tunisia has been progressively dismantling them under the EU\u2013 Tunisianfreetradeagreementandhasincreaseditsdirecttaxcollection capacity considerably. VAT has been introduced in the retail sector and measures have been put in place to discourage informal activity.

Since 2000, Tunisia has taken a number of critical steps to simplify procedures for trade by launching a programme called TunisiaTradeNet(TTN),anonlinenetworkthatfacilitatestheformalities related to foreign trade inTunisia (TTN establishes linkages with banks, administrations, customs, etc.). TTN acts as an intermediary to ensure traceability and to reduce the goods\u2019times of stay at the ports. TTN al- lows the various operators (companies, forwarding and commissioners\u2019 customs agents, carriers and shipping agents) to process electronically the various formalities of import and export. The establishment of TTN has consequently cut down the time and costs related to procedures for foreign trade. While attracting investment has been an ambitious project for the gov- ernment,effortshavealsobeenmadetodevelopanexportmarketfordo- mestic enterprises. Tunisia\u2019s export strategy is set by a high-level council presided by the president (CSI) (59) . An export promotion agency has been established under the Ministry of Commerce (CEPEX, le Centre de Promo- tion des Exportations) with a mandate to gather commercial intelligence, examine the impact of export assistance programmes and organise ex- port promotion activities such as commercial missions, trade fairs, etc. AC A As To be ready for the signature of an ACAA with the EU, the partner coun- try should have adequate infrastructure in the fields of standardisation, accreditation, conformity assessment, metrology and market surveil- lance, and should have adopted the relevant parts of the acquis . Tuni- sia has begun upgrading the infrastructure, and harmonisation of the horizontal legislation is well advanced.The alignment of the legislation in the priority sectors chosen byTunisia (machinery, construction prod- ucts, electrical appliances, simple pressure vessels, measuring instru- ments) has started. The adoption of European standards in the priority sectors and the withdrawal of national conflicting ones is under way. 4. Services for enterprises B U S I N E S S S U P P O R T S E RV I C E S Many business services are at the disposal of enterprises through both public and private channels. Two key programmes run by the govern- ment offer services to enterprises to improve competitiveness. Services undertheenterpriseupgradingprogramme(PMN),establishedin1996, have been made available to nearly 4 000 enterprises as of March 2008. The PMN is also highlighted as a priority in the 11th development plan. The industrial modernisation programme (PMI), established in 2003 and funded by the European Union, provides technical assistance to industrial enterprises offering services ranging from coaching to qual- ity management and facilitating access to finance (60) . The PMI prepares enterprises for the Euro-Med FTA and stimulates innovation in enter- prises.The PMI is administered through a number of public and private structures such as API, IACE, UTICA, BFPME, the Industrial Property and Patents Agency (INNORPI), and the Office for Assistance to Enterprises (BAE). Business establishment support services are available through- out the country (at the regional business centres). These support serv- ices go beyond basic establishment needs and nourish the creation of innovative enterprises. In addition, three regional development offices are in place in the north, centre and south of the country in order to strengthen development and investment efforts. I N N OVAT I O N P O L I C Y Complementing the PMN and PMI programmes, Tunisia is embarking on an aggressive innovation strategy with the backing of high-level po- litical support. Whilst R & D spending as a share of GDP is comparable withsomeOECDcountries,thestrategyaimstofurtherincreasenation- al spending on R & D from around 1.07 % to 1.25 % of GDP by 2009. A broad array of programmes and mechanisms is in place to promote innovation. This includes technopoles that have a sectoral specialisa- tion and are tasked with transforming knowledge into industrial ap- plications.These clusters are based on public\u2013private partnerships and link publicly funded investments in R & D, education and private invest- ment. Six technopoles are already in operation and the 11th economic development plan foresees the establishment of three more. The goal is to have at least one technopole or one business incubator in each of the country\u2019s 24 governorates by 2009. The Ministry of Higher Education, Scientific Research and Technology has just established an innovation and research promotion agency to strengthen linkages between research and production. Since 1999, a national programme has established 25 business incubators linked to higher education establishments. These efforts have paid off: according to government figures, already 2.23 % of the total active population (2006) is employed in medium- to high-technology firms in the manufacturing sector. Still Tunisia has some room left for improvement especially in involving the private sec- tor more closely in innovation promotion measures, in increasing the innovationcontentofsupportedprojects,andinpromotinginnovation in SMEs. According to statistics, only 4.75 % (2004) of Tunisian SMEs claim that they are innovating, compared with the 2006 EU-25 average of 47.2 % in the manufacturing sector (61) .

        "5. Human capital This section considers the human capital dimensions of the Charter, in par- ticular,theassessmentfocusedonentrepreneurshipeducationandtraining (Dimension2)andtheskillscontextoftheenterprisesector(Dimension3). On policies supporting entrepreneurship education and training, Tuni- sia stands apart from other countries in the region for its emphasis on promotion of entrepreneurial spirit and key competences in all parts of the learning system, enshrined within the 2002 national education strategy (updated in 2008). The potential of this policy framework, al- readyhighlightedasapolicyreferencepointabove,playsoutinTunisia\u2019s performance on secondary schooling (ISCED 2 and 3) where the entre- preneurship key competence and more developed entrepreneurship skills are being addressed. For Tunisia to move forward on the second- ary education indicators, statistics on the numbers of schools effectively delivering on the entrepreneurship key competence and harder entre- preneurship skills will be important. This information could be gleaned from annual school reports submitted to the national authorities. Complementing the good efforts being made within the formal educa- tion system, the assessment points to a host of non-formal entrepre- neurial learning (i.e. activities not subject to formal assessment by the state) such as the CEFE-ANETI coaching framework for microenterprise development. One initiative stands out for training provision building on know-how transfer: self-employment promotion through German\u2013 Tunisian cooperation (the FORTI initiative). Another good practice ini- tiative,particularlyintermsofwomen\u2019sstart-ups,isatrainingandwider support package for rural women on microenterprise development. A high-profile national award ( Prix du Pr\u00e9sident de la R\u00e9publique ) ensures good press coverage for this initiative. Better efforts, however, could be made to ensure that existing domestic know-how could be more sys- tematically disseminated in-country which will be important to move forward on the\u2018good practice\u2019indicator. Turning to training for enterprises, a range of human resource devel- opment strategies are supported by funding mechanisms and national agencies (e.g. Pronafoc, ANETI) targeting business start-ups and follow- up services. Taken together, these provide a good enterprise support framework against which a number of training provider networks oper- ate.There are also good training services (international standards, mar- keting) for enterprises operating or intending to break into the interna- tional trade arena. However, missing in the overall policy and delivery effort are data on enterprise training. The quantitative conditions of the Dimension 3 indicators require statistics on training take-up by en- terprise, and specifically on training for start-ups and expanding busi- nesses. Without a systematic tracking of enterprise training, public in- vestment in human resources is difficult to monitor and evaluate, while priority-setting and resource allocation risk being compromised. To move forward on Dimension 3,Tunisian employers, in cooperation with nationalauthorities,couldconsiderestablishingastructuredsystemfor regular gathering of data on the health of enterprise manpower with particular reference to skill gaps, weaknesses and future skills\u2019require- ments.This could help with policy adjustments and resource allocation, while prompting a closer fit between training demand and supply. 6. The way forward In general terms, Tunisian enterprise policy is well articulated and at- tracts considerable government resources. Tunisia achieves good scores in complex policy areas such as innovation (Dimension 6) and in the provision of business support services (Dimension 8). On policies supporting entrepreneurship education and training, Tunisia stands apart from other countries in the region for its emphasis on promotion of entrepreneurial spirit and key competences in all parts of the learn- ing system, enshrined within the 2002 national education strategy (up- dated in 2008). Access to finance is an area where the country performs less well, and, in Dimension 1, good results in company registration are partly offset by a limited performance in the area of regulatory reform. OnthebasisoftheCharterassessment,Tunisiashouldlooktointroduce more stringent mechanisms of policy evaluation, relying on a variety of tools, from policy indicators, to company surveys and independent policy reviews. This will improve the targeting of policy measures and will bringTunisia closer to widely recognised good practices. In addition, the following priorities have been identified. \u2022 Regulatory reform and administrative simplification. Some significant progress has been achieved in this area with the intro- duction of the general requirements ( Cahiers de charge ). However, Tunisia could benefit from the launching of a wider review of laws and regulations affecting the private sector, and particularly small enterprises, operating mainly in the domestic market. It will also be important to work on the introduction of a system of regulatory im- pact analysis on new legislation and regulations. \u2022 Access to finance. Good progress has been achieved in the diversi- fication of financial services for enterprises, but this is not matched by an equal improvement of the regulatory and legislative frame- work. It would be useful forTunisia to work on the establishment of apublicregisterofmovableassetsandonextendingcreditinforma- tion services to allow the entry of private operators. \u2022 Innovation policy. Tunisia is currently putting significant efforts into developing innovation policy. It is important to further develop synergies with skills development initiatives and to expand pro- grammes directed at building linkages between local and foreign- owned enterprises. This will unlock the considerable potential that Tunisia has in business process outsourcing vis-\u00e0-vis the francoph- one and the Arabic-speaking markets. Page 129 ",
        "Page 130 \u2022 Human capital. To build on an already good performance in Dimension 2, the education authorities should determine how school-based entrepreneurial learning developments are to be registered for the purposes of the statistics requirements of the indicators. Data on enterprise training need to be improved. An employer-led initiative, in cooperation with government, to systematically gather data on enterprise human resource activity, including training needs (management and trade skills) should be considered. All data developments should be gender-sensitive. 5.0 4.0 3.0 2.0 1.0 0.0 1 S i m p l e P r o c e d u r e s 2 E n t r e p r e n e u r s h i p 3 I m p r o v e d S k i l l s 4 A c c e s s t o F i n a n c e 5 M a r k e t A c c e s s 6 I n n o v a t i v e F i r m s 7 B u s i n e s s A s s o c i a t i o n s 8 B u s i n e s s S e r v i c e s 9 E u r o - M e d N e t w o r k s 1 0 C l e a r I n f o r m a t i o n Figure 31: Tunisia: Overall scores per Charter dimension ",

In 2002, the European Invest- ment Bank\u2019s operations in the Mediterranean partner countries were brought together under the Facility for Euro-Mediterranean Investment and Partnership (FEMIP). The FEMIP, supported by the European Commission, gives priority to financing private sector ventures (http://www.eib.org/femip). In addition, the European Commission and the European Investment Bank collaborate closely to maximise synergies between their private sector development actions. A number of ENPI-funded instruments are managed by the EIB on behalf of the European Commission under the FEMIP.These instruments include: \u2022 risk capital operations through which financing is provided (often through local intermediaries), in particular to small and medium- sized enterprises; \u2022 the FEMIP Technical Assistance Support Fund, which provides technical assistance managed by the EIB; it concerns technical as- sistance support that can be mobilised at all phases of the project cycle; an important objective is to reinforce the private sector focus of the FEMIP; \u2022 EIB loans benefiting from a Community guarantee: these loans are made available under the external lending mandate of the EIB; the guarantee is financed through the Commission budget.
