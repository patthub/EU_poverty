        "Council conclusions of 18 November 2010 on the role of sport as a source of and a driver for active social inclusion (2010/C 326/04) THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION, 1. RECALLING: The political background to this issue as set out in the Annex, in particular: \u2014 the declaration attached to conclusions of the European Council of 7-9 December 2000, which states that sport is a human activity resting on fundamental social, educational and cultural values, and a factor making for integration, involvement in social life, tolerance, acceptance of differences and playing by the rules ( 1 ), \u2014 Decision No 291/2003/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 6 February 2003 establishing the European Year of Education through Sport 2004 ( 2 ), \u2014 Decision No 1098/2008/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 October 2008 concerning the European Year against Poverty and Social Exclusion (2010) ( 3 ). 2. WELCOMING: \u2014 that, following the entry into force of the Lisbon Treaty ( 4 ) on 1 December 2009, sport has become a competence of the European Union and that, consequently, the European dimension in sport is to be further developed, taking particular account of the social and educational function of sport, \u2014 the intention of the Commission to adopt the Communi\u00ad cation on the Lisbon Treaty and sport by the end of 2010. 3. RECOGNISES THAT: 1. Common priorities, such as increased employment, social inclusion, gender equality, equal access to facilities and services, intergenerational solidarity and intercultural dialogue, need stronger support across the European Union, including in the area of sport. 2. Sport holds an important place in the lives of many EU citizens and plays a strong societal role with a powerful potential for social inclusion in and through sport, meaning that participation in sport or in physical activity in many different ways contributes to inclusion into society; whereby inclusion in sport involves a com- bination of \u2018sport for all\u2019, equal access to sport, equal opportunities in sport, and varied demand-oriented sporting opportunities and sport facilities, and whereby social inclusion through sport involves inclusive partici\u00ad pation in society, community development and strengthened social cohesion. 3. The sports movement can make an important contribution to issues of public interest such as social inclusion. In this context, professional athletes and amateur sport persons, as well as sport clubs, are role models for society, especially for young people, and other sport organisations and civil society organisations dealing with sport also contribute to social inclusion in and through sport. 4. Access to and participation in diverse aspects of sport is important for personal development, an individual\u2019s sense of identity and belonging, physical and mental wellbeing, empowerment, social competences and networks, inter\u00ad cultural communication and employability. 5. The \u2018European Conference on Local Sports Participation: social inclusion and combating poverty\u2019, 13-14 October in Leuven, Belgium, which demonstrated that sport plays an important role in social inclusion of disadvantaged groups, especially on the local level. 4.
