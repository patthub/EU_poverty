        "EDITORIAL A s 2015 draws to a close and the end-of-the-year holidays approach, the least we can say is that this has been an eventful and challenging year! To deliver on the Juncker Commission\u2019s ten priori- ties for Europe, the College and staff have been hard at work this year to produce this Commission\u2019s first key in- itiatives such as the Investment Package for Europe, the Energy Union, the Digital Single Market, the European Agenda on Migration and the Capital Markets Union. But certain shocking and tragic events have meant that it has been necessary also to keep adapting to new and changing circumstances and challenges \u2013 such as the evolving situation in the Syrian civil war, the refugee crisis, and the security and societal challenges posed by a series of deadly terrorist attacks, notably in Paris, but also in Europe\u2019s neighbourhood, including in Tunisia, Turkey, and Lebanon. With the most recent terrorist attacks in Paris cast- ing a bit of a shadow over the normally festive spirit GOODBYE 2015, HELLO 2016! by Zach Hester, EDITOR(cid:2)IN(cid:2)CHIEF, CEND \u00a9 F o t o l i a at this time of year, let us not be subdued or cowed. As Europeans, let us remember with respect those who lost their lives so brutally and needlessly, but let us also not lose sight of our fundamental values and principles that make Europe a beacon of hope and humanity for so many around the world! Let this be our gift to them at this time of giving. In that spirit, 2015 has been a landmark year for development policy. Timed to perfection, the European Year for Development focused attention on making the crucial transition between the UN\u2019s Millennium Development Goals and the new framework agreed in New York in September, the Agenda for Sustainable Development. The Sustainable Development Goals now set the priorities for international cooperation and development up until 2030. This and the EU\u2019s on-going development work are the focus of this edi- tion\u2019s Dossier. Bonne lecture et bonnes f\u00eates! (cid:2) ",

        "POST Comments on the new My IntraComm (taken from \u2018Have Your Say\u2019, My IntraComm\u2019s new staff forum) New My IntraComm worse than before I have to say, I find the new My IntraComm worse than the previous one: I use My IntraComm as a repository of internal procedures and know-how \u2013 this is now hidden in a menu, whereas the main site has become something like a news site. I don\u2019t see that the money spent on the revamp was well spent. Thomas Linsinger, DG JRC A different opinion I find the aesthetics / layout of the new My IntraComm very modern and professional, and I have not seen any deterioration so far. :-) Julian Daniel Jimenez Krause, DG COMP More modern and fresh I like the new look and feel as well :) Looks much more modern and fresh! Well done :) Edson Ramos, DG REGIO Thank you for your feedback. We are sorry, Thomas, that you find the change a deterioration. We acknowledge that there may be colleagues who preferred the old My IntraComm, but your comment gives us an opportunity to explain a little more about the project (carried out entirely in-house). My IntraComm is not intended only as a repository of procedures and know-how but also as a channel for important corporate news, a way to find information about other DGs, as well as practical information for staff. Compared to the previous version, the new My IntraComm doesn\u2019t have more news on the homepage \u2013 there are, in fact, fewer news items there, but key news is more prominent. In addition, there are more profiles of colleagues in line with the idea to build a single corporate culture, particularly since we are scattered across many different sites. The menu, far from being hidden, is now accessible from every page of the new My IntraComm, from the header. It has been designed in consultation with colleagues from all DGs and services, to provide rapid access to the top tools and a more rationalised navigation to information you need to do your job. If you cannot find the information you are looking for in the menu, you can also try the new Search. It is accessible from the magnifying glass in the top right corner. (See links below for more information about the Search and more general information about the new My IntraComm.)

        "8 Commission invests \u20ac160.6 million in 96 new environment projects The Commission approved an investment package of \u20ac264.8 million to support Europe\u2019s environment, na- ture, and green growth. The investment covers 96 new projects across 21 Member States, funded under the LIFE programme for the Environment. The projects cover actions in the field of resource efficiency, sup- porting the transition to a more circular and sustainable economy, nature and biodiversity, and environmental governance and information. The EU will co-finance the projects by providing \u20ac160.6 million. \u201cMoney in- vested in environment projects is money well spent. I am delighted to see that our LIFE programme will support many innovative projects, and I am sure they will make a vital contribution,\u201d stated Karmenu Vella, Commissioner for the Environment, Maritime Affairs and Fisheries. \u201cAs well as protecting and enhancing natural capital, there are many promising avenues here that will help steer Europe towards a low-carbon, resource efficient and sustainable future. We will follow these projects carefully, with a view to sharing and replicating their success.\u201d (cid:2) LIFE programme (cid:2) http://europa.eu/!CF87xV Action Plan to boost Single Market O n 28 October, the Commission launched an Action Plan to further boost the Single Market with a number of ambitious and pragmatic actions focused on three main areas \u2013 creating ad- ditional opportunities for consumers, professionals and businesses, and encouraging the modernisation and innovation that Europe needs. \u201cFurther strengthening and deepening the EU Single Mar- ket is the most important part of the Investment Plan for Europe.\" stated Vice-President Jyrki Katainen. The Single Market is one of Europe\u2019s greatest achieve- ments. By allowing people, services, goods and capital to move more freely in the world\u2019s largest economy (\u20ac14 trillion GDP), it offers European busi- nesses enormous opportunities, consumers greater choice and lower prices, and citizens the freedom to travel, live, work and study where they wish. But these benefits do not always materialise, because Sin- gle Market rules are not known, not implemented or simply undermined by other barriers. El \u017c bieta Bie \u0144 kowska, Commissioner for Internal Mar- ket, Industry, Entrepreneurship and SMEs, said: \u201cIf we are to restore citizens\u2019 trust in the European project, create jobs and build a competitive economy, and retain an influence in the world, we must unleash the full po- tential of the Single Market.

        "# D \u00e9 c e m b r e 2 0 1 5 - J a n v i e r 2 0 1 6 9 In the aftermath of the Paris attacks, on 18 November, the Commission adopted a package of measures to make it more difficult to acquire firearms in the EU. Fabio Marini, Head of DG HOME\u2019s Firearms Trafficking Task Force, explains what is happening. What action has the Commission taken? The package adopted includes proposed revisions of the Firearms Directive, implementing rules on deac- tivation, and a report on the Directive\u2019s implementa- tion. DG HOME is co-owner of this package with DG GROW, which deals with the Firearms Directive. The Firearms Task Force has been working for two years on this dossier. We were finalising different options, but the attacks in Paris and the subsequent request for a prompt response accelerated the proposals\u2019 finalisation The fight against firearms trafficking has been a DG HOME priority for over three years. Following the attack in Norway in July 2012, the Task Force was set up to define and develop activities \u2013 from best practices to legislation \u2013 to reduce firearm trafficking. The Task Force has brought together our experts in terrorism, organised crime, police cooperation, the Schengen Information System (SIS II), and external relations. We already de- fined a firearms strategy and published a Communica- tion in October 2013, prepared the Council Decision for the Adoption of the UN Firearms Protocol and drafted a Commission Decision setting up an expert group on firearms. We commissioned two preparatory studies for the Impact Assessment of revising the firearms legisla- tion and coordinated meetings with experts in the field. For these reasons, we were ready to draft the revised legislation at very short notice. At President Junker\u2019s request, we have also produced a Communication to step up EU action against the illicit trafficking and use of firearms and explosives and defined priorities and tasks to increase pressure on criminals active in this field. What can be done about access to the AK 47 Kalashnikov? Originally manufactured in the Soviet Union in 1947, the AK 47 Kalashnikov is an efficient, light and cheap fully automatic rifle. Today, this rifle and its variants are manufactured in many other countries. The fully automatic version is a weapon of war banned in the EU, but its semi-automatic version can be bought legally. However, because it is such a dangerous weapon, the Commission in the recently adopted proposal to revise the EU legislation proposes banning it and forbidding even legal ownership of deactivated war weapons, given the danger reactivated weapons of this type can pose. The overall idea behind the proposal is to reduce risk caused by the widespread ownership of the most dan- gerous weapons. Given the role of small arms and light weapons in civil wars like in Syria, how can EU law enforcement help de-escalate such conflicts? De-escalation of such complex conflicts cannot depend on a single initiative or piece of legislation. But good legislation can reduce the risk of criminal flouting of rules and help law enforcement agencies tackle the ille- gal trafficking of firearms. This also has to be combined with improved police cooperation, better exchange of information and the interoperability of different tools, such as databases. And the Task Force is working to ensure this happens.

        "10 G eopolitical events have kept energy high on the agenda in 2015. On-going tensions between Russia and Ukraine, persistently low oil prices impacting energy markets all over the world, additional supply in- frastructure for natural gas from Russia, the nuclear agree- ment with Iran, and the continued decline in domestic fossil fuel production have all highlighted the uncertainty around global energy supply and sustainability. It is within this context that the Commission put forward its proposals for a sustainable, low-carbon com- petitive Energy Union in February 2015 (see Dossier, CEND #21), and its first progress report, published on 18 November, looks at progress made over the last nine months. It also identifies key action areas for 2016, as well as providing policy conclusions at Member State, regional and European levels. According to Maro\u0161 \u0160ef \u010d ovi \u010d , Vice-President respon- sible for the Energy Union: \u201cNine months down the road, we can say with confidence that we are on track to deliver the Energy Union. My messages for 2016 are clear. First, the EU should continue to lead in the transition to a low- carbon economy. Second, that transition should be social- ly fair and consumer-centred. And third, the geopolitical challenges that we faced this year will not go away. 2016 will also be the year in which we will lay the foundations of a robust governance system bringing predictability and transparency, which is what investors need. In sum: 2016 will be a year of delivery!\u201d On climate change, the State of the Energy Union report highlights Europe\u2019s contribution to the UN-led negotiations now under way in Paris, which it is hoped will lead to binding global emissions cuts. At this stage, more than 160 countries representing more than 90% of global emissions have presented their contributions. The EU has pledged binding domestic economy-wide emissions cuts of at least 40% by 2030 compared to 1990 levels. After the Paris conference, it will be im- portant that all countries follow up with concrete im- plementation of their commitments. Miguel Arias Ca\u00f1ete, Commissioner for Climate Action and Energy, said: \u201cThe Energy Union is starting to take shape. A lot of progress has been made in these few months but we should now move to full scale delivery of all actions needed. This will be my focus in 2016: presenting the legislation to make our electricity market work better, to further increase the share of renewables, to bring down our energy consumption and to ensure security of our gas supply. With this, the EU\u2019s energy system will be stronger and all conditions will be set for the EU\u2019s transition toward a low-carbon energy system. As all eyes turn towards ne- gotiations in Paris, this is a renewed pledge for European leadership and our commitment to the international efforts to fight climate change.\u201d (cid:2) State of the Energy Union report (cid:2) http://europa.eu/!KN79BH The Commission\u2019s first State of the Energy Union report shows that the Energy Union Framework Strategy has created a new momentum to bring about the transition to a low-carbon, secure and competitive economy.

        "# D \u00e9 c e m b r e 2 0 1 5 - J a n v i e r 2 0 1 6 11 With unprecedented numbers of migrants arriving in the EU, the Valletta Summit brought together EU and African countries to address the challenges and find common solutions. An Action Plan was launched with an Emergency Trust Fund for Africa at its core. VALLETTA SUMMIT ON MIGRATION EMERGENCY TRUST FUND FOR AFRICA by Michael Scheerer, CEND \u00a9 E U A t the summit in Valletta, Malta, on 11-12 No- vember, Commission President Juncker, together with a number of European Heads of State and Government, launched the EU\u2019s Emergency Trust Fund for Africa. The Trust Fund is an innovative mechanism under the EU\u2019s Financial Regulation used in develop- ment cooperation to pool large resources from differ- ent donors to enable a swift, common, complementary and flexible response to the different dimensions of an emergency situation. It brings together \u20ac1.8 billion from the EU financing instruments and contributions from EU Member States and other donors. So far, 25 EU Member States and two non-EU do- nors \u2013 Norway and Switzerland \u2013 have announced a total contribution of around \u20ac81.3 million. The Trust Fund will benefit a wide range of countries across Africa, encompassing the major migration routes to Europe. These countries are among the most fragile and those most affected by migration. They will draw the greatest benefit from EU financial assistance. An Action Plan to address root causes As an important instrument for the implementation of the Action Plan, the Fund aims to help foster stability in the different regions and to contribute to better migra- tion management. More specifically, it aims to address the root causes of destabilisation, forced displacement and irregular migration, by promoting economic and equal opportunities, security, and development. The Valletta Summit brought together European and African Heads of State and Government in an effort to strengthen cooperation and address the current chal- lenges on migration. In a political declaration, the Sum- mit recognised that migration is a shared responsibility of countries of origin, transit, and destination, with the EU and African partners committing to work in a spirit of partnership to find common solutions to challenges of mutual interest. The aim is to enhance cooperation on legal migration and mobility, reinforce the protection of migrants and asylum seekers, prevent and fight irregular migration, migrant smuggling and trafficking in human beings, and work more closely to improve cooperation on return, readmission and reintegration. Since 2005, the Global Approach to Migration and Mobility provides the framework for the EU\u2019s relations with third countries in the areas of migration and asy- lum. Updated in 2013, it serves as a complement to the EU\u2019s foreign and development cooperation policies. On this basis, there are cooperation processes between the EU and African countries at continental, regional (Ra- bat process, Khartoum process) and bilateral (through mobility partnerships and other tools) levels.

        "12 on 14 October. In addition, there were exchanges of views on the future priorities with the European Parliament, Council, Committee of the Regions, and European Economic and Social Committee. The end result of these exchanges over an intense six-week period is a lean work programme very much anchored in the ten priorities and building on the key initiatives and strategies launched this year. In addi- tion to 23 new initiatives, the 2016 Commission Work Programme also highlights 17 legislative proposals already before the Parliament and the Council that merit speedy adoption, as well as 40 initiatives under our Regulatory Fitness and Performance Programme ( REFIT), and 20 proposals that we intend to withdraw or modify and 28 envisaged repeals. The Work Programme also informs citizens and businesses of 68 pieces of new legislation that will start applying in 2016. (cid:2) Commission Work Programme 2016 (cid:2) http://europa.eu/!JU76Pu EUROPE & BEYOND O ne year ago, the Commission made a new start with ten priorities set out in the Agenda for Jobs, Growth, Fairness and Democratic Change. Some key initiatives were taken in 2015, notably with the Investment Plan (see Dossier, CEND#24), with work streams put into motion in a number of areas for the coming years. This time, President Juncker took stock of the work accomplished and the challenges ahead in his first State of the Union on 9 September. As he said, \u201cthis is not the time for business as usual\u2019\u2019 . The Commission keeps on working to address the challenges and deliver: \u2022 on the jobs, growth and investment gap \u2022 the refugee crisis \u2022 climate change and the pressure on natural resources \u2022 inequality, intolerance and a sense of insecurity in some parts of our communities \u2022 instability in our neighbourhood \u2022 a fair deal for the UK within an EU committed to the four freedoms of the Single Market and the values that all 28 Member States share. The annual Work Programme exercise is essential to ensure that work is well coordinated within the Com- mission, priorities are aligned with the other EU Institu- tions, and it is properly communicated to the public. How has the Commission Work Programme been conceived? The First Vice-President, Frans Timmermans, is in the lead, in close cooperation with President Juncker.

        "14 EUROPE & BEYOND \u201c The Annual Growth Survey is essentially about prior- itising the right policies that can strengthen the recov- ery,\" stated Vice-President Dombrovskis. \"The response requires more impetus into investment, decisive structural reforms and responsible fiscal policies. This is the engine that can help power convergence amongst Member States. We are committed to bringing economic and social levels across Europe closer together and closer to the best performers.\u201d The Survey\u2019s 2016 novelties There are a number of novelties in the 2016 Annual Growth Survey, reflecting those innovative elements for the European Semester introduced in the follow-up to the five Presidents\u2019 report (see link) presented by Vice-President Dombrovskis on 21 October. Two are particularly worth highlighting. First, there is more emphasis on employment and social aspects, not least to tackle the social disparities both between and within Member States. Second, the euro area recommendations have been published now, together with the Survey, rather than together with the country-specific recom- mendations in the spring. This draws greater attention to common challenges specific to the euro area, en- abling Eurozone members to better take into account euro-area concerns in national policymaking and before designing their reforms ahead of the country-specific recommendations. Policy priorities The 2016 Annual Growth Survey also underlines the need to build on the 2015 Survey\u2019s three-pronged policy priorities: \u2022 Stepping up investment This means building on the Investment Plan for Eu- rope, developing projects with a real impact on the real economy, removing barriers to investment, and creating the right conditions for attracting private investment. High private debt and non-performing loans are also hampering investment. State-of-the- art insolvency systems and efficient judicial processes have to be put in place to address the problem of excessive private debt. \u2022 Continuing responsible fiscal policies Public debt in some Member States is still very high and needs to be brought under control within the rules of the Stability and Growth Pact. High debt holds back growth and makes countries vulnerable to shocks. Member States need to make sure that pen- sion, healthcare and social security systems are finan- cially sustainable considering the ageing population. At the same time, the quality of public finances can be improved, including through fairer and more ef- ficient tax systems. \u2022 Enhancing structural reforms to modernise EU economies This implies increased productivity through a flexible and secure labour market and with efficient and sus- tainable social protection systems, as well as a compet- itive and more integrated product and services market that can drive forward innovation and job creation. Efficient and modern public administrations are also needed to underpin investment and activity.

Following the call for donations launched by eu can aid! with the personal support of Vice-President Kristalina Georgieva and Commissioner Christos Stylianides and the help of the Central Staff Committee, \u20ac20,874 was collected. eu can aid! used the money collected to support four organisations. \u20ac5,000 went to Plan International for immediate emergency aid. \u20ac4,500 was donated to support self-sufficiency in food production for the rural families in three earthquake affected areas of Kathmandu, in partnership with AWARE, Pakistan. In partnership with Terre d\u2019enfance, \u20ac5,500 was used to reconstruct a primary school in Tanahu district. With the remaining \u20ac5,500, in partnership with Child Protection Centres and Services (CPCS), some 800 metal roofs were distributed to help 100 Nepali families who had lost their home. The roofs are today installed on temporary shelters and will serve as permanent roofs once the emergency phase is over and new stable houses will be built. Thanks to the partnership with CPCS, tarpaulins and tents were distributed immediately to hundreds of families. \"Gita from Sindhuli, a 10 year-old child, and her family received 12 pieces of metal roof to rebuild their home. Today Gita is going back to school and she and her family are not sleeping under the open-sky anymore,\" reports Jean-Christophe Ryckmans from CPCS.

        "18 C limate change is happening now. It is changing the world and changing it dramatically. The least developed countries (LDCs) and the small island developing states (SIDs) are the world\u2019s most vulner- able to its effects. \u201cIt is a top priority for the EU to assist the most vulnera- ble countries in their efforts to adapt to climate change and at the same time to transit to green and sustainable econ- omies. There are encouraging success stories which we will replicate and take further over the next years,\u201d states Neven Mimica, Commissioner for International Cooperation and Development, renewing the EU\u2019s commitment to addressing one of the world most pressing issues of the 21st century \u2013 climate change. One of the first donors to recognise the particular vulnerability of SIDs and the need to prioritise part- nerships with and between them, the EU has bilateral programmes with 14 SIDs and regional programmes benefiting 25 SIDs \u2013 accounting for 30% of GCCA+ funding today. Eradicating poverty by building resilient, low-carbon societies Climate change and poverty are strongly interconnect- ed, which is why poverty reduction efforts need to be integrated with sustainable development plans. Set up in 2007 to strengthen dialogue and cooperation on climate change between the EU and developing coun- tries, the Global Climate Change Alliance has become one of the most significant climate initiatives in the world. For the period 2007-13, the Alliance offered \u20ac300 million in funding to LDCs and SIDs, with Cy- prus, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Ireland and Sweden offering an additional \u20ac37 million. GCCA+ currently supports 51 programmes across 38 countries and eight regions of the world to build low-carbon, climate-resilient societies. Holistic and integrated approaches include setting up climate-re- silient eco-villages and nature-based solutions to cli- mate-change adaptation. In Tanzania, the Alliance enabled three regions in different types of ecosystems (coastal zones and islands, drylands, and highlands) to test such holistic, innovative and integrated ap- proaches. In these \u2018eco-villages\u2019, innovative adaptation measures in agriculture, rangeland management, water management, sanitation, biomass energy and participa- tory forest management are being successfully tested. Women are empowered to act at the forefront of this transformation, with increased authority and reduced workload. GCCA+ also supports developing countries\u2019 involve- ment in mitigation efforts at international level \u2013 partic- ularly in the emissions reductions measures undertaken to cope with deforestation and forest degradation, for example (see article, page 42). The GCCA+ is considerably larger than its predeces- sor \u2013 with around \u20ac350 million for the period 2014-20, as well as private and national public investments.\u201c We want to do more and we want to do it better,\u201d states Neven Mimica, referring to the initiative\u2019s plan to enhance collaboration with EU Member States and various other partners and to involve the private sector, as well as enhancing the participation of civil society and non- governmental organisations. GCCA+ \u2013 concrete action for the planet \u201cThis is a great initiative which shows that EU is scaling up climate finance to help the most vulnerable countries take action against climate change. And it also sends a clear signal ahead of Paris: the EU stands by its commitments and is ready to continue to do its part,\u201d says Miguel Arias Ca\u00f1ete, Commissioner for Climate Action and Energy. On 29 October 2015, GCCA+, a new phase of the Global Climate Change Alliance (GCCA), was launched, as the EU seeks to scale up climate finance to support the world\u2019s poorest and most vulnerable countries in tackling climate change.

The aim is to mobilise all the means for a global trans- formation to sustainable development and achieve- ment of the UN\u2019s Sustainable Development Goals. The Action Agenda includes a package of over 100 concrete measures that draw on all sources of finance, technolo- gy, innovation, trade, and data to achieve this. The Paris Climate Conference (COP21) now under way presents another unique opportunity to deal with climate change issues.

The Commission and DG DEVCO, which admin- ister GCCA+ funds on behalf of the EU, are commit- ted to supporting LDCs and SIDs in implementing the outcomes of these global processes, their National Ad- aptation Plans, and Intended Nationally Determined Contributions. The launch event itself was a good illustration of concrete action for the planet. DG DEVCO, the organ- iser, put considerable effort into significantly reducing the event\u2019s environmental impact. Participants had vegetarian lunches \u2013 saving emissions equivalent to around 600 km in a mid-sized petrol car (compared to a 40% meat-based buffet) \u2013 and corporate gifts were made of eco-friendly materials.

        "20 A n abnormal warming of the Pacific Ocean along the coasts of Ecuador and northern Peru, El Ni\u00f1o can wreak havoc on global meteorological pat- terns, causing catastrophic storms, floods and droughts on several continents. Until now, the worst year on record for this disrup- tion of the world\u2019s atmospheric system was 1997-98, when \u2018El Ni\u00f1o of the century\u2019 caused disasters costing more than 24,000 lives around the globe, and destroy- ing an estimated \u20ac28 billion in economic assets, over half of which were in Latin America. Globally, it is estimated that 110 million people were affected. This year\u2019s El Ni\u00f1o could break disaster records Yet, experts say 2015-16 might be worse. \u201cSo far this year, the abnormal warmth in the Pacific is reaching over 8 , 000 by 2 , 000 km, and is 300 metres deep,\u201d says Dr Eduardo Zambrano, one of the lead scientists of the International Centre for Research on the El Ni\u00f1o Phe- nomenon (CIIFEN), which monitors El Ni\u00f1o from Ecuador\u2019s Pacific coast. CIIFEN supports preparedness policies and programmes throughout South America, many of which are funded by DG ECHO. CIIFREN\u2019s October bulletin notes that El Ni\u00f1o is still expanding. \u201cWe are observing temperatures 4\u00baC above the norm on average, and up to 6\u00baC in some parts of the ocean,\u201d Dr Zambrano explained in October to an audience of disas- ter-risk-reduction agencies at the workshop DG ECHO held for the Caribbean region, where it supports many projects through its DIPECHO Disaster Risk Reduction programme. Memories of the disasters wrought by El Ni\u00f1o in 1997-98 linger in Latin American and Caribbean minds. Peru, for instance, one of the worst-affected countries, lost an estimated \u20ac3.17 billion to El Ni\u00f1o\u2019s impacts, amounting to 4.5% of its GDP. Floods alone destroyed a staggering \u20ac660 million worth of transport infrastructure \u2013 including roads, bridges, and railways. Peru\u2019s productive sector \u2013 agriculture, fisheries, min- ing, industry \u2013 lost close to \u20ac1.5 billion. The impact was particularly severe at community and household level among populations, undermining their tenuous livelihood security, with losses of crops and livestock, as well as household assets. \u201cThis year, Honduras was the first country to declare a state of emergency in June to facilitate response and request ex- ternal support, while Peru did so in August,\u201d explains Jocelyn Lance, DG ECHO\u2019s Resilience and Rapid Response Co- ordinator for Latin America and the Caribbean. From drought to floods \u201cIt is expected that El Ni\u00f1o may increase the severity of the current drought in Central America, northern Colombia, Venezuela, Cuba, Haiti, the Dominican Republic, Brazil and some eastern Caribbean islands,\u201d Lance points out. \u201cAlready, prolonged drought exacerbated by El Ni\u00f1o has caused a critical situation for around 200 , 000 Way\u00fau indig- enous people living in the northern part of Guajira peninsula in Colombia. Central America\u2019s \u2018Dry Corridor\u2019 \u2013 a region prone to droughts which stretches from southern Mexico to Costa Rica \u2013 is also a serious concern with regard to food security and livelihoods. 1.15 million vulnerable Central Americans are already in need of urgent food assistance. In the Caribbean, the drought is considered the most severe in 115 years, with an estimated 3.5 million people affected in Cuba, the Dominican Republic and Haiti, where up to 560 , 000 people need urgent food assistance in Haiti alone.\u201d Indeed, during a visit to ECHO-supported projects last October, residents from Savane Zombie, a hilly village in Haiti\u2019s Sud-Est province, said the drought was so severe that most livestock have died and people are going hungry. El Ni\u00f1o\u2019s name, Spanish for \u2018the child\u2019, hardly does justice to one of the world\u2019s most destructive weather abnormalities.

In Ecuador\u2019s coastal prov- ince of Guayas, for instance, thousands of farmers are struggling to protect their rice crops. \u201cLosing a rice crop to floods means a loss of 70% of a family\u2019s income,\u201d explains Carmen Guz\u00f1ay, who coordinates the local programme run by AVSF (Agronomes et V\u00e9t\u00e9rinaires sans Fronti\u00e8res) and funded by DG ECHO to make 250 families more resilient to recurrent catastrophes. An additional cause for concern is the global fall in commodity prices. Peru, Ecuador and Colombia\u2019s revenues from exported oil, gas and minerals have de- creased, weakening their financial capacity to respond to disasters. Anticipating disasters with better data and analysis Some lessons from 1997-98 have been heeded, however. Peru and Ecuador, for instance, updated their legisla- tion. \u201cPeru created national committees to produce reliable analyses, based on global climate models and computer- generated simulations, so as to anticipate disasters,\u201d says Dr Zambrano. But El Ni\u00f1o\u2019s repercussions are global, affecting also Africa and vulnerable Pacific countries such as Papua \u00a9 E U / E C H O / H . A v r i l (cid:2) El Ni\u00f1o\u2019s global reach worsens the current drought in Haiti, where river beds are turned into dustbowls. New Guinea, Fiji, and the Solomon Islands. Expected impacts range from extremely wet conditions in East and North Africa, with floods possibly increasing chol- era and malaria outbreaks, to insufficient monsoon rainfall in southern Asia, which could lead to drought, reduced crops and food insecurity. \u201cThe majority of countries have already taken measures to anticipate and respond to the crisis,\u201d explains Jocelyn Lance. \u201cHowever, due to the magnitude of expected impacts, additional emergency measures are being planned \u2013 short- term food assistance, livelihood recovery, and access to safe water.\u201d In addition to supporting disaster-risk-reduction projects around the world, DG ECHO\u2019s field experts are working with the EU Delegations and EU Member States to coordinate preparedness and response. \u201cThis year\u2019s El Ni\u00f1o will test national risk-management systems,\u201d Lance concludes. \u201cA lthough it is the strongest ever recorded, let\u2019s hope its impacts will be less severe than expected, so that we\u2019ll be able to say that El Ni\u00f1o is in the process of being adopted.\u201d (cid:2) Twitter (cid:2) @ECHO_LatAm DG ECHO \u2013 Latin America and Caribbean (cid:2) http://europa.eu/!uD33wt DIPECHO (cid:2) http://bit.ly/1lifVsy Solidarit\u00e9s International (cid:2) www.solidarites.org/en/ ",
        "22 The EUROPA website may be turning 20 but it still continues to evolve, reflecting the changing landscape of today's digital world. I n the 20 years since the EUROPA site was first launched, Europe has undergone a digital revolu- tion. In 1995, less than 6% of EU citizens used the Inter- net to gather information. Only 35 million computers worldwide were Internet-connected. Google did not exist. Mobile phones were in an experimental phase. Yet the Commission recognised the potential of this new technology and chose 1995 to launch the EUROPA web presence \u2013 making it one of the first international organisations with a website. EUROPA at that time reflected the newness of the In- ternet, as well as its limitations \u2013 multilingualism was an issue, as was an understanding of the difference between the ebb and flow of information on line in comparison with traditional media. Today, the Internet has taken on a significance unimaginable to those pioneers of two decades ago. The world now has more active mobile phone subscriptions than people. There are 3.1 billion Internet users and 1.9 billion of them are actively using social media on their mobile phones. In the EU, 78% of the population is on line. Internet still growing as media source Of the media sources that people in the EU are using to get information about the EU, only the Internet is growing \u2013 all others, like television (48%), the press (26%), and radio (17%) are losing market share. The Internet (33%) still comes in at second place, but is gaining steadily on television (see graph on page 24). The remarkable growth of the Internet has been reflected in the growth of EUROPA itself. After the initial launch, the number of Commission websites mushroomed, replicating the organisational structure of the Institution, down to the level of a particular DG, service or even unit. This pattern of growth continued unabated for several years, giving rise to websites with- out a shared identity and a mass of content that was constantly growing but not always coherent, resulting in duplication and maintenance issues. The Commission received a wake-up call with the rejection of the Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe in 2005 \u2013 an important political event \u2013 which led to a fundamental re-think of the way the Commission communicated. During the debate on the Constitution, the Commission had carried out its campaign mainly in the traditional media, whereas the \u2018No\u2019 supporters were very active on the Internet. On the strength of this knowledge, the collaborative aspects of EUROPA were developed to ensure more interactivity with partners and EU citizens. Towards a more polished, harmonised web presence By 2010, the Commission website was becoming more polished. Visual identity was being harmonised, and more content was translated into more languages. Re- gional news was available in local languages, thanks in particular to the efforts of Commission Representa- tions in EU countries. Nonetheless, problems remained during these teenage years. The cost of maintaining an ever-expanding collection of websites continued to grow. Over the past 20 years the number of websites has increased beyond 400 and the number of web pages to more than 3 million, with over 400 million visits a year. Yet while the EUROPA website provides a wealth of information to citizens, it has not always been easy for users to easily find the information they want. A drastic revamp of the Commission's on-line presence was needed, to make it relevant, coherent, and cost-effective. Since 2013, EUROPA has been un- dergoing a metamorphosis (see Dossier on Digital communication, CEND #13), thanks to the work of OUR STORIES EUROPA TURNS 20 A WEBSITE IN CONSTANT EVOLUTION by Valentin Delanghe and Thomas Rowe, DG COMM ",

Working with all DGs, the Digital Transformation Team has developed the new thematic structure of the future Commission web presence that is showcased in the test version of the site. Split into two distinct but closely interlinked parts, the new Commission site will have a future-ori- ented political part, communicating the Commission\u2019s vision and priorities and highlighting its position as a political Institution, and a factual, user-centred infor- mation part, providing people with the information and services they need regarding legislation, funding, and the implementation of policies. Niels J\u00f8rgen Th\u00f8gersen Director of Communications at the Commission (September 1988-February 2005) How was EUROPA created, and who came up with the name? We were to host a G7 conference in February 1995 on the information society and the Americans were going to present something called the Internet. I was told to do a similar thing for us. A small, dynamic task force was immediately created \u2013 and without our IT colleagues we could never have succeeded. I put forward the idea to call it EUROPA. What else? It is all about Europe, isn\u2019t it? Making access to information about Europe easy, fast, and free. How did the project go? It\u2019s one thing to make an impressive first presentation, another to run a convincing and useful hands-on service. At the start of the public Internet, the most visited site had 200,000 visits a month. My team and I took that as a special challenge and decided that we would beat them. We did so only one month later. And EUROPA has done so ever since. What challenges will EUROPA face in the future? The challenge for EUROPA is to adapt sufficiently quickly to the expectations of the very Internet- minded citizens combined with all the almost daily improvement of how the Internet works \u2013 and to make the political masters understand that there is not much point in having the best policy in the world if they cannot communicate about it efficiently and in a way that people feel involved and listened to. EUROPA is the answer to that need \u2013 if it is handled and supported sufficiently. Sixtine Bouygues Director for Strategy and Corporate Communication, DG COMM What was the impetus behind the digital transformation programme? On becoming responsible for EUROPA, the issue was apparent \u2013 the 20-year-old website needed to be reimagined. A solution was needed. I consulted my counterparts in Member States and saw that all public services have the same challenges. I went to France, the UK, Germany, the Netherlands. I took on best practices and came back with a proposal for change \u2013 first clean up the outdated content and then radically change the organisation of Europa to a more user-centric structure, leaving behind the former DG-based structure. Where are we now? Since 2013, a cross-DG team of DGs COMM, DIGIT and DGT has been working, together with all DGs, to build the Commission\u2019s new web presence. Together, we\u2019ve defined a new common information architecture that will make our web presence relevant and will ensure the coherence of the content in a cost-effective way. A test version of this site has been available since July within the Commission (see link at the end of the article). Work has started on five of the 15 themes on the new website, in intensive collaboration with all DGs, across silos. What are the next steps? Early next year we will make public the test version \u2013 the beta \u2013 of the site. This important step allows us to test our concept with real citizens. Once we have been able to measure the performance of the test site and collect sufficient feedback, it will gradually replace the Commission's web presence. By 2018, we should be able to replace the current silo-structure with the new thematic website. ",
        "24 Taking a user-centred, thematic approach The information part will deliver a user-centred solu- tion that serves both the Commission\u2019s communication needs and the needs of the people who interact with the Commission. A new information architecture and the user-centred method will enable visitors to find what they need easier and faster. This approach also includes a paradigm shift for the Commission, a departure from presenting content with a silo mentality, DG by DG, to a thematic way of working. In-depth research into the reasons why peo- ple interact with the Commission has revealed the six top reasons why people visit our websites and ranked 71 others in order of importance. Based on this research, and on a thorough collaborative process with the DGs, all content will be published according to one or more of 15 themes (see CEND #15, page 46-47). The consequence of this new, thematic organisation is that DGs will have to work together, across the silos, on the content. At the same time, a central web team bringing together DGs COMM, DIGIT and DGT will provide services for information architecture, content strategy, design, software development, translation, and hosting. It\u2019s hard to predict where the Internet will take us over the next 20 years. But whatever direction we end up taking, with this update, the Commission will be in a stronger position to keep up with this ever-changing world and to speak to EU citizens in a language they understand.

Stan van Alphen: The Monitor is an annual report on the state of play in education and training across the EU, now in its fourth year. It is DG EAC\u2019s flagship publi- cation, divided into two halves \u2013 a pan-European report and a detailed analysis of each Member State, running to around 8-10 pages per country. It brings together re- search, data and information on policy developments, based on a wide variety of sources, including national education ministries, EUROSTAT, the OECD, the Joint Research Centre, and our own Executive Agency, EACEA. It takes us about nine or ten months to gather all the information, to analyse it, and to produce the report. Who are the target audiences? S.v.A.: Primarily those who are working in the educa- tion policy field, at national and European levels. The main audience is national education Ministries, who use the Monitor not only to share their own experi- ences with their peers but also to learn from them, to see what works well in other countries, and to enrich their own national debate about education policies. The Monitor is widely used by policymakers, especially in today\u2019s climate of having to achieve more with less. Strengthening the evidence-base is one thing, but the link between this ever-growing amount of evidence and actual policy-making is another challenge. That\u2019s where the Monitor can be a source of inspiration. What are the main messages from this year\u2019s Monitor? S.v.A.: While offering a comprehensive annual snap- shot of the state of play in education and training in each EU Member State, we also try to focus on a particular theme, based on the data. This year we fo- cused in particular on educational poverty \u2013 the share of young people failing to reach minimum standards in education. What the data shows is that, although education should level the playing field for all, peo- ple\u2019s socio-economic and immigration background still plays a determining role. For example, no EU Mem- ber State has managed to bring underachievement amongst 15 year-olds with low socio-economic status below 15%, and in several countries, over half of those with low socio-economic status are unable to solve very basic maths problems. The share of early school leavers across the EU stands at 11.1%, and this is also influenced strongly by students' parental background. The state of play in education and training across the EU is assessed each year in the Education and Training Monitor produced by DG EAC. Commission en direct spoke to Stan van Alphen and Marco Montanari from the team behind the Monitor about how they create it and how it is used. EDUCATION AND TRAINING MONITOR INSIGHTS INTO INCLUSION by Chris Jones and Nilde Marchitto, CEND \u00a9 E U (cid:2) Stan van Alphen, le(cid:4) , with the latest issue of the Education and Training Monitor, and Marco Montanari, DG EAC. ",
        "26 The report also shows that around 60% of early school leavers are subsequently either inactive or unemployed, making it clear that educational poverty has serious long-term repercussions. Another insight from the Monitor is how migrants fare in European education systems. We found that if children from migrant families begin their compulsory education in their new country, they perform just as well as native-born children, but older migrant children who start studying in their own country and then have to join the education system of their new home find it far harder \u2013 in fact, the rate of early school leaving among these migrant students reaches EU averages of 28%. What are the highlights from the national level? Marco Montanari: There are many interesting stories from across the Member States. For example, Sweden is making efforts to integrate migrant students \u2013 which is important, given that it was the second largest recipi- ent of asylum seekers in the EU in 2014. Around 18% of the 81,000 asylum seekers in Sweden in 2014 were school-age children, and a further 55,000 school-age children are expected by 2018. This is one of the rea- sons why Sweden will introduce new laws in 2016 to further improve the integration of these children into the Swedish education system, setting out how their level of education will be tested to ensure that they are placed in the right class, for example. One of the success stories from France is its Digital University initiative for higher education \u2013 a five-year strategy designed to use digital technologies to improve access to education and lifelong learning, encourage new ways of teaching, improve education infrastruc- ture, and boost the French higher education system\u2019s competitiveness. Italy has also carried out a major school reform, and the Polish government is invest- ing heavily in improving early childhood education and care. Does the Commission offer any advice or recommendations? M.M.: The Commission has no regulatory powers in the field of education, of course, so we cannot really give advice or recommendations. But what we can do is highlight \u2018policy levers\u2019 that we believe could help improve the inclusiveness of Europe\u2019s education and training systems and tackle educational poverty. S.v.A.: First, we see that good early childhood education and care can help reduce the impact of socio-economic status on subsequent education achievement. Second, it\u2019s clear that teachers have a strong role to play in inclusive education, and that their training can be im- proved in key areas such as special education needs, multicultural environments and in specific issues of educational poverty like underachievement in basic skills and risk factors associated with early school leav- ing. Third, the education and training system needs to allow for more flexible transitions, between levels of education, between vocational and general education, or between the labour market and adult learning. Inclu- sive education is about fair chances, which sometimes means second chances.

COMMITTEE OF THE REGIONS ON(cid:5)LINE COURSE ON REGIONS AND EU POLICY(cid:5)MAKING by Ji\u0159\u00ed Buri\u00e1nek, SECRETARY(cid:2)GENERAL, COMMITTEE OF THE REGIONS A lthough the extent to which local civil servants are involved in European affairs differs from one Member State to another depending on its level of decentralisation, many will find themselves working on European programmes at some time or another. From implementing European Structural and Investment Funds to making sure local authorities comply with EU environmental and public procurement legislation and the provision of services of general public interest, a knowledge of EU rules and procedures is vital. Filling a knowledge gap The Committee of the Regions, as the EU\u2019s assembly of regional and local representatives, clearly has a role to play in helping to build this EU administrative capacity. It seeks to involve regional and local authorities in the European decision-making process and it is doing its utmost to \u2018reconnect Europe with its citizens\u2019. The ever- growing number of participants in events organised by the Committee, such as the annual European Week of Regions and Cities (OPEN DAYS), and the wide variety of training courses offered by public and private institu- tions clearly show that there is a growing interest and demand for information about EU affairs. At the same time, the rapid technological develop- ment of on-line communication tools and the rise of social media have made communication more cost- effective and enabled information to be shared by many more people and at any time. This is why the Committee of the Regions decided at the end of 2014 to organise a Massive Open Online Course (MOOC) as part of its 2015 communication plan \u2013 the first EU Institution to take such an initiative. The MOOC not only enhances the Committee\u2019s role as a partner of and \u00a9 A l l r i g h t s r e s e r v e d (cid:2) Markku Markkula, President of the Committee of the Regions, Professor Michel Huysseune, Vrije Universiteit Brussel, and Hella Dunger-L\u00f6per, State Secretary and Representative of the Land of Berlin to the German Federal Government and Committee Member, discussing the challenges and future of European regions and cities with moderator Katie Owens (centre) as part of the on-line course's preparation.

Survey confirms interest in on-line course The results of an on-line survey conducted by the Com- mittee of the Regions in April 2015 confirmed that there was interest for a MOOC on \u2018regions, EU and policy-making\u2019, including from people who had no or only limited experience of e-learning. Based on the survey, and with the aim of helping to improve the EU awareness of regional and local officials, the course chapters were designed to focus on eight key topics \u2013 EU Institutions and legislation, the role of regions and cities in EU affairs, EU Cohesion Policy and Structural and Investment Funds, research and innovation and the role of regions and cities, the environment, cli- mate change and sustainable development policies, free movement and migration, EU competition policies and state aid, and the EU budget, programmes and projects. The eight-week course \u2013 available since October 2015 on the iversity.org e-learning platform \u2013 builds on learn- ing aids such as video lectures and expert interviews, fact sheets, infographics, live debates with experts from the European Commission with integrated \u2018Q&A-sessions\u2019 web-streamed from the Committee, and written resourc- es and web-links to more topical in-depth information. A weekly quiz helps students to check on their learning progress. The course content has been produced together with more than 50 experts, including European and local politicians, as well as experts from EU Institutions and academia. We could not have created the course without them \u2013 and without the support of our colleagues from DG REGIO in particular. Live debate and a discussion forum There are over 7,500 people registered from more than 80 countries to take part in the MOOC. The majority of followers have a background in public administration, and there are significant numbers of followers from a university background (both teachers and students) and from NGOs. The participation rates vary between 15% and 25% of the total number enrolled, differing from one study unit to another. Lively on-line discussion on the various course topics takes place between students via an integrated discussion forum, and the live debate study unit \u2013 which offers students the possibility to ask questions of the experts and receive immediate feed- back \u2013 is a popular addition to traditional e-learning formats, increasing interactivity between the course followers and experts both on the learning platform and via the livestream chat in real time. The discussion forum itself is an open window for the Committee to learn more about the concerns and interests of a sub- stantial audience of curious and open-minded citizens. Next steps So far, feedback from the course followers is encourag- ing. The course will end in mid-December 2015, after which we will evaluate its success and use the findings to help us decide how to progress with this innovative communication project in the future. For the time be- ing, the options are open \u2013 the course may be revised or replaced with a more in-depth course developed in cooperation with external partners, potentially in more than one language. One thing is clear \u2013 we can already say that it was certainly worth investing in this project. As Secretary- General of the Committee of the Regions, I have given my full backing to this open and innovative approach to information-sharing and support for local and re- gional authorities, who are our key partners in making Europe \u2018more local\u2019.

The innovative EU pavilion proved one of the most popular \u2013 and the message about the need for greater food security was clearly understood. E xpo Milano was a great success. Focusing on the vital subject of food security and the best way to sustainably feed the entire planet, it attracted more than 60 heads of state, including Chancellor Angela Merkel, President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, and Prime Min- isters David Cameron and Mariano Rajoy. It also led to more than one million people signing the Charter of Milan, a plea for universal access to food and water that Italy\u2019s President Sergio Mattarella handed to the UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon at Expo during World Food Day on 16 October. Expo Milano was also a very successful experience for the EU. The figures speak for themselves \u2013 more than 650,000 people visited the EU pavilion staffed by 840 European volunteers (mostly from the Erasmus net- work). Over 30,000 experts took part in the 230 events organised by a variety of DGs (AGRI, DEVCO, SANTE, RTD, GROW, MARE, JRC, etc.) around the themes of nutrition and food security. 40 senior figures (heads of state or government and ministers) visited the EU pavilion, as did 13 Commissioners, including three Vice-Presidents, and some100 MEPs. But the numbers are only part of the story. The EU team, led by DG JRC, also set itself three objectives for the Expo (see Dossier, CEND #20) \u2013 to foster corporate communication with an innovative approach, to set a new standard for policy-making related to food security, and to contribute to the Agenda for Growth and Jobs \u2013 all of which were achieved. An innovative story-telling approach The EU pavilion\u2019s innovative story-telling approach (see CEND #20, pages 40-41) was meant to appeal particu- larly to schools, families and young people, and they were among the most frequent visitors. In particular, the animated short film in 4D, \u2018The Golden Ear\u2019, real- ly resonated with visitors \u2013 90% of the 2,800 people questioned during their visit expressed \u2018high approval\u2019 of the pavilion, and 61% said the visit had made them view the EU more positively. The physical recreation of Sylvia\u2019s Lab from the film at the JRC visitors centre in Ispra (60 km from the Expo) also proved popular, with more than 5,000 people visiting over the six months. Expo Milano was more than just a communication exercise for the EU, however. It was also a platform for political debate, with a strong emphasis on science, research and innovation, all key elements in solving the important food security challenge, the Expo's theme. ",
        "30 The EU had its own scientific programme for Expo (see CEND #20, pages 36-37) and presented four draft recommendations on research and innovation in global food and nutrition security, chief of which was the es- tablishment of an International Panel for Food Security, to improve policy and science interaction in food and nutrition security building on the experience of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. Boosting Europe\u2019s small and medium-sized enter- prises (SMEs) in the food industry was the third objec- tive of the EU\u2019s presence at Expo. This was achieved through arranging more than 3,000 meetings between European SMEs and 1,800 companies from around the The Expo experience \u2013 Grabbing \u2018community building\u2019 by the horns by Marco Ricorda, JRC \"This Expo is for those who take it... it's up to you what you make of it.\" This is what I remember most from my conversations with the other communication managers taking part in this year\u2019s Expo Milano \u2013 an unprecedented event which I believe truly changed Italy. And in terms of EU digital communication, I think we really did make the most of it. The EU had the most engaging social media presence in the whole Expo, and, for me, it clearly shows that it is possible to make Europe appealing if we humanise our communication and target \u2018real citizens\u2019. This is how we tried to do just that. The fi rst thing we did to change the communication mind-set was to get some new running shoes. Yes, for real. Eff ective community management can no longer be done sitting in front of your computer. The more we digitalise our relations, the more human relations matter in community building. So, I needed to get out, to meet people, and to talk to communication professionals from all over the world, in order to seize the historic moment of the fi rst real social-media World Expo. Second, we explored how people around the world did communication \u2013 and it turns out that it\u2019s not all about likes, retweets and followers but actually about making real human connections with those infl uencers, stakeholders and participants that can make your message travel further. A cup of coff ee is far stronger than a retweet when developing communication networks. (For the record, the EU did pretty well when it came to the fi gures, too \u2013 our Facebook page had 51,500 followers, the Twitter account more than 18,000, Instagram over 5,000, while the website had more than 250,000 visitors). Third, we focused on communicating Europe to citizens. \"You're crazy if you want to do this at a World Expo , \" I was told \u2013 but thousands of social media users clearly disagreed. Expo brought the world to Milan and we brought Europe to the world with a simple message \u2013 'We are stronger together'. We did it by merging digital communication and personal connections. Could this be the way ahead, the way to most eff ectively bridge the gap between citizens and policymakers? The time is ripe and we certainly have the tools \u2013 and the experience \u2013 to do it. So why not call me for a coff ee and we\u2019ll talk about it? world (the Mediterranean area and Turkey, Latin Ameri- ca, China, Japan, sub-Saharan Africa, the US, and South East Asia). Expo Milano may only just be over, but we are al- ready looking in depth at a number of aspects of the EU\u2019s participation, so as to learn more about the poten- tial benefits of taking part in such major events in the future. But for now, it is time for us all to get back to our day jobs, taking with us the many happy memories and lessons learned at Expo. Our thanks to all the peo- ple from the many DGs involved for making the EU\u2019s participation in Expo Milano such a success through their hard work and commitment. Bravi tutti!

C ommission staff donated over \u20ac120,000 to the Red Cross for humanitarian aid through two fund-raising appeals that ran simultaneously for three weeks from mid-September this year. The first appeal was coordinated by DG HR and Give Eur-Hope, an in-house staff charity and raised over \u20ac100,000. The second fund- raiser, run by the OIB, and based on staff contributing in Commission restaurants and cafeterias, raised nearly \u20ac22,000. Both were strongly supported by Vice-President Kristalina Georgieva. Of the \u20ac122,000 raised by the first two appeals, \u20ac50,000 has been used in Greece, where many migrants first set foot on European soil. Over 250 Red Cross vol- unteers and staff have been providing migrants with hygiene materials, thermal blankets, first aid, and basic health care. Hellenic Red Cross volunteers continue to rescue people that arrive on the shores of Lesvos, Kos and other islands, offering essential items such as food and water. A further \u20ac30,000 has been used in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, a transit country for thousands of migrants each day. There has been a sharp increase in the number of families entering the country recently, with women accounting for 40% of those crossing the border and children a further 10%. With around 200 staff and volunteers, the Red Cross has been assisting with food, water, hygiene kits, infant supplies, medicines, blankets, shelter and first aid. Nine mobile health teams are pro- viding assistance 24 hours a day, seven days a week at the northern and southern borders. A further \u20ac20,000 have been donated to help the response in Serbia, where over 260 trained volunteers and staff support 5,000 migrants arriving each day, pro- viding food, raincoats, and first aid. The Red Cross bakery in Bujanovac is working hard each day to provide fresh bread to people as they arrive at the Serbian border. The final \u20ac22,000 has been used in Belgium to provide emer- gency shelter and immediate humanitarian assistance to migrants. At the request of the Belgian government, the Belgian Red Cross has opened emergency accommoda- tion for migrants while they wait for their asylum claims to be processed. It has also opened a further 2,000 places in its reception centres. Additional first aid is also being offered to migrants, while the money has also been used to reinforce the Red Cross\u2019 existing work helping home- less people on the streets of Brussels, whose numbers have grown with the arrival of migrants. In all four countries, the Red Cross also provides a tracing service, as families often become separated on the journey and are desperate for news on the fate of their loved ones. Since the first two appeals ended, Give Eur-Hope has collected a further \u20ac30,000 from staff, which will also be donated to the Red Cross.

        "34 DOSSIER As the European Year for Development 2015 (EYD2015) draws to a close, Neven Mimica, Commissioner for International Cooperation and Development, and Karmenu Vella, Commissioner for Environment, Maritime Affairs and Fisheries, tell Commission en direct about what the achievement of a global agreement on the new UN Sustainable Development Goals means for their respective EU policy areas. MOVING FROM DEVELOPMENT TO SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT by Stacey Vickers, DG DEVCO, and Zach Hester, CEND Why has 2015 been such an important year for development? Neven Mimica: It was always going to be an unprece- dented year for development, with the Millennium Development Goals (see page 36) coming to an end, and the Sustainable Development Goals (see page 37) being put into place. During the UN Summit in September, the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development was adopted, setting the course for international cooperation and development up to 2030. Together with the other two key events in development this year \u2013 the Financing for Development Summit in Addis Ababa and the Climate Change Conference in Paris \u2013 this really has made 2015 a landmark year, and I am proud to say the EU has played a crucial role. However, development has now taken on even more significance than we would have imagined in 2015, with the refugee crisis and its images of migrants and refugees putting their lives at risk to cross the Med- iterranean shocking people across the EU and beyond. Development cooperation has never been more rele- vant. It has a vital role to play in tackling the root causes of this migration \u2013 helping to improve stability and to create jobs and opportunities in the different regions of the world, particularly for young people. What have been your personal highlights of the European Year? And what will be its lasting legacy? N.M.: I have been particularly impressed by the involvement of young people (see page 40). An event we hosted with UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, in May, for example, brought together hundreds of young people from across the EU for a debate about development. Personally, I hope that the legacy of the EYD2015 will be that the partnerships set up over the course of the year are continued. It has been inspiring to see people from all walks of life \u2013 young people, academics, the general public, and businesses \u2013 coming together for a common cause and I hope that these networks will continue long after 2015. How important an achievement was it to reach global agreement on the new UN Agenda for Sustainable Development and what are the implications for the EU\u2019s development policy? N.M.: Put simply, I believe that the 2030 Agenda, with the Sustainable Development Goals at its core, is a game-changer. Never has the international community had the potential to make such a difference through its work. The Millennium Development Goals have delivered great results. For example, the target to halve extreme poverty has been met well ahead of schedule. However, progress has been unequal around the world. That is why the new set of Sustainable Development Goals will need to go further, and include social, economic, and environmental targets. The outcome document adopted in New York this September shows that the international community is committed to working together to address the challeng- es we face and ensure a better future for people and the planet. Crucially, this new agreement is universal. It ap- plies to all countries. We all share ownership of it and we all share responsibility for its implementation. ",
        "# D \u00e9 c e m b r e 2 0 1 5 - J a n v i e r 2 0 1 6 35 What role does the environment play? Karmenu Vella: The concept of sustainability is based on three interconnected environmental, economic, and social pillars. The Sustainable Development Goals represent the environmental right to clean water, the social right to be educated, and the economic right to be lifted out of poverty. Our challenge is to ensure this conceptual connec- tion becomes policy action. Three ways we can do this from the environmental perspective are through na- ture protection, the circular economy, and an ocean policy. What does this mean in practical terms? K.V.: Sometimes the best way to protect ourselves from climate change is through protecting or restoring eco- systems. As I have said many times, we need nature, but nature does not need us. Ecosystems and natural resources are a natural defense. With large population centres under an ev- er-increasing risk of flooding, nature can be deployed with remarkable effect. Using nature to protect popula- tions from rising sea levels or storms is generally more cost-effective and more sustainable than vast artificial barriers. On the circular economy, we can contribute towards the 12th Sustainable Development Goal by promoting sustainable consumption and production. We can create push factors, so we recycle more. We can also use Europe\u2019s innovative talents to better design products in the future. The Commission is actively moving towards a more cir- cular economy, where the usual \u2018take, make and dispose\u2019 is replaced by \u2018reduce, re-use, and recycle\u2019. A third area where we can ensure that connec- tion is through better management of our oceans. The 14th Sustainable Development Goal states that we should conserve and sustainably use the oceans, seas, and marine resources. I am delighted that there is growing recognition of the role the oceans plays not just in a healthy environment, but also as a source of real sustainable economic growth. How are you planning to address these challenges? K.V.: We are now closing this European Year with the adoption by the College of our Circular Economy pack- age. We are also looking at how to improve ocean gov- ernance in the EU \u2013 starting with an initiative in the spring \u2013 and globally to ensure the sustainable man- agement of our common resources. And we will be undertaking a thorough review of EU nature legislation to ensure that we continue to make the progress that is so fundamentally needed.

        "38 DOSSIER What are the Year\u2019s main success stories? D\u00f6rte Bosse and Annie Martinez Alonso: One main suc- cess story has undoubtedly been the multi- stakeholder approach to our communication campaign. Many Commission DGs were involved, in particular COMM, DGT, ECHO, CLIMA, MARE, RTD, HOME, JUST, and EAC, as well as the EEAS and all other EU Institutions, EU Delegations, Member States, NGOs, academia, and the private sector. J\u00f6rel Str\u00f6mgren: The collaboration between all our part- ners on the EYD2015 website is another success story. We\u2019ve worked hard with the Delegations and other DGs to create really interesting content, but the bulk of it still comes from Member States, civil society, UN organisations, and other EU Institutions. As everyone communicates from their own angle, this makes the website as multifaceted as our community. Stina Soewarta and Stacey Vickers: The highlight was the social media \u2018takeover\u2019 we\u2019ve been running \u2013 giving total control of our EYD Facebook and Twitter accounts to a different partner every week. This was a fresh and innovative approach, which was not without its risks, but so far it\u2019s been a real success, with EU Institutions, NGOs, the private sector, Member States, youth groups and international organisations all taking the reins. In fact, we received far more requests to take part than we have had places available! What was new about the way you communicated? A.M.A.: One new thing was that we were not the only ones to communicate! We agreed on the tools, chan- nels and information \u2013 an educational toolkit, stories of the week, campaign material, website, co-curated The Communication and Transparency Unit in DG DEVCO has pioneered a number of new communication techniques during the European Year for Development 2015 (EYD2015). Head of Unit Stina Soewarta and her team share some of them with Commission en direct . EYD 2015 AN INNOVATIVE APPROACH TO COMMUNICATION by Chris Jones, CEND Facebook and Twitter accounts \u2013 in 23 EU languages thanks to the support of DGT, which were then used by all stakeholders. D.B.: This approach was crucially enshrined in the legal text on which the designation of the European Year was based, which meant we had the full support of Member States and the European Parliament from the outset. As such, they and other key partners really felt part of the Year and took ownership of it, tailoring it to their own needs to help them reach out to citizens at their level. They did this in many different ways \u2013 Belgium recently issued an EYD2015 \u20ac2 coin, for example, while Spain produced edible EYD2015 paper for a discussion on food security, and Slovenia produced special EYD2015 milk cartons. S.S.: Using storytelling was also a real success, helping to bring our development projects to life. The Stories of the Week (see pages 41-45) from our Delegations were Posts Events Stories EYD2015 website contributions since 1 January 2015, in 23 languages By the European Union By partners ",

S.V.: We\u2019ve also built alliances and partnerships with international organisations which I hope will continue long after this year has ended. The UN\u2019s Regional Infor- mation Centre (UNRIC), for example, has been a crucial partner in helping us to get a broad range of UN agencies involved in the year (co-curating social media, running conferences at our Infopoint, organising events, etc.) We\u2019ve also built alliances with more non-traditional development partners such as the private sector (pro- ducing a special EYD development publication with Ernst & Young for all their employees around the world, for example). A.M.A.: And Didier Drogba, Emma Watson and J.K. Rowl- ing all became EYD2015 faces in some shape or form, which was great for the Year\u2019s outreach and visibility! How did you manage to reach young people? A.M.A.: We always knew we wanted to reach young peo- ple (15-24), but simply talking to them was not enough, we needed to talk with them as well, to engage. S.V.: One highlight was a joint EU-UN event with Ban Ki-moon in May, which brought hundreds of young people together to talk about their vision of the future of development (see page 40). At the end of the event, a giant \u2018selfie\u2019 was taken with the UN Secretary-General and our hashtag #AskBanKimoon was the ninth most \u2018trended\u2019 on Twitter that day! Were you able to increase awareness of EU development cooperation in Europe? D.B.: Our aim was always to make a campaign with a dif- ference. We tried to avoid the usual silo-led institutional approach and communicated instead on how today\u2019s complex challenges in a globalised, interconnected world can have a direct impact on our daily lives. So our campaign also talked about issues such as migration, humanitarian aid, the new Sustainable Development Goals and the Climate Change Conference in Paris. This helped increase awareness not just of EU development cooperation in Europe but beyond. A.M.A.: We tried to reach out beyond the usual suspects. The migration and Ebola crises highlighted the need for better communication on global issues affecting Europe and the world. What will the Year\u2019s legacy be? Will your experience help with communicating the new Sustainable Development Goals? J.S.: The EYD campaign has allowed all involved to try new methods of communication and measure the impact. The networks and partnerships that we have created are probably the finest legacy of the year, along with the new approach of partners all communicating together and individually on the same key issues. A.M.A.: We hope that the lessons learned and established networks will help the Commission and partners shape communication around the Sustainable Development Goals and related initiatives. Like the EYD2015, these new goals will be a huge challenge from both a com- munication and a policy point of view, and are likely to need a similar multi-stakeholder approach with com- mon goals and a common agenda. S.V.: It would be great to see other communication colleagues building on our experience. I hope that ideas like storytelling or co-curation on social media will be used by other DGs.

        "40 U N Youth Envoy Ahmad Alhendawi, who has been active throughout the EYD2015, summed up nicely the importance of youth involvement. \"Young people know how to teach us to think of a better future and to hold their governments accountable.\" A Eurobarometer survey (Special Eurobarometer 421) carried out at the start of the year found that young peo- ple are generally more positive about development, yet they feel they should be involved more. To be effective in engaging young people, a youth focus was planned throughout all our activities and by creating space for youth involvement. How we communicated was important \u2013 boring or bureaucratic communication was out! Instead, we told human stories, produced materials accessible to a young audience, and organised activities that resonated with young people. Many of our stories showed how young people\u2019s lives can be transformed through our cooperation. Like Elvina, a young lady from rural Pakistan, who set up a successful Internet business, or how African youth are producing radio documentaries to draw attention to important social issues. It was very important to show how we are all different, and yet alike, all over the world. A special educational toolkit A special educational toolkit \u2013 including a handbook for educators, a celebrity booklet, quizzes and lesson plans \u2013 was produced. Now part of the Czech Republic\u2019s curriculum, it has also been distributed to all Finnish secondary schools. Young people are more likely to go to the Internet for information, so we concentrated a lot of our ef- forts on line. Our website and social media platforms encouraged a diversity of young voices, with many on-line competitions for young people. A first of its kind, takeover of our social media channels by five girls from five developing countries reached over 2 million people. Over 800 official EYD2015 events have been organ- ised throughout Europe, reaching many thousands of young people. A \u2018Kapuscinski Development Lecture\u2019, an initiative of the Commission, UNDP and leading European universities, was organised in each EU Mem- ber State, gathered over 6,000 participants. A group of young leaders even got the chance to debate the role of youth with the UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon in BOZAR, Brussels. Web-streamed and live on Twitter, the event reached over 10 million people. At the European Development Days in June, the \u2018Future Leaders\u2019 programme brought 14 young lead- ers to give their views on the world\u2019s future, with a wide-ranging debate with EU foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini, and Sam Kutesa, President of the 69th UN General Assembly. Finishing the Year on a high note, DG DEVCO is preparing the flagship \u2018Youth for Development\u2019 initia- tive. The initiative should provide opportunities for young people to gain valuable work experience in EU development projects around the world, as a lasting legacy of the EYD2015.

        "42 A s a forester, Pham Hong Luong has always understood the importance of protecting the environment and forests in particular. Now, 20 years after he first started to work in Vietnam\u2019s forests, he works for the Vietnamese government overseeing an innovative national programme called \u2018Payments for Forest Ecosystem Services\u2019 (PFES) that helps do just that. Forests play a crucial role in preventing soil ero- sion, maintaining the water cycle, and fighting climate change. They also provide timber, food and fuel for poor rural communities. Since 2010, PFES has recog- nised the value of forests by requiring those who rely on forest environmental services \u2013 water supply com- panies, hydropower plants and tourism operators \u2013 to make payments to the communities and individuals that own and look after the forest. Each year, the pro- gramme collects around US$ 60 million, 75% of which is distributed to forest owners. In exchange, they must not cut down any trees. The programme has raised many questions. How much do you charge? If you have a fixed rate of pay- ment, what happens when there\u2019s inflation? Which areas count as forest? Who counts as a forest owner? What about people who have customary rights to land but no legal title? Are the payments enough to ensure people do not clear the forests? An EU-funded project by the Centre for Interna- tional Forestry Research (CIFOR) is helping answer some of these questions \u2013 particularly those related to With support from the EU, Vietnam is the first country in Asia to launch a nationwide programme giving incentives to forest owners not to chop down trees. \u00a9 F o t o l i a how the benefits of schemes like PFES are distributed, and how they are perceived by the local people who receive them. CIFOR research in Vietnam and five other tropical countries (Indonesia, Peru, Brazil, Cameroon, and Tanzania) examines and analyses benefit-sharing mechanisms like PFES, and offers advice for policy- makers on how to design their systems in the most efficient, effective and fairest way possible. Vietnam\u2019s experience also offers important lessons for other global programmes that are seeking fair ways to share benefits among rural people \u2013 such as REDD+ (Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation), which aims to tackle climate change by reducing carbon emissions from deforestation. For example, to make incentives more effective, CIFOR is exploring ways to structure PFES payments based on local preferences and combine them with other sources of revenue. That could make the payments substantial enough to ensure people do not lose out if they stop clearing trees to plant crops. \u201cIf the benefit- sharing mechanism is adjusted, villagers will get more money to ensure their livelihoods, which helps them to protect our forests,\u201d says Pham Hong Luong. \u201cThat is a sustainable way to ensure we keep our forests into the future.\u201d (cid:2) EU Delegation to Vietnam (cid:2) http://europa.eu/!Hr39Wb Centre for International Forestry Research (CIFOR) (cid:2) www.cifor.org/ VIETNAM (cid:5) PROTECTING FORESTS FOR A SUSTAINABLE FUTURE by the EU Delegation to Vietnam ",

It feels like the Amazon rainforest \u2013 muddy water, dense wood- land and an atmosphere laden with humidity \u2013 the perfect conditions for the Scylla Serrata, or \u2018mangrove crab\u2019, to thrive. And thrive it does \u2013 so much so, in fact, that a burgeon- ing crab-fishing industry has developed in recent years as catches have increased. Madagascar has 325,000 hectares of this type of ecosystem, which accounts for a potential fishing yield of 7,500 tonnes of crab, much of which is still largely under-exploited. Developing this resource diversifies fishing and contributes to the food security of Madagascar\u2019s entire population. Crabs are one of the most sought-after products on the international market and have the potential to gen- erate significant and sustainable revenues for Madagas- car\u2019s coastal communities. Asian markets have a prefer- ence for larger species of live crab, which fetch around twice as much per kilo as frozen crab, which is mainly exported to Europe. But keeping the crabs alive long enough to satisfy this demand is a real challenge for the fishermen. This is why Julienne is working with them to develop innovative, but inexpensive, methods of im- proving storage and transport conditions, which help to dramatically reduce the mortality rate of crabs. Julienne lives in one of the pilot villages of four regions chosen by the regional SmartFish programme run by the Indian Ocean Commission and financed by the European Union. The initiative provides support at every stage in the chain of production. The aim is to keep the mangrove crab alive and intact from capture to market. Demand for mangrove crabs across Asia has helped boost the Madagascan economy \u2013 and EU support is helping to make the business sustainable. Julienne works with around 60 fishermen, and has pro- vided them with new traps to catch the bigger crabs without damaging them. She has also given them tanks to preserve their catch and has built two boats with shelv- ing for transporting the crabs to Mahajanga. And the investments have paid off. \"Just a year ago we lost almost half of our crab catch,\" says Julienne. With the new equip- ment for catching and preserving the crabs, the cost of the investments was recouped after the very first month. \"The new equipment has dramatically reduced our losses and is making a big difference to our lives,\" says Julienne.

Annalechchamy, jeune femme tamoul, pensait que les conditions qu\u2019avaient connu des g\u00e9n\u00e9rations de travailleurs ne changeraient jamais. Jusqu\u2019\u00e0 l'adoption de la loi sur l\u2019octroi de la citoyennet\u00e9 aux apatrides, en 2003, elle ne disposait d'aucun droit civique. Elle avait m\u00eame peur de s'adresser aux administrateurs du domaine et, a fortiori, de n\u00e9gocier ses droits. Mais les choses ont commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 changer. Annalechchamy a pu b\u00e9n\u00e9ficier de l'initiative \u00abY compris les exclus\u00bb (Including the Excluded) \u2013 financ\u00e9e par l\u2019UE et mise en \u0153uvre par CARE International \u2013 qui a pour mission d'am\u00e9liorer les conditions de vie des travailleurs dans les plantations de th\u00e9.

Devenue l'une des premi\u00e8res femmes dirigeantes syndicales de sa communaut\u00e9, elle remet en cause un mode de vie qui semblait immuable. Le Sri Lanka est mondialement connu pour la saveur de son \u00abth\u00e9 de Ceylan\u00bb. Les femmes qui travaillent dans les plantations de th\u00e9 sont particuli\u00e8rement expos\u00e9es \u00e0 la discrimination dans leur famille, leur communaut\u00e9 et sur leur lieu de travail. Les coutumes patriarcales cantonnent les femmes dans des r\u00f4les d\u00e9termin\u00e9s, des t\u00e2ches plus discr\u00e8tes et moins reconnues. Confin\u00e9es \u00e0 la cueillette, elles devaient travailler plus d'heures, dans des conditions climatiques souvent dif- ficiles. Des t\u00e9moignages indiquent \u00e9galement que la violence sexiste constitue un probl\u00e8me important dans les exploitations mais que les abus sont peu d\u00e9nonc\u00e9s car les normes sociales excusent souvent ce type de comportement. En outre, les femmes connaissent mal les moyens de recours et renoncent de ce fait \u00e0 demander de l\u2019aide.

        "46 Why do we need a talent management strategy? The Commission\u2019s responsibilities have grown with the adoption of the Lisbon Treaty, the economic crisis, the Juncker Commission\u2019s ten priorities, and as a result of new emerging challenges such as the refugee crisis and the evolving security context in Europe. At the same time, our resources are decreasing as a result of the 5% staff cut. In this context of increased pressure on our staff, we need to do more to exploit the wealth of talents we have at our disposal. The 2014 Staff Survey showed that our staff remain very engaged \u2013 72% are satisfied with working at the Commission and 95% are willing to put in the extra effort when needed. The talent management strategy \u2013 along with the fit@work programme (CEND #23, pages 48-52) and the new internal communication strategy currently in preparation \u2013 will help staff feel supported in their work and, ultimately, make them more effective and efficient at what they do. Our goal is to increase staff performance and staff engagement and, as a con- sequence, the performance of our organisation. What does the new approach involve? The Commission workforce must be knowledgeable, skilled, flexible, and we must work together in the interests of Europe. To achieve these goals, we have focused the new strategy on five pillars \u2013 improving managerial excellence, encouraging staff development, developing a collaborative corporate culture, improving staff performance, and clarifying career expectations. There will also be a greater emphasis on encouraging mobility across the Commission by making it a natural part of career development. Promoting diversity and inclusion will be another transversal effort supporting the strategy. So what concrete changes can we expect? There will be many. Managerial excellence is, of course, a top priority. We will achieve the target of 40% women in management by 2019, and we will also improve the way managers are recruited and make it easier for them to move between jobs. To help managers do their jobs more effectively, there will be a raft of new initiatives for training, mentoring and coaching, as well as 360\u00b0 Growing Commission responsibilities in a context of staff cuts call for the development of a reinforced talent management strategy, as Irene Souka, DG HR\u2019s Director-General, explains. \u00a9 E U PERSONNEL POLICY NEW TALENT MANAGEMENT STRATEGY by Zach Hester and Chris Jones, CEND AU QUOTIDIEN ",

We will shortly be launching a modernised learn- ing and development strategy with a clear focus on learning at work \u2013 from your experience and that of others \u2013 as well as training (classroom but also e-learn- ing). In addition to encouraging staff to develop their competences, we will also make it easier for them to put these to good use across the Commission by revamping the Career Guidance Service (see box), so that it offers additional support and guidance to staff in their career development and mobility. Knowledge of other DGs and the reinforcement of the corporate culture will also contribute to this \u2013 the new eight-day induction course for newcomers launched last October is a first concrete step in this regard. The Commission\u2019s workforce is constantly evolv- ing, of course, as staff retire and new colleagues are recruited. So a good talent management strategy must also focus on getting the right people from the outset. This is why we will reinforce the follow-up of com- petition results, and introduce a closer monitoring of DGs\u2019 satisfaction with new recruits. Stronger central support will be offered to DGs and managers to deal with cases of underperformance, including during the probation period. Last but not least, we want to offer additional career opportunities for staff. Internal competitions open to contract agents and the reinforcement of the adviser function are some examples. How will staff be involved? The views of staff, as expressed in the Staff Survey, and consultations with our stakeholders at all levels have already influenced the development of the new strat- egy, and I definitely see this as an on-going process as the strategy is rolled out. The definition of the com- ponent actions is a process that will involve everyone \u2013 Commissioners, senior and middle managers, human resources professionals, staff representatives, and all members of staff who wish to contribute. The dedicated website and a live chat with Vice-President Georgieva after the Christmas break will offer opportunities for staff to contribute. (cid:2) Career guidance at the Commission Liisi Rossi, who heads DG HR's Career Guidance Service (SCOP), explains the role of career guidance . What do you do? We support staff who want to reflect on their career issues and future mobility. Working on a one-to-one basis with staff, we can help with many things, from dra(cid:5)ing CVs or cover letters and preparing for interviews to helping clarify motivations and aspirations. By helping people to ask the right questions and find the right answers, we help them develop career management skills of use throughout their careers. Why is it important? The Commission is a complex place to work, where staff can spend their entire career. So it is important to be in the right job \u2013 for the benefit of individuals and the organisation as a whole. In this regard, personalised career coaching helps in matching jobs with people. It is important for staff to take personal responsibility for managing their own career, as we cannot do it all \u2013 but we can certainly help make it easier! So what is the role of talent management? I meet people daily who care, who believe in what they are doing, and who are looking for ways to develop further. The task of any talent management system is to tap into this potential, foster personal and professional development, and create win-win situations. \u00a9 E U (cid:2) Liisi Rossi and Christian Levasseur, DG HR's Director responsible for talent management.

        "48 CERT-EU is the Computer Emergency Response Team of the EU Institutions, Agencies and bodies. Freddy Dezeure, Head of CERT-EU, explains how CERT-EU helps to protect us against ever more sophisticated cyber-attacks, and coordinates response to cybersecurity incidents. What is CERT-EU? CERT-EU was set up in 2011, in the context of the Eu- ropean Digital Agenda. The objective was to increase the cybersecurity of the EU Institutions and to show a good example for Member States that did not have a national/governmental CERT. CERT-EU\u2019s mission is to enhance the security of the information and communications technology infra- structure of all EU Institutions, Agencies and bodies (its \u2018constituents\u2019), around 60 organisations in total. It acts as their cybersecurity information exchange and incident-response coordination hub. CERT-EU helps to prevent cyber-attacks, to detect them earlier and to resolve them quicker. It interacts closely with the internal teams in the Commission, within DG DIGIT and DG HR's Security Directorate, and with the IT or incident-response teams in the con- stituents. It provides value through its highly skilled staff and specialised tools, its strong network of peers and partners, and its access to unique sources of in- formation. CERT-EU is hosted by the Commission, in secured offices. Its office automation environment is integrated into the Commission infrastructure, but all the special- ised activities are carried out on dedicated IT infrastruc- ture, isolated from the Commission network. Could you tell us about the current threat landscape? The threats we are dealing with are \u2018targeted attacks\u2019, in most cases related to cyber-espionage, which aim to gain privileged access to sensitive information of a geo- political, economic or technical nature. These attacks are very sophisticated, trying to remain undetected and maintaining a presence in the infrastructure for as long as possible. Constituents are frequently targeted by such attacks \u2013 fortunately most are unsuccessful. Nevertheless, there is no absolute protection against sophisticated targeted attacks. Attribution of cyber-attacks to countries or adver- saries is very difficult. In the media, there are a lot of articles on countries from which attacks allegedly origi- nate, but it is rare that we are 100% sure. We actively monitor all threats that can be relevant for our constitu- ents, and have recently seen an important increase in cyber-attacks, which we believe is correlated with the tensions in Eastern Europe. What is it like to work for CERT-EU? Most of our staff are IT engineers, specialised in inci- dent response, intrusion detection, forensic analysis, vulnerability assessment, and cyber-threat intelligence. We currently employ 20 staff, with several recruitments in the pipeline. The resources are provided in posts or credits by the constituents. Working at CERT-EU is very exciting. We are con- tinuously challenged technically and operationally by sophisticated adversaries. It\u2019s also fun because we have a really cool team! CERT-EU is frequently invited to take part in international conferences to present its insights on the threat landscape and incident mitigation. How do you enhance the security of the Institutions? The services of CERT-EU are very modular to cope with the diversity of the needs and expectations of its con- CERT(cid:5)EU SUPPORTING THE INSTITUTIONS AGAINST CYBER(cid:5)THREATS by Rogier Holla, CERT(cid:2)EU AU QUOTIDIEN ",
        "# D \u00e9 c e m b r e 2 0 1 5 - J a n v i e r 2 0 1 6 49 DG DIGIT / DG HR Cybersecurity Awareness Campaign 90% of the cybersecurity incidents in the EU Institutions are caused by phishing e-mails \u2013 fake e-mails that mimic correspondence from trusted organisations or people you know. The goal of the attacker is to steal personal data and collect information to harm the Commission or you (e.g. empty your bank account). A single click can compromise our IT network. To raise awareness about the existing cyber-threats, DG DIGIT and DG HR jointly developed and implement the Cybersecurity Awareness Campaign in the Commission, with the support of Vice-President Kristalina Georgieva and Commissioner G\u00fcnther Oettinger. The purpose is to make staff aware of the existing threats and to equip all colleagues with the best armament to react to potential attacks. The campaign's fi ve main messages are: 1. Beware of suspicious e-mails (phishing) 2. Secure your password (keep your password secret) 3. Store and transfer data and documents safely (check your USB for malware) 4. Share safely (on social media) 5. Browse and download safely (when you have administrative rights) You are welcome to visit the Cybersecurity Portal on My IntraComm which was designed as a learning space and a training camp to test how well we are prepared to prevent hackers from damaging our computers and mobile devices. stituents. They range from advice on prevention and detection of compromises to incident response and coordination. We also help the constituents to deploy specialised tools and services. In practice, we keep abreast of the most important threats and alert the constituents whenever they are targeted. We also come to the rescue whenever a severe incident happens. CERT-EU is continuously in contact with the EU Member States\u2019 CERTs, NATO-NCIRC and US-CERT, trusted organisations with which we systematically exchange information and which face the same attacks as we do. CERT-EU also maintains extensive contacts with IT security companies. It can reach out to the best experts on the planet, with privileged access to threat intelligence and mitigation measures. This cooperation is organised under non-disclosure agreements. CERT- EU\u2019s constituents can benefit from its unique network of expertise, knowledge and capabilities.

Born in Etterbeek, Belgium, on 12 February 1935, he studied at the Ecole Polytechnique (Facult\u00e9 des Sciences Appliqu\u00e9es) of the Free University of Brussels where, in 1957, he obtained the diploma of Ing\u00e9nieur Civil M\u00e9canicien-Electricien (grade l\u00e9gal) with \"La Plus Grande Distinction\" and the Post-Graduate Certificate in Nuclear Physics. Jean- Pierre Contzen was Director for prospective studies at the JRC (Joint Research Center) in Ispra in 1974- 75, then Director of Programmes in the headquarters until 1981. After some years in DG Research, he was appointed Director-General of the JRC in 1986, a posi- tion that he held until 1997. Already as a Director, Jean-Pierre Contzen was behind some of the strategic changes that shaped the JRC's current structure and mission. He was in charge of diversifying the work of the JRC towards non-nuclear activities and, when he became Director-General, he restructured the JRC into thematic institutes, rein- forced the links with national research bodies and emphasised the support to EU policies formulation and implementation. Those who knew him will remember his renowned expertise in the nuclear field, his vision for the JRC, and his leadership. His is certainly a loss for the sci- entific and policy communities. Europe has always been at the heart of his work, regardless of the subject or the country involved, and a European flag covered his coffin for his last journey. (cid:2) IN MEMORIAM ",

Cette initiative permet aux pensionn\u00e9s de participer \u00e0 des activit\u00e9s au sein des DG et services selon certaines modalit\u00e9s. \u00a9 E U (cid:7)ACTIVE SENIOR(cid:8) SIGNATURE DE LA 100e CONVENTION POURQUOI PAS VOUS? par Janette Sinclair, DG HR U n sondage r\u00e9alis\u00e9 par la DG HR en 2011 avait d\u00e9montr\u00e9 le vif int\u00e9r\u00eat de l\u2019ensemble des services quant \u00e0 l\u2019appel aux comp\u00e9tences d\u2019anciens fonctionnaires dans un cadre homog\u00e8ne et consolid\u00e9. Une enqu\u00eate ant\u00e9rieure datant de 2004 portant sur les relations qu\u2019entretient l\u2019institution avec son personnel retrait\u00e9 avait quant \u00e0 elle fait appara\u00eetre une \u00e9vidence tr\u00e8s claire: 55% des pensionn\u00e9s \u00e9taient d\u2019avis que la Commission n\u2019utilise pas assez leur expertise. En effet, seules 9 DG de la Commission avaient d\u00e9j\u00e0 eu recours \u00e0 l\u2019expertise d\u2019anciens coll\u00e8gues. Les activit\u00e9s portaient principalement sur les relations ext\u00e9rieures, l\u2019aide hu- manitaire ou encore la lutte anti-fraude et, de mani\u00e8re g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, n\u00e9cessitaient un profil assez pointu. Forte de ce constat, la DG HR a estim\u00e9 qu\u2019il \u00e9tait essentiel de doter la Commission d\u2019un cadre consolid\u00e9 autorisant le recours \u00e0 l\u2019expertise des anciens fonction- naires et de leur permettre ainsi de prester de mani\u00e8re b\u00e9n\u00e9vole des mandats ou activit\u00e9s non r\u00e9mun\u00e9r\u00e9s. En f\u00e9vrier 2014, l\u2019initiative \u00abActive Senior\u00bb \u00e9tait lanc\u00e9e (voir CEND #12, p. 53-55). Des orientations en d\u00e9fi- nissent les modalit\u00e9s et les proc\u00e9dures et procurent un cadre int\u00e9gr\u00e9 aux services qui d\u00e9sirent en b\u00e9n\u00e9ficier. Elles pr\u00e9voient notamment un mod\u00e8le de convention \u00e0 signer entre le service et l\u2019ancien fonctionnaire, un code de conduite \u00e0 respecter, une d\u00e9claration de non-conflit d\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat et le b\u00e9n\u00e9fice d\u2019une couverture accident. Le remboursement de certains frais de d\u00e9placement est \u00e9galement pr\u00e9vu. Certaines r\u00e8gles sont \u00e0 respecter quant au choix des t\u00e2ches \u00e0 attribuer aux candidats. L\u2019active senior ne doit pas assumer des responsabilit\u00e9s directes et des prises de d\u00e9cision. Il n\u2019est autoris\u00e9 ni \u00e0 repr\u00e9senter la Commission de mani\u00e8re officielle, ni \u00e0 intervenir dans des n\u00e9gocia- tions avec un organisme ext\u00e9rieur, ni \u00e0 participer \u00e0 des r\u00e9unions o\u00f9 il engagerait l\u2019institution. Il ne constitue pas non plus un moyen de remplacement des fonction- naires en activit\u00e9. Ceux-ci doivent conserver la ma\u00eetrise et la responsabilit\u00e9 des activit\u00e9s entreprises au sein des services. L\u2019utilisation de l\u2019expertise d\u2019un ancien consti- ",

Enfin \u2013 et ceci constitue sans doute un des \u00e9l\u00e9ments les plus importants \u2013 l\u2019initiative \u00abActive Senior\u00bb ne s\u2019adresse pas uniquement aux pensionn\u00e9s qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 membres de l\u2019encadrement. Tout ancien fonctionnaire a pu acqu\u00e9rir une expertise et un savoir-faire dans des domaines vari\u00e9s, qu\u2019il ait \u00e9t\u00e9 membre du personnel d\u2019encadrement ou affect\u00e9 \u00e0 des t\u00e2ches d\u2019ex\u00e9cution. Le recours \u00e0 un active senior doit donc pouvoir se conce- voir \u00e0 tous les niveaux. Identifier les profils des candidats Ce sont les services de la Commission qui sont respon- sables de la mise en \u0153uvre de l\u2019initiative, s\u2019ils le d\u00e9sirent. Il leur incombe donc d\u2019initier les proc\u00e9dures ad\u00e9quates pour identifier les profils des candidats correspondant aux activit\u00e9s susceptibles d\u2019\u00eatre prest\u00e9es par un active senior. Les orientations de la DG HR pr\u00e9conisent aussi la mise en place de mesures pr\u00e9alables comme la gestion, au sein des services, d\u2019une base de donn\u00e9es d\u2019anciens se portant volontaires pour certaines activit\u00e9s, notam- ment au moment du d\u00e9part \u00e0 la retraite. Il est \u00e9gale- ment important de pr\u00e9voir si n\u00e9cessaire l\u2019organisation de sessions de formation ou de remise \u00e0 niveau des active seniors, de m\u00eame que la mise \u00e0 disposition de la logistique et du mat\u00e9riel informatique. Depuis le lancement de l\u2019initiative en f\u00e9vrier 2014, 19 DG et services y ont particip\u00e9. Des conventions ont \u00e9t\u00e9 sign\u00e9es dans les domaines les plus diversi- fi\u00e9s: membre de jury de concours, participation \u00e0 des groupes de r\u00e9flexion, gouvernance informatique, support technique lors d\u2019\u00e9v\u00e8nements, appui \u00e0 la Task Force Ukraine (voir CEND #15, p. 54-55)... La DG HR a montr\u00e9 l\u2019exemple en tant que chef de file: 33 conven- tions ont \u00e9t\u00e9 sign\u00e9es dans le cadre notamment de la pr\u00e9sidence de groupes d\u2019entraide, de cercles de loisirs ou de pr\u00e9sentations lors de s\u00e9minaires et conf\u00e9rences. La dur\u00e9e des conventions varie de 3 jours \u00e0 30 mois. Les orientations pr\u00e9conisent de ne pas d\u00e9passer une p\u00e9riode de 12 mois avec possibilit\u00e9 de renouveler la convention. La 100e convention \u00abActive Senior\u00bb a \u00e9t\u00e9 sign\u00e9e en octobre dernier dans le contexte de l\u2019EPSO Academy, projet pilote visant \u00e0 constituer une r\u00e9serve de personnes pour les comit\u00e9s de s\u00e9lection. Les avantages mutuels de l\u2019initiative sont \u00e9vidents. D\u2019une part, l\u2019institution b\u00e9n\u00e9ficie d\u2019un v\u00e9ritable poten- tiel: la transmission du savoir-faire des anciens, la sau- vegarde et l\u2019utilisation de leur expertise incomparable acquise au fil du temps et, surtout, leur disponibilit\u00e9. De son c\u00f4t\u00e9, l\u2019ancien fonctionnaire, en apportant sa contribution \u00e0 la Commission, s\u2019en trouve valoris\u00e9, doublement motiv\u00e9 et fier de se sentir encore utile et appr\u00e9ci\u00e9 par ses anciens coll\u00e8gues.

En 2015, il y en a eu une douzaine. BIEN PREPARER SA RETRAITE par Monique Th\u00e9\u00e2tre, DG HR GENERATIONS S uivre un s\u00e9minaire \u00abPr\u00e9paration \u00e0 la retraite\u00bb n\u2019aide en aucun cas \u00e0 prendre une d\u00e9cision ou \u00e0 obtenir des informations sur l\u2019\u00e9volution future des conditions de retraite. En effet, ces sessions de trois jours \u2013 auxquelles on peut s\u2019inscrire via Syslog \u2013 s\u2019adressent exclusivement aux personnes qui ont l\u2019intention de prendre leur retraite dans les dix prochains mois. Elles offrent des informations pratiques sur les questions administratives, juridiques et financi\u00e8res li\u00e9es \u00e0 la ces- sation de fonctions. Les th\u00e8mes abord\u00e9s sont tr\u00e8s diver- sifi\u00e9s: pensions, assurance maladie, droits p\u00e9cuniaires, services sociaux, fiscalit\u00e9, successions, di\u00e9t\u00e9tique, asso- ciations d\u2019anciens, assurances compl\u00e9mentaires\u2026 La troisi\u00e8me journ\u00e9e est quant \u00e0 elle consacr\u00e9e \u00e0 des aspects moins tangibles \u2013 mais tout aussi importants \u2013 \u00e0 savoir les aspects psychologiques li\u00e9s au d\u00e9part \u00e0 la retraite qui constitue un moment crucial de transition dans la vie. Malgr\u00e9 la diversit\u00e9 des situations personnelles, les participants ont ainsi l\u2019occasion d\u2019\u00e9changer leurs id\u00e9es et de prendre conscience des \u00e9cueils qui peuvent par- fois se pr\u00e9senter. Certaines actions sp\u00e9cifiques peuvent alors \u00eatre identifi\u00e9es tendant \u00e0 rendre le processus de d\u00e9part \u00e0 la retraite \u00e0 la fois confortable et gratifiant. Les partenaires sont \u00e9galement les bienvenus, sans inscrip- tion n\u00e9cessaire au pr\u00e9alable. Cerise sur le g\u00e2teau: un succulent d\u00e9jeuner sous forme de buffet est offert aux participants, ajoutant \u00e0 ce s\u00e9minaire une dimension coll\u00e9giale et conviviale tr\u00e8s appr\u00e9ci\u00e9e. (cid:2) Dominique Barette, DG HR Pourquoi avez-vous assist\u00e9 \u00e0 ce s\u00e9minaire? J\u2019ai jug\u00e9 utile de me pr\u00e9parer au mieux \u00e0 mon futur statut de retrait\u00e9e. A mon sens, cela suppose un changement de vie assez radical; je souhaitais donc entendre les recommandations des diff \u00e9rents services impliqu\u00e9s et partager les attentes (et peut-\u00eatre les craintes) des coll\u00e8gues qui, eux aussi, ont l\u2019intention de mettre bient\u00f4t un terme \u00e0 leurs activit\u00e9s professionnelles. Qu\u2019avez-vous appris d\u2019int\u00e9ressant ou d\u2019utile? Toutes les interventions \u00e9taient int\u00e9ressantes, mais celles du PMO et de l\u2019avocat conseil en particulier ont mis en \u00e9vidence des \u00e9l\u00e9ments auxquels je n\u2019aurais peut-\u00eatre pas pens\u00e9. Par ailleurs, j\u2019ai appr\u00e9ci\u00e9 que l\u2019attention des futurs retrait\u00e9s soit attir\u00e9e sur des sujets importants tels que l\u2019alimentation ou encore l\u2019impact psychologique du changement de statut. Selon vous, qu\u2019est-ce qui pourrait \u00eatre am\u00e9lior\u00e9? G lobalement, le programme du s\u00e9minaire tel qu\u2019il est con\u00e7u est assez complet. J\u2019ai beaucoup appr\u00e9ci\u00e9 le fait que les participants aient la possibilit\u00e9 de poser librement et ouvertement des questions aux diff \u00e9rents intervenants et d\u2019\u00eatre ainsi rassur\u00e9s sur les points qui les pr\u00e9occupaient. Il conviendrait peut-\u00eatre d\u2019encourager les conjoints \u00e0 prendre part \u00e0 ce s\u00e9minaire, car leur contribution ne peut qu\u2019enrichir les \u00e9changes. ",

A une \u00e9poque largement domin\u00e9e par les hommes, Elisabeth Louise Vig\u00e9e Le Brun a \u00e9t\u00e9 l'une des rares artistes de son temps \u00e0 avoir su s\u2019imposer sur la sc\u00e8ne artistique fran\u00e7aise. Devenue le peintre officiel de la derni\u00e8re reine de France, Marie-Antoinette d\u2019Autriche, elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 une observatrice attentive \u00e0 la fois aux fastes de la vie de l\u2019Ancien R\u00e9gime \u2013 \u00e9cras\u00e9 par la R\u00e9volution fran\u00e7aise \u00e0 partir de 1789 \u2013 et \u00e0 l\u2019essor d\u2019une soci\u00e9t\u00e9 nouvelle sous le Consulat et l\u2019Empire. Mme Vig\u00e9e Le Brun jouissait \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9poque d\u2019une c\u00e9l\u00e9- brit\u00e9 \u00e9gale \u00e0 celle des grandes portraitistes de son temps \u2013 comme Quentin de La Tour ou Jean-Baptiste Greuze \u2013 mais son nom est aujourd\u2019hui peu connu du grand public. L\u2019exposition, qui est la premi\u00e8re r\u00e9trospective fran\u00e7aise \u00e0 lui \u00eatre consacr\u00e9e apr\u00e8s celle de 1982 aux Etats-Unis, lui rend hommage en r\u00e9unissant pr\u00e8s de 130 de ses \u0153uvres. Peintures, pastels et dessins, dans les genres majeurs du portrait, du paysage et de la repr\u00e9sen- tation mythologique, t\u00e9moignent de la ma\u00eetrise de cette artiste ambitieuse. D'autres artistes qui l\u2019ont influenc\u00e9e, comme Greuze ou Vernet, ainsi que ses concurrentes f\u00e9minines, notamment Ad\u00e9la\u00efde Labille-Guiard, sont \u00e9galement repr\u00e9sent\u00e9s. Une vie d\u00e9di\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019art L\u2019exposition s\u2019articule en espaces th\u00e9matiques tels que \u00abEmulation et concurrence f\u00e9minine\u00bb, \u00abL\u2019El\u00e9gance \u00e0 la fran\u00e7aise\u00bb ou encore \u00abPeindre l\u2019enfance et l\u2019amour maternel\u00bb et suit le cours de la vie de l\u2019artiste, qui meurt \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e2ge de 87 ans. D\u00e8s sa jeunesse, Mme Vig\u00e9e Le Brun fait partie du cercle des artistes qui c\u00f4toient la bour- geoisie parisienne. Elle apprend diff\u00e9rentes techniques artistiques de son p\u00e8re, Louis Vig\u00e9e \u2013 un artiste de l'Aca- d\u00e9mie de Saint-Luc renomm\u00e9 surtout pour ses pastels. Ses proches sont les protagonistes de la premi\u00e8re phase de sa production juv\u00e9nile. Puis, son mariage avec un marchand de tableaux, Jean Baptiste Pierre Le Brun, lui permet de cultiver des relations influentes et de conti- nuer son \u00e9tude des ma\u00eetres anciens et de son temps. Mme Vig\u00e9e Le Brun d\u00e9veloppe alors une technique per- sonnelle et sophistiqu\u00e9e, qui lui assure une client\u00e8le et une c\u00e9l\u00e9brit\u00e9 grandissantes. A partir des ann\u00e9es 1770, elle commence \u00e0 repr\u00e9senter les membres de la famille royale et \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e2ge de seulement 23 ans elle r\u00e9alise son premier portrait officiel de la reine: Marie-Antoinette en grand habit de cour (1778). La relation amicale entre les deux femmes \u2013 l\u2019une des th\u00e9matiques centrales de l\u2019exposition \u2013 est scell\u00e9e par l\u2019intervention de la sou- veraine dans l\u2019acceptation de Mme Vig\u00e9e Le Brun \u00e0 l\u2019Acad\u00e9mie royale de peinture et de sculpture en 1783. Son morceau de r\u00e9ception, une all\u00e9gorie intitul\u00e9e la Paix ramenant l\u2019Abondance (1780) , montre que l\u2019artiste \u00e9tait aussi une peintre d'histoire de talent. Au service de Marie-Antoinette et de sa cour En embellissant de mani\u00e8re imperceptible certains traits de ses sujets, sans pour autant perdre la ressemblance, Mme Vig\u00e9e Le Brun s\u2019inscrit dans la tradition du portrait \u00e9l\u00e9gant du XVIIIe si\u00e8cle. Gr\u00e2ce \u00e0 l\u2019introduction de sub- tiles nouveaut\u00e9s dans le genre \u2013 notamment de l\u00e9gers sourires pour signifier la joie de vivre \u2013, elle est la pre- mi\u00e8re peintre \u00e0 satisfaire les attentes de Marie-Antoinette. Dans plusieurs tableaux, la reine \u2013 ainsi que sa cour \u2013 est repr\u00e9sent\u00e9e comme une femme de son temps. En 1783, la reine pose en \u00abrobe de gaulle\u00bb \u2013 un v\u00eatement en lin ou en coton blanc \u00e0 porter \u00e0 l\u2019int\u00e9rieur ou pour les prome- nades ; ce portrait expos\u00e9 au Salon suscitera la critique en raison de la tenue que Marie-Antoinette arbore. ",
        "58 La reine, attaqu\u00e9e par la presse de l\u2019\u00e9poque, \u00e9tait devenue fort impopulaire aupr\u00e8s de ses sujets en raison de ses d\u00e9penses inconsid\u00e9r\u00e9es, de ses coiffures extra- vagantes, de sa frivolit\u00e9 et de la pr\u00e9tendue ill\u00e9gitimit\u00e9 de ses enfants. Dans le but de restaurer l\u2019image de la reine, Mme Vig\u00e9e Le Brun consulte son ami le peintre Jacques-Louis David qui lui conseille de s\u2019inspirer de Ra- pha\u00ebl pour la composition pyramidale d\u2019un portrait de groupe. Ce sera l\u2019une de ses \u0153uvres les plus c\u00e9l\u00e8bres: le portrait de Marie-Antoinette et ses enfants (1786-1787).

Elle entre- prend un voyage de pr\u00e8s de douze ans. En s\u2019appuyant sur son renom et sur son talent, elle tisse des relations influentes dans les cercles des acad\u00e9mies et des cours europ\u00e9ennes, et sert une client\u00e8le fascin\u00e9e par le mod\u00e8le fran\u00e7ais. Elle s\u00e9journe \u00e0 Rome, Naples, Bologne, Parme et Florence, puis elle est accueillie par la Cour imp\u00e9riale \u00e0 Vienne. Enfin, elle retrouve une nouvelle patrie \u00e0 Saint-P\u00e9tersbourg aupr\u00e8s de la famille imp\u00e9riale et de l\u2019aristocratie russe. En 1802, Mme Vig\u00e9e Le Brun rentre \u00e0 Paris pour se mettre au service de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 du Consulat, puis de celle de l\u2019Empire. Elle ne cesse pas de voyager pour autant et s\u00e9journe en Angleterre et en Suisse. Au fil de ses p\u00e9r\u00e9grinations, elle ne quittera jamais le style d\u00e9licat qui caract\u00e9rise tous ses portraits. Enfin, dans sa derni\u00e8re production, Mme Vig\u00e9e Le Brun est touch\u00e9e par les influences du Romanti- cisme et du R\u00e9alisme, alors qu\u2019elle se livre au genre de la peinture de paysage en plein air, en manifestant une nouvelle sensibilit\u00e9 pour la nature. Les sursauts de l\u2019histoire n\u2019auront jamais eu d\u2019inci- dence sur le style de Mme Vig\u00e9e Le Brun, qui a continu\u00e9 \u00e0 repr\u00e9senter la joie de vivre tout au long de sa carri\u00e8re. Pour cela, ses \u0153uvres extr\u00eamement pris\u00e9es en Europe et au-del\u00e0 ont largement circul\u00e9. Ainsi, outre les tableaux conserv\u00e9s en France, l\u2019exposition r\u00e9unit des \u0153uvres de Mme Vig\u00e9e Le Brun pr\u00eat\u00e9es par des mus\u00e9es europ\u00e9ens ou encore l\u2019Ermitage (Russie) et le Metropolitan Mu- seum of Art (Etats-Unis).
