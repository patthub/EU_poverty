        "NEWS ITEMS Seminar on statistics on poverty in the European Community 1. Introduction The seminar on statistics on poverty in the European Community was held in Noord- wijk, the Netherlands, from 24 to 27 October 1989. Its main objective was to enable the Statistical Office of the European Communities to deter mine the basic components - methods and data sources - needed to set up an informa tion system to quantify and analyse poverty in Europe. 2. Lack of consensus on methods In general, poverty is defined as a lack of welfare resulting from insufficient material, cultural and social resources. In most studies on poverty, 'resources' means income alone, but such an indicator does not take account of goods and services offered free of charge or at a reduced rate (health, education) and may well produce an underestimate. Total expenditure is therefore often taken as a rough guide to income, a procedure which is appropriate for low-income households, which have few or no savings, or even nega tive savings. But these two variables, income and expenditure, do not reflect the fact that poverty is multidimensional. Some research ers therefore advocate introducing additional qualitative indicators such as housing, educa tion and health. Along with the problem of choosing the resources indicator, a poverty line has to be defined. Three main definitions have been suggested by researchers, ranging from a fixed purchasing power level (assessed on the basis of the cost of a basket of goods meeting basic needs) to a percentage of a distribution of income (relative approach), via the popula tion's own assessment of its state of poverty (subjective approach). Poverty may also be measured by a European line or by reference to a national standard. These two methods give a totally different distribution of numbers of poor people: the first approach produces a far smaller number in high-income countries than the second. Methods of measuring poverty are still being discussed. The choice of one or other of the definitions is not within the remit of Eurostat, which has to continue working with all three methods. 3. Household surveys have the edge over administrative statistics Administrative registers are an abundant source of data in the social field. They can be used to count up and analyse persons who are often not included in household surveys, namely, those living in communities, and the homeless. However, reservations were expressed at the seminar about this data source. In some European Community coun tries, administrative data are neither compu terized nor centralized, and a great deal of work would therefore have to be done before they could be used to measure poverty. On the other hand, the participants were strongly in favour of using family budget surveys, which are currently the best source of ",
        "NEWS ITEMS data on household welfare. In particular, they provide information on the composition of households, the breakdown of expenditure, income, ownership of durables and housing. In order to cover the dynamics of poverty, its causes and effects, Eurostat was asked to supplement this survey by setting up a panel on incomes, to be representative of all the Community countries, with a first survey period due in 1992. National extensions of this panel would also be a possibility, to ensure that reliable data were available at national level. 4. Conclusions The seminar on statistics on poverty in Europe provided the main outline of Euro- stat's programme of work for the coming years : (i) in the short term, the accent will have to be on household surveys - mainly improving the family budget survey by harmonizing concepts, classifications and survey dates between countries; (ii) in the medium term, alongside this work on harmonization, the experimental extension of the family budget survey in the Netherlands and Italy (introducing additional questions to measure subjec tive poverty) will have to be applied in all Community Member States. More over, additional data sources such as the LIS (Luxembourg Income Study) base will have to be exploited; (iii) long-term plans involve setting up the European panel to measure poverty in line with various definitions (absolute, relative and subjective measurements). This programme of work will be financed in part by the Commission under the third pro gramme to combat poverty, financing for which has just been approved. The setting up of the European panel, which will be a major cost item, depends on the success of financial negotiations currently under way. ",
        "NEWS ITEMS Environment statistics for the Community John Allen' The appearance of Eurostat's first official publication of environment statistics might well prompt some questions, a few of which are anticipated here. Why has Eurostat started to work on environment statistics? The current demand for Community statistics on the environment reflects the emergence of environment policy as an accepted field of Community action. Of course, Community environment legislation has existed for many years (to give one example, the 1975 Directive on water quality at bathing beaches 2 ). How ever, since the Single European Act imposed an environmental dimension on all Commun ity policies, 3 the Commission has produced a series of increasingly radical proposals for action on environmental questions. Some of these proposals - for example, for strict limits John Allen is an administrator in Eurostat's environment statistics unit. Council Directive 75/160/EEC of 8 December 1975 con cerning the quality of bathing water. The Single European Act of 1985 added three articles dealing specifically with the environment (130r, 130s and 130t) to the EEC Treaty. It also included a reference to environmental protection in Article 100a, on the internal market. on car-exhaust emissions 4 - have been accepted relatively easily. Others, such as the Commission's policy document on carbon- dioxide emissions, 5 have stimulated reactions ranging from outright hostility to a cautious approach which emphasizes the need for more information both on the technical feasi bility of the proposed emissions reductions and also on the economic consequences of such a policy. For all these Community actions on the en vironment, statistics have a dual role. First, they assist in the formulation of policy. Stat istics describe the current situation - for example, historical trends in emissions; they also make it possible to assess some of the consequences of particular policy options, such as a renewed emphasis on nuclear elec tricity generation as a way of reducing emis sions. Second, they demonstrate the effective ness - or lack of effectiveness - of past actions. For example, the 1985 Helsinki Pro tocol to the Convention on long-range trans- Proposal for a Council Directive amending Directive 70/220/EEC on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to measures to be taken against air pollution by emissions from motor vehicles; COM(89) 662.

        "NEWS ITEMS boundary air pollution' commits eight Mem ber States to reducing sulphur-dioxide emis sions by at least 30%, based on 1980 emis sions. Statistics, particularly when collected and published independently of the legislative procedures of the Community, provide the public with evidence of success or failure in dealing with recognized environmental prob lems. Where do Eurostat's environment statistics come from? Following Eurostat's general policy, the pri mary sources for environment statistics are the official statistical services of Member States. For the 'state of the environment' series, covering air and water pollution and wastes, Eurostat decided to use figures col lected from Member States via the OECD environmental data questionnaire. This ques tionnaire was devised by the OECD in the early 1980s; it has been sent to OECD mem ber countries every two years, and it is the principal source of the statistics published in the OECD's Environmental Date Compen dium, which is probably the most widely used set of environment statistics at international level. By adopting the OECD questionnaire, Euro stat has sacrificed some flexibility in requests for data, but this strategy has avoided the use of time and resources to develop a question naire from scratch, while also avoiding a double burden on environment statistics units in Member States. It cannot be too strongly emphasized that the major effort of produc ing these statistics is carried out in the Mem ber States, often by statisticians who are working under severe pressure to meet cur rent demands for environmental data at national level; one of Eurostat's current prior ities is to find resources for Member States to Council Decision 81/462/EEC of II June 1981 on the conclusion of the Convention on long-range transboun- dary air pollution. work on Community-level environment statis tics. 2 The data in the current publication were compiled from the 1988 OECD questionnaire (and from historical data held by the OECD) by an expert based at the OECD but employed by Eurostat. The 1990 question naire has been sent to Member States under a joint OECD-Eurostat heading and the data will be compiled under a contract with the OECD, financed by Eurostat, an arrange ment which has practical advantages for both organizations. Further statistics of environmental relevance are derived from the regular official statistics compiled by several other units within Euro stat. Notably, land-use statistics have been 'borrowed' from agricultural statistics; the data are less detailed than would be ideal in an environment policy context - important habitat types such as heathlands and wetlands are not shown separately, nor are built-up areas distinguished - but these are the best statistics available at Community level and they show the major trends in land use over more than 40 years. Energy data are also a major element in environment statistics; here, extensive use has been made of Eurostat's energy balance sheets, both to construct a series of energy indicators covering almost 30 years, and also a base data for the calculation of carbon-dioxide emissions. The energy bal ance sheets may be considered one of Euro stat's most valuable general-purpose statistical resources; it is hoped that they can be main tained and developed with added detail on the energy consumption side and by the inclu sion of unconventional and renewable energy sources. A few series have been obtained directly from industry sources. In particular, national data on CFCs (chlorofluorocarbons) are still regarded as confidential, because only a few : Proposals for a Council Decision adopting a four-year programme (1990-93) to develop regular official statistics on the environment. ",
        "NEWS ITEMS companies produce these materials; Eurostat can only obtain aggregate data for the Com munity and the world, which data are com piled by industry federations. Questions of nomenclature and classification are in principle very important to Eurostat's work in environment statistics, as in other fields. Eurostat participates in the current development of classifications for environ ment data by the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe, based in Geneva, which has a mandate for this activity from the Conference of European Statisticians. Classifications have been adopted, or drafted for testing, for statistics on land use, wastes, air pollution, water use and quality, and environmental protection expenditures, and it is proposed that these will serve as a basis for revision of the OECD-Eurostat questionnaire. It is too early to judge the impact of these proposed standard classifications on the col lection or presentation of environment statis tics; the level of detail suggested is difficult to achieve in practice in most Member States. One can foresee a quite lengthy process of mutual adaptation between the standard international classifications and the normal practice of Member States. At Community level, compatibility between the standard clas sifications and Community legislation needs to be improved. Could Eurostat's environment statistics be more up to date? It must be admitted that the answer to this question is yes. However, it should be remem bered that many of the 'state of the environ ment' statistics obtained via the OECD- Eurostat questionnaire are the result of com plex ad hoc data-collection procedures within Member States, frequently involving many different departments in national administra tions. Many statistics also have to be calcu lated, using procedures which are still under development (for example, emissions of air pollutants are typically calculated using emis sion factors applied to energy consumption or industrial activity data). It is therefore not surprising that these series are both incom plete and not very up to date. Nonetheless, as the publication of environment statistics becomes a routine activity for all Member States - which is by no means the case at present - the quality and timeliness of the Community-level statistics should improve. It could also be argued that changes from one year to another are of relatively minor signif icance for many environmental variables; of far greater importance are trends over 10, 20 or 30 years. For example, changes in energy use in the 1980s, and consequent trends in emissions of the major air pollutants, need to be seen in the context of energy consumption increases before the oil crisis of the 1970s. In the preparation of this publication, much effort has gone into constructing tables back to 1960 or 1970 wherever possible. Can one envisage 'summary indicators' for the environment? There are no combined or summary indica tors in this publication and there are strong reasons for questioning the feasibility of such indicators. For physical data, although an 'environmental quality index' or an 'air qual ity index' may be an attractive concept, it is difficult to see how one can combine data for which there is no common scale of measure ment. One possibility, which is being studied, is to refer to standards for environmental quality (for example, the water quality stand ards specified by some Community legisla tion). In this case, it might be possible to present statistics showing what proportion of the water (or air. or whatever) meets the relevant standard. On the economic side, considerable effort is being devoted by Eurostat, among others, to the valuation of environmental resources and to the quantification of environmental protec tion as an economic activity. One end-result ",
        "NEWS ITEMS of this activity should be the publication of environmental satellite accounts, as an adjunct to conventional national accounts; another result should be the development of various economic indicators relating to spe\u00ad cific environmental questions. In theory, money provides a common unit of measure; in practice, summary economic indicators will give radically different answers according to which resources are included, or which activi\u00ad ties are considered under the heading of envi\u00ad ronmental protection. Much development is required before such indicators can be included in official environment statistics. On the other hand, there is an emerging consensus that a limited set of environment statistics can be extracted for use as 'key indicators' for policy-makers. This approach has been developed over the last year by the OECD, following a specific request from a recent G-7 meeting. Key indicators have been identified by the OECD on a sector-by-sector basis; they include both physical statistics, such as the annual national emissions of major air pollutants on a per capita basis, as well as economic variables. Many of these key physical indicators are already included in this publication, and other sectors, such as agriculture and transport, will be covered in future editions. Could more use be made of data collected under Community legislation? Member States supply a stream of data to the Commission following the requirements of Community legislation, and in principle some of these data could be published as environ\u00ad ment statistics. It was decided to base the present publication on OECD-Eurostat ques\u00ad tionnaire data and existing Eurostat statistics, leaving the possibility of 'recycling' data sup\u00ad plied under legislation for future editions. Some tentative steps in this direction have identified several practical difficulties. First, legislation typically requires Member States to supply data for a single year, without any guarantee of comparability between years when methodologies change (as they fre\u00ad quently do when dealing with environmental data), and the historical data are not usually updated. Second, the Commission itself has sometimes failed to check the completeness or accuracy of the data; this is understandable when data are not supplied for statistical purposes, but it causes endless difficulties when attempting to extract statistics from this information. Third, the definitions used are often incompatible with the statistical nomen\u00ad clatures adopted (or proposed) for interna\u00ad tional environment statistics. These difficul\u00ad ties are not insurmountable, but they argue for a closer integration of data collection for statistical purposes and data collection in the application of Community legislation. How does Eurostat's environment stat- stics programme relate to Corine and to the European Environment Agency? Corine' is an experimental programme for gathering and disseminating environmental data, in which Eurostat participates as a manager, as a source of data and also as a client. The Corine database emphasizes geo\u00ad graphically related data and its computing tools are oriented to map production; most of the experimental datasets (other than the regional socio-economic data provided by Eurostat) cannot be considered as statistics in any conventional sense, since they do not include time series (which is why they have not been included in this publication).

Can the Commission say what precisely the situation is, in particular how many dairies are affected, how big the shortfall is and what quantities of butter, skimmed-milk powder and other dairy products were in storage in the Community at the end of 1988? Answer given by Mr Mac Sharry on behalf of the Commission Market balance has not yet been achieved for milk products. This is borne out by : (i) the aid schemes for private storage of butter; (ii) the aid scheme for the use of butter and skimmed-milk powder in the Commun ity, which is still a major scheme, and aid for the manufacture of casein and casem ates; (iii) the size of the export refunds. Although the inflexibility of production struc tures sometimes gives rise to local tension, there is no reason at present to fear shortages liable to create problems for the processing industry. The figures clearly illustrate this. Under the policy of production control, recently intensified to achieve a 9.5 % cut in production, there has been a steady increase in production of 'fresh products' and 'cheeses', for which the market outlets are assured, while production of butter and skimmed-milk powder has declined. In 1988, estimates point to a further increase of 1.3% for fresh products and 2 % for cheeses, with a drop of 11% for butter and 19% for skimmed-milk powder. The improvement in stock levels achieved by the reinforcement of the production control policy continued in 1988.

Principally the study covers the 10-member Community from 1974 to 1987. Part (A) gives a brief description of the methodology and a general analysis of the formation and distribution of productivity gains. Part (B) contains the individual analyses for each of the countries studied. Spanish agriculture has thus been included for the period from 1980 to 1986.

        "PUBLICATIONS AGRICULTURAL PRICES Microfiche Theme 5 \u2014 Series B: Short-term trends The microfiche for agricultural prices contain the monthly 'selling prices of crop products', 'selling prices of animal products' and 'purchase prices of the means of agricultural production' for the Member States of the Community. All data are also stored in the Cronos databank (PRAG domain). The monthly prices in the microfiche cover the past two years. Where no monthly series exist, the tables show the annual prices for 1980 to 1989 inclusive. The prices are expressed in national currencies and in ecus. The selling prices of crop and animal products comprise prices for the major products at the agricultural producer level, and also the prices of a number of processed products of the dairy industry. The purchase prices of the means of agricultural production relate to the prices paid by farmers for feedingstuffs, fertilizers and fuels.

In order to eliminate the effect of different rates of inflation in the Community, the nominal agricultural price indices are deflated using the consumer price index. The publication contains both nominal and deflated price indices. Each price index is the result of a base-weighted (Laspeyres) calculation using value weights determined for the base year 1985 for a fixed basket of agricultural products (output index) and a selection of goods and services (input index). 1985 also serves as the reference year. A brief commentary on the most recent developments, various summaries containing rates of change and a number of diagrams can be found before the index tables. A weighting scheme by country and product is also included. This publication provides in addition, for each of the last two years, monthly and annual series for the selling prices of the main agricultural (crop and animal) products and the purchase prices of the means of agricultural production. The prices are expressed in national currencies and in ecus.
