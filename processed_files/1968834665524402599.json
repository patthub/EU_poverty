        "7 Trends and results 2017 Executive summary T he new EU Consensus on Development was adopted in June 2017 ( 1 ), confirming the EU\u2019s commitment to be a frontrunner in the implementation of the 2030 agenda for sustainable development. The new consensus recognises the central place of budget support in fostering partner countries\u2019 efforts towards achieving the sustainable development goals (SDGs). The present report reflects this unique contribution to reforms and developmental results. It draws on the experi- ence of implementing 263 budget support contracts in 88 countries or territories for a portfolio of EUR 12.7 bil- lion and payments amounting to EUR 1.7 billion in 2016. EU budget support is provided when relevant and credible policies are put in place and implemented effectively. This report highlights many tangible results achieved by EU partner countries, and how EU budget support con- tributed to the success of their policies. For example, in the last 15 years, countries receiving EU budget support have reduced on average the percent- age of people living in extreme poverty by around 15 percentage points, much faster than other developing countries. Economic growth has been higher and less volatile in budget support countries, while public finances have proved to be healthier. Similarly, the nine countries in which the EU has been providing budget support in the health sector have seen the child mortality rate (before the age of five) dropping from 76 % on average to 46 % between 2005 and 2015. Access to safe water and sanitation, which has been the focus of budget support contracts in Bolivia and Burkina Faso, has increased by 10 to 20 percentage points in the last decade. Also disparities between urban and rural areas have shrunk in these two countries. Many other examples can be found in the report which, for the first time, includes chapters on how budget support is implemented in the field of environment and climate change and how it helps to build capacities for migration management and addressing the root causes of migration. As regards economic governance, public finance management and budgetary transparency continue to be as- sessed as stronger in countries where the EU provides budget support. This trend is also reflected by the im- provement in the fight against corruption in countries receiving budget support, even if it tends to worsen in countries in situation of fragility. Furthermore this added value of budget support is confirmed by recent evaluations, especially in relation to ser- vice delivery and public finance management. In Ghana ( 2 ), budget support and the accompanying technical sup- port \u2018helped to consolidate the country\u2019s transition process towards a middle-income oil-producing economy\u2019. This mix of inputs contributed to \u2018substantially increasing access to basic services and to maintaining, to some extent, a focus on pro-poor interventions\u2019. This concurs with the evaluation in Paraguay ( 3 ) which concluded that \u2018re- garding the effectiveness of the EU budget support operations, there is no doubt that in the education and social protection sectors, EU operations achieved a higher-than-expected impact in relation to their financial weight\u2019. Nonetheless, further progress is needed to achieve all SDGs by 2030 and the EU is committed to orienting budget support contracts towards these goals so that they contribute further to: \u2022 improving the quality and performance of countries\u2019 policies; \u2022 maintaining macroeconomic stability, upgrading public finance management and encouraging revenue mobilisation; \u2022 fostering human development, mainstreaming climate change and improving the business environment to stimulate inclusive and sustainable growth.

        "8 BUDGET SUPPORT Following the adoption of the European Consensus, the Commission has therefore updated its budget support guidelines accordingly. To reflect the new international agenda, the Commission will propose sustainable development goals contracts as of now, instead of good governance and development contracts formerly. The 2017 budget support guidelines also reflect lessons learned since the revision of the EU policy on budget sup- port in 2011 and the release of the 2012 guidelines. The effectiveness of state-building contracts is recognised in situations of fragility and in support to transition processes, demonstrating progress in developmental outcomes and positive trends in poverty and inequality reduction. Nevertheless some improvements were introduced to ad- dress more directly the root causes of fragility and contribute to increasing further state and social resilience ( 4 ). To underline this objective, the state-building contract has been renamed state and resilience building contract. Similarly the 2017 budget support guidelines build on the experience with sector reform contracts in upgrading service delivery in many sectors and improving countries\u2019 monitoring and evaluation systems. To emphasise the importance of results and focus on performance, this type of budget support will now be designated as sector reform performance contracts. This change also draws on the use of EU budget support in the enlargement context where it helps candidate countries and potential candidates in their progressive alignment with EU law, standards, policies and practices. Finally the 2017 budget support guidelines provide improved guidance in fields where further support and dia- logue is needed to meet the SDGs. This is particularly true for domestic revenue mobilisation or on cross-cutting issues such as gender. Messages were reinforced and the tools at the disposal of partner countries presented in detail. Likewise the 2017 guidelines explain how EU budget support could help to improve the business and investment climate in partner countries, in general or within the framework of the External Investment Plan for Sub-Saharan Africa and the European Neighbourhood. They also underline the importance of communication and visibility in all budget support contracts as a tool for facilitating the intended change in partner countries, but also to better promote budget support results to European stakeholders. These are the many dimensions touched upon in the present report, which is organised in three parts. Part I of the report presents selected macroeconomic, fiscal, developmental and sectoral results. Achievements highlighted above materialised while the macroeconomic outlook continues to be affected by uncertainties about global economic growth and low commodity prices. More specifically, the deterioration of debt sustaina- bility in many countries is of particular concern. It could jeopardise their fiscal stability, impact their populations, affect the business climate and undermine their investment efforts. Through the macroeconomic eligibility cri- terion and in partnership with the IMF, budget support allows dialogue with national authorities in this respect and offers additional fiscal space to secure essential public services, to finance reforms and policies, to improve the business climate and to allow for sustainable investments in these countries. Part II presents the risk analysis. The risk management framework is an important tool to inform the Commis- sion\u2019s decisions and devise mitigating measures. In 2016 the overall level of risk rose as a result of increased instability factors globally. West and central Africa remains the region with the highest risk profile, but the greatest increase in risks from the previous year is associated with Asia, east and southern Africa, and Latin America, mostly driven by increases in political risks. Part III presents the financial implementation of EU budget support, and the breakdown per region and contract type. Sub-Saharan Africa remains the largest recipient of budget support (42.5 %), followed by the European Neighbourhood (29.2 %), Asia (13.0 %), Latin America (5.4 %), the Caribbean (4.1 %), overseas countries and territories (2.4 %), candidate countries and potential candidates to EU membership (2.3 %) and the Pacific (1.1 %). By type of contract, the sector reform contracts dominate the portfolio with 68 % of the total com- mitments, followed by the state-building contracts (17 %) and good governance and development contracts or former general budget support (15 %). ( 4 ) In line with the 2017 joint communication on a strategic approach to resilience in the EU\u2019s external action (http://eur-lex.europa.eu/ legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:52017JC0021). ",
        "9 Trends and results 2017 Part I \u2014 Selected macroeconomic, fiscal, developmental and sectoral results 1. Poverty and inequality 1.1. Overall trends In terms of extreme poverty (USD 1.90 a day poverty headcount ratio), EU budget support countries have achieved strong gains in the reduction of poverty, which has reduced from almost 35 % to less than 20 % over the last 15 years. Over the same period, other developing countries also reduced extreme poverty but at a sig- nificantly lower pace. These gains are not only driven by solid progress in populous countries such as Bangladesh, Ethiopia, Indonesia, Pakistan and Vietnam but are relatively widespread. The strongest performers over the more recent period are Burkina Faso, Chad, Guinea, Indonesia, Nepal, Niger and Vietnam. In just seven EU budget support countries ( 5 ) did extreme poverty increase over the same period for various country-specific reasons, and in Guinea-Bissau and Tajikistan significantly so. The USD 3.10 poverty rate figures also show an important decline in EU budget support countries, but the trend is closer to other developing countries in this case. 10% 15% 20% 25% 30% 35% 2000-04 2005-09 2010-14 Poverty headcount ratio (USD 1.90 a day) All developing (excl China & India) Budget Support Countries (excl.

Among budget support countries, upper middle income countries (UMICs) exhibit significantly lower bottom 40 % shares compared with low income countries (LICs) and lower middle income countries (LMICs). Some LICs and LMICs, mostly in Latin America but also some sub-Saharan African countries such as Central African Repub- lic, Guinea-Bissau and Togo, have particularly low bottom 40 % income shares. Strategic evaluations over the years point out that developing countries need to do more to distribute gains from economic growth to a wider segment of the population. This is true for both budget support and non-budget support countries. In terms of sector focus, EU budget support focuses strongly on sectors that have a big impact on poverty reduction, such as education, health, agriculture, rural development and food security. 1.2. Regional analysis The graphs below show poverty and inequality data for all regions. Extreme poverty data, as measured by the USD 1.90 international poverty line, is not shown for the European Neighbourhood Policy (ENP) and In- strument for Pre-Accession Assistance (IPA) regions as such measures of extreme poverty are close to zero for most budget support countries in that region. Poverty data on the Caribbean budget support countries is mostly absent. Haiti however has poverty data showing no progress, with the extreme poverty rate remaining close to 55 %. Poverty headcount ratio (USD 1.90 a day) 0% 10% 20% 30% 40% 50% 60% 70% 2000-04 2005-09 2010-14 Asia ESA WCA LA Asia ESA WCA ENP-E ENP-S LA CAR 0% 5% 10% 15% 20% 25% 30% 2000-04 2005-09 2010-14 Income share bottom 40 % Compared with last year\u2019s report, new data is available for a number of sub-Saharan African countries. Whereas previous data pointed to stagnation or an increase in poverty in Burkina Faso, the new data for 2014 shows a substantial decrease in extreme poverty from 55 % to 44 %, accompanied by an increase in the income share of the bottom 20 % from 6.7 % to 8.3 %. Guinea and Niger also managed to achieve similar results. Overall, poverty reduction in sub-Saharan African budget support countries continues on a positive a trend, more so in west and central Africa than in the eastern and southern Africa region, where a slowdown can be observed. The latter is largely due to South Africa, where the rate of poverty reduction declined, and Madagascar, where poverty increased. ",
        "11 Trends and results 2017 Asia continued its sharp reduction of extreme poverty, now close to 10 % in budget support countries, thanks to sustained high economic growth in most of the countries and a wider distribution of the gains than in most other regions. Latin America has also managed to reduce extreme poverty significantly over the last 15 years, with some exceptions. A recent strategic evaluation in Paraguay ( 6 ) showed that budget support had contributed to the significant decrease in poverty by supporting education and social protection policies. Two countries re- mained outside of the positive trend. A particularly low bottom 40 % income share in Honduras and low growth in Guatemala have led to disappointing outcomes, with high poverty levels remaining largely unchanged. In the countries of the Neighbourhood East, recent data on poverty (below USD 3.10 a day) indicate that ex- treme poverty levels are non-existent in Moldova and Ukraine while it still affects Armenia (14.6 % in 2014) and Georgia (25.3 %), with a significant reduction over the last decade. Neighbourhood South countries with budget support operations display a varied picture as regards poverty levels. Extreme poverty has been in decline across the Maghreb region (except Libya), including Tunisia, despite a setback in 2011-2013, However, the poverty rate in Jordan probably increased in 2016 due to the continued impact of the spill-over effect of the Syrian crisis and related refugees. Egypt also recorded a continued, though small, increase in 2015 of poverty levels to 27.8 % on the back of a difficult domestic economic situation. In the enlargement context data indicates that in 2016 poverty declined in all western Balkan beneficiaries receiving budget support. More jobs and low prices have helped reduce poverty, although unemployment is still high. Between 2013 and 2016, the average poverty rates for Albania, Montenegro and Serbia declined by close to 2 percentage points. This translated into approximately 240 000 people out of poverty. 2. Economic growth and macroeconomic stability 2.1. Overview Growth in developing countries continued to decline in 2016 as the effects of the commodity price slump continued to be felt. At the same time, lower world trade volumes and persistent structural impediments to growth in advanced economies has also dampened developing country performance. Countries receiving EU budget support fared better, with growth in LMIC countries in particular showing an upturn in growth in 2016. 0% 1% 2% 3% 4% 5% 6% 7% 8% 9% 2 0 0 4 2 0 0 5 2 0 0 6 2 0 0 7 2 0 0 8 2 0 0 9 2 0 1 0 2 0 1 1 2 0 1 2 2 0 1 3 2 0 1 4 2 0 1 5 2 0 1 7 2 0 1 6 2 0 1 8 Real GDP growth EU Budget support LIC EU Budget support LMIC EU Budget support UMIC 2 0 0 4 2 0 0 5 2 0 0 6 2 0 0 7 2 0 0 8 2 0 0 9 2 0 1 0 2 0 1 1 2 0 1 2 2 0 1 3 2 0 1 4 2 0 1 5 2 0 1 7 2 0 1 6 2 0 1 8 0% 1% 2% 3% 4% 5% 6% 7% 8% Real GDP growth All developing (excl.

In addition, a projected strengthening of the recovery in advanced economies and an as- sociated upturn in world trade growth should also support stronger developing country export performance. The medium-term outlook is nevertheless beset with risks, including continued policy uncertainty, financial tensions and a possible further downturn in commodity prices.

At the same time, however, fiscal deficits remained at around 5 % of GDP, which continued to drive an increase in debt ratios. These trends were broadly mirrored by EU budget support countries, albeit from more favourable levels. Debt developments are of particular concern in a number of countries in sub-Saharan Africa, many of whom benefited from the heavily indebted poor countries (HIPC) initiative. As growth recovers and stronger progress is made in fiscal consolidation, expenditure is projected to decline as a share of GDP.

These trends are less pronounced in coun- tries benefiting from EU budget support, however, where investment levels declined only marginally and current accounts balances improved by less. Commodity prices have recovered somewhat after the significant decline since 2015, but they are still well be- low the average of the 2010-2015 period. A significant number of countries have been experiencing exogenous economic shocks from declining export volumes and export earnings, which reduces their fiscal space. Even after a small recovery of commodity prices, this trend is likely to continue in the medium term. ",

Regional analysis Sub-Saharan African growth of 1.5 % in 2016 was its lowest for two decades. At such low levels, growth is barely sufficient to keep pace with population growth in the region, thus undermining efforts to reduce poverty. The downturn reflects a variety of factors across coun- tries in the region, including lower commodity prices, weak international trade growth, lack of progress over structural reforms, inadequate policy responses and the impact of conflict and/or climate-related shocks. Coun- tries in the region benefiting from EU budget support experienced significantly higher growth on average com- pared to the region as a whole. This in turn is seen in the differing performance in the two principal regions, with west and central Africa maintaining higher growth than budget support recipients in general. The opposite is true in eastern and southern Africa (ESA), where growth was below the average for budget support recipients. This weaker performance in the ESA sub-region is a result of the impact on growth of the drought that affected a number of countries in the region. Growth is expected to increase strongly in 2017 and 2018 as the impact of the drought subsides and rising world trade volumes allow for stronger export-led growth. Lower growth and continued strong investment spending have resulted in continued high fiscal deficits and sharply rising debt in sub-Saharan African countries. From 2012 to 2016, the debt stock in the sub-Saharan African region increased by 20 percentage points of GDP to approach pre-HIPC levels. This has been accompa- nied by an increase in the total debt service to revenue ratio, with commodity exporters facing the most acute challenges. In line with these trends, the risk of debt distress, as analysed under the IMF/World Bank debt sus- tainability analysis, has increased in a number of sub-Saharan African countries. 2 0 0 4 2 0 0 5 2 0 0 6 2 0 0 7 2 0 0 8 2 0 0 9 2 0 1 0 2 0 1 1 2 0 1 2 2 0 1 3 2 0 1 4 2 0 1 5 2 0 1 7 2 0 1 6 2 0 1 8 0% 1% 2% 3% 4% 5% 6% 7% 8% 9% 10% Real GDP growth All Budget Support ESA budget support WCA budget support ",
        "14 BUDGET SUPPORT The economic performance of pre-accession and Neighbourhood East countries showed a continued recovery following their downturns of 2014 and 2015 respectively. This reflects improved prospects in key trading part- ners in the EU and recovery from the dislocations caused by the security crisis in Ukraine. In Neighbourhood South countries, growth declined somewhat and is projected to further decline as regional security concerns and the associated disruption of trade linkages continue to weigh on economic activity. Neighbourhood East budget support countries showed di- verse trends in 2016. Moldova and Ukraine recovered from the security-related contractions of 2015 and Azer- baijan fell into recession following the protracted low oil prices and emerging financial sector vulnerabilities. While growth in Armenia and Georgia remained positive, it was nevertheless below trends of recent years as economic activity in key trading partners slowed and commodity prices remained soft. Prospects for stronger growth in 2017 are favourable in all countries except Azerbaijan, where oil and financial sector vulnerabilities are expected to see a further contraction before recovery in 2018. Over the medium term, a robust economic growth with real GDP increases of 3-5 % is expected in most of the re- gion\u2019s countries. Growth in Neighbourhood South budget support coun- tries remained broadly stable in 2016 with the excep- tion of Morocco and Tunisia, where growth declined due to drought and security-related falls in tourism respectively. In the enlargement context, candidate countries and po- tential candidates continued to recover from the down- turn experienced in 2014. This materialised in sustained export growth and rising domestic demand. Prospects for a continued upswing in growth are favourable as the ex- ternal environment improves, foreign direct investment (FDI) inflows continue to support growth and structural reforms enhance potential. Growth in Asian budget support countries remained strong in 2016 as buoyant domestic demand made up for a small decline in net exports. There are prospects for increased growth as net exports recover, buoyed by sustained demand from key trading partners in China and the United States. Traditional risks of cap- ital flow reversals remain, however, albeit mitigated by improved resilience through deepening domestic financial markets, relatively healthy foreign exchange reserves and flexible exchange rate policies. At the same time, demographic challenges present a medi- um-term challenge to public finances, with the ageing population leading to a projected increase in the de- pendency ratio. \u201310% \u20135% 0% 5% 10% 15% Real GDP growth All Budget Support ENP-E budget support ENP-S budget support IPA budget support 2 0 0 4 2 0 0 5 2 0 0 6 2 0 0 7 2 0 0 8 2 0 0 9 2 0 1 0 2 0 1 1 2 0 1 2 2 0 1 3 2 0 1 4 2 0 1 5 2 0 1 7 2 0 1 6 2 0 1 8 \u20131% 1% 3% 5% 7% 9% Real GDP growth All Budget Support ASIA budget support PAC budget support 2 0 0 4 2 0 0 5 2 0 0 6 2 0 0 7 2 0 0 8 2 0 0 9 2 0 1 0 2 0 1 1 2 0 1 2 2 0 1 3 2 0 1 4 2 0 1 5 2 0 1 7 2 0 1 6 2 0 1 8 \u20131% 1% 3% 5% 7% 9% Real GDP growth All Budget Support LA budget support CAR budget support 2 0 0 4 2 0 0 5 2 0 0 6 2 0 0 7 2 0 0 8 2 0 0 9 2 0 1 0 2 0 1 1 2 0 1 2 2 0 1 3 2 0 1 4 2 0 1 5 2 0 1 7 2 0 1 6 2 0 1 8 ",
        "15 Trends and results 2017 In Pacific budget support beneficiaries, growth was dampened by lower commodity prices and increased vul- nerabilities to climate shocks and natural disasters. From 2017, a recovery in Pacific growth is expected in line with rising commodity prices. Growth in Latin America and the Caribbean budget support countries during 2016 was below the average for all budget support recipients. While all countries across the two regions benefited from the sustained recovery in the United States in 2016, growth prospects are influenced by a range of factors, including continued struc- tural weaknesses, low commodity prices, and heightened vulnerability to climate shocks. From 2017 growth is projected to increase across the two regions, supported by a continued upturn in the US economy and domestic reforms to enhance growth. 3. Fragility and resilience: the contribution of state-building contracts State-building contracts (SBCs) are designed to support countries in fragile situations and have evolved over time to become a significant part of the EU\u2019s portfolio. A 2015 study by the Overseas Development Institute (ODI) ( 7 ) concluded that EU SBCs enable the EU to deploy rapid support mechanisms in difficult contexts in line with donor commitments in the \u2018New deal for engagement in fragile states\u2019. SBCs are ongoing in 21 countries, about a quarter of the budget support countries. SBC contracts represent 11 % of all ongoing budget support operations and 17 % of all ongoing budget support commitments (see Part I, point 1). By the end of 2016, ongoing SBC commitments amounted to EUR 2.2 billion and our forecast shows that the share of SBCs in the overall portfolio has stabilised and is expected to remain on a similar level in the coming years. The average size of an SBC is EUR 93 million, significantly larger than other budget support programmes, representing higher financing needs. Most SBCs are in western and central Africa. Eight of these SBC recipients belong to the group of self-declared fragile and conflict-affected countries in the g7+ ( 8 ), which was the main proponent of the new deal and a major force for SDG 16 (peaceful societies, access to justice, inclusive institutions). Most SBC countries are characterised by structural fragility where the resilience of the state needs to be strengthened. The main areas of focus in SBC contracts are public financial management, health, education, domestic revenue mobilisation and macroeconomic stability. SBCs are subject to a higher degree of risk than other budget support contracts. At the same time, they provide rapid support to preserve essential state functions in a volatile environment where the risk of non-intervention can be considerable and where the speed of intervention can be a determining factor for the success of support. SBC disbursements usually represent a sizeable increase in fiscal space in countries with considerable develop- mental challenges with a strong focus on the delivery of basic social services. SBCs address different challenges of countries affected by fragility and conflicts and their scope differs. The SBCs in Dominica, Fiji, Haiti and Nepal aim at contributing to post-disaster reconstruction. On the other hand, the programmes in Afghanistan, Burkina Faso, Central African Republic, C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire Guinea-Bissau, Madagas- car, Mali, Tunisia and Ukraine provide support to countries undergoing political transition processes. Chad and Mauritania have faced economic shocks. Lastly, SBCs can also target situations of more structural fragility, as in the cases of Guinea, Haiti, Liberia, Niger and Sierra Leone. Despite being affected by fragility and conflicts, SBC countries demonstrate progress in developmental out- comes. Overall, economic growth is relatively high and somewhat delinked from global or regional economic cycles, but vulnerable to shocks. Extreme cases include Central African Republic\u2019s contraction of GDP by 36 % in 2013, Sierra Leone\u2019s 21 % contraction in 2015 and Liberia\u2019s 28 % fall in GDP in 2003.

        "16 BUDGET SUPPORT Data limitations mean that poverty and inequality trends cannot easily be monitored in a short time frame. How- ever, based on data available from the last 15 years, trends in SBC countries could be compared to trends in all budget support countries and to other, non-budget support developing countries. Data from the last 15 years sug- gests that the rate at which extreme poverty has been reduced in SBC countries overall is roughly similar to other budget support countries, but SBC extreme poverty rates are almost double the rates observed on average in all budget support countries. The income share of the bottom 40 % in SBC countries was initially well below the share in other budget support countries, but those shares have gradually converged. The increase in the income share of the bottom 40 % might imply that future growth has a higher propensity to translate into poverty reduction. 2000-04 2005-09 2010-14 Poverty headcount ratio (USD 1.90 a day) 10% 15% 20% 25% 30% 35% 40% 45% 50% 55% 60% Budget Support Countries (excl.

Guin- ea-Bissau and Madagascar, on the other hand, saw poverty increase. The key macroeconomic aggregates in SBC countries are presented in the four graphics (IMF World Economic Outlook) below. Overall, fiscal deficits have deteriorated from the surpluses seen before the global economic crisis, but they remain close to 3 % of GDP and have not deteriorated as much as in other budget support coun- tries. Only Liberia, Niger and Togo have a deficit estimated above 6 % for 2016. Debt relief has contributed to a substantial reduction in debt levels from close to 100 % of GDP to around 40 %, close to levels seen in other budget support countries.

        "17 Trends and results 2017 Government expenditure (% GDP) was initially particularly low in SBC countries and well below other budget support countries or developing countries overall. However, SBC countries have succeeded in increasing domes- tic revenues and thereby facilitating an expansion of government expenditure to finance public services. This increase in domestic revenues since 2013 took place in most SBC countries, while domestic revenues in other developing countries declined. Central African Republic however saw a sharp decline to a record low of 5 % of GDP in domestic revenues before recovering to an estimated 7 %. Other countries which remain hampered by a particularly low level of domestic revenue mobilisation include Afghanistan, Madagascar and Sierra Leone. Fighting corruption is a significant challenge and, despite improvements in other budget support countries, the situation continues to deteriorate in SBC countries. This requires particular attention, monitoring and compre- hensive mitigating measures. \u20130.9 \u20130.8 \u20130.7 \u20130.6 \u20130.5 \u20130.4 \u20130.3 \u20130.2 \u20130.10 2000 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 WGI \u2013 Control of corruption SBC Countries Other Budget Support Countries All developing Source: World Bank \u2014 World Governance Indicators. A review of public expenditure and financial accountability (PEFA) results suggests that public financial man- agement (PFM) systems in SBC countries perform worse than other budget support countries. The difference is most notable in relation to external scrutiny and audit where SBC PEFA results in SBC countries are particularly poor. It is, however, encouraging that progress takes place in most dimensions and in particular in those which can be considered as more closely related to core PFM functions such as budget predictability and control, ac- counting, recording and reporting. Furthermore, while PEFA results in SBC countries are usually below scores in other budget support countries, they are similar to those measured in non-budget support developing countries. External audit is the area which stands out as particularly challenging in SBC countries and deserves attention.

        "18 BUDGET SUPPORT 4. Domestic public finance 4.1. Public financial management The EU\u2019s preferred means of assessing PFM performance is the PEFA tool. Budget support has greatly facilitated the adoption of the PEFA with virtually all budget support countries having undergone at least one PEFA assess- ment ( 9 ), whereas the total number of PEFAs performed since its adoption is more than 300 (as of end 2016). The European Commission has also played an important role in the most comprehensive upgrade of the PEFA framework since it was first published in 2005. The new PEFA framework introduced in 2016 incorporates new and updated benchmarks that reflect the changing landscape of PFM reforms and the evolution of good prac- tices over the last decade. The new framework has already been used in some countries receiving EU budget support (e.g. Morocco, Niger and Tanzania). PEFA results continue to suggest progress across the different PFM dimensions ( 10 ), albeit at a slow pace, as shown in the chart below. Overall, progress can be noted in all six dimensions and encouragingly, it is more significant in areas which had the lowest PEFA scores, notably predictability and control in budget execution and external scrutiny and audit. This positive finding is echoed in a number of recent studies and strategic evaluations such as the 2014 evaluation of budget support covering four low income countries ( 11 ) (i.e. Mali, Mozambique, Tanzania and Zambia), and the 2014 evaluation by Danida (Danish cooperation), which notes \u2018strengthening of PFM systems appears to be one of the most common, positive effects of budget support across countries\u2019.

Asian budget sup- port countries\u2019 PEFA results were initially below average but have caught up substantially. PEFA results in Latin American and the Caribbean on the other hand have stagnated. In sub-Saharan Africa, west and central Africa lags behind the east and southern Africa region but shows a faster improvement. Apart from the PEFA, more in-depth diagnostic tools have also been developed to identify specific weaknesses in certain PFM areas. These include Public Investment Management Assessments (PIMA), Fiscal Transparency Evaluations (FTE), the Methodology for Assessing Procurement Systems (MAPS), the Public\u2013Private Partnership Fiscal Risk Assessment Model (P-FRAM) and the Tax Administration Diagnostic Assessment Tool (TADAT). ( 13 ) This may be explained by the introduction of the new PEFA methodology and the impact of external shocks on the PFM reform efforts. ",
        "20 BUDGET SUPPORT 4.2. Corruption Monitoring corruption trends and measures to fight corruption is not straightforward. Changes in countries\u2019 capacity to fight corruption take time. Nevertheless, some trends can be observed using the Worldwide Govern- ance Indicator (WGI) on control of corruption ( 14 ). These suggest a modest but steady improvement in the control of corruption in budget support countries over the last decade. This positive trend has taken place while other developing countries saw a worsening trend. \u20130.65 \u20130.6 \u20130.55 \u20130.5 \u20130.45 \u20130.4 \u20130.35 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 World Governance Indicator \u2013 Control of corruption (2005-2015) Interpretation: the higher score, the lower perception of corruption BS recipients Other aid recipients All aid recipients Transparency International\u2019s Corruption Perception Index (CPI) ( 15 ) suggests a similar trend for budget support countries. The difference is not as large as for the WGI but the progress appears to be stronger in budget support recipient countries. While the two groups of countries started in 2005 at the same level (around a score 30.5), the difference in 2016 exceeds five points (with an average score of 36.7 in budget support recipient countries, compared to an average of 31.5 in other assistance recipients and a rather declining trend in their case). 20 22 24 26 28 30 32 34 36 38 40 Corruption Perception Index (2005-2016) Interpretation: the higher score, the lower corruption perception Other aid recipients BS recipients All aid recipients methodological change 2 0 0 5 2 0 0 6 2 0 0 7 2 0 0 8 2 0 0 9 2 0 1 0 2 0 1 1 2 0 1 2 2 0 1 3 2 0 1 4 2 0 1 5 2 0 1 6 ( 14 ) The WGI on the control of corruption is a composite indicator measuring perceptions of the extent to which public power is exercised for private gain, including both petty and grand forms of corruption, as well as \u2018capture\u2019 of the state by elites and private interests. Scores range from \u2013 2.5 for \u2018weak governance\u2019 to + 2.5 for \u2018strong governance\u2019. Results should be interpreted with care as they are subject to important standards errors. ( 15 ) The index rates countries on a scale from 0 for \u2018most corrupt\u2019 to 100 for \u2018least corrupt\u2019. It measures the perception of corruption as a proxy for the level of corruption, which cannot be measured directly. Comparisons over time with the corruption perception index should be interpreted with care. In addition, the methodology was updated between 2011 and 2012, inducing a change in scores for all countries. ",
        "21 Trends and results 2017 The issues of corruption and fraud continue to be addressed through budget support, but 2016 could be de- fined as a year of diversification. Traditionally, the approach to fighting corruption has centred on public finance management reforms aimed at strengthening accountability mechanisms, such as budget transparency and asset declarations. While this undoubtedly helps control corruption, lessons learned show that the effectiveness of anti-corruption measures is maximised by a combination of complementary (top-down and bottom-up) approaches and success driven by the interaction of a number of reforms introduced simultaneously ( 16 ). For instance, alongside the introduction of actions aiming at controlling corruption, support for justice independence and impartiality is gradually finding its well-deserved place in EU budget support operations. Fight against corruption in the good governance and development contract in Benin (2016-2020) The programme was designed on the basis of the recommendations of the Benin National Integrity Assess- ment System performed by Transparency International (carried out in full agreement and close association with the government). As a result, the programme includes, within the same framework, support as regards PFM, justice and the private sector to help improve Benin\u2019s integrity mechanisms. The objectives of the good governance and development contract (GGDC) are: \u2022 to contribute to transparent public finance management, in particular in terms of resource mobilisa- tion and expenditure management; \u2022 to set up a credible system to fight corruption based on justice independence; \u2022 to improve the business climate through the implementation of reforms in support of competitiveness and the legal security of investments. This multi-sector approach contributes to the implementation of a credible anti-corruption system. Beyond the judiciary, and depending on the partner country context, this approach allows the connection to be strengthened between a wide array of sectors and stakeholders when dealing with corruption. In terms of sectors, these include public administration reforms, security sector reforms, improvement of the business environment and customs reforms. As for stakeholders, the EU\u2019s response will come in support of those exercising oversight and control functions: civil society, the media, whistle-blowers and human rights defenders, as well as supreme audit institutions and parliaments. 4.3. Budgetary transparency and oversight The 2015 Open Budget Index suggests that budget support countries continue to demonstrate more budg- etary transparency, with an average rating of 44 against 39 in other recipients of assistance. Furthermore, where repeated assessments are available, budget support countries demonstrate progress on average, albeit sometimes from a low initial level. The most outstanding examples of improvements are Benin, Burkina Faso, Georgia, Kyrgyzstan, Peru, Rwanda, Senegal and Sierra Leone. The transparency-related PEFA indicators confirm these results, although the positive difference with other developing countries is more limited. Transparency is a necessary but insufficient step towards greater accountability, and a focus is needed in par- ticular on oversight functions in budget support countries. Some of the new budget support contracts include such a focus on oversight functions, including external audit functions and parliamentary but also civic over- sight. Moreover, the EU is providing oversight institutions with a lot of direct support beside budget support. The eligibility criterion on transparency and oversight of the budget is defined as the full disclosure of all rele- vant fiscal information in a timely and systematic manner. Since the introduction of this criterion (2012), budget support programmes have processed and monitored transparency issues and fostered the disclosure of rele- vant fiscal information in countries where the situation was critical prior to the introduction. In countries where the starting point was very low, the criterion resulted in an incentive for the publication of these data. ( 16 ) See https://www.transparency.org/files/content/corruptionqas/Successful_anti-corruption_reforms.pdf ",
        "22 BUDGET SUPPORT This criterion serves also to strengthen the dialogue with new actors, within the executive with sectorial minis- tries but also with external control bodies (Parliament, Court of Auditors and civil society).

Domestic revenue mobilisation and illicit financial flows Support to domestic revenue mobilisation (DRM) remained a priority for the European Commission in its devel- opment cooperation in 2016. This has been reconfirmed in the new European Consensus on Development that identifies DRM as an essential driver for sustainable growth and development. Following the 2015 Addis Ababa Financing for Development Conference and the presentation of its \u2018Collect more \u2014 Spend better\u2019 approach ( 17 ), the European Commission intensified its support to DRM to the benefit of our partner countries, in line with our commitment to the Addis Tax Initiative. This materialised through active participation in the Platform for the Collaboration on Tax and close coopera- tion with the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), the World Bank and the UN. This implied increasing financial support to global or regional fora, trust funds or instruments in that field (e.g. UN Committee of Experts on International Tax, IMF Revenue Mobilisation Trust Fund, IMF Trust Fund for the Management of Natural Resource Wealth or the Tax Administration Diagnos- tic Assessment Tool (TADAT)). This translated into improved guidance on DRM in the updated budget support guidelines. Have you got your TADAT? The TADAT is an international diagnostic tool that provides an objective and standardised performance as- sessment of a country\u2019s tax administration system. Whereas PEFA gives a global picture of the PFM country system, TADAT provides an in-depth assessment of a tax administration\u2019s performances. Like PEFA assess- ments, a TADAT helps country authorities and development partners: to identify and understand the relative strengths and weaknesses of the tax administration system; to set reform objectives; and to establish and sequence reform priorities. In 2016 the Commission provided a EUR 2 million grant to support the TADAT secretariat. Since 2015 more than 40 TADATs have been completed (including pilots).

        "23 Trends and results 2017 All these actions meet the recommendations by the European Court of Auditors in its report ( 18 ) on the use of budget support to support revenue mobilisation in nine LICs and LMICs in sub-Saharan Africa (Cape Verde, Cen- tral African Republic, Mali, Mauritania, Mozambique, Niger, Rwanda, Senegal and Sierra Leone). They conclude that, while the Commission\u2019s approach led to better needs assessments, the inclusion of DRM in budget support contracts needs to be further strengthened. An increased engagement with national authorities has been observed in our bilateral programmes in support of good economic governance and notably in the context of budget support contracts. The emphasis on DRM in EU political documents and in the updated guidelines will take it a step further. PEFA indicators suggest that budget support countries have made progress in strengthening tax administration and achieve better tax-related PEFA results than other developing countries. As can be seen in the graphs, PI-13 and PI-14 indicators for budget support countries show improved performance over time and also display, compared to other developing countries, better results in budget support countries. The results as regards the PI-15 are less straightforward, but this mostly stems from the fact that PI-15 covers, among other aspects, the level of tax arrears, which does not necessarily correlate to the effectiveness of the tax collection system ( 19 ).

( 19 ) For instance, a major tax assessment may substantially increase the amount of tax arrears identified by the authorities. This may prove a positive development so as to inform a process of tax arrears collection afterwards. ",
        "24 BUDGET SUPPORT The Commission also had to address the challenges faced by resource-dependent countries. In 2016 low com- modity prices continued to erode both export earnings and revenue collection. Fiscal pressures required large adjustments in some countries. This volatility of revenue from extractive industries led many countries to a focus on non-natural resource revenue. Roughly 40 % of the countries receiving EU budget support are resource-rich, but they are often affected by significant governance issues ( 20 ) and sometimes under risk of debt distress ( 21 ). Thanks to the entry points of- fered by budget support contracts, the Commission has continued strengthening its policy dialogue with national authorities in relation to the macroeconomic and PFM eligibility criteria. This dialogue, and related support for capacity development, targeted the complexity of the extractive industries\u2019 fiscal regimes, the potential impact on national budgets of extractive industry tax reforms and helping countries to generate more revenues out of their natural resources endowments. These actions on a bilateral basis are complemented by a strong involvement of the Commission in global initiatives, such as the Extractive Industry Transparency Initiative (EITI) ( 22 ), and trust funds, such as the Extrac- tives Global Programmatic Support Multi-Donor Trust Fund (EGPS-MDTF) financing technical assistance to help countries comply with the EITI requirements. This agenda also implies advocating for more transparency from international companies around the world. The EU\u2019s longstanding political commitment towards transparency crystallised in its revised accounting and transparency directives, which de facto have become an international reference as regards financial disclo- sure. The EU encourages other countries to adhere to these standards in order to establish a level playing field with the same reporting requirements for all concerned companies, regardless of the country where they are headquartered. 4.5. Debt management Borrowing patterns of developing countries have changed significantly in recent years. They take on more and more debt to finance huge infrastructure needs and bridge the gap caused by low commodity prices and de- creasing demand for some of their export products. Due to the favourable environment, they also have easier access to international capital markets and many have started to issue Eurobonds in recent years. As a result, the risk of debt distress has been increasing in many countries, as also clear from the IMF\u2019s debt sustainability analysis (DSA) and our risk assessment exercise. The EU has supported both upstream and downstream debt management capacity strengthening initiatives for developing countries. Upstream activities typically focus on debt management diagnostics using the Debt Management Performance Assessment tool (DeMPA), debt sustainability analysis (DSA), medium-term debt strategy development and reform plans. Downstream activities focus on operational functions such as effective debt recording and reporting, IT support systems, operational risk management and annual borrowing plans. In addition, budget support allows us to have a regular and engaged dialogue on debt and investment issues and to monitor the risks associated with them on a regular basis together with partner countries. DeMPA has been developed to assess countries\u2019 debt management capacities and evaluate progress over time. 35 countries have undergone two consecutive DeMPA assessments so far. The results suggest that capacity-strengthening efforts have contributed to important progress in several dimensions, but also show that many dimensions still score below the minimum requirement. It is therefore clear that debt management capacity requires substantial further strengthening in most countries. ( 20 ) Of the 81 countries included in the Resource Governance Index, 47 are classified by the IMF as resource-rich, with oil, gas or minerals dominating the economy. The majority of these countries exhibit weak, poor or failing resource governance in index assessments.

Agriculture, food security, and rural development (SDG 2) Experience with sector reform contracts (SRCs) in the field of food and nutrition security and sustainable agricul- ture (FNSSA) shows some distinctive features, notably arising from the multi-dimensional nature of such policies. 0 50 100 150 200 250 m i l l i o n \u20ac M a l i I v o r y C o a s t S e n e g a l B u r k i n a F a s o R w a n d a N i g e r B e n i n * B h u t a n N e p a l * B o l i v i a C o l u m b i a H o n d u r a s T r i n i d a d & T o b a g o M o l d o v a G u a t e m a l a A r m e n i a G e o r g i a M o r o c c o Food and nutrition security and sustainable agriculture \u2013 Ongoing SRCs \u2013 Total of about 1.2 billion \u20ac The FNSSA sectors usually involve many different ministries or agencies (e.g. agriculture, livestock, fisheries, environment, forestry, health), with their own specific strategies. The EU approach brings agriculture and rural development together with food and nutrition security. However, in many countries these particular sectors are set out in a separated, unarticulated manner, under the responsibility of different ministries that hardly com- municate with each other. ",
        "26 BUDGET SUPPORT The FNSSA SRCs are instrumental in contributing to further intersectorial coordination. Equally SRCs encourage finance ministries to engage with the relevant ministries on strategic issues (e.g. in Benin, Mali and Senegal). The use of budget support and related opportunities positions the EU as a key player in this field. Interestingly nutrition is gaining further attention and support in the context of budget support. The budget support modality was not used at all in 2014 for nutrition purposes. It was used in two countries in 2015 (Hon- duras, Senegal) and in three others in 2016 (Burkina Faso, Niger, Rwanda), leading to a very steep increase of commitments \u2014 of almost EUR 130 million \u2014 by the end of 2016. Four countries illustrate the diversity of operations in the FNSSA field: Colombia, where budget support assists the country in upgrading its dairy sector; Ivory Coast, where it supports specifically land tenure reform; Georgia, where it helps sector modernisation; and Morocco where it combines a focus on small farmers with sustaina- bility objectives. In Colombia, the dairy sector policy aims at: (i) improving productivity, processing and marketing; (ii) encour- aging horizontal and vertical integration of the value chain; (iii) increasing competitiveness through productive conglomerates; (iv) supplying safe dairy products for local consumption and external markets; and (v) fostering a common framework for sector coordinate. Given the strategic nature of this economic activity, the government of Colombia increased its related budget allocation from EUR 5.4 million in 2011 to around EUR 27 million in 2015. The policy has enabled more than 32 000 producers to benefit from technical assistance to implement sustainable agricultural practices over 19 600 further hectares. One of the main achievements of the policy has been the revision of the system of payment for raw milk, valuing solids content (grams of fat and protein) and encouraging certification. As a result, the incomes of smallholders increased by 8 % and 3.344 million of litres of milk now comply with the quality requirements of the formal market.

For instance, 723 small or medium enterprises operating in the processing, distribution and marketing of milk received support, through loans and guaran- tees. The government of Colombia, together with businesses, is now looking at ways to unlock the potential of dairy products in terms of differentiation and position Colombia on more competitive and environment-sen- sitive markets. The upscaling of cooperative business models is also being explored as they have proved to be successful, in terms of service delivery, innovation, value added creation, improving bargaining power and income distribution. In another region, C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire has emerged from a political crisis which began in 1999 and came to an end in 2011-2012. This crisis, and the years of tension that preceded it, were rooted in the dual problem of citizenship and land ownership, particularly in rural areas. Agriculture employs 46 % of the active population and remains the basis of the national economy with 22 % of GDP, 75 % of non-oil export earnings and two thirds of Ivorian households\u2019 income. Given the repeated conflicts over the land issue, C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire adopted ",
        "27 Trends and results 2017 a rural land act in December 1998 and, despite the crisis, the EU has continued to pursue dialogue with the Government on land policy over the last 10 years. This effort is now supported through an SRC focusing on delimitation of village territories, land certificates, pre- vention of conflicts and strengthening of both central and local authorities. Land tenure reform is a complex and sensitive issue that will require the attention of the Ivorian government for the next 15 to 20 years. Therefore the SRC is supporting C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire at a crucial step in such a long-term reform. In doing so, the SRC is encour- aging various stakeholders to have their say in the process, so that all dimensions can be taken into account. For instance, land tenure reform should not be implemented at the expense of food and nutrition security for the most vulnerable people and key aspects such as plot size or land fertility need to be factored into the process. The rural development programme in Georgia has helped to change the way small farmers conduct business. With a total of 1 600 farmers cooperatives established and with an enriched offer that covers a range of products like dairy, wine, vegetables and fish, the farmers have been empowered to reach large-scale markets. Moreover, Geor- gian farmers have benefited from the latest information on new technologies, training and best practices made available by 59 newly established regional consultation centres. EU standards in the food safety, sanitary and phytosanitary sectors have brought higher-quality products to consumers both in Georgia and in the EU. For the past 8 years, the EU has been Morocco\u2019s partner in the agricultural and rural development sector. In 2016 this translated into an increase of 37 % in the agricultural sector GDP. Through EU support more than 600 local projects covering an area of 1.6 million hectares have been launched with an investment of EUR 1.3 billion and benefiting 950 000 stakeholders. With a focus on smallholders, budget support has contributed to two of the main livelihoods of the Moroccan rural population: the olive oil industry and cultivation of dates. This has generated new employment (estimated at 1.2 million working days) and the planting of more than 110 000 bayoud-resistant palm trees and facilitated training for more than 200 project stakeholders in 2015 and 2016. 5.2. Health (SDG 3) As of the end of 2016, 10 countries were implementing an SRC in the health sector, with notably examples in Ethiopia and Peru that started towards the end of 2016. However the programme in Egypt is on hold, like other SRCs in the country. New health SRCs are in preparation for Grenada and Tajikistan. Overall progress in terms of maternal and child health has been significant. Between 1990 and 2015, the global under-five mortality rate declined by more than 50 % worldwide, dropping from 90 to 43 deaths per 1 000 live births. Between 1990 and 2013, the maternal mortality ratio declined by 45 % worldwide, and most of the reduction has occurred since 2000. The evolution of these indicators has many contributing factors, but in countries where there is an SRC, progress compares favourably to the average, especially for LICs, even though it remains unequal. 0 20 40 60 80 100 120 140 160 180 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 Child mortality rate (under 5, per 1 000 live births) Burkina Faso Ethiopia Ghana Liberia Morocco Peru Philippines South Africa Vietnam ",
        "28 BUDGET SUPPORT The Health SDG aims at strengthening health systems in order to achieve universal health coverage (targets 3.1 to 3.9). Given this new context, the framework under which some SRCs operate will most likely broaden to include health determinants, with direct support to health sectors still being essential. For example, the water and sanitation SRC in Solomon Islands is labelled as a health SRC. Most SRCs are well advanced in their implementation. Burkina-Faso, Ghana and Liberia were supported with SRCs that have been producing results in maternal and child mortality in challenging contexts. In Liberia, due to the Ebola crisis, budget support funds were frontloaded to counter a possible pandemic but the technical assistance component is still ongoing. The other SRCs (e.g. in Morocco, the Philippines and Vietnam) are more anchored in the context of health sector reforms and results achieved in that context are very promising. The Vietnam SRC addresses health system strengthening in the 10 poorest provinces. Likewise, in the Phil- ippines, the health sector has made good progress in doubling the budget for reducing inequalities further, notably through assigning more human resources to remote areas, and providing health insurance coverage to senior citizens. In Morocco, the health sector has also achieved positive results, notably with the increase of ob- stetrical references to health facilities, of medically assisted births and of diabetics treated in health facilities, which have all showed a steep improvement beyond expectations. In all the countries, public financial management remains a critical issue in the health sector and support to this component of health policies has received greater attention in the context of EU SRCs in terms of assessment, policy dialogue and support for capacity development. 5.3. Education (SDG 4) As of the end of 2016, there were 20 budget support operations in the education sector in 20 countries, com- prising: (i) five new SRCs, respectively in Greenland, Nepal, Niger, Paraguay and Turks and Caicos Islands, for a total committed amount of approximately EUR 218 million; and (ii) 15 ongoing SRCs, respectively in Aruba, Bangladesh, Barbados, Cambodia, Dominican Republic, India, Indonesia, Jordan, Kyrgyzstan, Morocco, Namibia, Nepal, Pakistan, Seychelles and South Africa for a total committed amount of approximately EUR 930 million. 0 20 40 60 80 100 120 140 Primary completion rate, 2005-2015 2005 2011 2015 B a n g l a d e s h A r u b a ( N L ) B a r b a d o s B o t s w a n a C a m b o d i a D o m i n i c a n R e p u b l i c I n d i a I n d o n e s i a J o r d a n K y r g y z s t a n M o r o c c o N a m i b i a N e p a l S e y c h e l l e s N i g e r P a k i s t a n P a r a g u a y In terms of results (SDG 4.1), the general trend in recent years continues to be positive. Children in developing countries around the world are increasingly completing primary. In partner countries benefiting from an SRC in education, the primary completion rate (PCR) stands at 95.4 %, which is relatively higher that the average for all the partner countries (88.9 %). The completion rate for lower secondary education in SRC partner countries stands at 61.2 %, against an aver- age of 57.7 % in all partner countries. Niger presents the lowest rate (16.0 %), followed by Cambodia (48.0 %) and Pakistan (52.1 %). Nevertheless, these three countries have recorded the highest relative increases over the period, which shows the need for long-term commitment. ",

In SRC partner countries, the literacy rate stands at 83.3 %. The lowest rates can be found in sub-Saharan Africa, with 75.5 %, although this has increased by 5.4 percentage points since 2005.

The new SRC builds on the lessons learned from the previous programme, whose implementation has been proven effective as confirmed by a budget support evaluation in 2016 ( 23 ). Likewise, quality of learning is also a major priority for the SRC in Cambodia, where the commitment of the government to the sector reform has successfully translated into increased budget allocations. Regular policy dialogue proves particularly effective in helping to better understand the key challenges related to school com- pletion and dropout as well as to build local technical capacity. Particular attention has been paid also to early childhood education, where the number of public pre-schools has more than doubled in the last 8 years, from ( 23 ) See Strategic evaluation of budget support in Paraguay 2006-2014 (https://ec.europa.eu/europeaid/evaluation-budget-support- paraguay-2006-2014_en). ",
        "30 BUDGET SUPPORT 1 634 schools in 2007/2008 to 3 443 in 2015/2016, and the enrolment in pre-primary schools has grown by 2.5 times since 2007/2008. Avoiding \u2018lost generations\u2019 in crisis-affected countries is another major challenge. In Jordan, through the SRC, the EU has supported schooling \u2014 from pre-school to higher education \u2014 for Syrian refugees and host com- munities \u2014 by building new classrooms, supporting teachers (e.g. stipends and training), providing learning materials, funding scholarships, increasing access to assessment services or to psychosocial support to secure continuous learning opportunities for Jordanian and Syrian children. In Pakistan, in newly pacified areas, the EU assists the authorities in providing temporary learning spaces, water and sanitation facilities, teaching materials and empowerment activities to enable some 45 000 young people, 1 000 teachers and 6 000 households to return to their villages. In Nepal, the earthquakes of April and May 2015, the subsequent fuel crisis in 2016 and agitation in some parts of the country following the promulgation of a new constitution severely impacted the education sector. Nev- ertheless, the Ministry of Education reacted swiftly by creating the Nepal Education Cluster with development partners and providing grants to establish 12 000 temporary learning centres. This allowed continuous delivery of education services and contributed to normalising the situation. Despite the large setbacks in some districts affected by the quake, the education sector has experienced progress in terms of access and gender parity at all levels. 5.4. Employment and social protection (SDGs 1, 4, 8 and 10) Employment/vocational education and training Eight countries are benefiting from an SRC in the field of employment and vocational education and training (VET): Albania, Armenia, Dominican Republic, Georgia, Jordan, Moldova, Morocco and Turks and Caicos Islands. The VET sector is central in these countries. In Moldova, in 2015, the vocational programme students represent- ed 43.4 % of the total number of upper secondary students. It is also proven that proactive policies for VET help increase the overall employment rate and reduce the number of 15-29-year-olds not in employment, education or training (25 % to 35 % in these countries). It also addresses the gender gap in employment (for instance, in Dominican Republic the unemployment rate amounted to 8.7 % for men and 23.1 % for women respectively). In Turks and Caicos Islands, the education sector policy is supported with an element of VET stimulating the participation of private resources in providing continuous education and training opportunities. All SRCs support the modernisation of the country VET system to make it more responsive to labour market needs and address the skills mismatch, thereby providing enterprises with the required competencies, increas- ing their productivity and enhancing the competitiveness of the economy. This process implies upgrading the quality of the training offer and putting in place quality assurance and certification systems in this respect. Each SRC has a specific focus according to the country context, for instance the strengthening of active labour market measures for the most vulnerable groups of jobseekers in Albania or embedding the VET in the overall strategy for agriculture and rural development in Armenia. In Morocco, emphasis is put on job creation by small and medium enterprises within a national employment strategy which adequately combines the economic (creating many more decent jobs) and the social (addressing social inequalities including territorial disparities). This involves equipping people with the appropriate skills to create their own job and become an entrepreneur, as well providing lifelong learning opportunities for all. Budget support contributes to making the policy framework more conducive to results. For instance, it has allowed government commitments to be translated into additional funding for the sector in Georgia, where em- ployment rate has improved from 63.2 % in 2010 to 68.8 % in 2015. It has also encouraged the government to engage with employers and build partnerships with the private sector, as in Dominican Republic, Turks and Caicos Islands or Georgia, again, or to strengthen the role of social partners, as in Jordan. ",
        "31 Trends and results 2017 Results in the field of employment and VET are obviously dependent on many factors and particularly on eco- nomic developments as well as on demographic growth. Average annual unemployment rates for the period 2010-2015 are as follows: Albania (15.3 %), Armenia (17.8 %), Dominican Republic (14.5 %), Georgia (14.2 %), Jordan (12.5 %), Moldova (5.6 %) and Morocco (9.3 %). Youth unemployment rates remain high while there have been reductions in Armenia (from 38.9 % in 2010 to 32.5 % in 2015), Georgia (from 36.4 % to 30.8 %) and Moldova (from 17.8 % to 12.8 %). In Albania, the youth un- employment rate has increased (from 22.5 % in 2010 to 33.2 % in 2015). It has also increased, even though to a lesser extent, in Jordan (from 28.1 % to 30.8 %) and Morocco (from 17.6 % to 20.8 %). It is also interesting to note that in these contexts, SRCs address the quality as well as the level of employment and the creation of decent jobs. Social protection At the end of 2016, El Salvador, Kyrgyzstan, Morocco, Paraguay, Peru and Tajikistan had ongoing sector reform contracts in the area of social protection. In Bangladesh, the EU also started exploring the possibilities of a budget support contract to assist the national social security strategy. In Latin America, EU programmes in the area of social protection have supported governments in increasing the effectiveness and expanding the coverage of their social protection policies, which entail a number of social assistance programmes targeting disadvantaged groups and/or regions characterised by high poverty indica- tors. In El Salvador for instance, budget support contributed to providing the most vulnerable with core services and increasing their access to education, health, nutrition, food security, housing and community infrastructure. In Paraguay, this approach has been complemented by a conditional cash transfer scheme directed at poor families. The social protection policy has also expanded in terms of coverage with the support of EU budget support and, for example, the coverage of the social pension for older adults increased significantly from 20 000 people in 2011 to more than 150 000 in 2015. Setting up and advancing social protection schemes also require strong coordination both horizontally between central departments (e.g. health, education, housing or agricul- ture) and vertically between the different levels of government. The SRC in Peru ensured that due attention was paid to governance and efficiency in the implementation of the social protection strategy, allowing gains to be reinvested in the delivery of integrated basic social services towards the poorest quintiles and in districts where the Amazonian population mostly lives. Evaluation of EU budget support contracts in Paraguay in 2006-2014 The external evaluation highlighted significant contributions to progress in the education sector as well as for social protection, as stated by the executive summary of the final evaluation report ( 24 ). \u2018 Regarding the effectiveness of the EU budget support operations, there is no doubt that in the education and social protection sectors, EU operations achieved a higher-than-expected impact in relation to their financial weight. With an average contribution of \u20ac11 million over 5 years of implementation (equivalent to just over 1 % of the annual net education budget), the PASEP [support to education] proved to be strategic in facilitat- ing an increase [of] the very constrained capital budget. The PALFP [support to the fight against poverty] and the PAPPDS [support to social development policy] made possible the allocation of funds for spending pro- grammes and actions complementary to the flagship programmes Tekopor\u00e1, Abrazo and Adultos Mayores, as part of a strategy to introduce a base level [set of minimum services] of social protection for vulnerable groups. The policy dialogue between the EU and the Government also played an important role in the development of content of social policies. From its formulation, the logic of the PASEP contributed to the achievement of a change in the working method of the Ministry of Education and Culture, facilitating the transition from an input-based logic to a more sectoral-planning oriented logic focused on the achievement of specific outcomes prioritised within the sectoral policy. In the case of the Social Protection sector, the use of indicators and var- iable tranches in the budget support operations had an important impact on the internal dialogue within the ( 24 ) See https://ec.europa.eu/europeaid/evaluation-budget-support-paraguay-2006-2014_en ",
        "32 BUDGET SUPPORT Government of Paraguay, fostering exchanges between the Ministry of Finance, the Social Policy Unit and the line Ministries, under whose mandate resided the fulfilment of the indicators chosen for the variable tranches. The effectiveness of the operations derived directly from the nature of the Budget Support modality. This format introduced positive contributions in terms of ownership, fostering of policy improvements, capacity building, and improved sectoral outcomes, as well as achieving 100 % levels of budget execution. The percep- tion of the sector institutions is that budget support funds and the policy dialogue have been more effective and efficient than project-based support.\u2019 The social protection systems in central Asia consist of a mix of schemes inherited from the Soviet era and new programmes introduced since independence. The EU is supporting Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan in the modernisa- tion and rationalisation of their social protection systems, in order to increase both the coverage towards poor people and the level of benefits. In addition, a new SRC on social protection was approved in Morocco at the end of 2016. The new programme seeks to consolidate the achievements of past budget support operations in the areas of health, education and human development through supporting the ongoing national policy reforms in social protection. This need stems from a very fragmented set of social security programmes (140 programmes according to Unicef\u2019s mapping) and a limited coverage of the population (about 30 %). The programme aims to support an integrat- ed social protection policy favouring the improvement of governance and fiscal transparency, institutional and financial rationalisation, facilitation of dialogue with civil society and social partners and the promotion of best practices in insurance and social assistance. 5.5. Migration (SDGs 5, 8 and 10) The root causes of migration are addressed through many budget support contracts, but often indirectly. For instance, every operation which supports progress in terms of education, training and job creation is expected to have a significant impact on migration. Likewise, in situations of fragility, the implementation of SBCs clearly contributes to keeping the basic public capacities functioning, including border controls, and to contributing to stabilisation, thereby avoiding putting more people on the road. Migration management in itself is singled out in a few cases. Following the action plan of the Valetta Summit and the launch of the EU Emergency Trust Fund for Africa, the EU initiated in November 2016 a budget support contract in Niger aiming to strengthen the capacities of the judiciary and internal security forces to fight against the smuggling of migrants and trafficking of human beings. The programme will foster coordination and allow the legal and strategic framework for enhanced border man- agement to be updated. The programme complements the ongoing SBC implemented to mitigate the effects of the security situation and reinforce some basic state functions. In another context, a budget support programme is being implemented in Georgia to provide durable housing solutions to internally displaced persons (IDPs) and to raise both them and their host communities out of ex- treme poverty and lessen their dependence on the state. As of December 2016, the programme had helped the government to relocate 52 % of the total number of IDPs present in Georgia; these have been relocated to new housing that meets international heating and water standards and the government is offering the possibility of preferential purchase to IDPs. With the support of the programme, the government is currently working on the shift from a status- to a needs-based approach and is reviewing, for that purpose, the legal IDP status which is currently hereditary (rights are transferred from parents to children automatically).

        "33 Trends and results 2017 5.6. Water and sanitation (SDG 6) Nine countries are implementing an SRC in the water and sanitation sector (Burkina Faso, Bolivia, Cook Islands, Egypt, Honduras, S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe, Solomon Islands, Tunisia and Western Samoa). As explained above, these SRCs encompass different aspect of the water and sanitation sector and can equally be considered rele- vant for health or environmental policies. In Egypt and Tunisia, the SRC focuses on the implementation of a sector policy for agricultural water. In the Cook Islands, the SRC focuses on improving access to sanitation. In Bolivia and Burkina Faso, it aims at improving access to safe drinking water and basic sanitation. Most of the SRCs aim at improving the sector in rural areas, such as in Bolivia or Solomon Islands. Hygiene, through community sensitisation, is an important factor in many of the SRCs, such as Burkina Faso or S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe. In Honduras, the SRC has two main objectives. The first concerns access to basic services. The second concerns water quality, for drinking water and water used in agriculture, as well as waste water management. Following an evaluation of its interventions in the water sector in 2004, the EU and the government of Bolivia opted for budget support. The first programme was focused on drinking water supply in rural areas. In the fol- lowing years the geographical scope was widened to include peri-urban areas and isolated rural areas. It was later extended to the sub-sectors of water resource/basin management and protected area management, with additional programmes in 2008 and 2012. Ten years later, the budget support tool continues to be among the preferred ones for the Bolivian authorities. It allows full alignment with national policies, strengthens the national systems and fosters efficiency in the use of resources. Furthermore, it has proved useful for building national capacities in policy design, fostering a result-oriented management and facilitating coordination with other cooperation partners. It has also granted additional fiscal space and triggered dialogue between the sectoral ministry and the Ministry of Economy and Public Finance in this respect. 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 40% 50% 60% 70% 80% 90% 100% Bolivia \u2013 Access to drinking water Urban Rural 30% 35% 40% 45% 50% 55% 60% 65% 70% 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 Bolivia \u2013 Coverage of sanitation Urban Rural The Bolivian experience shows that the success of budget support is often associated with the level of conti- nuity and stability of the beneficiary institutions. In this case, difficulties were encountered at the outset, with the formulation of result frameworks for public policies with yearly and measurable targets, the switch from process to output indicators, data collection and analysis, the use of this information for decision-making and the involvement of sub-national level government and civil society in policy dialogue. These issues have been overcome. However, national efforts have been focusing on infrastructure development, leaving aside quality and sustainability of interventions, which remain the main challenges for the sector in the years ahead. ",
        "34 BUDGET SUPPORT In Burkina Faso, the EU started operating in the water sector in the 1990s with infrastructure projects and it is only in 2010 that the approach was complemented by budget support. This enabled the dialogue with authori- ties to be much more strategic and much more integrated with the national institutional setup. This multidimen- sional approach also includes using financial instruments from the European Investment Bank and supporting civil society organisations. Budget support offered the platform to bring together the water and the sanitation sub-sectors within the same strategy, with all public or private utility companies, and according to a joint performance assessment framework. The EU budget support programmes coupled with direct investments undoubtedly contributed to the significant results achieved in terms of coverage of water access and sanitation, despite the very high de- mographic growth. 0% 10% 20% 30% 40% 50% 60% 70% 80% 90% 100% 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 Burkina Faso \u2013 Water and sanitation Access to drinking water - rural areas Access to drinking water - urban areas Access to sanitation - rural areas Access to sanitation - urban areas 5.7. Energy (SDG 7) In 2016 the EU had six SRCs in the energy sector in Egypt, Jordan, Moldova, Rwanda, Tonga and Ukraine. How- ever, the programme in Egypt has been on hold for more than 4 years due to eligibility concerns and in both Moldova and Ukraine there was no disbursement in 2016. In Morocco, the energy SRC was closed in 2016. EU budget support programmes in the energy sector aim at assisting the implementation of the relevant in- stitutional, legislative and fiscal reforms so as to create an enabling environment and engage both public and private operators in the scaling up of renewable energy, towards energy efficiency and for a better governance of the electricity sector. ",
        "35 Trends and results 2017 Until 2015 the EU contributed to the implementation of the national energy strategy in Morocco. The strategy helped secure energy supply, improve access to energy at affordable prices, contain energy demand and con- tribute to environment protection. This implied diversifying the electrical mix, increasing the use of renewable energy, prioritising efficiency and strengthening regional integration. 52 % of Morocco\u2019s electricity generation capacity is expected to be renewable by 2030. Similar objectives are being pursued in Jordan, where a second budget support programme for renewable ener- gy and energy efficiency was signed in 2016, and in Tonga, where it supports the energy roadmap 2010-2020 and notably the shift towards renewable energy production as well as grid losses reduction. In sub-Saharan Africa, where only a third of the population has access to electricity, the EU aligns its operations with the Sustainable Energy 4 All initiative. This aims, by 2030, at: (i) ensuring universal access to modern ener- gy services; (ii) doubling the rate of improvement in energy efficiency; and (iii) doubling the share of renewable energy in the global energy mix. 020 40 6 0 80 100 120 140 1 6 0 180 200 - 100 000 200 000 300 000 400 000 500 000 600 000 700 000 2012/13 2013/14 2014/15 2015/16 Electricity in Rwanda Electricity connections Electricity generation capacity (MWh) For example, energy is one of the top priorities of Rwanda. Access to modern energy for the population and the development of industrial activities are a prerequisite for the achievement of Rwanda\u2019s goal of becoming a middle income country by 2020. In 2016 the EU signed a 6-year budget support agreement of EUR 177 million to support Rwanda\u2019s agenda. Results already achieved are promising and are expected to accelerate. 5.8. Trade and private sector development (SDG 8) Through its eligibility criteria on macroeconomic stability or public finance management and the related policy dialogue with the authorities, budget support contracts may also help monitoring to ensure that the invest- ment strategy does not undermine macroeconomic stability in the long term (e.g. tax exemptions undermining domestic revenue mobilisation or unsustainable indebtedness) and that improvement in the business climate encourages private investment. Morocco is at the forefront of this business and investment agenda. This is seen by the commitments made by the country under the advanced status action plan. Improving the business environment and promoting the development of small and medium enterprises (SMEs) is one of the main areas of EU intervention through its budget support programmes, such as the investment and export support programme, the employment and SME programme, the agricultural sector policy support programme, the advanced status programmes, the Hakama programme for public finance management on PFM and, more recently, the green growth and competitiveness support programme. ",
        "36 BUDGET SUPPORT In South Africa, a new budget support operation was initiated in 2016 to promote inclusive and sustainable growth and create decent jobs, through the development of SMEs. This new operation is expected to cut unem- ployment by reducing the cost of doing business in the country, especially for SMEs. The programme will support the government in addressing key regulatory and administrative constraints for SMEs. It will also help them to access finance and to capitalise on opportunities as suppliers to bigger companies or to the public sector. Through its SRC to support private sector development in Jordan, the EU is backing government\u2019s reforms for improving the business environment and supporting SMEs to enhance their productivity, increasing their capac- ity to tap into the international value chain of larger companies and ultimately scale up. Similarly, the new SRC entitled \u2018Skills for employment\u2019 will accompany the reform of vocational training and ensure the labour market has an adequate supply of quality jobs. The two initiatives are also to be considered as supporting the imple- mentation of the agreement between the EU and Jordan on relaxation of rules of origin, which was adopted in July 2016 within the framework of the Association Agreement with Jordan. In the same vein, budget support programmes are addressing reforms to help foster trade links between the EU and partner countries. In 2014, Georgia, Moldova and Ukraine signed deep and comprehensive free trade agreements (DCFTAs) with the EU. These constitute ambitious roadmaps for reforms. Together with lifting main tariff barriers, these agree- ments include an approximation to EU legislation in many policy areas such as competition, public procurement, food safety, quality infrastructure and intellectual property. The EU is providing substantial support to these three countries to help them take up the challenge of implementing these reforms. SRCs are at the core of the assistance provided to governments in this respect, in addition to financial and technical support provided directly to businesses or business intermediaries. In Ukraine, more particularly, the SRC has facilitated the harmonisation of legislation and practices with the EU acquis communautaire . The acquis communautaire is the accumulated body of European Union law and obli- gations from 1958 to the present day. It comprises all the related treaties and laws (directives, regulations and decisions), declarations and resolutions, international agreements and the judgments of the Court of Justice. EU-harmonised standards have been adopted and the old standards left over from the USSR have been with- drawn. Ukraine has completely renewed its legislative framework on technical regulations, standardisation and accreditation. The mandatory pre-market certification of goods, which represented a heavy burden for business- es, has been drastically reduced and replaced by conformity assessment in line with EU practices. The quality infrastructure has been strengthened and, thanks to the SRC, the quality centres have been equipped with new test equipment and software for their laboratories. The impact of the SRCs in Georgia and Moldova is along the same lines with regard to quality certification, market surveillance and food safety. Both programmes include outreach activities to ensure the DCFTA-related reforms are well understood by the business community, and also SME-specific activities to help them to reap the benefits of these agreements. 40 45 50 55 60 65 70 75 80 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 Ease of doing business \u2013 Distance to frontier compositive indicator Countries with SRC TPSD BS recipients All aid recipients Other aid recipients ",

In particular, the \u2018distance to frontier\u2019 score assesses the level of regulatory performance over time. It measures the gap between each country and the best performance ob- served across all economies in the sample. Economies\u2019 distance to frontier is measured on a scale from 0 to 100, where 0 represents the lowest performance and 100 represents the frontier. If the score increases, it in- dicates progress. Overall the improvement trend in the business climate since 2010 has been relatively similar in budget support recipient countries to that in other aid recipients, but the overall business climate level is on average higher in budget support recipients. 5.9. Transport (SDG 9) The transport sector can greatly contribute to the SDGs by driving prosperity and reducing geographic dispari- ties. Budget support in the transport sectors typically contributes to setting the right incentives for partner coun- tries to engage in strategic management and preservation of their transport infrastructure networks. Sound policy frameworks and adequate institutional capacities are critical for that purpose but, in order to remain sus- tainable, reforms require commitment and ownership by partner countries towards resilient road maintenance management, affordable network sizes, strategic network development, sufficient sector financing and progress on public finance management. Nine countries had an ongoing SRC in support of the transport sector in 2016 (Albania, Egypt, Ethiopia, Malawi, Mozambique, Rwanda, Tanzania, Ukraine and Zambia) but the performance of the sector policies varies quite significantly. In sub-Saharan Africa, Ethiopia, Rwanda and Tanzania, with increasingly strong budgetary processes, are less prone to difficulties in their policy implementation and therefore the implementation of the related SRCs is considered broadly satisfactory. In countries like Malawi, Mozambique and Zambia, however, the weaknesses of the sector policies frameworks hamper the performance of the operations. But the example of Tanzania offers a very good perspective. Years of policy dialogue have finally unlocked a situation where large arrears vis-\u00e0-vis the private sector had impeded any significant progress. Budget support was a unique platform to come to such a positive outcome. Results achieved by the sector policies with the support of budget support are particularly striking in Ethiopia and Rwanda. Ethiopia shows a sound evolution of the road network maintenance performance at federal and regional levels alongside an increasing share of rural communities having access to all-weather roads, which facilitates their participation in the economy. 50 % 55 % 60 % 65 % 70 % 75 % 80 % 85 % 90 % 95 % 100 % 19000 20000 21000 22000 23000 24000 25000 26000 Y12/13 Y13/14 Y14/15 Y15/16 Ethiopia: road maintenance and access of rural communities Ethiopia - km of federal or regional roads maintained Ethiopia - % or rural communities with access to all-weather roads 0 50 100 150 200 250 300 350 400 450 500 Y13/14 Y14/15 Y15/16 target Rwanda: rehabilitation and maintenance of rural feeder roads Km of rural feeder road rehabilitated Km of rural feeder road maintaine ( 25 ) See http://www.doingbusiness.org ",
        "38 BUDGET SUPPORT For Rwanda, the SRC focuses on rural feeder roads development and related capacity enhancement of local authorities primarily. Rwanda is an example of an innovative approach towards job creation in the road trans- port sector. Community-based cooperatives for road maintenance are promoted under the SRC as well as labour-intensive methods for construction and maintenance. In terms of network performance, targets set for feeder roads maintenance and rehabilitation were met or even exceeded, which reflects sound and sustainable network management by the Rwandan authorities. Investing in maintenance allowed reducing needs for more costly rehabilitation works. As for Ukraine, the transport sector was severely affected by political developments and the conflict in Crimea and in Donbas. This hampered the expected progress for transport infrastructure and road safety. Nevertheless, strategic planning improved steadily, through sub-sector development plans. Administrative capacity and trans- port legislation harmonisation with EU-related frameworks also progressed. Likewise, reforms have started to bring about results with railway corporatisation. 5.10. Environment and climate change (SDGs 13 and 15) Thirteen budget support programmes are currently being implemented in the field of environment and climate change (Algeria, Bhutan, Bolivia, Colombia, Ghana, Honduras, Jordan, Lesotho, Morocco, Rwanda, Senegal, Trin- idad and Tobago and Samoa). Programmes cover a large range of issues (e.g. water management and de-pollution, air quality and forest governance, the green economy and climate change adaptation and mitigation) and overlap with other sector policies in those countries (for instance, in Bolivia, as regards water and sanitation). This demonstrates progress towards the mainstreaming of the environmental dimension in countries\u2019 policies. With respect to Neighbourhood South and East countries, environment and sustainable management of natural resources are important drivers for convergence with EU policies. Through budget support, the EU supports the upgrading of national production systems and the transition towards more resource-efficient economies, by addressing challenges such as degradation of, and competition for, natural resources. This allows a move up the value chain, facilitating exports to the EU and ultimately advancing the countries\u2019 competitiveness. Investment in skills development in the environmental field is also a key dimension in the approach, for instance in Morocco. After the Paris Agreement on climate change, when countries submitted their nationally determined contribu- tions, emphasis was put on the production of national strategies. In this regard, budget support is a very power- ful modality to enhance the integration of climate concerns at national or sector level. Dedicated SRCs are being implemented for that purpose in the following countries: Bhutan, Guyana, Rwanda and Samoa. They all are part of the Global Climate Change Alliance (GCCA+), the EU flagship initiative to support climate ac- tion in developing countries and to enhance policy dialogue on climate change and development. Since climate change affects all sectors of the economy and all groups in society, the actions targeting climate change can be very different but include: water and sanitation (Samoa); land management and tenure (Rwanda); or natural resources management and agriculture (Bhutan and Guyana). In Bhutan and Samoa, these actions complement other operations within the EU assistance portfolio for the country. The advantage in such cases is that the overall strategy of the action becomes \u2018climate relevant\u2019. It is also extremely useful in promoting the integration of the climate change dimension into sector development strategies. For example, in Samoa the GCCA+ contribution was merged into an SRC in the national water and sanitation sector. The results of the action include the strengthening of the integration of climate change ad- aptation into the updated \u2018Water for life\u2019 sector plan for 2012-2016 as well as the mitigation of the impact of flooding in the central part of the capital city, Apia, through the rehabilitation of priority drainage infrastructure and the introduction of an effective maintenance programme. Samoan authorities now make clear linkages between water/sanitation infrastructure design and risks associated with climate change. In Guyana and Rwanda, the actions were more focused and \u2018self-standing\u2019: land tenure for long-term invest- ments in sustainable land management in Rwanda and mangrove restoration in support of the national man- grove programme in Guyana. In both cases, the SRCs were instrumental in ensuring the appropriate integration ",
        "39 Trends and results 2017 of these objectives in the wider national development context and therefore facilitating their continuation and impact. In Rwanda, several smallholder farmers testify that their land is now \u2018fully theirs\u2019, which allows them to undertake specific adaptation actions that have mid- or long-term impacts, such as agro-forestry or land erosion control. 5.11. Justice, security and governance (SDG 16) At the end of 2016, the EU was supporting the rule of law through an SRC in seven countries: Armenia, Georgia, Jamaica, Jordan, Moldova, Morocco and South Africa. In Armenia, the EU supported the strengthening of alternative dispute resolution mechanisms, the development of probation and the strengthening of the Ethics and Disciplinary Commission. Amongst the achievements re- corded in Georgia, it is worth noting the substantial expansion of the state-funded Legal Aid Service to further categories of beneficiaries. In Jamaica, the SRC aims at improving access to gender-responsive, accountable and effective justice at community level, with the mainstreaming of restorative justice services as well as the treatment of children in conflict with the law in accordance with international standards. In Jordan, achievements have included improved professional training and a revamped system for legal aid. In Morocco, the EU supported the implementation of key provisions of the constitutional reform of 2011, which led to important legislative achievements in 2016 such as the adoption of the organic law on the Supreme Judicial Council and Organic Law on the Statute of judges. Finally, the \u2018Socioeconomic justice for all\u2019 programme supports the South African Department of Justice and Constitutional Development in the implementation of socioeconomic rights entrenched in the constitution, in- cluding improved handling of sexual offences cases. Beyond dedicated SRCs, some SBCs or GGDCs include components that either draw on justice sectorial strat- egies or support key reforms linked to the rule of law: \u2022 The SBC in Niger features a component on justice aiming at reducing the excessive use of pre-trial de- tention and increasing the provision of free legal aid for the most vulnerable. \u2022 In Burkina Faso, the GGDC supports strategic priorities such as the setting up of a fully operational inde- pendent Supreme Council for the Judiciary for both judges and prosecutors. \u2022 In Benin, the GGDC supports key reforms to secure effective separation of powers and independence of the judiciary in line with the latest National Integrity System Assessment. \u2022 The GGDC in Ivory Coast aims at enhanced efficiency of justice to improve the business climate. \u2022 The SBC in Ukraine aims at strengthening the independence of judges.

        "40 BUDGET SUPPORT Part II \u2014 Risk management T he following risk analysis is based on the 96 risk management frameworks (RMFs) adopted by DG Inter- national Cooperation and Development\u2019s Budget Support Steering Committee and DG Neighbourhood and Enlargement Negotiations\u2019 Financial Assistance Steering Committee in March and April 2017 for countries and overseas countries and territories (OCTs) with ongoing budget support operations or where budget support operations are foreseen in the near future. The RMFs were developed by EU delegations and reviewed by DG International Cooperation and Development, DG Neighbourhood and Enlargement Negotiations and the European External Action Service geographic and thematic directorates to ensure coherence. For the first time, the graphs below include the Instrument for Pre-Accession Assistance (IPA) regional risk profile. The analysis below is based on the frequency of substantial/high-risk cases. The RMF has a structure consisting of five risk categories, each of which is a simple average of a number of underlying risk dimensions. The 14 risk dimensions are assessed on the basis of a questionnaire that consists of 44 questions. For important risks, mitigating measures are identified. The sections below present an overview of risks and mitigating measures analysis, both from a geographic and a thematic perspective. 1. Risk analysis Overall, the frequency of substantial/high-risk cases has increased compared to the 2016 risk profile. This is mainly due to an increase in all political risk dimensions (rule of law, democracy, human rights and insecurity and conflict) and in some public financial management dimensions (budget comprehensiveness and external audit). The risk related to debt sustainability continues to increase substantially year after year. These changes in risk profile require careful monitoring and risk management. Risk mitigation measures should be further re- fined and targeted and they should fit into our overall approach to cooperation with the partner country. 1.1. Risk category analysis The charts below suggest a clear increase in political and public financial management risks, but all other risk categories have been revised upwards slightly. The increase in PFM risks was due to the external audit and budget comprehensiveness dimensions. This calls for a close monitoring of PEFA outcomes and special atten- tion in our programmes to these areas. Concerning political risks, conflicts and insecurity, as well as concerns around human rights, rule of law and democracy, are increasing in many regions and are greatly affecting the risk outlook. This has an impact not only on the budget support programmes but also on our overall cooperation strategy and political dialogue with partner countries. It also necessitates close cooperation between the polit- ical and the economic/governance sections in delegations. West and central Africa remains the region with the highest risk profile among budget support recipients. The greatest increase in risks from the previous year is associated with Asia, east and southern Africa and Latin America, mainly driven by increases in political risks. ",

In Asia and the ENP regions, political risks are relatively prominent, whereas the Caribbean and west and central Africa have an above-average share of macroeconomic risk. In the Latin American region, the risk profile is skewed very much towards corruption, while developmental risks are most important in eastern and southern Africa ( 26 ). ( 26 ) The enlargement context is not illustrated with a pie chart, due to the small number of budget support contracts in the region and the generally low level of risk.

Risk dimensions analysis When looking at the 14 risk dimensions, the corruption and fraud risk is the most significant, with over 60 % of cases assessed as substantial/high-risk. Government effectiveness has historically been one of the most signifi- cant risks while rule of law risks saw a significant increase this year. Other political risk dimensions (democracy, human rights and insecurity and conflict) have also risen markedly. The fast deterioration of debt sustainability risk has continued and is now a substantial or high risk in 30 % of countries. This is a worrying trend which requires very close monitoring since many of our partner countries are very vulnerable to debt distress. ",

Political risks continue to be dominated by rule of law and democracy concerns, although the other two dimensions are also important. Vulnerability and exogenous shocks are still the most important in the macroeconomic risk category, but debt sustainability is gaining rapidly in significance. Public financial management risks remain relatively evenly shared across the four underlying dimensions, with an in- crease in the importance of budget comprehensiveness and external audit risks. Developmental risks are still dom- inated by concerns around government effectiveness, but an upward trend can be observed with public policy risks.

Risk profile by type of budget support contract SBCs, provided to support countries in fragile situations, have the highest risk profile, with all five risk categories clearly present in the large majority of SBC countries. The GGDC contract sees a lot of fluctuation in its risk profile from one year to another, due to the limited number of countries where GGDCs are implemented. Nevertheless, the high corruption and fraud and developmental and the increasing political risks are worrying and require close follow-up. SRCs have the lowest level of risks, but PFM risks have increased markedly in this contract type. ",

Mitigating measures and risk response EU delegations have identified a range of risk-mitigating measures and reported on progress in the implemen- tation of previously identified risk mitigation measures. Political risks are mainly mitigated through a combination of political dialogue and programmes in support of demo- cratic oversight, human rights, the rule of law and conflict prevention. Democracy-related risks are mainly mitigated through support to electoral reforms, election observations and support to parliamentary and civil society oversight. Support to rule of law programmes, human rights defenders and activists aims at mitigating human rights and rule of law related risks. Progress reporting generally points to important improvements but mitigating country-level political risks generally remains a longer-term process, especially when the inherent political risks increase. Macroeconomic risk diversification is a combination of support to economic diversification to reduce vulnera- bilities, close monitoring and policy dialogue in close collaboration with the IMF and World Bank and support to macroeconomic dimensions of public finance management. Budget support financing can make an important contribution to risk mitigation, especially for SBCs, where the budget support funds are a significant part of the country\u2019s budgetary resources. Developmental risks concern a wide range of issues and institutions. Hence, risk mitigation takes place in the form of a wide range of activities with a particular focus on cross-cutting issues such as capacity strengthening support in the areas of public sector reform, decentralisation, policy costing and statistics. PFM risk mitigation is focused on support to reforms, institutional development, financial management informa- tion systems and budgetary transparency. The main beneficiaries of direct support are government institutions of the executive branch, but risk mitigation also focuses on support to audit institutions and parliaments in order to strengthen oversight. Public participation in budgetary processes is supported for example through the development of citizen budgets. In 2015 DG International Cooperation and Development produced guidance on \u2018Promoting civil society participation in policy and budget processes\u2019 as part of its \u2018Tools and methods\u2019 series. The mitigation of corruption and fraud risks remains a key focus. Such mitigation can take many forms from direct support to anti-corruption institutions and strengthening the justice sector to a focus on transparency and oversight functions, the rule of law, or support to the strengthening of institutions prone to corruption such as revenue administrations. Support to civil society actors, for example to enable participation in the budgetary and policy process, can furthermore mitigate corruption risks. Significant corruption cases with potential impli- cations for budget support eligibility are closely monitored to ensure appropriate action is taken. In 2016 DG International Cooperation and Development produced an in-house study on experiences of implementing the SBC since its inception. This stressed that corruption mitigation should feature even more significantly in SBCs than in other types of budget support contracts. The risk response consists of ensuring that the expected benefits of budget support contracts outweigh the identified risks and that appropriate risk mitigation is in place. In some cases, however, new commitments or disbursements have been put on hold by the Commission until appropriate corrective action is taken. ",

The largest budget support contracts are provided in sub-Saharan Africa, with around EUR 75 million per contract. In two other regions (Asia and ENP-E), the average budget support contract amounts to EUR 55 million and EUR 53 million, respectively. The larger size of contracts in Africa is related to the relatively high number of general budget support contracts, particularly SBCs. As of the end of 2016, the average number of ongoing budget support programmes per country was three, similar to previous years. Most regions are quite close to this global average, except the ENP regions, which have around seven budget support programmes on average per country. In these countries, budget support is used in many different sectors to deliver development assistance. Most budget support programmes are SRCs, with 83 % of the total number of budget support programmes, and this share keeps increasing each year. Due to their relatively small size, however, they represent only 68 % of ongoing commitments.

Fixed and variable tranches The average planned variable tranche share in total disbursements (fixed and variable tranches) for 2016 was 51 %. This share is well above the 30 % of the total disbursements suggested in the budget support guide- lines and observed as an estimated average in the period from 2007 to 2013. In 2016 variable tranches were particularly large in the Neighbourhood context, in Latin America and in the Caribbean. In addition, in west and central Africa, the share of planned variable tranche disbursement increased significantly compared to 2015. Variable tranches can be useful in creating an incentive effect and in order to focus the policy dialogue. However, care should be taken that such a focus does not come at the expense of a broader policy dialogue and review of performance beyond selected indicators. A high variable tranche can furthermore put much financial weight on a limited number of indicators with potential implications for predictability and the budgeting process of the partner country. Evaluation results have shown that variable tranches are effective only when recipient govern- ments are strongly committed to the reforms concerned. Indeed, when looking at execution rates, an estimated 81 % of planned fixed tranches were paid in 2016, com- pared with only 61 % of planned variable tranches. This resulted in an actual variable tranche disbursement rate of 46 % instead of the planned 51 %.

        "49 Trends and results 2017 4. Distribution by sector and country income group SRCs cover a wide variety of sectors. Education is still the most important one, but the importance of agriculture and rural development is increasing very rapidly as one of the priority sectors to support growth and jobs in the current multiannual financial framework. On the other hand, the share of energy, another priority sector, is increasing at a rather modest pace. The reasons are probably numerous, but it is likely that it is more difficult to engage strategically in the sector due to its complexity and the relatively little sector experience in EU del- egations. Furthermore, governance saw a significant increase in importance, while the importance of transport and health is declining. 0 200 400 600 800 1 000 1 200 1 400 1 600 E d u c a t i o n A g r i c u l t u r e & r u r a l d e v e l o p m e n t G o v e r n a n c e H e a l t h J u s t i c e a n s s e c u r i t y E n e r g y W a t e r & S a n i t a t i o n T r a n s p o r t S o c i a l p r o t e c t i o n M u l t i s e c t o r O t h e r P r i v a t e S e c t o r D e v e l o p m e n t E n v i r o n m e n t E m p l o y m e n t & v o c a t i o n a l t r a i n i n g P F M T r a d e M i l l i o n s SRC/SBS ongoing programmes (by amount of commitments) 26 % 31 % 36 % 51 % 46 % 44 % 21 % 20 % 17 % 3 % 3 % 3 % 2014 2015 2016 Breakdown by income group \u2013 2014, 2015 and 2016 Low Income-Countries Low Middle-Income Countries Upper Middle-Income Countries High Income-Countries ",
        "50 BUDGET SUPPORT By country group, low middle income countries are the largest beneficiaries of budget support, representing 44 % of the total amount of ongoing commitments in 2016. In this category, Morocco is by far the largest re- cipient of budget support with 9 % of the total amount of all commitments. It is positive that the share of low income countries in ongoing budget support commitments has been increasing steadily, and now represents 36 % after only 26 % in 2014. This is partly due to the increasing use of the SBC to strengthen fragile state functions. This means that budget support is firmly contributing to the EU commitment to allocate 0.2 % of gross national income (GNI) to least developed countries. Four high income countries ( 29 ) and the OCTs together account for 3 % of total budget support commitments. 5.

        "51 Trends and results 2017 SRCs represent 88 % of the total number of new contracts expected to be launched in 2017, which signals a clear dominance of this type of budget support contract in the years to come. In fragile contexts, the SBC is still widely used, representing 12 % of all new budget support programmes. In this context, the launch of the new SDG contract will provide an alternative to the dominance of SRCs with its focus on the implementation of the SDGs by addressing key cross-cutting issues. The sector distribution of the new SRCs expected to be launched in 2017 shows that agriculture/rural develop- ment/food security, energy and governance will continue to increase in importance, reflecting the change in sec- tor priorities in the 2014-2020 programming period, where sustainable agriculture and food security, education, energy and governance are priority sectors.
