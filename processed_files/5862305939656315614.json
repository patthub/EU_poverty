        "J. whereas around 27 % of global CO 2 emissions from fuel combustion currently relate to internationally traded goods ( 8 ); whereas 90 % of international goods transport is carried out at sea, leading to significant GHG emissions; whereas only GHG emissions from domestic waterborne navigation were included in the EU\u2019s initial nationally determined contribution (NDC); whereas this is subject to revision in light of the EU\u2019s enhanced 2030 target; K. whereas the COVID-19 crisis has delivered some important lessons, hence why the Commission\u2019s proposal for a new recovery instrument \u2014 Next Generation EU \u2014 underlines the need to strengthen European autonomy and resilience and the need for short circuits, in particular shorter food supply chains; L. whereas it is essential that the Commission has an integrated vision of climate policies, for example by addressing emission reduction targets, such as those for maritime transport, in coordination with carbon pricing strategies; M. whereas ensuring effective and meaningful carbon pricing as part of a broader regulatory environment can serve as an economic incentive to develop production methods with a lower GHG footprint and can spur investments in innovation and new technologies, providing for the decarbonisation and circularity of the EU\u2019s economy; whereas an effective Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM) can play a role in that context; N. whereas trade can be an important tool to promote sustainable development and help fight climate change; whereas the EU\u2019s single market is the world\u2019s second-largest consumer market, putting the Union in a unique position as a global standard setter; O. whereas combating climate change is a factor in competitiveness and social justice and offers major potential in terms of industrial development, job creation, innovation and regional development; P. whereas Article XX of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) allows World Trade Organization (WTO) members to implement measures that are necessary to protect human, animal or plant life or health (b), or natural resources (g); Q. whereas the EU should accept that a third country can set up a CBAM if that country implements a higher carbon price; R. whereas US President Biden has taken a favourable stance through his electoral platform to seek to \u2018impose carbon adjustment fees or quotas on carbon-intensive goods from countries that are failing to meet their climate and environment obligations\u2019; whereas this would create a new opportunity for cooperation between the EU and the US in fighting climate change and restoring this key partnership; S. whereas the EU\u2019s increased ambition on climate change should not lead to the risk of carbon leakage for European industries; General remarks 1. Is deeply concerned that currently none of the NDCs submitted, including those of the EU and its Member States, are in line with the objective of keeping the global temperature increase, as provided by the Paris Agreement, to well below 2 o C, while pursuing efforts to limit the global temperature increase to 1,5 o C above pre-industrial levels; 2. Is concerned by the lack of cooperation by some of the EU\u2019s trade partners in international climate negotiations over the past few years, which, as recently observed at COP25, undermines our collective global ability to reach the objectives of the Paris Agreement; encourages all parties to support a collective and science-based global effort that can deliver the achievement of these goals; calls on the Commission and the Council to uphold a transparent, fair and inclusive decision-making process in the UNFCCC; C 474/4 EN Official Journal of the European Union 24.11.2021 Wednesday 10 March 2021 ( 8 ) Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), \u2018CO 2 emissions embodied in international trade and domestic final demand: methodology and results using the OECD inter-country input-output database\u2019, 23 November 2020.

Stresses that the EU and its Member States have the responsibility and opportunity to continue assuming a leading role in global climate action along with the other leading global emitters; points out that the EU has been leading global climate action, as evidenced by its adoption of the objective to achieve climate neutrality by 2050 at the latest and its plan to scale up its 2030 GHG emission reduction target; strongly encourages the Commission and the Member States to intensify their climate diplomacy ahead of and after the adoption of the legislative proposal for a CBAM and, in particular, to ensure continuous dialogue with trade partners in order to incentivise global climate action; stresses the need for concurrent diplomatic efforts to ensure that the EU\u2019s neighbourhood countries are engaged early on; 4. Highlights the central role of citizens and consumers in the energy transition, and the importance of stimulating and supporting consumer choice in order to reduce the effects of climate change by promoting sustainable activities and collateral benefits that lead to a higher quality of life; 5. Takes note of the Commission\u2019s proposal to set the EU\u2019s 2030 climate target to \u2018at least 55 % net emissions reduction\u2019 compared to 1990 levels; highlights the fact, however, that Parliament adopted a higher target of 60 %; 6. Notes that while the EU had substantially reduced its domestic GHG emissions, the GHG emissions embedded in imports to the EU have been constantly rising, thereby undermining the Union\u2019s efforts to reduce its global GHG footprint; underlines that the net imports of goods and services in the EU represent more than 20 % of the Union\u2019s domestic CO 2 emissions; considers that the GHG content of imports should be better monitored in order to identify possible measures to reduce the EU\u2019s global GHG footprint; Designing a WTO-compatible CBAM 7. Supports the introduction of a CBAM, provided that it is compatible with WTO rules and EU free trade agreements (FTAs) by not being discriminatory or constituting a disguised restriction on international trade; considers that as such, a CBAM would create an incentive for European industries and EU trade partners to decarbonise their industries and therefore support both EU and global climate policies towards GHG neutrality in line with the Paris Agreement objectives; states unequivocally that a CBAM should be exclusively designed to advance climate objectives and not be misused as a tool to enhance protectionism, unjustifiable discrimination or restrictions; stresses that this mechanism should support the EU\u2019s green objectives, in particular to better address GHG emissions embedded in EU industry and in international trade, while being non-discriminatory and striving for a global level playing field; 8. Stresses that Least Developed Countries and Small Island Developing States should be given special treatment in order to take account of their specificities and the potential negative impacts of the CBAM on their development; 9. Recalls the specific constraints and challenges facing the outermost regions, compounded, in particular, by their remoteness, their insularity and the limited size of their market, and calls for the CBAM to give special consideration to their specific characteristics, in accordance with Article 349 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU); 10. Reiterates that the introduction of a CBAM should be part of a package of legislative measures to ensure the swift reduction of GHG emissions deriving from EU production and consumption, in particular by scaling up energy efficiency and renewable energies; stresses that the CBAM should be coupled with policies aimed at enabling and promoting investments in low-carbon industrial processes, including through innovative financing tools, the new Circular Economy Action Plan and a broader EU industrial policy that is both environmentally ambitious and socially fair, with a view to steering a decarbonised reindustrialisation of Europe to create quality jobs at a local level and ensure the competitiveness of the European economy, while fulfilling the EU\u2019s climate ambition and offering predictability and certainty to secure investments towards climate neutrality; 11. Emphasises that product standards can ensure low-carbon, resource-efficient manufacturing as well as help to guarantee minimal negative environmental impacts from product use; therefore asks the Commission to propose, as a complement to the introduction of a CBAM, more ambitious and binding norms and standards on products placed on the EU market in terms of GHG emission reduction and savings on resources and energy, in support of the Sustainable Product Policy Framework and the new Circular Economy Action Plan; 24.11.2021 EN Official Journal of the European Union C 474/5 Wednesday 10 March 2021 ",
        "12. Considers that in order to prevent possible distortions in the internal market and along the value chain, a CBAM should cover all imports of products and commodities covered by the EU ETS, including when embedded in intermediate or final products; stresses that as a starting point (already by 2023) and following an impact assessment, the CBAM should cover the power sector and energy-intensive industrial sectors like cement, steel, aluminium, oil refinery, paper, glass, chemicals and fertilisers, which continue to receive substantial free allocations, and still represent 94 % of EU industrial emissions; 13. Underlines that the GHG emissions content of imports should be accounted for on the basis of transparent, reliable and up-to-date product-specific benchmarks at the level of the installations in third countries and that, as a default, if data is not made available by the importer, account should be taken of the global average GHG emissions content of individual products, broken down by different production methods with varying emission intensities; considers that the carbon pricing of imports should cover both direct and indirect emissions and therefore also take into account the country-specific carbon intensity of the electricity grid or, if data is made available by the importer, the carbon intensity of the energy consumption at the level of the installation; 14. Notes that the Commission is currently assessing all the different options for the introduction of a CBAM, ranging from tax instruments to mechanisms using the EU ETS; stresses that the modalities for the design of a CBAM should be explored alongside the revision of the EU ETS so as to ensure they are complementary and consistent, and to avoid overlapping that would lead to double protection of EU industries; underlines the importance of a transparent process behind a CBAM, including by engaging with the WTO and the EU\u2019s trading partners in coordination with the European Parliament and carefully assessing and comparing the effectiveness, efficiency and legal feasibility of different forms of a CBAM with a view to reducing total global GHG emissions; insists that the primary aim of the CBAM is environmental and that environmental criteria should therefore play an essential role in the choice of instrument, ensuring a predictable and sufficiently high carbon price that incentivises decarbonisation investments in order to realise the aims of the Paris Agreement; 15. Stresses the importance of assessing the impacts of each option on the living standards of consumers, especially those belonging to more vulnerable groups, as well as their impact on revenue; calls on the Commission to also include in the impact assessment the consequences for the EU budget of the revenue generated from the CBAM as an own resource, depending on the design and modalities chosen; 16. Considers that in order to address the potential risk of carbon leakage while complying with WTO rules, the CBAM needs to charge the carbon content of imports in a way that mirrors the carbon costs paid by EU producers; stresses that carbon pricing under the CBAM should mirror the dynamic evolution of the price of EU allowances under the EU ETS while ensuring predictability and less volatility in the price of carbon; is of the opinion that importers should buy allowances from a separate pool of allowances to the EU ETS whose carbon price corresponds to that of the day of the transaction in the EU ETS; underlines that the introduction of the CBAM is only one of the measures in the implementation of the European Green Deal objectives and must also be accompanied by the necessary measures in non-ETS sectors as well as an ambitious reform of the EU ETS to ensure it delivers meaningful carbon pricing that fully respects the polluter pays principle, and to contribute to the necessary GHG emissions reduction in line with the EU\u2019s updated 2030 climate target and 2050 net zero GHG emissions target, including by addressing the linear reduction factor, a rebasing of the cap and assessing the potential need for a carbon floor price; 17. Highlights that an excise duty (or tax) on the carbon content of all consumed products, both domestic and imported, would not fully address the risk of carbon leakage, would be technically challenging given the complexity of tracing carbon in global value chains and might place a significant burden on consumers; acknowledges that a fixed duty or tax on imports could be a simple tool to give a strong and stable environmental price signal for imported carbon; believes, however, that given its fixed nature, such a tax would be a less flexible tool to mirror the evolving price of the EU ETS; stresses that, in practice, an evolving tax that automatically mirrors the price of the EU ETS would be equivalent to a notional ETS; acknowledges that, should the CBAM be of a fiscal nature, there is a possibility that a mechanism based on Article 192(2) TFEU would be introduced; C 474/6 EN Official Journal of the European Union 24.11.2021 Wednesday 10 March 2021 ",
        "18. Stresses that importers should have the option to prove, in accordance with EU standards for monitoring, reporting and verification of the EU ETS, that the carbon content of their products is lower than those values, and avail of a payable amount adapted accordingly, to encourage innovation and investment in sustainable technologies across the world; considers that this should not impose a disproportionate burden on SMEs; highlights that the implementation of the mechanism will need to be underpinned by a set of EU standards that will prevent it from being circumvented or misused, and will require strong independent infrastructure in order to be administered; 19. Stresses that the CBAM should ensure that importers from third countries are not charged twice for the carbon content of their products to ensure they are treated on an equal footing and without discrimination; calls on the Commission to assess carefully the impact of the different CBAM options on Least Developed Countries; 20. Highlights that unlike the ETS, the mechanism should not treat burning wood for fuel as carbon neutral and within the revised and updated framework the carbon embedded in logged wood and depleted soil should have a price; 21. Urges the Commission to minimise the risk of exporters to the EU trying to bypass the mechanism or compromise its effectiveness, for example by re-routing production between markets or exporting semi-finished goods; Trade-related aspects of a CBAM 22. Calls for the Paris Agreement and its goals to become one of the main guiding principles of trade policy, to which all trade initiatives and their policy tools must be adjusted, by including it in, inter alia, FTAs as an essential element; is convinced that such a purpose-built trade policy can be an important driver in steering economies towards decarbonisation in order to achieve the climate objectives set in the Paris Agreement and the European Green Deal; 23. Expresses its deep concern over the erosion of the multilateral trading system; calls on the Commission to actively engage with trade partners\u2019 governments to ensure a continued dialogue on this initiative, thereby providing incentives for climate action both within the Union and by its trading partners; underlines that trade policy can and should be used to promote a positive environmental agenda and to avoid major differences in the levels of environmental ambition between the EU and the rest of the world, and that a CBAM should be designed as an action complementing actions under the trade and sustainable development chapters of the EU\u2019s FTAs; underlines that global action which makes the CBAM redundant must be the final goal of the initiative, as the rest of the world catches up with the level of ambition the EU has set for reducing CO 2 emissions; is therefore of the view that the CBAM should be regarded as a means to help the acceleration of this process and not as a means of protectionism; expects the Commission to initiate negotiations on a global approach within the framework of the WTO or the G20; 24. Considers that international trade and trade policy are key enablers of the transition towards a climate-neutral, resource-efficient, circular global economy and, as such, support the global efforts towards the achievement of the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and the Paris Agreement; considers that there is an urgent need to pursue a comprehensive reform of the WTO, enabling it to guarantee fair trade, while at the same time combating global warming; notes that the GATT rules date back to 1947 and is of the view that they need to be rethought in the present context of climate crisis; expects the Commission to take urgent initiatives for WTO reform in order to achieve compatibility with the climate objectives; calls on the Commission to intensify its efforts to achieve global CO 2 pricing and to facilitate trade in climate and environmental protection technologies, for example through trade policy initiatives such as the WTO Environmental Goods Agreement; 25. Calls on the Commission to pursue multilateral WTO reforms that bring international trade law into line with the goals of the Paris Agreement and other aspects of international law, in particular the conventions of the International Labour Organization (ILO); points out that a CBAM is compatible with WTO rules if it is designed with a clear environmental objective in mind to reduce global GHG emissions and if it upholds the highest environmental integrity; 26. Underlines that the CBAM can help to contribute to the SDGs; recalls that the promotion of decent work is also an SDG and urges the Commission to ensure that goods placed on the EU market are produced under conditions that respect the ILO conventions; 24.11.2021 EN Official Journal of the European Union C 474/7 Wednesday 10 March 2021 ",
        "27. Notes that in order to be compatible with WTO rules, GATT provisions such as Article I (the principle of most-favoured nation treatment), Article III (the national treatment principle) and, if necessary, Article XX (general exceptions) could be the basis for any CBAM design, whose rationale should be solely and strictly environmental \u2014 reducing global CO 2 emissions and preventing carbon leakage; 28. Underlines the principle of non-discrimination under GATT Article III; stresses that treating imports and domestic production in the same way is a key criterion for ensuring WTO compatibility of any measure; emphasises that the CBAM should create a level playing field between EU domestic and foreign producers by applying an ETS-equivalent charge on the embodied carbon emissions of imported goods in those sectors, regardless of their origin, thereby ensuring full protection against carbon leakage for European industry and avoiding emission transfers to third countries; emphasises that the implementation of the CBAM should avoid double protection for EU installations, while assessing the impact on exports and dependent sectors along the value chain; emphasises that the design of the CBAM should follow a simple principle whereby one tonne of carbon should not be protected twice; 29. Underlines the importance of ensuring a global level playing field for the competitiveness of European industries without generating harmful effects on climate and the environment; urges the Commission, therefore, to consider the possible introduction of export rebates, but only if it can fully demonstrate their positive impact on climate and their compatibility with WTO rules; stresses that in order to prevent perverse climate effects by incentivising less efficient production methods for European exporting industries and ensure WTO compatibility, any form of potential export support should be transparent, proportionate and not lead to any kind of competitive advantages for EU exporting industries in third countries, and should be strictly limited to the most efficient installations so as to maintain GHG reduction incentives for EU exporting companies; 30. Stresses that any mechanism must create an incentive for industries in the EU and abroad to produce clean and competitive products and avoid carbon leakage, without endangering trade opportunities; 31. Notes that the CBAM is part of the European Green Deal and a tool to achieve the EU\u2019s goal of net zero GHG emissions by 2050; notes that the most carbon- and trade-intensive industrial sectors could potentially be impacted by the CBAM, either directly or indirectly, and that they should be consulted throughout the process; notes further that the CBAM could influence supply chains in such a way that they would internalise carbon costs; stresses that any CBAM should be easy to administer and not place an undue financial and administrative burden on enterprises, especially SMEs; The CBAM and own resources 32. Acknowledges that the CBAM could be implemented either as an extension of the current regime of customs duties or as a complementary scheme within the existing EU ETS framework; emphasises that both approaches could be entirely consistent with an own resources initiative; 33. Supports the Commission\u2019s intention to use revenues generated by the CBAM as new own resources for the EU budget, and asks the Commission to ensure full transparency about the use of those revenues; highlights, however, that the budgetary role of the CBAM should only be a by-product of the instrument; believes that those new revenues should allow for greater support for climate action and the objectives of the Green Deal, such as the just transition and the decarbonisation of Europe\u2019s economy, and for an increase in the EU\u2019s contribution to international climate finance in favour of Least Developed Countries and Small Island Developing States, which are most vulnerable to climate change, in particular to support them to undergo an industrialisation process based on clean and decarbonised technologies; calls on the Commission to take into account the social effects of the mechanism in its upcoming proposal with a view to minimising them; stresses that the revenues generated from a CBAM should by no means be used as disguised subsidies for high-polluting European industries, as this would ultimately compromise its WTO compatibility; 34. Recalls that Parliament, the Council and the Commission agreed to the creation of new own resources, including the CBAM, during the next multiannual financial framework under the Interinstitutional Agreement of 16 December 2020 on budgetary discipline, on cooperation in budgetary matters and on sound financial management, as well as on new own resources, including a roadmap towards the introduction of new own resources (IIA) ( 9 ); stresses that assigning the financial flows generated by the CBAM to the EU budget would help to mitigate issues of fiscal equivalence and ensure a fairly C 474/8 EN Official Journal of the European Union 24.11.2021 Wednesday 10 March 2021 ( 9 ) OJ L 433 I, 22.12.2020, p. 28. ",
        "distributed impact across Member States, as well as ensuring a lean structure with minimal administrative overhead costs; concludes, therefore, that defining the proceeds as an EU own resource would reduce the share of GNI-based contributions in the financing of the EU budget, and would thus help to mutualise the impact of the CBAM in a fair way across all Member States; considers that any savings at national level due to lower GNI-contributions will increase Member States\u2019 fiscal space; 35. Takes note of various prudent revenue estimates, ranging from EUR 5 to 14 billion per year, depending on the scope and design of the new instrument; highlights the fact that the EU budget is in any event uniquely suited to absorbing revenue fluctuations or even long-term regressive effects; 36. Is determined to ensure that the CBAM-based own resource will be part of a basket of own resources sufficient to cover the level of overall expected expenditure for the repayment costs of the principal and interests of the borrowing incurred under the Next Generation EU instrument, while respecting the principle of universality; recalls moreover, that any surplus from the repayment plan must still remain in the EU budget as general revenue; 37. Stresses that the introduction of a basket of new own resources, as provided for in the roadmap towards the introduction of new own resources under the IIA, could facilitate a better focus of expenditure at EU level on priority areas and common public goods with high efficiency gains compared to national spending; recalls that any failure to respect the terms agreed in the IIA by one of the three institutions could expose it to a legal challenge by the others; 38. Calls on the institutions to follow up actively in the spirit and to the letter of the roadmap towards the introduction of new own resources under the IIA, which prescribes that this new own resource is to enter into force by 1 January 2023 at the latest; Implementing the CBAM and other aspects 39. Stresses that the implementation of the CBAM must be accompanied by the removal of all forms of environmentally harmful subsidies granted to energy-intensive industries at national level; calls on the Commission to evaluate the different practices of Member States in that matter in the light of the polluter pays principle; 40. Requests that the CBAM be monitored through an independent body, under the auspices of the Commission, which should regularly report and provide transparent information to Parliament, the Council and Commission on request and at least twice a year; 41. Notes that the EU is the world\u2019s largest carbon importer and that the carbon content of exported goods from the EU is well below the carbon content of imported goods; deduces that European efforts to combat climate change are greater than the average international effort; highlights that in order to measure the overall climate impact of the Union, a solid reporting method is needed that takes into account the emissions of imported goods and services to the EU; 42. Stresses that sufficient international climate efforts, such as robust, widespread and consistent international carbon pricing and fully competitive low-emission technologies, products and production processes will render the mechanism obsolete over time; considers that climate change is a global problem that requires global solutions, and therefore believes that the EU should continue to support the establishment of a global framework for CO 2 pricing in line with Article 6 of the Paris Agreement; encourages the Commission to design the mechanism with a clear and ambitious timeline for its implementation and evolution; recalls that some technical solutions for mitigating CO 2 are still at the pilot stage and thus calls on the Commission to continue efforts to develop them further; calls on the Commission to design the mechanism as part of a comprehensive and long-term-oriented policy package that is consistent with achieving a highly energy- and resource-efficient, net-zero GHG economy by 2050 at the latest; 43. Recalls that the EU\u2019s climate policy, industrial policy and the goal to maintain and increase sustainable economic growth must go hand in hand; stresses that any mechanism must be embedded in our industrial strategy, creating an incentive for industries to produce clean and competitive products; 24.11.2021 EN Official Journal of the European Union C 474/9 Wednesday 10 March 2021 ",

Underlines that a properly functioning mechanism should ensure the reduction of emissions imported into the EU and provide the most effective climate protection against the risk of carbon leakage while respecting WTO rules; stresses that the mechanism should be designed in way that ensures its effective and simple application and at the same time prevents circumventing behaviour such as resource shuffling or the import of semi-finished or end products not covered under the mechanism; 45. Calls on the Commission to provide technical advice and support to industries at home and abroad, especially for SMEs, in setting up reliable GHG emission accounting systems for imports in order to maintain a strong European industry without causing technical obstacles for trading partners; 46. Calls for a special evaluation of the impact of the mechanism on SMEs and on competition within the internal market; calls for the creation, if needed, of a support mechanism for SMEs to successfully adjust to the new market reality, thereby preventing them from being victims of unfair practices by larger market players; 47. Notes, furthermore, that in order to prevent unfair competition on the European market, no competitive disadvantages among competing materials should be created by the mechanism; underlines that the most climate-friendly materials should not suffer competitive disadvantages; 48. Emphasises its importance in ensuring that European citizens and their interests are represented and in contributing to the achievement of EU priorities such as climate protection, sustainable growth and international competitiveness; calls on the Commission and the Council, therefore, to fully involve Parliament, as co-legislator, in the legislative process to establish the mechanism; o o o 49.

Whereas Article 208(1) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) provides that the Union is to take account of the objectives of development cooperation in the policies that it implements which are likely to affect developing countries; C. Whereas the globalisation of economic activity has aggravated adverse impacts of business activities on human rights, including social and labour rights, the environment and the good governance of states; whereas human rights violations often occur at primary production level, in particular when sourcing raw material and manufacturing products; D. Whereas the Charter applies to all Union legislation and to national authorities when implementing Union law both in the Union and in third countries; E. Whereas if due diligence is implemented comprehensively, undertakings will in the long term benefit from better business conduct with a focus on prevention rather than on remediation of harm; F. Whereas, given that future legislation on corporate due diligence and corporate accountability for European undertakings would be expected to have extraterritorial effects, such legislation would affect the social, economic and environmental development of developing countries and their prospects of achieving their SDGs; whereas this significant impact could contribute to the Union\u2019s policy objectives concerning development; G. Whereas undertakings should respect human rights, including international binding rights and the fundamental rights enshrined in the Charter, the environment and good governance and should not cause or contribute to any adverse impacts in this regard; whereas due diligence should be based on the \u2018do no harm\u2019 principle; whereas Article 21 TEU requires the Union to promote and consolidate the universality and indivisibility of human rights and fundamental freedoms, as protected by the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (ECHR) and the Charter, to ensure sustainable development and consistency between its external action and other policies; whereas the Council of the European Union has recognised that corporate respect for human rights in corporate operations and supply chains is important to achieve the UN SDGs; H. Whereas democracy, which protects human rights and fundamental freedoms, is the only form of government compatible with sustainable development; whereas corruption and lack of transparency greatly undermine human rights; I.

Whereas corruption in the context of judicial proceedings can have a devastating effect on the lawful administration of justice and judicial integrity, and intrinsically violate the right to a fair trial, the right to due process and the right to effective redress; whereas corruption can lead to cases of systematic violation of human rights in the business context, for example, by preventing individuals from accessing goods and services that States are obliged to provide to meet their human rights obligations or by increasing the price of such goods and services, by encouraging wrongful acquisition or appropriation by business of land, or facilitating money laundering, or by granting unlawful licences or concessions to businesses in the extractive sector; C 474/14 EN Official Journal of the European Union 24.11.2021 Wednesday 10 March 2021 ( 34 ) Directive 2011/36/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 5 April 2011 on preventing and combating trafficking in human beings and protecting its victims, and replacing Council Framework Decision 2002/629/JHA (OJ L 101, 15.4.2011, p. 1).

        "K. Whereas the COVID-19 crisis has exposed some of the severe drawbacks of global value chains and the ease with which certain undertakings are able to shift, both directly and indirectly, negative impacts of their business activities to other jurisdictions, in particular outside the Union, without being held accountable; whereas the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) has shown that undertakings that have taken proactive steps to address the risks related to the COVID-19 crisis in a way that mitigates adverse impacts on workers and supply chains, develop a more long-term value and resilience, improving their viability in the short term and their prospects for recovery in the medium to long term; L. Whereas the importance of freedom of expression and of the freedoms of association and of peaceful assembly, including the right to form and join trade unions, the right to collective bargaining and action, as well as the right to fair remuneration and to decent working conditions, including health and safety in the workplace, should be underlined; M. Whereas, according to ILO statistics, around the globe there are around 25 million victims of forced labour, 152 million victims of child labour, 2,78 million deaths due to work-related diseases per year and 374 million non-fatal work-related injuries per year; whereas the ILO has developed several conventions to protect workers, but their enforcement is still lacking, especially with reference to the labour markets of developing countries; N. Whereas the exploitation and degradation of human beings through forced labour and slave-like practices affecting millions of people, from which certain undertakings, public or private entities or persons have benefitted globally in 2019, persist; whereas the situation of an estimated 152 million children in child labour, 72 million of whom work in hazardous conditions, many of them being forced to work through violence, blackmail and other unlawful means is unacceptable and particularly worrying; whereas undertakings have the special responsibility of protecting children, in particular, and preventing any form of child labour; O. Whereas fundamental labour, social and economic rights are enshrined in several international human rights treaties and conventions, including the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, the ILO\u2019s Core Labour Standards, and the European Social Charter, as well as in the Charter; whereas the rights to work, to the free choice of employment and to remuneration that ensures for employees and their families an existence worthy of human dignity are basic human rights enshrined in Article 23 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights; whereas inadequate state labour inspection, limited right to redress, excessive working hours, poverty-level wages, the gender pay gap and other forms of discrimination remain of serious concern in an increasing number of countries, notably in Export Processing Zones; P.

Whereas the United Nations Special Rapporteur on human rights and the environment has stated that the rights to life, health, food, water and development, as well as the right to a safe, clean, healthy and sustainable environment, are necessary for the full enjoyment of human rights; whereas the Special Rapporteur has also stressed that the loss of biodiversity undermines the full enjoyment of human rights and that states should regulate harm to biodiversity caused by private actors as well as government agencies; whereas the United Nations General Assembly recognised, in its Resolution 64/292, the right to safe and clean drinking water and sanitation as a human right; whereas those rights should be covered by any possible legislation; R. Whereas undertakings have in general limited awareness of the range of impacts they have on children\u2019s rights in their operations and supply chains and the potentially life-changing consequences these can have for children; 24.11.2021 EN Official Journal of the European Union C 474/15 Wednesday 10 March 2021 ",

Whereas the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights and the United Nations Human Rights Council have stated that climate change has an adverse impact on the full and effective enjoyment of human rights; whereas states have an obligation to respect human rights when addressing adverse impacts caused by climate change; whereas any corporate due diligence legislation must be in line with the Paris Agreement; T. Whereas systemic corruption violates the principles of transparency, accountability and non-discrimination, with severe implications for the effective enjoyment of human rights; whereas the OECD Convention on Combating Bribery of Foreign Public Officials in International Business Transactions and the United Nations Convention against Corruption oblige Member States to implement effective practices aimed at the prevention of corruption; whereas provisions of the United Nations Convention against Corruption should form part of due diligence obligations in legislation; U. Whereas this alarming situation has highlighted the urgency regarding making businesses more responsive to, responsible and accountable for the adverse impacts they cause or contribute or are directly linked to, and prompted a debate as to how to do so, while underlining the need for a proportionate and harmonised Union-wide approach to these matters, which is also necessary to be able to achieve the United Nations (UN) SDGs; V. Whereas, according to the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, a large number of human rights defenders are under threat because they raise concerns about adverse human rights impacts of business operations; W. Whereas that debate has led, among other things, to the adoption of due diligence frameworks and standards within the United Nations, the Council of Europe, the OECD and the ILO; whereas those standards are, however, voluntary and, consequently, their uptake has been limited; whereas Union legislation should progressively and constructively build on these frameworks and standards; whereas the Union and Member States should support and engage in the ongoing negotiations to create a legally binding UN instrument on Transnational Corporations and Other Business Enterprises with respect to human rights and the Council should give a mandate to the Commission to be actively involved in those ongoing negotiations; X. Whereas, according to a Commission study, only 37 % of business respondents currently conduct environmental and human rights due diligence; Y. Whereas some Member States, such as France, and the Netherlands, have adopted legislation to enhance corporate accountability and have introduced mandatory due diligence frameworks; whereas other Member States are currently considering the adoption of such legislation, including Germany, Austria, Sweden, Finland, Denmark and Luxembourg; whereas the lack of a joint Union-wide approach in this matter may lead to less legal certainty when it comes to business prerogatives and to imbalances in fair competition which would in turn disadvantage undertakings that are proactive regarding social and environmental matters; whereas the lack of harmonised corporate due diligence legislation jeopardises the level playing field of undertakings operating in the Union; Z. Whereas the Union has already adopted due diligence legislation for specific sectors, such as the Conflict Minerals Regulation, the Timber Regulation, the Forest Law Enforcement, Governance and Trade (FLEGT) Regulation and the Anti-Torture Regulation; whereas those pieces of legislation have become a benchmark for targeted binding supply chain due diligence legislation; whereas the future Union legislation should support undertakings in managing and living up to their corporate responsibilities and be fully aligned with all existing sectoral due diligence and reporting obligations, such as the Non-Financial Reporting Directive, and coherent with relevant national legislation, to avoid duplications; AA. Whereas the Commission has proposed to develop a comprehensive strategy for the garment sector as part of the new Circular Economy Action Plan, that, by including a uniform set of standards regarding due diligence and social responsibility, could be another example of integrating a more detailed approach for a specific sector; whereas the Commission should propose further sector-specific Union legislation on mandatory due diligence, for example for sectors such as forest and ecosystem risk commodities and the garment sector; C 474/16 EN Official Journal of the European Union 24.11.2021 Wednesday 10 March 2021 ",
        "1. Considers that voluntary due diligence standards have limitations and have not achieved significant progress in preventing human rights and environmental harm and in enabling access to justice; considers that the Union should urgently adopt binding requirements for undertakings to identify, assess, prevent, cease, mitigate, monitor, communicate, account for, address and remediate potential and/or actual adverse impacts on human rights, the environment and good governance in their value chain; believes that this would be beneficial for stakeholders, as well as for businesses in terms of harmonisation, legal certainty, a level playing field and mitigating unfair competitive advantages of third countries that result from lower protection standards as well as social and environmental dumping in international trade; stresses that this would enhance the reputation of Union undertakings and of the Union as a standard setter; stresses the proven benefits for undertakings of having effective responsible business conduct practices in place, which include better risk-management, a lower cost of capital, overall better financial performance, and enhanced competitiveness; is convinced that due diligence increases certainty and transparency as regards the supply practices of undertakings sourcing from countries outside the Union and will help protect consumer interests by ensuring the quality and reliability of products, and should lead to more responsible purchasing practices and long-term supplier relationships of undertakings; stresses that the framework should be based on an obligation for undertakings to take all proportionate and commensurate measures and make efforts within their means; 2. Stresses that, while it is the duty of undertakings to respect human rights and the environment, it is the responsibility of states and governments to protect human rights and the environment, and this responsibility should not be transferred to private actors; recalls that due diligence is primarily a preventative mechanism and that undertakings should be first and foremost required to take all proportionate and commensurate measures and to make efforts within their means to identify potential or actual adverse impacts and adopt policies and measures to address them; 3. Calls on the Commission to always include, in the external policy activities, including in trade and investment agreements, provisions and discussions on the protection of human rights; 4. Asks the Commission to conduct a thorough review of undertakings based in Xinjiang that export products to the Union in order to identify potential breaches of human rights, especially those related to the repression of Uighurs; 5. Recalls that the full enjoyment of human rights, including the right to life, health, food and water, depends on the preservation of biodiversity, which is the foundation of ecosystem services to which human well-being is intrinsically linked; 6. Notes that, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, small and medium-sized undertakings face a challenging situation; believes that providing them with support and the creation of a favourable market environment are crucial objectives of the Union; 7. Stresses that human rights violations and breaches of social and environmental standards can be the result of an undertaking\u2019s own activities or of those of its business relationships under their control and along their value chain; underlines therefore that due diligence should encompass the entire value chain, but should also involve having a prioritisation policy; recalls that all human rights are universal, indivisible, interdependent and interrelated and should be promoted and respected in a fair, equitable and non-discriminatory manner; 8. Calls for supply chain traceability to be strengthened, based on the rules of origin of the Union Customs Code; notes that the Union\u2019s human rights policy and future corporate due diligence requirements adopted as a result of a legislative proposal from the Commission should be taken into account in the conduct of Union trade policy, including in relation to the ratification of trade and investment agreements and should cover trade with all trading partners, not just those with whom the Union has concluded a free trade agreement; stresses that Union trade instruments should include strong enforcement mechanisms such as withdrawal from preferential access in the event of non-compliance; 9. Considers that the scope of any future mandatory Union due diligence framework should be broad and cover all large undertakings governed by the law of a Member State or established in the territory of the Union, including those providing financial products and services, regardless of their sector of activity and of whether they are publicly owned or publicly controlled undertakings, as well as all publicly listed small and medium-sized undertakings and high-risk small and medium-sized undertakings; considers that the framework should also cover undertakings which are established outside the Union, but are active on the internal market; 24.11.2021 EN Official Journal of the European Union C 474/17 Wednesday 10 March 2021 ",
        "10. Is convinced that compliance with the due diligence obligations should be a condition for access to the internal market and that operators should be required to establish and provide evidence, through the exercise of due diligence, that the products that they place on the internal market are in conformity with the environmental and human rights criteria set out in the future due diligence legislation; calls for complementary measures such as the prohibition of the importation of products related to severe human rights violations such as forced labour or child labour; stresses the importance of including the objective of combating forced labour and child labour in Trade and Sustainable Development chapters of Union trade agreements; 11. Considers that some undertakings, and particularly publicly listed small and medium-sized undertakings and high-risk small and medium-sized undertakings may need less extensive and formalised due diligence processes, and that a proportionate approach should take into account, amongst other elements, the sector of activity, the size of the undertaking, the severity and likelihood of risks related to the respect of human rights, governance and the environment intrinsic to its operations and to the context of its operations, including geographic, its business model, its position in value chains and the nature of its products and services; calls for specific technical assistance to be provided to Union undertakings, especially to small and medium-sized undertakings, so that they can comply with due diligence requirements; 12. Underlines that due diligence strategies should be aligned with the SDGs and Union policy objectives in the field of human rights and the environment, including the European Green Deal, and the commitment to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by at least 55 % by 2030, and Union international policy, especially the Convention on Biological Diversity and the Paris Agreement and its goals to hold the increase in the global average temperature to well below 2 o C above pre-industrial levels and pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1,5 o C above pre-industrial levels; asks the Commission to develop, with the meaningful participation of relevant Union bodies, offices and agencies, a set of due diligence guidelines, including sector-specific guidelines, on how to comply with existing and future Union and international mandatory legal instruments and be in line with voluntary due diligence frameworks, including coherent methodologies and clear metrics to measure impacts and progress, in the areas of human rights, the environment and good governance, reiterates that such guidelines would be especially useful for small and medium-sized undertakings; 13. Notes that certified industry schemes offer small and medium-sized undertakings opportunities to efficiently pool and share responsibilities; underlines however that relying on certified industry schemes does not exclude the possibility of an undertaking being in breach of its due diligence obligations, or of being held liable in accordance with national law; notes that certified industry schemes must be assessed, recognised and overseen by the Commission; 14. Calls on the Commission to honour the principle of policy coherence for development, enshrined in Article 208 TFEU, in future legislation; stresses that it is important to minimise the possible contradictions and build synergies with development cooperation policy to the benefit of developing countries and to increase the effectiveness of development cooperation; considers that, in practical terms, this means actively involving the Commission\u2019s Directorate-General for International Cooperation and Development in the ongoing legislative work and conducting a thorough assessment of the impact of the relevant future Union legislation on developing countries from an economic, social, human rights and environmental perspective, in line with the Better Regulation Guidelines ( 36 ) and Tool 34 of the Better Regulation Toolbox ( 37 ); notes that the results of that assessment should inform the future legislative proposal; 15. Stresses that complementarity and coordination with development cooperation policy, instruments and actors is decisive and that the future Union legislation should therefore provide for some provisions in this regard; 16. Stresses that due diligence obligations should be carefully designed to be an ongoing and dynamic process instead of a \u2018box-ticking exercise\u2019 and that due diligence strategies should be in line with the dynamic nature of adverse impacts; considers that those strategies should cover every actual or potential adverse impact on human rights, the environment or good governance, although the severity and likelihood of the adverse impact should be considered in the context of a prioritisation policy; believes that, in line with the principle of proportionality, it is important to align existing tools and C 474/18 EN Official Journal of the European Union 24.11.2021 Wednesday 10 March 2021 ( 36 ) SWD(2017)0350.

Highlights that comprehensive transparency requirements are a crucial element of legislation on mandatory due diligence; notes that enhanced information and transparency give suppliers and manufacturers better oversight control and understanding of their supply chains and improve stakeholders\u2019 and consumers\u2019 monitoring capacity as well as public confidence in production; stresses in this regard that the future due diligence legislation should take into consideration digital solutions to facilitate public access to information and to minimise bureaucratic burdens; 18. Notes that due diligence also necessitates measuring the effectiveness of processes and measures through adequate audits and communicating the results, including periodically producing public evaluation reports on the due diligence processes of an undertaking and its results in a standardised format based on an adequate and coherent reporting framework; recommends that the reports be easily accessible and available, especially to those affected and potentially affected; states that disclosure requirements should take into account competition policy and the legitimate interest to protect internal business know-how and should not lead to disproportionate obstacles or a financial burden for undertakings; 19. Highlights that effective due diligence requires that undertakings carry out in good faith effective, meaningful and informed discussions with relevant stakeholders; stresses that a Union due diligence framework should ensure the involvement of trade unions and workers\u2019 representatives, at national, Union and global levels, in the establishment and implementation of the due diligence strategy; stresses that procedures for stakeholders\u2019 engagement must ensure safety and protection of physical and legal integrity of stakeholders; 20. Emphasises that engagement with trade partners, in a spirit of reciprocity, is important for ensuring due diligence effects change; underlines the importance of accompanying measures and projects to facilitate the implementation of Union free trade agreements and calls for a strong link between such measures and horizontal due diligence legislation; requests therefore that financial instruments, such as \u2018Aid for Trade\u2019, be used to promote and support the uptake of responsible business conduct in partner countries, including technical support on due diligence training, traceability mechanisms and embedding export-led reforms in partner countries; emphasises in this regard the need to promote good governance; 21. Requests that trade instruments be linked to, and Union Delegations be actively involved in, the monitoring of the application of the future due diligence legislation by Union undertakings operating outside the Union, including by convening meaningful exchanges of views with and supporting rights holders, local communities, chambers of commerce and national human rights institutions, civil society actors and trade unions; calls on the Commission to cooperate with Member States\u2019 chambers of commerce and national human rights institutions in providing online tools and information to support implementation of the future due diligence legislation; 22. Notes that coordination at sectoral level could enhance the consistency and effectiveness of due diligence efforts, allow for the sharing of best practices and contribute to levelling the playing field; 23. Considers that, to enforce due diligence, Member States should set up or designate national authorities to share best practices, carry out investigations, supervise and impose sanctions, taking into account the severity and repeated nature of the infringements; underlines that such authorities should be provided with sufficient resources and powers to realise their mission; considers that the Commission should set up a European due diligence network to be responsible for, together with the national competent authorities, the coordination and convergence of regulatory, investigative, enforcement and 24.11.2021 EN Official Journal of the European Union C 474/19 Wednesday 10 March 2021 ",

Highlights that comprehensive transparency requirements are a crucial element of legislation on mandatory due diligence; notes that enhanced information and transparency give suppliers and manufacturers better control and understanding of their supply chains and improve public confidence in production; stresses in this regard that the future due diligence legislation should focus on digital solutions to minimise bureaucratic burdens and calls on the Commission to investigate new technological solutions supportive of establishing and improving traceability in global supply chains; recalls that sustainable blockchain technology can contribute to this goal; 25. Considers that a grievance mechanism at the level of an undertaking can provide effective early-stage recourse, provided they are legitimate, accessible, predictable, equitable, transparent, human rights-compatible, based on engagement and dialogue, and protect against retaliation; considers that such private mechanisms must be properly articulated with judicial mechanisms in order to guarantee the highest protection of fundamental rights, including the right to a fair trial; stresses that such mechanisms should never undermine the right of a victim to file a complaint before competent authorities or to seek justice before a court; suggests that judicial authorities should be able to act on a complaint by third parties through safe and accessible channels without threat of reprisals; 26. Welcomes the announcement that the Commission proposal will include a liability regime and considers that in order to enable victims to obtain an effective remedy, undertakings should be held liable in accordance with national law for the harm the undertakings under their control have caused or contributed to by acts or omissions, where the latter have committed violations of human rights or have caused environmental harm, unless the undertaking can prove that it acted with due care in line with its due diligence obligations and took all reasonable measures to prevent such harm; underlines that time limitations, difficulties to access evidence, as well as gender inequality, vulnerabilities and marginalisation can be major practical and procedural barriers faced by victims of human rights violations in third countries, obstructing their access to effective legal remedies; stresses the importance of effective access to remedies without fear of retaliation and in a gender-responsive manner, and for persons in situations of vulnerability, as enshrined in Article 13 of the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities; recalls that Article 47 of the Charter requires the Member States to provide legal aid to those who lack sufficient resources insofar as such aid is necessary to ensure effective access to justice; 27. Notes that the traceability of undertakings in the value chain can be difficult; calls on the Commission to evaluate and propose tools in order to help undertakings with the traceability of their value chains; stresses that digital technologies could assist undertakings with their value chain due diligence and reduce costs; considers that the innovation objective of the Union should be linked to promoting human rights and sustainable governance under the future due diligence requirements; 28. Considers that conducting due diligence should not automatically absolve undertakings from liability for the harm they have caused or have contributed to; further considers, however, that having a robust and effective due diligence process in place can help undertakings to avoid causing harm; further considers that due diligence legislation should apply without prejudice to other applicable subcontracting, posting or supply chain liability frameworks established at national, European and international level, including joint and several liability in subcontracting chains; 29. Stresses that victims of business-related adverse impacts are often not sufficiently protected by the law of the country where the harm has been caused; considers, in this regard, that relevant provisions of the future directive should be considered overriding mandatory provisions in line with Article 16 of Regulation (EC) No 864/2007 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 July 2007 on the law applicable to non-contractual obligations (Rome II) ( 38 ); 30.

At the same time, many oil, gas, mining and food industry undertakings pushed into increasingly remote areas, often displacing indigenous communities without adequate consultation or compensation. (2) Within a context of mounting evidence of human rights violations and environmental degradation, concern grew about ensuring that businesses respected human rights and about ensuring that victims had access to justice, in particular when the value chains of some businesses extended into countries with weak legal systems and law enforcement, and holding them accountable in accordance with national law for causing or contributing to harm. In this light, the United Nations (UN) Human Rights Council in 2008 unanimously welcomed the \u2018Protect, Respect and Remedy\u2019 Framework. This framework rests on three pillars: the State duty to protect against human rights abuses by third parties, including businesses, through appropriate policies, regulation, and adjudication; the corporate responsibility to respect human rights, which means acting with due diligence to avoid infringing on the rights of others and to address adverse impacts that occur; and greater access by victims to effective remedies, both judicial and non-judicial. (3) That framework was followed by the UN Human Rights Council\u2019s endorsement in 2011 of the \u2018Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights\u2019 (UNGPs). The UNGPs introduced the first global standard for \u2018due diligence\u2019 and provided a non-binding framework for undertakings to put their responsibility to respect human rights into practice. Subsequently, other international organisations developed due diligence standards based on the UNGPs. The 2011 Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises refer extensively to due diligence and the OECD has developed guidance to help undertakings carry out due diligence in specific sectors and supply chains. In 2016, the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe adopted a recommendation addressed to Member States on human rights and business calling on its Member States to adopt legislative and other measures to ensure that human rights violations in an undertaking\u2019s value chain give rise to C 474/22 EN Official Journal of the European Union 24.11.2021 Wednesday 10 March 2021 ( 1 ) OJ \u2026 ",
        "civil, administrative and criminal liability before European courts. In 2018, the OECD adopted general Due Diligence Guidance for Responsible Business Conduct. Similarly, the International Labour Organisation (ILO) adopted in 2017 the ILO Tripartite Declaration of Principles Concerning Multinational Enterprises and Social Policy, which encourages undertakings to put in place due diligence mechanisms to identify, prevent, mitigate and account for the manner in which they address their business\u2019s actual and potential adverse impacts as regards internationally recognized human rights. The 2012 United Nations Global Compact, Save the Children and UNICEF Children\u2019s Rights and Business Principles identify key children\u2019s rights considerations relating to adverse business impact and UNICEF has developed a series of guidance documents supporting business due diligence and children. The 2013 UN Committee on the Rights of the Child General Comment No. 16 identifies a comprehensive range of State obligations regarding the impact of the business sector on children\u2019s rights, including States requiring businesses to undertake child-rights due diligence. (4) Undertakings thus currently have at their disposal an important number of international due diligence instruments that can help them fulfil their responsibility to respect human rights. While it is difficult to overstate the importance of these instruments for undertakings that take their duty to respect human rights seriously, their voluntary nature can hamper their effectiveness and their effect has proved limited, with a restricted number of undertakings voluntarily implementing human rights due diligence in relation to their activities and those of their business relationships. This is exacerbated by many undertakings\u2019 excessive focus on short-term profit maximisation. (5) Existing international due diligence instruments have failed to provide victims of human rights and environmental adverse impacts with access to justice and remedies because of their non-judicial and voluntary nature. The primary duty to protect human rights and provide access to justice lies with States, and the lack of public judicial mechanisms to hold undertakings liable for damages occurring in their value chains should not and cannot adequately be compensated by the development of private operational grievance mechanisms. Whereas such mechanisms are useful in providing emergency relief and fast compensation for small damages, they should be closely regulated by public authorities and should not undermine the right of victims to access justice and the right to a fair trial before public courts. (6) The Union has adopted mandatory due diligence frameworks in very specific areas with the aim of combating sectors that harm the interests of the Union or its Member States, such as the financing of terrorism or deforestation. In 2010, the Union adopted Regulation (EU) No 995/2010 of the European Parliament and of the Council ( 2 ), which subjects operators that place timber and timber products on the internal market to due diligence requirements and requires traders in the supply chain to provide basic information on their suppliers and buyers to improve the traceability of timber and timber products. Regulation (EU) 2017/821 of the European Parliament and of the Council ( 3 ) establishes a Union system for supply chain due diligence in order to curtail opportunities for armed groups, terrorist groups and/or security forces to trade in tin, tantalum and tungsten, their ores, and gold. (7) A different, more general and complementary approach based on transparency and sustainability was taken by Directive 2014/95/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council ( 4 ), which imposes on undertakings with more than 500 employees the obligation to report on the policies they pursue in relation to environmental, social, employee-related, and anti-corruption and bribery matters and respect for human rights, including due diligence. (8) In some Member States the need to make undertakings more responsive to human rights and to environmental and good governance concerns has led to the adoption of national due diligence legislation. In the Netherlands, the Child Labour Due Diligence Act requires undertakings operating in the Dutch market to investigate whether there is 24.11.2021 EN Official Journal of the European Union C 474/23 Wednesday 10 March 2021 ( 2 ) Regulation (EU) No 995/2010 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 20 October 2010 laying down the obligations of operators who place timber and timber products on the market (OJ L 295, 12.11.2010, p. 23).

        "a reasonable suspicion that the goods or services supplied have been produced using child labour and, in the event of reasonable suspicion, to adopt and implement an action plan. In France, the law on a duty of vigilance of parent and ordering undertakings requires some large undertakings to adopt, publish and implement a due diligence plan to identify and prevent human rights, health and safety and environmental risks caused by the undertaking, its subsidiaries, sub-contractors or suppliers. The French law establishes an administrative liability for the failure to abide by its due diligence requirements, and a civil liability for the undertaking to provide remedies for harm caused. In many other Member States, debate is ongoing as to the introduction of mandatory due diligence requirements for undertakings and some Member States are currently considering the adoption of such legislation, including Germany, Sweden, Austria, Finland, Denmark, and Luxembourg. (9) In 2016, eight national parliaments expressed their support for a \u2018Green Card Initiative\u2019 calling on the Commission to bring forward legislation to ensure corporate accountability for human rights abuses, including the Parliaments of Estonia, Lithuania, Slovakia and Portugal, the House of Representatives in the Netherlands, the Senate of the Republic in Italy, and the National Assembly in France, as well as the UK House of Lords. (10) The insufficient harmonisation of laws can have an adverse impact on the freedom of establishment. Further harmonisation is therefore essential to prevent unfair competitive advantages being created. To create a level playing field, it is important that the rules apply to all undertakings \u2014 be they Union or non-Union \u2014 operating in the internal market. (11) There are significant differences between Member States\u2019 legal and administrative provisions on due diligence, including as regards civil liability, that apply to Union undertakings. It is essential to prevent future barriers to trade stemming from the divergent development of such national laws. (12) In order to ensure a level playing field, the responsibility for undertakings to respect human rights under international standards should be transformed into a legal duty at Union level. By coordinating safeguards for the protection of human rights, the environment and good governance, this Directive should ensure that all Union and non-Union large undertakings and high-risk or publicly listed small and medium-sized undertakings operating in the internal market are subject to harmonised due diligence obligations, which will prevent regulatory fragmentation and improve the functioning of the internal market. (13) The establishment of mandatory due diligence requirements at Union level would be beneficial to businesses in terms of harmonization, legal certainty and the securing of a level playing field and would give undertakings subject to them a competitive advantage, inasmuch as societies are increasingly demanding from undertakings that they become more ethical and sustainable. This Directive, by setting a Union due diligence standard, could help foster the emergence of a global standard for responsible business conduct. (14) This Directive aims to prevent and mitigate potential or actual adverse impacts on human rights, the environment and good governance in the value chain, as well as at ensuring that undertakings can be held accountable for such impacts, and that anyone who has suffered harm in this regard can effectively exercise the right to a fair trial before a court and the right to obtain remedies in accordance with national law. (15) This Directive is not aimed at replacing Union sector-specific due diligence legislation already in force or precluding further Union sector-specific legislation from being introduced. Consequently, it should apply without prejudice to other due diligence requirements established in Union sector-specific legislation, in particular Regulations (EU) No 995/2010 and (EU) 2017/821, unless the due diligence requirements in this Directive provide for more thorough due diligence with regard to human rights, the environment or good governance. (16) The implementation of this Directive should in no way constitute grounds for justifying a reduction in the general level of protection of human rights or the environment. In particular, it should not affect other applicable subcontracting, posting or supply chain liability frameworks established at national, Union or international level. The fact that an undertaking has carried out its due diligence obligations under this Directive should not exonerate it from or weaken its obligations under other liability frameworks and therefore any legal proceedings brought against it based on other liability frameworks should not be dismissed on account of that circumstance.

        "(17) This Directive should apply to all large undertakings governed by the law of a Member State, established in the territory of the Union or operating in the internal market, regardless of whether they are private or state-owned and of the economic sector they are active in, including the financial sector. This Directive should also apply to publicly listed and high-risk small and medium-sized undertakings (*). (18) Proportionality is built into the due diligence process, as this process is contingent on the severity and likelihood of adverse impacts that an undertaking might cause, contribute to or be directly linked to, its sector of activity, the size of the undertaking, the nature and context of its operations including geographic, its business model, its position in the value chain and the nature of its products and services. A large undertaking whose direct business relationships are all domiciled within the Union or a small or medium-sized undertaking that, after carrying out a risk assessment, concludes that it has not identified any potential or actual adverse impacts in its business relationships, could publish a statement to that effect, including its risk assessment containing the relevant data, information and methodology, which should in any case be reviewed in the event of changes to the undertakings\u2019 operations, business relationships or operating context. (19) For undertakings owned or controlled by the State, the fulfilment of their due diligence obligations should require that they procure services from undertakings which have complied with due diligence obligations. Member States are encouraged not to provide state support, including through state aid, public procurement, export credit agencies or government-backed loans, to undertakings that do not comply with the objectives of this Directive. (20) For the purposes of this Directive, due diligence should be understood as the obligation of an undertaking to take all proportionate and commensurate measures and make efforts within their means to prevent adverse impacts on human rights, the environment or good governance from occurring in their value chains, and to address such impacts when they occur. In practice, due diligence consists in a process put in place by an undertaking in order to identify, assess, prevent, mitigate, cease, monitor, communicate, account for, address and remedy the potential and/or actual adverse impacts on human rights, including social, trade union and labour rights, on the environment, including the contribution to climate change, and on good governance, in its own operations and its business relationships in the value chain. Undertakings covered by this Directive should not pass on due diligence obligations to suppliers. (21) Annex xx sets out a list of types of business-related adverse impacts on human rights. To the extent that they are relevant for undertakings, the Commission should include in that Annex the adverse impacts on human rights expressed in the international human rights conventions that are binding upon the Union or the Member States, the International Bill of Human Rights, International Humanitarian Law, the United Nations human rights instruments on the rights of persons belonging to particularly vulnerable groups or communities, and the principles concerning fundamental rights set out in the ILO Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work, as well as those recognised in the ILO Convention on freedom of association and the effective recognition of the right to collective bargaining, the ILO Convention on the elimination of all forms of forced or compulsory labour, the ILO Convention on the effective abolition of child labour, and the ILO Convention on the elimination of discrimination in respect of employment and occupation. They further include, but are not restricted to, adverse impacts in relation to other rights recognised in the Tripartite of principles concerning multinational enterprises and social policy (MNE declaration) and a number of ILO Conventions, such as those concerning freedom of association, collective bargaining, minimum age, occupational safety and health, and equal remuneration, and the rights recognised in the Convention on the Rights of the Child, the African Charter of Human and Peoples\u2019 Rights, the American Convention on Human Rights, the European Convention on Human Rights, the European Social Charter, the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, and national constitutions and laws recognising or implementing human rights. The Commission should ensure that those types of impacts listed are reasonable and achievable. 24.11.2021 EN Official Journal of the European Union C 474/25 Wednesday 10 March 2021 (*) The Commission should identify high-risk sectors of economic activity with a significant impact on human rights, the environment and good governance in order to include the small and medium-sized undertakings operating in those sectors within the scope of this Directive. High-risk small and medium-sized undertakings should be defined by the Commission in this Directive. The definition should take into account the sector of the undertaking or its type of activities. ",
        "(22) Environmental adverse impacts are often closely linked to human rights adverse impacts. The United Nations Special Rapporteur on human rights and the environment has stated that the rights to life, health, food, water and development, as well as the right to a safe, clean, healthy and sustainable environment, are necessary for the full enjoyment of human rights. Furthermore, the United Nations General Assembly has recognised, in Resolution 64/292, the right to safe and clean drinking water and sanitation as a human right. The COVID-19 pandemic has underlined not only the importance of safe and healthy working environments, but also that of undertakings ensuring they do not cause or contribute to health risks in their value chains. Consequently, those rights should be covered by this Directive. (23) Annex xxx sets out a list of types of business-related adverse impacts on the environment, whether temporary or permanent, that are relevant for undertakings. Such impacts should include, but should not be limited to, production of waste, diffuse pollution and greenhouse emissions that lead to a global warming of more than 1,5 o C above pre-industrial levels, deforestation, and any other impact on the climate, air, soil and water quality, the sustainable use of natural resources, biodiversity and ecosystems. The Commission should ensure that those types of impacts listed are reasonable and achievable. To contribute to the internal coherence of Union legislation and to provide legal certainty, this list is drawn up in line with Regulation (EU) 2020/852 of the European Parliament and of the Council ( 5 ). (24) Annex xxxx sets out a list of types of business-related adverse impacts on good governance that are relevant for undertakings. They should include non-compliance with OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises, Chapter VII on Combatting Bribery, Bribe Solicitation and Extortion and the principles of the OECD Convention on Combating Bribery of Foreign Public Officials in International Business Transactions and situations of corruption and bribery where an undertaking exercises undue influence on, or channels undue pecuniary advantages to, public officials to obtain privileges or unfair favourable treatment in breach of the law, and including situations in which an undertaking becomes improperly involved in local political activities, makes illegal campaign contributions or fails to comply with the applicable tax legislation. The Commission should ensure that those types of impacts listed are reasonable and achievable. (25) Adverse impacts on human rights, the environment and good governance are not gender-neutral. Undertakings are encouraged to integrate the gender perspective into their due diligence processes. They can find guidance in the UN booklet Gender Dimensions of the Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights. (26) Human rights, environmental and governance potential or actual adverse impacts can be specific and more salient in conflict-affected areas. In this regard, undertakings operating in conflict-affected areas should conduct appropriate human rights, environmental and governance due diligence, respect their international humanitarian law obligations, and refer to existing international standards and guidance including the Geneva Conventions and its additional protocols. (27) Member States are encouraged to monitor the undertakings under their jurisdictions with operations or business relationships in conflict-affected areas, and accordingly take the necessary actions to protect human rights, the environment and good governance in line with their legal obligations, with due consideration for the specific and salient risks present in those areas. (28) Business impacts on the full spectrum of rights defined in the UN Convention Rights of the Child and other relevant international standards. Childhood is a unique period of physical, mental, emotional and spiritual development and violations of children\u2019s rights, such as exposure to violence or abuse, child labour, inappropriate marketing, or unsafe products or environmental hazards, may have lifelong, irreversible and even transgenerational consequences. Mechanisms for corporate due diligence and corporate accountability designed without due attention being given to children\u2019s considerations risk being ineffective in protecting their rights.

",
        "(29) Violations of or adverse impacts on human rights and social, environmental and climate standards by undertakings can be the result of their own activities or of those of their business relationships, in particular suppliers, sub-contractors and investee undertakings. In order to be effective, undertakings\u2019 due diligence obligations should encompass the entire value chain, while taking a risk-based approach and setting up a prioritization strategy on the basis of Principle 17 of the UN Guiding Principles. However, tracing all undertakings intervening in the value chain can be difficult. The Commission should evaluate and propose tools in order to help undertakings with the traceability of their value chains. This could include innovative information technologies, such as blockchain, that allow all data to be traced, the development of which should be encouraged in order to minimise administrative costs and avoid redundancies for undertakings performing due diligence. (30) Due diligence is primarily a preventative mechanism that requires undertakings to take all proportionate and commensurate measures and make efforts within their means to identify and assess potential or actual adverse impacts and to adopt policies and measures to cease, prevent, mitigate, monitor, communicate, address, remediate them, and account for how they address those impacts. Undertakings should be required to produce a document in which they publicly communicate, with due regard for commercial confidentiality, their due diligence strategy with reference to each of those stages. This due diligence strategy should be duly integrated into the undertaking\u2019s overall business strategy. It should be evaluated annually, and revised whenever this is considered necessary as a result of such evaluation. (31) Undertakings that publish no risk statements should not be exempt from possible checks or investigations by Member State competent authorities in order to ensure that they comply with the obligations provided for in this Directive, and they can be held liable in accordance with national law. (32) Undertakings should set up an internal value chain-mapping process that involves making all proportionate and commensurate efforts in order to identify their business relationships in their value chain. (33) Commercial confidentiality as referred to in this Directive should apply in respect of any information which meets of the requirements to be considered a \u2018trade secret\u2019 in accordance with the Directive (EU) 2016/943 of the European Parliament and of the Council ( 6 ), namely information that is secret, in the sense that it is not, as a body or in the precise configuration and assembly of its components, generally known or readily accessible to persons within the circles that normally deal with the kind of information in question, that it has commercial value because it is secret, and that it has been subject to reasonable steps under the circumstances, by the person lawfully in control of the information, to keep it secret. (34) Due diligence should not be a \u2018box-ticking\u2019 exercise but should consist of an ongoing process and assessment of risks and impacts, which are dynamic and may change on account of new business relationships or contextual developments. Undertakings should therefore in an ongoing manner monitor and adapt their due diligence strategies accordingly. Those strategies should strive to cover every actual or potential adverse impact, although the nature and context of their operations, including geographical, the severity and likelihood of the adverse impact should be considered if the establishment of a prioritisation policy is required. Third-party certification schemes can complement due diligence strategies, provided that they are adequate in terms of scope and meet appropriate levels of transparency, impartiality, accessibility and reliability. However, third-party certification should not constitute grounds for justifying a derogation from the obligations set out in this Directive or affect an undertaking\u2019s potential liability in any way. (35) In order for a subsidiary to be deemed in compliance with the obligation to establish a due diligence strategy, if the subsidiary is included in the due diligence strategy of its parent undertaking, the subsidiary should clearly state that that is the case in its annual reporting. Such a requirement is necessary to ensure that there is transparency for the public to enable national competent authorities to carry out the appropriate investigations. The subsidiary should ensure that the parent undertaking possesses sufficient, relevant information in order to perform due diligence on its behalf. 24.11.2021 EN Official Journal of the European Union C 474/27 Wednesday 10 March 2021 ( 6 ) Directive (EU) 2016/943 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 8 June 2016 on the protection of undisclosed know-how and business information (trade secrets) against their unlawful acquisition, use and disclosure (OJ L 157, 15.6.2016, p. 1). ",
        "(36) The appropriate frequency of verification in a given time period implied by the term \u2018regularly\u2019 should be determined in relation to the likelihood and severity of adverse impacts. The more likely and severe the impacts, the more regularly the verification of compliance should be carried out. (37) Undertakings should first try to address and solve a potential or actual impact on human rights, the environment or good governance in discussion with stakeholders. An undertaking which has leverage to prevent or mitigate the adverse impact should exercise it. An undertaking wishing to increase its leverage could, for example, offer capacity-building or other incentives to the related entity, or collaborat e with other actors. Where an adverse impact cannot be prevented or mitigated and the leverage cannot be increased, a decision to disengage from a supplier or other business relationship could be a last resort and should be done in a responsible manner. (38) Sound due diligence requires that all relevant stakeholders be consulted effectively and meaningfully, and that trade unions in particular be appropriately involved. The consultation and involvement of stakeholders can help undertakings to identify potential and actual adverse impacts more precisely and to set up a more effective due diligence strategy. This Directive therefore requires the discussion with and involvement of stakeholders at all stages of the due diligence process. Furthermore, such discussion and involvement may give voice to those with a strong interest in the long-term sustainability of an undertaking. Stakeholder participation could help improve the long-term performance and profitability of undertakings, as their increased sustainability would have positive aggregate economic effects. (39) When carrying out discussions with stakeholders as provided for by this Directive, undertakings should ensure that where the stakeholders are indigenous peoples such discussions are conducted in accordance with international human rights standards, such as the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples ( 7 ), including free, prior and informed consent and indigenous peoples\u2019 right to self-determination. (40) The concept of stakeholder means persons whose rights and interests may be affected by the decisions of an undertaking. The term therefore includes workers, local communities, children, indigenous peoples, citizens\u2019 associations and shareholders, and organisations whose statutory purpose is to ensure that human and social rights, climate, environmental and good governance standards are respected, such as trade unions and civil society organisations. (41) To avoid the risk of critical stakeholder's voices remaining unheard or marginalised in the due diligence process, this Directive should grant relevant stakeholders the right to safe and meaningful discussions as regards the undertaking\u2019s due diligence strategy, and should ensure the appropriate involvement of trade unions or of workers\u2019 representatives. (42) Relevant information on the due diligence strategy should be communicated to potentially affected stakeholders upon requests and in a manner appropriate to those stakeholder\u2019s context, for instance by taking into account the official language of the country of the stakeholders, their level of literacy and of access to the internet. However, there should be no obligation on undertakings to proactively disclose their entire due diligence strategy in a manner appropriate to the stakeholder\u2019s context, and the requirement to communicate relevant information should be proportionate to the nature, context and size of the undertaking. (43) Procedures to raise concerns should ensure that the anonymity or confidentiality of those concerns, as appropriate in accordance with national law, as well as the safety and physical and legal integrity of all complainants, including human rights and environmental defenders, is protected. In the event that such procedures concern whistleblowers, those procedures should be in line with Directive (EU) 2019/1937 of the European Parliament and of the Council ( 8 ).

",
        "(44) Undertakings should be required to make all proportionate and commensurate efforts within their means to identify their suppliers and subcontractors and make relevant information accessible to the public, with due regard to commercial confidentiality. In order to be fully effective, due diligence should not be limited to the first tier downstream and upstream in the supply chain but should encompass those that, during the due diligence process, might have been identified by the undertaking as posing major risks. This Directive, however, should take account of the fact that not all undertakings have the same resources or capabilities to identify all their suppliers and subcontractors and therefore this obligation should be made subject to the principles of reasonableness and proportionality, which in no case should be interpreted by undertakings as a pretext not to comply with their obligation to make all necessary efforts in that regard. (45) For due diligence to be embedded in the culture and structure of an undertaking, the members of the administrative, management and supervisory bodies of the undertaking should be responsible for the adoption and implementation of its sustainability and due diligence strategies. (46) Coordination of undertakings\u2019 due diligence efforts and voluntary collaborative actions at sectoral or cross-sectoral level could enhance the consistency and effectiveness of their due diligence strategies. To this end, Member States could encourage the adoption of due diligence action plans at sectoral or cross-sectoral level. Stakeholders should participate in the definition of those plans. The development of such collective measures should in no way absolve the undertaking of its individual responsibility to perform due diligence or prevent it from being held liable for harm it caused or contributed to in accordance with national law. (47) In order to be effective, a due diligence framework should include grievance mechanisms at the level of the undertaking or at sectoral level, and, in order to ensure that such mechanisms are effective, undertakings should take decisions informed by the position of stakeholders, when developing grievance mechanisms. Those mechanisms should allow stakeholders to raise reasonable concerns and should function as an early-warning risk-awareness and mediation system. They should be legitimate, accessible, predictable, equitable, transparent, rights-compatible, a source of continuous learning and should be based on engagement and dialogue. Grievance mechanisms should be entitled to make suggestions as to how potential or actual adverse impacts could be addressed by the undertaking involved. They should also be able to propose an appropriate remedy when it is brought to their attention through mediation that an undertaking has caused or contributed to an adverse impact. (48) Grievance mechanisms should not discharge Member States from their primary duty to protect human rights and to provide access to justice and remedies. (49) Member States should designate one or more national authorities to monitor the correct implementation by undertakings of their due diligence obligations and ensure the proper enforcement of this Directive. These national authorities should be independent and should have the appropriate powers and resources to carry out their tasks. They should be entitled to carry out appropriate checks, on their own initiative or based on substantiated and reasonable concerns raised by stakeholders and third parties, and impose effective proportionate and dissuasive administrative sanctions, taking into account the severity and repetition of infringements, in order to ensure that undertakings comply with the obligations set out in the national law. At Union level, a European Due Diligence Network of competent authorities should be set up by the Commission to ensure cooperation. (50) The Commission and the Member States are encouraged to provide for administrative fines comparable in magnitude to fines currently provided for in competition law and data protection law. (51) The national authorities are encouraged to cooperate and share information with the OECD National Contact Points (NCP) and national human rights institutions available in their country. (52) In line with the UNGPs, conducting due diligence should not absolve undertakings per se from liability for causing or contributing to human rights abuses or environmental damage. However, having a robust and adequate due diligence process in place may help undertakings to prevent harm from occurring. 24.11.2021 EN Official Journal of the European Union C 474/29 Wednesday 10 March 2021 ",
        "(53) When introducing a liability regime, Member States should ensure a rebuttable presumption requiring a certain level of evidence. The burden of proof would be shifted from a victim to an undertaking to prove that an undertaking did not have control over a business entity involved in the human rights abuse. (54) Limitation periods should be deemed reasonable and appropriate if they do not restrict the right of victims to access justice, with due consideration for the practical challenges faced by potential claimants. Sufficient time should be given for victims of human rights, environmental and governance adverse impacts to bring judicial claims, taking into account their geographical location, their means and the overall difficulty to raise admissible claims before Union courts. (55) The right to an effective remedy is an internationally recognised human right, enshrined in Article 8 Universal Declaration of Human Rights and in Article 2(3) International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, and is also a Union fundamental right (Article 47 of the Charter). As recalled by the UNGPs, states have the duty to ensure, through judicial, administrative, legislative or other appropriate means, that those affected by business-related human rights abuses have access to an effective remedy. Therefore, this Directive makes specific reference to this obligation in line with the United Nations Basic Principles and Guidelines on the Rights to Remedy and Reparation for Victims of Gross Violations of International Human Rights Law and Serious Violations of International Humanitarian Law. (56) Large undertakings are encouraged to set up advisory committees tasked with advising their governing bodies on due diligence matters, and including stakeholders in their composition. (57) Trade unions should be given the necessary resources to exercise their rights in relation to due diligence, including in order to establish connections with trade unions and workers in the undertakings with which the main undertaking has business relationships. (58) Member States should use existing liability regimes or, if necessary, introduce further legislation to ensure that undertakings can, in accordance with national law, be held liable for any harm arising out of adverse impacts on human rights, the environment and governance that they, or entities they control, have caused or contributed to by acts or omissions, unless the undertaking can prove it took all due care in line with this Directive to avoid the harm in question, or that the harm would have occurred even if all due care had been taken. (59) In order to create clarity and certainty and consistency among the practices of undertakings, the Commission should prepare guidelines in consultation with Member States and the OECD and with the assistance of a number of specialised agencies, in particular the European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights, the European Environment Agency and the Executive Agency for Small and Medium-sized Enterprises. A number of guidelines on due diligence produced by international organisations already exist and could be used as a reference for the Commission when developing guidelines under this Directive specifically for Union undertakings. This Directive should aim for full harmonization of standards among Member States. In addition to general guidelines which should guide all undertakings and in particular small and medium-sized undertakings in the application of due diligence in their operations, the Commission should envisage producing sector-specific guidelines and provide a regularly updated list of country fact-sheets in order to help undertakings assess the potential and actual adverse impacts of their business operations on human rights, the environment and good governance in a given area. Those fact-sheets should indicate in particular which Conventions and Treaties among those listed in Annexes xx, xxx and xxxx to this Directive have been ratified by a given country. (60) In order to update the types of adverse impacts, the power to adopt acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union should be delegated to the Commission in respect of amending Annexes xx, xxx and xxxx to this Directive. It is of particular importance that the Commission carry out appropriate consultations during its preparatory work, including at expert level, and that those consultations be conducted in accordance with the principles laid down in the Interinstitutional Agreement of 13 April 2016 on Better Law-Making ( 9 ). In particular, to ensure equal participation in the preparation of delegated acts, the European Parliament and the Council receive all documents at the same time as Member States' experts, and their experts systematically have access to meetings of Commission expert groups dealing with the preparation of delegated acts.

        "(61) Since the objectives of this Directive cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States but can rather, by reason of the scale or effects of the action, be better achieved at Union level, the Union may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty on European Union. In accordance with the principle of proportionality as set out in that Article, this Directive does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve those objectives, HAVE ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE: Article 1 Subject matter and objective 1. This Directive is aimed at ensuring that undertakings under its scope operating in the internal market fulfil their duty to respect human rights, the environment and good governance and do not cause or contribute to potential or actual adverse impacts on human rights, the environment and good governance through their own activities or those directly linked to their operations, products or services by a business relationship or in their value chains, and that they prevent and mitigate those adverse impacts. 2. This Directive lays down the value chain due diligence obligations of undertakings under its scope, namely to take all proportionate and commensurate measures and make efforts within their means to prevent adverse impacts on human rights, the environment and good governance from occurring in their value chains, and to properly address such adverse impacts when they occur. The exercise of due diligence requires undertakings to identify, assess, prevent, cease, mitigate, monitor, communicate, account for, address and remediate the potential and/or actual adverse impacts on human rights, the environment and good governance that their own activities and those of their value chains and business relationships may pose. By coordinating safeguards for the protection of human rights, the environment and good governance, those due diligence requirements are aimed at improving the functioning of the internal market. 3. This Directive further aims to ensure that undertakings can be held accountable and liable in accordance with national law for the adverse impacts on human rights, the environment and good governance that they cause or to which they contribute in their value chain, and aims to ensure that victims have access to legal remedies. 4. This Directive applies without prejudice to further due diligence requirements established in Union sector-specific legislation, in particular Regulation (EU) No 995/2010 and Regulation (EU) 2017/821, unless the due diligence requirements under this Directive provide for more thorough due diligence with regard to human rights, the environment or good governance. 5. The implementation of this Directive shall in no way constitute grounds for justifying a reduction in the general level of protection of human rights or the environment. In particular, it shall be applied without prejudice to other applicable subcontracting, posting or value chain liability frameworks, established at national, Union or international level. Article 2 Scope 1. This Directive shall apply to large undertakings governed by the law of a Member State or established in the territory of the Union. 2. This Directive shall also apply to all publicly listed small and medium-sized undertakings, as well as high-risk small and medium-sized undertakings. 3. This Directive shall also apply to large undertakings, to publicly listed small and medium-sized undertakings and to small and medium-sized undertakings operating in high risk sectors, which are governed by the law of a third country and are not established in the territory of the Union when they operate in the internal market selling goods or providing services. Those undertakings shall fulfil the due diligence requirements established in this Directive as transposed into the legislation of the Member State in which they operate and be subject to the sanctions and liability regimes established by this Directive as transposed into the legislation of the Member State in which they operate. 24.11.2021 EN Official Journal of the European Union C 474/31 Wednesday 10 March 2021 ",
        "Article 3 Definitions For the purposes of this Directive, the following definitions apply: (1) \u2018stakeholders\u2019 means individuals, and groups of individuals whose rights or interests may be affected by the potential or actual adverse impacts on human rights, the environment and good governance posed by an undertaking or its business relationships, as well as organisations whose statutory purpose is the defence of human rights, including social and labour rights, the environment and good governance. These can include workers and their representatives, local communities, children, indigenous peoples, citizens\u2019 associations, trade unions, civil society organisations and the undertakings\u2019 shareholders; (2) \u2018business relationships\u2019 means subsidiaries and commercial relationships of an undertaking throughout its value chain, including suppliers and sub-contractors, which are directly linked to the undertaking\u2019s business operations, products or services; (3) \u2018supplier\u2019 means any undertaking that provides a product, part of a product, or service to another undertaking, either directly or indirectly, in the context of a business relationship; (4) \u2018sub-contractor\u2019 means all business relationships that perform a service or an activity that contributes to the completion of an undertaking\u2019s operations; (5) \u2018value chain\u2019 means all activities, operations, business relationships and investment chains of an undertaking and includes entities with which the undertaking has a direct or indirect business relationship, upstream and downstream, and which either: (a) supply products, parts of products or services that contribute to the undertaking\u2019s own products or services, or (b) receive products or services from the undertaking; (6) \u2018potential or actual adverse impact on human rights\u2019 means any potential or actual adverse impact that may impair the full enjoyment of human rights by individuals or groups of individuals in relation to human rights, including social, worker and trade union rights, as set out in Annex xx to this Directive. That Annex shall be reviewed on a regular basis and be consistent with the Union\u2019s objectives on human rights. The Commission is empowered to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 17, to amend the list in Annex xx; (7) \u2018potential or actual adverse impact on the environment\u2019 means any violation of internationally recognised and Union environmental standards, as set out in Annex xxx to this Directive. That Annex shall be reviewed on a regular basis and be consistent with the Union\u2019s objectives on environmental protection and climate change mitigation. The Commission is empowered to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 17, to amend the list in Annex xxx; (8) \u2018potential or actual adverse impact on good governance\u2019 means any potential or actual adverse impact on the good governance of a country, region or territory, as set in Annex xxxx to this Directive. That Annex shall be reviewed on a regular basis and be consistent with the Union\u2019s objectives on good governance. The Commission is empowered to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 17, to amend the list in Annex xxxx; (9) \u2018control\u2019 means the possibility for an undertaking to exercise decisive influence on another undertaking, in particular by ownership or the right to use all or part of the assets of the latter, or by rights or contracts or any other means, having regard to all factual considerations, which confer decisive influence on the composition, voting or decisions of the decision making bodies of an undertaking; (10) \u2018contribute to\u2019 means that an undertaking\u2019s activities, in combination with the activities of other entities, cause an impact, or that the activities of the undertaking cause, facilitate or incentivise another entity to cause an adverse impact. The contribution has to be substantial, meaning that minor or trivial contributions are excluded. Assessing the substantial nature of the contribution and understanding when the actions of the undertaking may have caused, facilitated or incentivised another entity to cause an adverse impact can involve the consideration of multiple factors. C 474/32 EN Official Journal of the European Union 24.11.2021 Wednesday 10 March 2021 ",
        "The following factors can be taken into account: \u2014 the extent to which an undertaking may encourage or motivate an adverse impact by another entity, i.e. the degree to which the activity increased the risk of the impact occurring, \u2014 the extent to which an undertaking could or should have known about the adverse impact or potential for adverse impact, i.e. the degree of foreseeability, \u2014 the degree to which any of the undertaking\u2019s activities actually mitigated the adverse impact or decreased the risk of the impact occurring. The mere existence of a business relationship or activities which create the general conditions in which it is possible for adverse impacts to occur does not in itself constitute a relationship of contribution. The activity in question should substantially increase the risk of adverse impact. Article 4 Due diligence strategy 1. Member States shall lay down rules to ensure that undertakings carry out effective due diligence with respect to potential or actual adverse impacts on human rights, the environment and good governance in their operations and business relationships. 2. Undertakings shall in an ongoing manner make all efforts within their means to identify and assess, by means of a risk based monitoring methodology that takes into account the likelihood, severity and urgency of potential or actual impacts on human rights, the environment or good governance, the nature and context of their operations, including geographic, and whether their operations and business relationships cause or contribute to or are directly linked to any of those potential or actual adverse impact. 3. If a large undertaking, whose direct business relationships are all domiciled within the Union, or a small or medium-sized undertaking concludes, in line with paragraph 2, that it does not cause, contribute to, or that it is not directly linked to any potential or actual adverse impact on human rights, the environment or good governance, it shall publish a statement to that effect and shall include its risk assessment containing the relevant data, information and methodology that led to this conclusion. In particular, that undertaking may conclude that it has encountered no adverse impacts on human rights, the environment or good governance if its impacts identification and risk assessment analysis determines that all of its direct suppliers perform due diligence in line with this directive. That statement shall be reviewed in the event that new risks emerge or in the event of that undertaking entering into new business relationships that can pose risks. 4. Unless an undertaking concludes, in line with paragraphs 2 and 3, that it does not cause or contribute to, or that it is not directly linked to any potential or actual adverse impact on human rights, the environment or good governance, it shall establish and effectively implement a due diligence strategy. As part of their due diligence strategy, undertakings shall: (i) specify the potential or actual adverse impacts on human rights, the environment and good governance identified and assessed in conformity with paragraph 2, that are likely to be present in its operations and business relationships, and the level of their severity, likelihood and urgency and the relevant data, information and methodology that led to these conclusions; (ii) map their value chain and, with due regard for commercial confidentiality, publicly disclose relevant information about the undertaking\u2019s value chain, which may include names, locations, types of products and services supplied, and other relevant information concerning subsidiaries, suppliers and business partners in its value chain; (iii) adopt and indicate all proportionate and commensurate policies and measures with a view to ceasing, preventing or mitigating potential or actual adverse impacts on human rights, the environment or good governance; 24.11.2021 EN Official Journal of the European Union C 474/33 Wednesday 10 March 2021 ",
        "(iv) set up a prioritisation strategy on the basis of Principle 17 of the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights in the event that they are not in a position to deal with all the potential or actual adverse impacts at the same time. Undertakings shall consider the level of severity, likelihood and urgency of the different potential or actual adverse impacts on human rights, the environment or good governance, the nature and context of their operations, including geographic, the scope of the risks, their scale and how irremediable they might be, and if necessary, use the prioritisation policy in dealing with them. 5. Undertakings shall ensure that their business strategy and their policies are in line with their due diligence strategy. Undertakings shall include explanations in their due diligence strategies in that regard. 6. The subsidiaries of an undertaking shall be deemed in compliance with the obligation to establish a due diligence strategy if their parent undertaking includes them in their due diligence strategy. 7. Undertakings shall carry out value chain due diligence which is proportionate and commensurate to the likelihood and severity of their potential or actual adverse impacts and their specific circumstances, particularly their sector of activity, the size and length of their value chain, the size of the undertaking, its capacity, resources and leverage. 8. Undertakings shall ensure that their business relationships put in place and carry out human rights, environmental and good governance policies that are in line with their due diligence strategy, including for instance by means of framework agreements, contractual clauses, the adoption of codes of conduct or by means of certified and independent audits. Undertakings shall ensure that their purchase polices do not cause or contribute to potential or actual adverse impacts on human rights, the environment or good governance. 9. Undertakings shall regularly verify that subcontractors and suppliers comply with their obligations under paragraph 8. Article 5 Stakeholder engagement 1. Member States shall ensure that undertakings carry out in good faith effective, meaningful and informed discussions with relevant stakeholders when establishing and implementing their due diligence strategy. Member States shall guarantee, in particular, the right for trade unions at the relevant level, including sectoral, national, European and global levels, and for workers' representatives to be involved in the establishment and implementation of the due diligence strategy in good faith with their undertaking. Undertakings may prioritise discussions with the most impacted stakeholders. Undertakings shall conduct discussions and involve trade unions and workers\u2019 representatives in a manner that is appropriate to their size and to the nature and context of their operations. 2. Member States shall ensure that stakeholders are entitled to request from the undertaking that they discuss potential or actual adverse impacts on human rights, the environment or good governance that are relevant to them within the terms of paragraph 1. 3. Undertakings shall ensure that affected or potentially affected stakeholders are not put at risk due to participating in the discussions referred to in paragraph 1. 4. Workers\u2019 representatives shall be informed by the undertaking on its due diligence strategy and on its implementation, to which they shall be able contribute, in accordance with Directives 2002/14/EC ( 10 ) and 2009/38/EC ( 11 ) of the European Parliament and of the Council and Council Directive 2001/86/EC ( 12 ).

Member States shall ensure, with due regard for commercial confidentiality, that undertakings make their most up to date due diligence strategy, or the statement including the risk assessment, referred to in Article 4(3), publicly available, and accessible free of charge, especially on the undertakings\u2019 websites. 2. Undertakings shall communicate their due diligence strategy to their workers\u2019 representatives, trade unions, business relationships and, on request, to one of the national competent authorities designated pursuant to Article 12. Undertakings shall communicate relevant information concerning their due diligence strategy to potentially affected stakeholders upon request and in a manner appropriate to those stakeholders\u2019 context, for example by taking into account the official language of the country of the stakeholders. 3. Member States and the Commission shall ensure that undertakings upload their due diligence strategy or the statement including the risk assessment, referred to in Article 4(3) on a European centralised platform, supervised by the national competent authorities. Such a platform could be the Single European Access Point mentioned by the Commission in its recent Capital Markets Union Action Plan (COM(2020)0590). The Commission shall provide a standardised template for the purpose of uploading the due diligence strategies on the European centralised platform. Article 7 Disclosure of non-financial and diversity information This Directive is without prejudice to the obligations imposed on certain undertakings by Directive 2013/34/EU to include in their management report a non-financial statement including a description of the policies pursued by the undertaking in relation to, as a minimum, environmental, social and employee matters, respect for human rights, anti-corruption and bribery matters, and the due diligence processes implemented. Article 8 Evaluation and review of the due diligence strategy 1. Undertakings shall evaluate the effectiveness and appropriateness of their due diligence strategy and of its implementation at least once a year, and revise it accordingly whenever revision is considered necessary as a result of the evaluation. 2. The evaluation and revision of the due diligence strategy shall be carried out by discussing with stakeholders and with the involvement of trade unions and workers' representatives in the same manner as when establishing the due diligence strategy pursuant to Article 4. Article 9 Grievance mechanisms 1. Undertakings shall provide a grievance mechanism, both as an early-warning mechanism for risk-awareness and as a mediation system, allowing any stakeholder to voice reasonable concerns regarding the existence of a potential or actual adverse impact on human rights, the environment or good governance. Member States shall ensure that undertakings are enabled to provide such a mechanism through collaborative arrangements with other undertakings or organisations, by participating in multi-stakeholder grievance mechanisms or joining a Global Framework Agreement. 2. Grievance mechanisms shall be legitimate, accessible, predictable, safe, equitable, transparent, rights-compatible and adaptable as set out in the effectiveness criteria for non-judicial grievance mechanisms in Principle 31 of the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights and the United Nations Committee on the Rights of the Child General Comment No 16. Such mechanisms shall provide for the possibility to raise concerns either anonymously or confidentially, as appropriate in accordance with national law. 24.11.2021 EN Official Journal of the European Union C 474/35 Wednesday 10 March 2021 ",
        "3. The grievance mechanism shall provide for timely and effective responses to stakeholders, both in instances of warnings and of expressions of concern. 4. Undertakings shall report on reasonable concerns raised via their grievance mechanisms and regularly report on progress made in those instances. All information shall be published in a manner that does not endanger the stakeholders\u2019 safety, including by not disclosing their identity. 5. Grievance mechanisms shall be entitled to make proposals to the undertaking on how potential or actual adverse impacts may be addressed. 6. Undertakings shall take decisions informed by the position of stakeholders, when developing grievance mechanisms. 7. Recourse to a grievance mechanism shall not preclude the claimants from having access to judicial mechanisms. Article 10 Extra-judicial remedies 1. Member States shall ensure that when an undertaking identifies that it has caused or contributed to an adverse impact, it provides for or cooperates with the remediation process. When an undertaking identifies that it is directly linked to an adverse impact on human rights, the environment or good governance, it shall cooperate with the remediation process to the best of its abilities. 2. The remedy may be proposed as a result of mediation via the grievance mechanism laid down in Article 9. 3. The remedy shall be determined in consultation with the affected stakeholders and may consist of: financial or non-financial compensation, reinstatement, public apologies, restitution, rehabilitation or a contribution to an investigation. 4. Undertakings shall prevent additional harm being caused by providing guarantees that the harm in question will not be repeated. 5. Member States shall ensure that the remediation proposal by an undertaking does not prevent affected stakeholders from bringing civil proceedings in accordance with national law. In particular, victims shall not be required to seek extra-judicial remedies before filing a claim before a court, nor shall ongoing proceedings before a grievance mechanism impede victims\u2019 access to a court. Decisions issued by a grievance mechanism shall be duly considered by courts but shall not be binding upon them. Article 11 Sectoral due diligence action plans 1. Member States may encourage the adoption of voluntary sectoral or cross-sectoral due diligence action plans at national or Union level aimed at coordinating the due diligence strategies of undertakings. Undertakings participating in sectoral or cross-sectoral due diligence action plans shall not be exempt from the obligations provided for in this Directive. 2. Member States shall ensure that relevant stakeholders, particularly trade unions, workers' representatives, and civil society organisations, have the right to participate in the definition of sectoral due diligence action plans without prejudice to the obligation for each undertaking to comply with the requirements laid down in Article 5. 3. Sectoral due diligence actions plans may provide for a single joint grievance mechanism for the undertakings within their scope. The grievance mechanism shall be in line with Article 9 of this Directive. 4. The development of sectoral grievance mechanisms shall be informed by the position of stakeholders.

Those competent authorities shall be authorised to carry out checks on undertakings and interviews with affected or potentially affected stakeholders or their representatives. Such checks may include examination of the undertaking\u2019s due diligence strategy, of the functioning of the grievance mechanism, and on-the-spot checks.

Investigations referred to in paragraph 1 shall either be conducted by taking a risk-based approach or in the event a competent authority is in possession of relevant information regarding a suspected breach by an undertaking of the obligations provided for in this Directive, including on the basis of substantiated and reasonable concerns raised by any third party. 3. The Commission and Member States competent authorities referred to in Article 12 shall facilitate the submission by third parties of substantiated and reasonable concerns referred to in paragraph 2 of this Article by measures such as harmonised forms for the submission of concerns. The Commission and the competent authorities shall ensure that the complainant has the right to request that his or her concerns remain confidential or anonymous, in accordance with national law. Member States competent authorities referred to in Article 12 shall ensure that that form can also be completed electronically. 4. The competent authority shall inform the complainant of the progress and the outcome of the investigation within a reasonable period, in particular if further investigation or coordination with another supervisory authority is needed. 5. If, as a result of the actions taken pursuant to paragraph 1, a competent authority identifies a failure to comply with this Directive, it shall grant the undertaking concerned an appropriate period of time to take remedial action, if such action is possible. 6. Member States shall ensure that if the failure to comply with this Directive could directly lead to irreparable harm, the adoption of interim measures by the undertaking concerned, or, in compliance with the principle of proportionality, the temporary suspension of activities may be ordered. In the case of undertakings governed by the law of a non-Member State that operate in the internal market, the temporary suspension of activities may imply a ban on operating in the internal market. 7. Member States shall provide for sanctions in accordance with Article 18 for undertakings that do not take remedial action within the period of time granted.

Welcomes the Commission\u2019s CPR evaluation and ongoing review, which seek to further address barriers in the internal market for construction products and contribute to the objectives of the European Green Deal and the Circular Economy Action Plan, while taking account of technological developments and innovation; 2. Points to the specific nature of the CPR, which differs from the general principles of the new legislative framework (NLF), chiefly because it does not harmonise any specific requirements or minimum safety levels for construction products, but instead only defines a common technical language, which is the same for all construction products falling under the CPR, for assessing the performance of construction products over their essential characteristics, laid down in harmonised technical specifications; 3. Highlights that the current CPR ensures the free circulation of construction products within the Union, while Member States retain control of the rules on construction works; notes, in this regard, that the rules of the Member States require that construction works be designed and executed so as neither to endanger the safety of persons, domestic animals or property nor damage the environment; points out that building regulations set at Member State level are generally influenced by the performance of the construction products which are integrated in the works; C 474/42 EN Official Journal of the European Union 24.11.2021 Wednesday 10 March 2021 ( 8 ) European Commission, \u2018The European construction sector \u2014 A global partner\u2019, 2016. ",
        "Common technical language, including standards 4. Notes that the common technical language introduced by the CPR is defined by harmonised European standards, and by European Assessment Documents (EADs) for products not \u2014 or not fully \u2014 covered by harmonised standards in order to address Member States\u2019 performance requirements; acknowledges that the European Committee for Standardisation (CEN) and the European Committee for Electrotechnical Standardisation (CENELEC) are the competent organisations for the drafting of harmonised standards, while the European Organisation for Technical Assessment (EOTA) and Technical Assessment Bodies (TAB) are responsible for the preparation of EADs; 5. Points out that unlike other NLF legislation, the use of harmonised standards under the CPR is mandatory, which requires an effective system for their adoption in order to address the needs and reflect the most effective practices of industry, pave ways for innovation, keep up with technological developments, ensure legal clarity and a level playing field for SMEs, and meet the regulatory needs of the Member States; calls on the Commission, to that end, to ensure the active involvement of the industry and relevant stakeholders in order to ensure that new standards are as relevant as possible; notes the importance of the active participation of Member States in the standardisation process; 6. Is concerned by the fact that of the 444 existing harmonised standards for construction products, only 12 new standards were issued after the adoption of the CPR; believes that the time required for the development and citation of standards, the backlog for revising and updating existing standards (CPR acquis ), the lack of legal clarity in the current legislative framework and the lack of a productive dialogue between all partners currently involved in the process are among the most significant problems associated with the implementation of the CPR; 7. Points to the fact that a significant number of standards do not fully cover all basic requirements necessary for the use of construction products in construction works; is concerned that this incomplete nature of harmonisation has led in part to additional national requirements and mandatory national marks for construction products, which serve to create unjustified barriers, fragment and weaken the internal market and create legal uncertainties for businesses, builders, contractors, planners and architects, leading to potential safety risks for construction works; 8. Urgently calls on the Commission to find a quick and viable solution to improve standardisation processes and remove the backlog of non-cited standards; supports, in this regard, a combination of short-term measures to tackle the backlog and regulatory deficiencies alongside long-term measures to improve the process of defining the common technical language by means of comprehensive harmonised standards; 9. Points to the fact that problems with the development of harmonised standards need to be addressed in all steps of the preparation process; calls on the Commission to closely consult with all the relevant stakeholders during the preparatory phase, in line with the Standardisation Regulation, and stresses the importance of balanced representation and of transparency and openness of all parties involved in order to find workable solutions; highlights the need to ensure that the standardisation requests issued by the Commission are of high quality and the necessity to provide clear and pragmatic guidance; further encourages the Commission to develop comprehensive and horizontal guidelines for standardisation bodies outlining the structure and requirements of a requested standard; suggests establishing clearly defined timeframes for the Commission to assess the prepared standards and clear deadlines for all parties to ensure further revision if a standardisation request or the CPR is found not to have been adhered to; considers it important to define the scope of the standards more precisely so that manufacturers can have clear guidance when declaring that their products fall within the scope; 10. Believes that owing to the mandatory nature of standards in the context of the CPR and the fact that they are considered part of Union legislation, the texts of issued harmonised standards should be available in all Union languages; highlights the need to ensure access to high-quality translation at no additional cost and to enhance the involvement of national standardisation bodies in the translation process; calls on the Commission to further support and simplify the financial arrangements for the translation of harmonised standards; 11. Is concerned by the fact that while the alternative route for products not or not fully covered by harmonised standards was included in the CPR to allow innovative products to enter the market, the vast majority of EADs do not concern innovative products; 12. Believes, in consequence, that the current underperformance of the standardisation system is one factor leading to an increasing use of the EOTA route as an alternative means of standardisation; 24.11.2021 EN Official Journal of the European Union C 474/43 Wednesday 10 March 2021 ",
        "13. Points to the lengthiness and high cost of the EOTA route, which is not SME-friendly and mostly only affordable to big market players; stresses that notwithstanding the need for general improvements in the standardisation process, the current procedure for developing EADs can be helpful as a supplementary route to encourage the development of innovative products and the participation of SMEs, but also has to address the manufacturers\u2019 goal of putting innovative products on the market as quickly as possible while respecting Union product requirements, and should not be seen as a permanent alternative to the standardisation system; 14. Underlines that a common technical language could help to promote a circular economy as it enables the performance of construction products to be declared in a common manner; considers that greater focus should be attached to standards that can help to promote a circular economy in Europe; CE marking and Declaration of Performance (DoP) 15. Notes that the CE marking is a means to allow construction products legally placed on the market in one Member State to be marketed on the territory of any other Member State; is concerned by the fact, however, that since the CE marking under the CPR differs from other NLF legislation, as it only refers to product performance and does not attest to conformity with specific product requirements, such a difference in approach from other NLF legislation could create confusion as regards the CE marking and diminish its value; points, in this regard, to the overlaps in the information required by the CE marking and the Declaration of Performance (DoP); believes that this duplication creates additional unnecessary administrative burdens and costs for businesses and should be addressed, including by enhanced use of digital solutions; 16. Regrets the fact that the CE marking under the CPR is wrongly understood as a quality mark and does not determine whether a construction product is safe or could be used in construction works; believes that further solutions are needed to provide end-users with precise and clear information on the nature of the CE marking, with regard to the safety of construction products and their compliance with national building safety and construction works requirements; 17. Calls on the Commission to consider and thoroughly assess the possibility of gradually enhancing the CPR by including therein additional information obligations and product performance requirements with regard to health, safety and environmental aspects following an impact assessment and the assessment of Union and Member States\u2019 regulatory needs for each product category; calls on the Commission, furthermore, to evaluate which approach would prove to be effective for the CPR; 18. Notes the lack of digitalisation in the construction sector and emphasises the importance of fully harnessing digital technologies, which could allow for clear, transparent and reliable information to be provided to economic operators and end-users, address the overlap in information requirements and enable market surveillance authorities to carry out their activities more effectively; calls on the Commission to evaluate the benefits of using such technologies and to develop solutions towards the smart integration of existing data that can be utilised throughout different information systems; 19. Believes that digital solutions could enhance the transparency of the market of construction products and ensure the accuracy and reliability of the information provided in the DoP, as well as facilitate the comparability of construction products based on their declared performance, including safety and environmental performance, thereby allowing economic operators and end-users to benefit from the information provided by manufacturers by quickly assessing and comparing requirements for construction works with the information provided in the DoP; 20. Stresses the need to raise awareness among economic operators, in particular SMEs and micro-enterprises, with regard to CE marking and the DoP, including through the single digital gateway; believes that such an approach would increase trust in Union harmonisation and the quality of harmonised standards and help to reduce the fragmentation of the single market; highlights the important role of national Product Contact Points for Construction (PCPC) in informing economic operators about the application of the CPR and providing reliable information on the provisions within the territory of a Member State on the requirements for construction works applicable for the intended use of each construction product; suggests that further efforts be undertaken to increase awareness of the existence of these contact points, as only 57 % of stakeholders were aware of them in 2018; C 474/44 EN Official Journal of the European Union 24.11.2021 Wednesday 10 March 2021 ",
        "Market surveillance 21. Is concerned by the fact that market surveillance for construction products is seen as insufficient and ineffective by the industry; emphasises that such a situation undermines the level playing field for economic operators who comply with the legislation, to the benefit of rogue traders, who do not; points out that weak and inconsistent market surveillance could lead to an increase of products that do not meet their declared performance, putting end-users at risk; 22. Calls on the Member States to fully implement Regulation (EU) 2019/1020, which aims to strengthen the market surveillance of products covered by Union harmonisation legislation, including the CPR, and establishes the framework for cooperation with economic operators; stresses the need for a consistent, harmonised and uniform enforcement of new rules by the national market surveillance authorities and for enhanced cross-border cooperation to this end in order to ensure a level playing field in the construction sector and fair competition in the Union market; 23. Recalls the requirement for Member States under Regulation (EU) 2019/1020 to dedicate the necessary financial, human and technical resources to market surveillance authorities, including ensuring that they have sufficient expertise and competences; encourages the Member States to enhance cooperation among their market surveillance authorities, including at cross-border level, and to improve the number, efficiency and effectiveness of checks in order to be able to identify construction products that are not in conformity with their declared performance and prevent their circulation in the single market; 24. Calls on the Commission to swiftly adopt implementing acts under Regulation (EU) 2019/1020 in order to further align the performance of market surveillance authorities by determining the uniform conditions of checks, criteria for the determination of the frequency of checks and the amount of samples to be checked in relation to certain products or categories of products, and by laying down benchmarks and techniques for checks on harmonised products, taking due account of the specificities of the sectors involved, including construction products, and of the impact on a reviewed CPR; notes the important role of the Union Product Compliance Network and administrative cooperation groups (AdCos) in ensuring structured coordination and cooperation between the enforcement authorities of the Member States and the Commission and in streamlining market surveillance practices to make them more effective; 25. Considers it crucial that national market surveillance authorities responsible for construction products cooperate closely with national building control authorities in order to ensure a nuanced approach in assessing the conformity of construction products used in construction works with the declared performance or intended use, as well as to ensure their compliance with building regulations, thereby guaranteeing protection for the health and safety of workers who use construction products and of the users of construction works; 26. Stresses that Member States should take responsibility when introducing national provisions on construction works, including requirements related to the safety of buildings during the construction, maintenance and demolition of construction works, by taking into consideration other aspects important to the public interest, such as the health, safety and security of workers and protection of the environment; 27. Points to the increase in online sales in the construction sector; highlights the need to ensure the effective market surveillance of construction products sold online, especially those purchased from non-EU economic operators, as they might not comply with Union legislation and could therefore influence the quality and safety of construction works, in order to ensure the conformity of construction products circulating in the single market with their declared performance or intended use, irrespective of their origin; underlines the role that online marketplaces could play in this respect; 28. Highlights the importance of ensuring a uniform level of performance of notified bodies carrying out assessments of the performance of construction products, so that their functions are carried out at the same level and under the same conditions; notes, in this regard, the role of the Union testing facilities introduced by Regulation (EU) 2019/1020 in contributing to enhancing laboratory capacity, as well as ensuring the reliability and consistency of testing, for the purposes of market surveillance across the Member States; 29. Stresses the need to enhance the provision and exchange of information on potentially dangerous substances in construction products and to strengthen cooperation with the European Chemicals Agency databases in accordance with the current legislation; 30. Calls on the Commission to continue to effectively monitor and address unjustified barriers in the internal market stemming from national regulatory measures; stresses the need for enhanced dialogue and cooperation between the Commission and the Member States in order to tackle practices that impede the free movement of construction products in the internal market, such as the continuous use of national marks and additional certifications for construction products; 24.11.2021 EN Official Journal of the European Union C 474/45 Wednesday 10 March 2021 ",
        "Sustainability in construction products 31. Highlights the overall need for a transition to a sustainable and more circular economy in the sourcing, manufacturing, reuse and recycling of construction products and in their use in construction works; stresses the need to improve the sustainability of construction products and the availability of secondary and renewable products and materials on the market; 32. Welcomes, in this regard, the Commission\u2019s objective to make the construction sector more sustainable by addressing the sustainability performance of construction products in the revision of the CPR, as announced in the Circular Economy Action Plan; supports the Commission\u2019s commitment to aligning and making more consistent the legislation on construction products with horizontal environmental policies; 33. Calls on the Commission to envisage incorporating certain requirements regarding environmental performance and sustainability criteria across the lifecycle of products into the harmonised standards for specific product categories under the CPR, while taking account of market and technological developments and national regulatory requirements for the construction sector or buildings policies, in order to provide manufacturers with one single framework for the assessment and testing of products where relevant common compliance requirements arise; highlights the fact that current basic requirements for construction works set out in the CPR can already constitute the basis for preparing standardisation mandates and harmonised technical specifications with regard to the environmental performance and sustainability of construction products; stresses the importance of a proper assessment of the product categories to which such requirements would be relevant and the need for all the relevant stakeholders to be involved in the assessment process; highlights that such incorporation should not lead to an increase in the prices of construction products; 34. Calls on the Commission to assess how the CPR could support the circularity of construction products, including reused or remanufactured products or those manufactured from recycled materials; stresses that this will require reliable data on the previous use of construction products, taking into account the potential costs involved; welcomes, in this regard, the Commission\u2019s aim of establishing a common European Dataspace for Smart Circular Applications with data on product information ( 9 ); Specific recommendations on the review of the CPR 35. Highlights the need to ensure the proper involvement of all stakeholders in the consultation and evaluation process; emphasises the importance of an extensive impact assessment of the possible regulatory choices; highlights the need for a level playing field and a lighter administrative burden in construction products legislation for all businesses, especially SMEs, while taking account of new business models, as well as for fair competition at global level; calls, in this regard, for further clarification and enhancement of the simplified procedures for micro-enterprises; 36. Stresses the importance of avoiding duplications and of ensuring that the revised CPR is consistent with existing legislation and future legislative initiatives; calls on the Commission, therefore, to clarify the relationship of the CPR to related internal market legislation, such as the Ecodesign Directive ( 10 ), the Energy Labelling Regulation ( 11 ), the Waste Framework Directive ( 12 ) and the Drinking Water Directive ( 13 ) in order to avoid possible overlaps and, where necessary, to streamline the relevant provisions in order to ensure legal clarity for businesses; 37. Emphasises that any revision of the CPR should be in line with the principles and objectives of the Standardisation Regulation as regards the preparation of harmonised standards in order to ensure their transparency and quality; highlights that any revision should ensure the appropriate involvement of all interested parties and address Member States\u2019 regulatory needs; 38. Stresses the need to ensure legal clarity for a transitional period as regards any revision of the CPR and the review of the CPR acquis , in order to avoid a legal vacuum and secure the smooth transition from existing to new provisions; C 474/46 EN Official Journal of the European Union 24.11.2021 Wednesday 10 March 2021 ( 9 ) As stated in the Circular Economy Action Plan.

        "39. Is concerned that any revision of the CPR and, in particular, the review of the CPR acquis will take significant time, while manufacturers, builders, contractors, planners, architects and other end-users need immediate solutions to overcome the legal uncertainty resulting from, among other issues, the lack of updated harmonised standards and regulatory gaps; calls on the Commission to address these issues as part of its expected review of the CPR, including devising a solution to get to grips with the urgent legal and technical challenges; 40. Calls for an ambitious revision of the CPR with a view to creating a solid regulatory framework with effective, easily enforceable and harmonised rules; o o o 41.

Highlights the importance of access to information for victims of discrimination; considers it necessary that Member States take the appropriate steps to ensure that reasonable and accessible legal advice and assistance can be obtained and are provided to victims at all stages of the legal process, including confidential and in-person counselling and emotional, personal and moral support, by equality bodies or appropriate intermediaries; calls on the Member States, furthermore, to combat harassment and violence in the workplace which violate a person\u2019s dignity and/or create an offensive environment at work; 20. Calls on the Member States to take active measures to safeguard non-discrimination for all, including PwD, to ensure, in line with the UNCRPD, the accessibility of workplaces, transport and of the built environment, and to provide reasonable accommodation for PwD at all stages of work, from recruitment through career advancement, for safe and healthy working conditions and employment rehabilitation; calls for the EU institutions to take the same measures; calls on the Member States to ensure that PwD can exercise their labour and trade union rights on equal terms, and that they are protected from violence, mobbing, cyber-bullying and harassment, including sexual harassment, in particular that inflicted on women with disabilities; to this end, urges the Member States to ratify the Istanbul Convention, which is supposed to have a transversal impact on all EU legislation with a specific focus on women with disabilities who face multiple discrimination and are more vulnerable to harassment in the workplace; calls for the EU institutions to take the same measures; 21.

Calls on the Commission and the Member States to recognise and promote user-led personal assistance in line with General Comment No 5 of the UNCRPD Committee, to foster independent living and inclusion in the labour market; recalls that owing to the special nature of personal assistance, free movement provisions need to be adapted to the needs of PwD; calls for EU action to address personal assistance, especially concerning free movement of PwD and their personal assistants; 34. Recalls that new technologies represent both opportunities and challenges for all workers, in particular PwD; stresses in this regard that new technologies might pose major accessibility challenges for PwD; therefore, underlines that accessibility must be included as a pre-condition in any EU initiative, and that the EU should take action to support the application of universal design and ensure the availability and affordability of assistive technologies; calls on the Commission to ensure, in line with the UNCRPD, full and effective accessibility of information and communication technologies and systems on an equal basis and apply, in this context, guidelines supporting AI developers to take into account the needs of PwD through the development processes, avoiding the creation of new discriminatory biases; calls on the Commission and the Member States to support research programmes focused on the development of assistive technologies including robotics, digital technologies and artificial intelligence with the aim of enabling the full integration of PwD in all aspects of life; calls on the Member States to ensure that PwD have access to affordable digital tools and software which are tailor-made to their needs and to build on the expertise of organisations representing PwD in defining the most suitable digital tools or software for the individual needs of the PwD; Further targeted actions and mainstreaming the rights of PwD 35.

Calls on the Commission and the Member States to mainstream the rights of PwD, taking into consideration the specific situation of those subject to multiple discrimination, in all employment-related proposals, including the ones concerning the expected transformations in the future of work, as well as when designing and implementing actions aimed at developing digital and green skills; 39. Calls on the Commission, in particular the Equality Task Force, and the Member States to systematically mainstream the rights of PwD, with special attention to those subject to intersectional discrimination, in all the relevant laws, policies and programmes, since equality in employment is indivisible from equal access to education, health, housing, justice and social protection, and to expand the focus on accessibility to make progress towards an accessible built environment, public spaces, transport, and information and communication technologies, etc.; stresses in this regard the need to appoint a disability focal point in all EU institutions, including in all Commission DGs and EU Agencies, in addition to establishing an interinstitutional coordination mechanism in order to ensure disability mainstreaming in all EU legislation; 40. Is concerned about the existence of significant barriers to access to information and communications for persons with disabilities, particularly for persons who are blind or deaf, have intellectual disabilities or are on the autism spectrum; recalls that differences in individuals\u2019 abilities to receive and impart information and to use information and communications technologies represent a knowledge divide that creates inequality; 41.

Expresses its deep concern that most mainstream programmes, including those covered by Structural Funds, fail to reach out to the most deprived groups, including PwD; calls, therefore, on the European Court of Auditors to check the performance of EU programmes, with special emphasis on education and employment programmes, for example the European Social Fund Plus (ESF+), the Youth Employment Initiative (YEI), the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF), and Erasmus+, in a thorough manner; 47. Calls on the Commission to guarantee that EU funds will respect EU and international human rights standards and conventions such as the UNCRPD and will not support any measures and programmes that contribute to segregation or to social exclusion; furthermore, calls on the Commission to fund actions creating accessible environments, products, services, practices and devices, fostering deinstitutionalisation and supporting personal assistance, and to guarantee that EU-funded actions reach PwD and ensure their active involvement in society; o o o 48.

        "Lack of assessment of the complementary herbicides J. whereas a number of studies show that herbicide-tolerant GM crops result in a higher use of complementary herbicides, in large part because of the emergence of herbicide-tolerant weeds ( 9 ); whereas, as a consequence, it has to be expected that the GM cotton will be exposed to both higher and repeated doses of glufosinate and glyphosate, and that therefore a higher quantity of residues may be present in the harvest; K. whereas questions concerning the carcinogenicity of glyphosate remain; whereas EFSA concluded in November 2015 that glyphosate was unlikely to be carcinogenic and the European Chemicals Agency concluded in March 2017 that no classification was warranted; whereas, on the contrary, in 2015, the International Agency for Research on Cancer, the specialised cancer agency of the World Health Organization, classified glyphosate as a probable carcinogen for humans; L. whereas, according to EFSA, toxicological data allowing a consumer risk assessment to be performed for several break-down products of glyphosate relevant for GM glyphosate-tolerant crops are missing ( 10 ); M. whereas glufosinate is classified as toxic to reproduction 1B and therefore meets the \u2018cut-off criteria\u2019 set out in Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council ( 11 ); whereas the approval of glufosinate for use in the Union expired on 31 July 2018 ( 12 ); whereas the GM cotton has been made doubly tolerant to glufosinate, allowing even higher doses to be used on the plants; N. whereas studies show that glyphosate and glufosinate can severely impact the microbiome ( 13 ), and consequently the long term toxicity (mixed toxicity) of whole food and feed of the Bt toxins on the intestinal gut from spraying with glyphosate and glufosinate should first be assessed before any conclusion can be reached on health impacts and food safety; O. whereas assessment of herbicide residues and their break-down products found on GM plants is considered outside the remit of the EFSA Panel on Genetically Modified Organisms (EFSA GMO Panel) and is therefore not undertaken as part of the authorisation process for GMOs; whereas this is problematic since the way in which complementary herbicides are broken down by the GM plant concerned, and the composition and thus toxicity of the break-down products (\u2018metabolites\u2019), can be impacted by the genetic modification itself ( 14 ); 24.11.2021 EN Official Journal of the European Union C 474/69 Thursday 11 March 2021 ( 9 ) See, for example, Bonny, S., \u2018Genetically Modified Herbicide-Tolerant Crops, Weeds, and Herbicides: Overview and Impact\u2019, Environmental Management, January 2016; 57(1), pp. 31-48, https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26296738 and Benbrook, C.

        "Outstanding questions concerning Bt toxins P. whereas Cry1Ab and Cry2Ae proteins produced in Escherichia coli ( E. coli) and B . thuringiensis respectively were used to conduct the safety studies, rather than proteins produced by the GM plant itself ( 15 ), meaning that the assessment of toxic effects is based on the assumed equivalence of Bt toxins produced artificially in bacteria with the plant produced Bt toxins; whereas, however, in order to adequately take into account synergistic effects, assessments should not solely be based on tests with transgenic Bt toxins produced in microbial systems; Q. whereas, furthermore, little significance can be attributed to toxicological tests conducted with proteins in isolation, due to the fact that Bt toxins in GM crops, such as maize, cotton and soybeans, are inherently more toxic than isolated Bt toxins; whereas this is because protease inhibitors (PI), present in the plant tissue, can increase the toxicity of the Bt toxins by delaying their degradation; whereas this phenomena has been demonstrated in a number of scientific studies, including one conducted for Monsanto 30 years ago which showed that even the presence of extremely low levels of PI enhanced the toxicity of Bt toxins up to 20-fold ( 16 ); R. whereas those effects have never been taken into account in EFSA risk assessments, even though they are relevant for all Bt plants approved for import or cultivation in the Union; whereas risks arising from this enhanced toxicity due to the interaction between PI and Bt toxins, to humans and animals consuming food and feed containing Bt toxins cannot be ruled out; S. whereas a number of studies show that side effects have been observed that may affect the immune system following exposure to Bt toxins and that some Bt toxins may have adjuvant properties ( 17 ), meaning that they can increase the allergenicity of other proteins with which they come into contact; T. whereas assessment of the potential interaction of herbicide residues and their metabolites with Bt toxins is considered outside the remit of the EFSA GMO Panel and is therefore not undertaken as part of the risk assessment; whereas this is problematic since residues from spraying with glyphosate and glufosinate are known to disturb the microbiome which, for example, may enhance immune reactions in combination with Bt toxins ( 18 ); Bt crops: effects on non-target organisms and increased resistance U. whereas, unlike the use of insecticides, where exposure is at the time of spraying and for a limited time afterwards, the use of Bt GM crops leads to continuous exposure of the target and non-target organisms to Bt toxins; C 474/70 EN Official Journal of the European Union 24.11.2021 Thursday 11 March 2021 ( 15 ) Scientific Opinion of the EFSA Panel on Genetically Modified Organisms on application EFSA-GMO-NL-2011-97 for the placing on the market of insect-resistant and herbicide-tolerant genetically modified cotton T304-40 for food and feed uses, import and processing under Regulation (EC) No 1829/2003 from Bayer CropScience AG, EFSA Journal 2013; 11(6):3251, https://www.efsa. europa.eu/en/efsajournal/pub/3251, and Scientific opinion of the EFSA Panel on Genetically Modified Organisms on application (EFSA-GMO-NL-2011-96) for the placing on the market of genetically modified insect-resistant and herbicide-tolerant cotton GHB119, for food and feed uses, import and processing under Regulation (EC) No 1829/2003 from Bayer CropScience AG, EFSA Journal 2016; 14(10):4586, https://www.efsa.europa.eu/en/efsajournal/pub/4586, p. 14.

Reiterates its call on the Commission not to authorise the import for food or feed uses of any GM plant which has been made tolerant to a herbicide-active substance that is not authorised for use in the Union; 8. Calls on EFSA to finally accept the substantial differences between native Bt toxins and those expressed by synthetic transgenes in GM crop plants, and to widen its risk assessment in order to fully take into account all interactions and combinatorial effects between Bt toxins, GM plants and their constituents, residues from spraying with the complementary herbicides, the environment as well as impacts on health and food safety; 9. Calls on EFSA to no longer accept toxicity studies based on isolated proteins which are likely to be different in structure and biological effects compared to those produced by the plant itself, and to require that all tests are carried out with tissue from the GM plant; 10. Calls on EFSA to make sure that data from field trials or greenhouses cover a sufficiently broad range of agronomic and environmental conditions to assess the impact of all stress factors which have to be expected during cultivation on gene expression and plant composition; 11. Calls on EFSA to make sure that the data from field trials or greenhouses cover a sufficiently broad range of different varieties to assess the impact of various genetic backgrounds on gene expression and plant composition; 12.

Notes that the Commission has committed to implementing many of the European Ombudsman\u2019s proposals, such as asking individuals who switch to the private sector to provide additional information about the organisation they are joining and more details about the type of professional activity they are embarking on; emphasises that such transfers cannot be taken lightly, as they could lead to conflicts of interest when former public officials take up a job with a firm to lobby on policies that they previously legislated or worked on; notes that according to a recent report ( 8 ) 99 % of requests for transfer into the private sector were approved by the Commission, with a rejection rate of only 0,62 %, which points to the need to strengthen oversight; recalls that ethics rules are not a mere formality and should be adhered to by all institutions; urges the Commission to implement all recommendations made by the Ombudsman, to take a more robust approach to the issue of \u2018revolving doors\u2019 and to follow through with the proposed measures, including forbidding new activity when there is evidence that this activity would lead to a conflict with the public interest and publishing, directly on its ethics website and in a timely manner, all related information on each case of former senior staff members assessed with a view to implementing the one-year lobbying and advocacy ban; 21.

Fully endorses the European Ombudsman\u2019s confirmation of her finding that four instances of maladministration marred the appointment process of the most senior Commission official, and welcomes the new Commission\u2019s introduction in 2019 of a specific appointment procedure for its Secretary-General, which includes the publication of a vacancy notice and the inclusion of the appointment on the agenda of the weekly meeting of Commissioners, with sufficient time for it to be given proper consideration; 25.

Notes that in 2019 the Ombudsman received numerous complaints from EU citizens residing in a Member State other than their own who encountered difficulties in trying to register for and/or vote in the 2019 European Parliament elections, and points out that the right to vote in elections is a fundamental right recognised in the EU Treaties; 36. Congratulates the Ombudsman on the inquiries opened in 2019, which covered the following main topics: transparency in the EU institutions, the transparency of lobbying activities, service culture, fundamental rights, ethics issues, citizens\u2019 participation in EU decision-making, the proper management of staff issues and recruitment, and sound financial management; C 474/88 EN Official Journal of the European Union 24.11.2021 Thursday 11 March 2021 ",

Notes that in 2019 the Ombudsman dealt with 1 300 complaints which did not fall within her mandate, mainly because they did not concern the activities of an EU institution or body; endorses the Ombudsman\u2019s approach of replying to everyone who seeks her assistance, explaining her mandate to them and providing advice, and redirecting them, as far as possible, to other bodies which may be able to help them, and encourages her to continue to do so; 38. Urges the European Ombudsman to remain vigilant and resolute in handling complaints concerning fundamental rights, including equality, non-discrimination and the right to be heard; welcomes her inquiry into the European Asylum Support Office and her interviews with asylum seekers, and her inquiry into the Commission\u2019s handling of a complaint concerning discrimination against Roma in Italy; 39.

Notes that the number of complaints falling outside the Ombudsman\u2019s mandate has remained relatively stable (1 330 cases in 2019 compared to 1 300 cases in 2018); takes the view that better and coordinated communication at the level of all the EU institutions as to the competencies of the European Ombudsman could help to reduce the number of complaints falling outside its mandate and streamline the response to citizens\u2019 problems; 41. Welcomes the European Ombudsman\u2019s commitment to the right of citizens to be involved in the EU democratic process, as demonstrated by her organising of the annual conference of the European Network of Ombudsmen in April 2019 on the need to strengthen citizens\u2019 participation in the democratic process; endorses her decision to reply to all those seeking assistance in the language of their complaint, and calls on the EU public administration to make every effort to ensure that citizens are able to communicate effectively with her in the 24 official languages of the EU and in national sign languages; welcomes the European Ombudsman\u2019s draft guidelines on the use of languages on the websites of the EU institutions; underlines that such guidelines are of the utmost importance in protecting Europe\u2019s rich linguistic diversity; notes that the websites of the EU institutions should better exemplify the equality of all 24 official EU languages; deplores the fact that many sections of the EU institutions\u2019 websites and the publications uploaded to them continue only to be available in certain popular languages and never get coverage in all 24 official EU languages as required by the principles of the Union; 42.

The Council applies the same rule on an ad hoc basis.

Highlights that the goal of the Recovery and Resilience Facility is to make Member States\u2019 economies and societies more resilient, while striving for competitive sustainability, convergence and cohesion within the EU; emphasises that national ownership and transparency will be essential elements for the swift and successful implementation of the Recovery and Resilience Facility and the recovery plans; considers it essential, therefore, for debates to be held in national parliaments, for the Commission to cooperate with the national authorities and relevant stakeholders proactively in order to discuss the draft national plans at an early stage, making tailor-made solutions and specific reforms possible; 4. Welcomes the fact that in order to cope with the unprecedented crisis caused by COVID-19, the Member States and the EU institutions established NGEU in order to help the recovery; notes, therefore, that the RRF creates a unique opportunity for delivering on the reforms and investments needed for the EU to get ready to cope with the present challenges; 5. Believes that the symmetrical effects of COVID-19 have actually widened the socio-economic rift between EU Member States and their regions; 24.11.2021 EN Official Journal of the European Union C 474/93 Thursday 11 March 2021 ",
        "6. Further notes that the deadlines of the European Semester and the Recovery and Resilience Facility will overlap, which requires the temporary adjustment of the Semester process in order to properly launch the Recovery and Resilience Facility; stresses that the EU\u2019s recovery provides a unique opportunity to provide guidance to Member States on where reforms and investments are most needed in order to accelerate the transition to a more sustainable, resilient and inclusive EU; 7. Supports the Commission\u2019s guidance to Member States to include in their RRPs investments and reforms in flagship areas that are in line with the EU\u2019s objective of just climate and digital transitions; 8. Considers that the four dimensions of social and environmental sustainability, productivity, fairness and stability identified in the 2020 ASGS should be considered in the preparation of the Member States\u2019 recovery and resilience plans, which are to be centred around the six pillars defined in the Regulation establishing the Recovery and Resilience Facility; reiterates that in order to ensure transparency, the Commission will transmit the national recovery and resilience plans drawn up by Member States to both the Council and the European Parliament simultaneously; 9. Underlines that the Regulation establishing the Recovery and Resilience Facility recognises that women have been particularly affected by the COVID-19 crisis, as they represent the majority of healthcare workers across the Union and balance unpaid care work with their employment responsibilities; 10. Considers that the temporary adaptation of this year\u2019s cycle cannot override the original purpose and function, and must not impede the further evolution of the European Semester; recalls that the European Semester cycle is a well-established framework for EU Member States to coordinate their budgetary, economic, social and employment policies, and after the COVID-19 crisis, a functioning European Semester will be needed more than ever to coordinate these policies across the European Union, but also notes that the Semester, since the inception, has been expanded to include, among others, issues related to the financial sector and taxation, as well as objectives of the UN SDGs in the European Semester, giving due consideration to the people of our planet in our economic policy; notes that in order to further strengthen economic and social resilience, the EU must deliver on the principles of the EPSR; recalls that promoting stronger and sustainable growth in a sustainable manner means promoting responsible fiscal policies, structural reforms, effective investment, digital transformation and green and just transitions; invites the Member States and the Commission to strike a proper balance between boosting sustainable, growth-friendly public and private investment and structural reforms in the recovery plans; 11. Believes that the 2021 European Semester exercise offers a great opportunity to improve national ownership, given that Member States are developing tailor-made RRPs to respond to their different needs; in this regard, is convinced that democratic legitimacy must be guaranteed and eventually increased, including the proper role of the European Parliament in the implementation of the Facility, as enshrined in the Regulation establishing the Recovery and Resilience Facility; calls on the Member States to build up, using, if necessary, the Technical Support Instrument, the necessary administrative and monitoring capacity to provide firm guarantees of the proper and efficient use of funds, as well as a high level of absorption capacity; recalls that RRPs are subject to the horizontal requirements of sound economic governance and the general regime of rules for the protection of the Union budget; II. Economic prospects for the EU 12. Notes with great concern the extremely difficult situation EU economies find themselves in and that, according to the Commission\u2019s Winter 2021 economic forecast, GDP fell by an unprecedented rate in both the euro area and the EU as a whole; notes that EU GDP has contracted by 6,3 % (6,8 % in the euro area) in 2020, whereas an economic recovery of 3,7 % (3,8 % in the euro area) is forecast in 2021; 13. Highlights that the unprecedented economic recession in 2020 and the measures taken in response to the pandemic are set to push the EU debt-to-GDP ratio up to a new peak of around 93,9 % (101,7 % in the euro area) in 2020, with a further forecasted increase to around 94,6 % (102,3 % in the euro area) in 2021; highlights that a high level of uncertainty persists and that the economic outlook very much depends on how quickly the pandemic can be overcome; understands, furthermore, that these debt levels can be sustained by sufficient economic growth; reiterates the importance of the long-term sustainability of sovereign debt; notes that many Member States have entered the current crisis in a weak fiscal position, which is being further worsened by the pandemic; C 474/94 EN Official Journal of the European Union 24.11.2021 Thursday 11 March 2021 ",
        "14. Is concerned about the remarkably negative impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the EU\u2019s economy, particularly on small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), the single market and its competitiveness and underlines the importance of the implementation of the European Green Deal, the EPSR and the UN SDGs; believes, therefore, that coordination of the Member States\u2019 actions is, among others, an essential tool for reducing the mentioned negative impact; is of the opinion that if the EU cannot provide an adequate response to this current crisis, then both the euro area and the EU as a whole risk falling further behind with the realisation of the goals of environmental sustainability, competitiveness, productivity, fairness and macroeconomic stability; 15. Reiterates the importance of safeguarding the level playing field in the single market, while taking into account the physical characteristics faced by insular, peripheral, and sparsely populated regions of the EU and the situation of the EU\u2019s least developed regions, which is a necessary precondition for fostering, among other things, the digital transformation and the green and just transitions, innovation and accelerating the recovery and competitiveness; 16. Calls for a better implementation of responsible public finances, socially balanced structural reforms improving long-term prospects and high-quality and efficient public and private investment, among others, to realise the green and digital transitions; 17. Is concerned about the impact of the pandemic containment measures on the low productivity growth in the EU and the pronounced decline of productivity growth in the euro area before the pandemic; is of the opinion that a balanced strategy to promote sustainable growth and an investment-friendly environment should be pursued, while improving fiscal sustainability; stresses that special emphasis should be placed on future-oriented investments and policies, especially by those Member States that have the fiscal space to invest in order to promote sustainable and inclusive growth; 18. Welcomes the European Green Deal as the EU\u2019s new sustainable growth strategy bringing together four dimensions: the environment, productivity, stability and fairness, enabled by digital and green technologies, an innovative industrial base and strategic autonomy; III. Responsible fiscal and sustainable policies 19. Notes that although there are new challenges regarding macroeconomic stability, the Economic and Monetary Union is in a much better position to face crises than it was during the 2008 financial and economic crisis; is convinced that promoting resilient and sustainable economic recovery in line with the EU\u2019s policy objectives, centred around the green, just and digital transitions, is one of the most important immediate priorities; notes that the means to overcome the current crisis are of a nature, which requires \u2014 for as long as necessary \u2014 expansionary fiscal policy; 20. Points out that those Member States that had fiscal buffers were able to mobilise fiscal stimulus packages at a much faster pace and without associated borrowing costs, which has helped to mitigate the negative socio-economic effects of the pandemic; reiterates that replenishing fiscal buffers over time, in a socially responsible manner, will be important for preparation for future crises; however, urges Member States, the Commission and the Council not to repeat mistakes of the past in response to the economic crisis; shares the view of the European Fiscal Board that rapidly reversing the fiscal stance is not advisable for recovery; 21. Notes the fact that the Commission intends to make recommendations on the budgetary situation of the Member States in 2021, as envisaged under the Stability and Growth Pact; points out that the economic governance framework should also look at current economic realities and be coherent with the EU\u2019s policy priorities, while at the same time improving compliance with fiscal rules, which should be simplified, clear and practical, and are going to be reviewed, and according to the outcome, adapted; calls for a more pragmatic approach and underlines the need to ensure that the framework is stricter in good economic times and more flexible in bad economic times; 22. Without prejudice to the outcome of the discussions on the reform of the Growth and Stability Pact, highlights that the current EU fiscal and budgetary rules provide the flexibility needed in times of crisis, through the activation of the general escape clause under the Stability and Growth Pact and allow all Member States to adopt the fiscal stance necessary to protect the EU\u2019s economies, thereby demonstrating extraordinary counter-cyclicality; 24.11.2021 EN Official Journal of the European Union C 474/95 Thursday 11 March 2021 ",
        "23. Expects that the general escape clause will remain activated as long as the underlying justification of the activation exists in order to support the efforts of the Member States to recover from the pandemic crisis and strengthen their competitiveness, as well as economic and social resilience; takes note of the Commission\u2019s view that, according to the current preliminary indications, the general escape clause should continue to be applied in 2022 and be deactivated in 2023; invites the Commission to assess the deactivation or continued application of the general escape clause as part of its European Semester package on the basis of its spring 2021 economic forecast; notes that the Commission will continue to take into account country-specific situations after the deactivation of the general escape clause; 24. Takes note of the Commission communication on the fiscal policy response to COVID-19 ( 11 ), which sets out its considerations on how to coordinate at EU level the conduct of fiscal policy, taking to the next phase the concerted approach of addressing the pandemic, sustaining the economy, supporting a sustainable recovery and maintaining fiscal sustainability in the medium term;; acknowledges that the general escape clause allows Member States temporarily to depart from the adjustment path towards the medium-term budgetary objective, provided that this does not endanger fiscal sustainability in the medium term and does not lead to the suspension of the procedures of the Pact; takes note of the Commission\u2019s assessment that sustainability risks have increased due to the severe impact of the crisis, and that this is likely to lead to less favourable growth and fiscal trajectories in the medium term; highlights the Commission\u2019s call to make the best use of the general escape clause and Next Generation EU; 25. Calls on the Commission to act decisively in order to tackle tax fraud, tax avoidance and evasion, as well money laundering issues, which drain potential resources from national budgets and hampers governments\u2019 capacity to act, among others, for the recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic; 26. Notes the fact that, by the end of April 2021, the Commission intends to perform in-depth reviews assessing the state of play of imbalances for selected Member States; further notes that a number of existing macroeconomic imbalances are being aggravated by the COVID-19 crisis; 27. Recalls the urgent need to complete and reinforce the Economic and Monetary Union architecture by completing the Banking Union and the Capital Markets Union, with a view to protecting citizens and reducing pressure on public finances during external shocks so as to overcome social and economic imbalances; IV. Growth-enhancing, balanced and sustainable structural reforms 28. Is aware that the COVID-19 crisis will not be solved by the current fiscal stance alone; underlines, therefore, the importance of implementing deep, growth-enhancing, balanced and sustainable and socially just, tailor-made structural reforms to deliver on, among other things, sustainable and socially inclusive growth and jobs, which can support the recovery efficiently, as well as supporting the digital transformation and green transition, quality employment, reduction of poverty, and the UN SDGs, and can boost competitiveness and the single market, increasing convergence and stronger and sustainable growth within the Union and the Member States; points out that the long-term growth potential of Member States\u2019 economies in particular can only be enhanced by structural improvements; notes, however, that the effectiveness and success of the alignment of Member States\u2019 policy measures will depend on the review of the Stability and Growth Pact and, according to outcome thereof, its adaptation, as well as increased ownership by the Member States of the implementation of the country-specific recommendations; 29. Calls on the Commission to start working on the creation of a climate indicator to assess the discrepancy between the structure of Member States\u2019 budgets and the Paris-aligned scenario for each of their national budgets; stresses the need for this indicator to provide Member States with information on their trajectory within the framework of the Paris Agreement in order to ensure that Europe is able to become the first climate-neutral continent by 2050; expects the climate indicator to be a reference for the EU\u2019s various policies and thus also to be used as a guide for the European Semester, without watering down its original purpose; C 474/96 EN Official Journal of the European Union 24.11.2021 Thursday 11 March 2021 ( 11 ) Commission communication of 3 March 2021 entitled \u2018One year since the outbreak of COVID-19: fiscal policy response\u2019 (COM(2021)0105). ",
        "30. Is of the opinion that developing digital skills is a precondition to ensure that all Europeans are able to participate in society and reap the advantages of the digital transition; points out that it requires reforms in the area of education, skills and also lifelong learning to steer a labour market in transition and to develop and enable key digital technologies and build Europe\u2019s digital future; further points out that equality in cross-cutting access to digital infrastructure, equipment and skills should be supported in order to prevent a digital divide; 31. Calls on the Member States and the Commission, while respecting fiscal sustainability and sound budgetary rules, to create a regulatory and governance framework, including investment rules or other adequate mechanisms, that are predictable and supportive of public and private investments in line with the EU\u2019s long-term objectives, while ensuring Member States\u2019 ability to respond to future crises; 32. Takes note that the Member States are encouraged by the Commission, within the context of the Recovery and Resilience Facility, to submit their National Reform Programmes and their RRPs in a single integrated document; 33. Highlights that the Recovery and Resilience Facility, providing financial support, can be a unique opportunity to help Member States address their challenges identified in the framework of the European Semester; 34. Recalls that socially balanced, growth-friendly structural reforms do not always require fiscal space, but rather political, legislative and administrative efforts; 35. Highlights that continuous monitoring and vigilance will be needed and Member States should address emerging imbalances through reforms that enhance economic and social resilience and promote the digital transformation and green and just transitions; is pleased that the Commission will continue to monitor implementation by Member States of reforms proposed in previous years\u2019 country-specific recommendations; considers that this process should take into account the economic and social outlook of the Member States; V. Investment 36. Stresses that the EU faces the unprecedented challenge of mitigating the economic consequences of the pandemic, taking into account EU strategies with a view to having a lasting impact on the resilience of the Member States, and believes that the economic recovery should be conducted through strengthening the single market, research and innovation, and in accordance with European Green Deal, the UN SDGs, the implementation of the EPSR and competitiveness, while alleviating the situation of SMEs and improving their access to private capital; is convinced that this requires both an increased level of economically, socially, environmentally and digitally viable investment in the long term and enhanced convergence and cohesion in the EU and the Member States; 37. Stresses the lack of investment, as projections reveal the need for an expansion of investment; highlights that public investments are limited, as they represent scarce resources mostly funded by the taxpayers; points out that the size of the investment gap also requires sizeable private and public investments, generating an adequate level of infrastructure, as well as a predictable and favourable business environment that is conducive to such investments; 38. Stresses that the Member States should focus on targeted, sustainable public and private investment in future-proof infrastructure and other areas that further strengthen the single market, the transition to a cleaner, socially inclusive, sustainable and digital society and increase the EU\u2019s competitiveness and strategic autonomy; is of the opinion, therefore, that cross-border and multi-country projects are to be prioritised; 39. Underlines the need to adopt investment-friendly policies, reduce administrative burden and guarantee a level playing field, in particular for SMEs, which constitute the backbone of the EU economy and job creation; considers that all this would both facilitate economic recovery and create conditions advantageous to long-term growth; 24.11.2021 EN Official Journal of the European Union C 474/97 Thursday 11 March 2021 ",

Calls for committed coordination with social partners and other relevant stakeholders at both national and European level, with a view to strengthening democratic accountability and transparency; 42.

Notes the conclusion of the European Fiscal Board that the fiscal framework has to be revised in order to limit complexities and ambiguities, to offer better and more permanent protection for sustainable growth-enhancing government expenditure, and to set realistic targets for debt reduction in Member States that will not undermine upward social convergence; urges the Commission to ensure that all of the Member States\u2019 socio-economic, macro-economic and fiscal policies contribute to and are fully consistent with the objectives and targets of the EPSR, the European Green Deal and the UN SDGs and that social and environmental targets and objectives are introduced in the framework of the multilateral surveillance procedure referred to in Article 121 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU), as well as in the context of a reinforced macro-economic imbalance procedure; considers that the inclusion of the UN SDGs and the social pillar within the scope of the European Semester will require the adjustment of existing indicators and the creation of C 474/106 EN Official Journal of the European Union 24.11.2021 Thursday 11 March 2021 ( 31 ) Eurofound, Long-term care workforce: employment and working conditions , Publications Office of the European Union, Luxembourg, 2021.

States that 10 years after the introduction of the European Semester cycle of economic policy coordination, employment and social imbalances in the EU, such as labour market segmentation, wage dispersion, growing inequalities and poverty, especially child poverty, have not been resolved and have actually worsened, demonstrating that public policies in some Member States did not have enough leverage to build robust social protection systems and a fairer EU labour market, and that stronger policies and coordination at EU level are needed; strongly believes that EU support must go beyond making funds available; highlights the importance of taking lessons from the current health and economic crisis and acting proactively in the future; 4. Highlights that democratic accountability for the current Semester evaluation process needs to be strengthened; calls on the Commission and the Member States to reform the financial legal framework and the European Semester process in order to strengthen democratic accountability and the involvement of the European Parliament, to strengthen the role and participation of EU and national social partners, and to protect social progress objectives relating to social welfare systems and quality employment in future adjustment programmes and in the European Green Deal framework; 5. Emphasises that it should be better involved in the European Semester process, including the country-specific recommendations; stresses the important role of a more inclusive social dialogue with social partners, civil society, youth organisations, and local and regional authorities in shaping the European Semester; stresses that an effective, transparent, comprehensive, result-oriented and performance-based social tracking methodology \u2014 to be developed for the RRF \u2014 will improve the European Semester by better reflecting social, gender and environmental challenges and placing them on an equal footing with fiscal coordination, and by, for example, paying more attention to aggressive tax planning, poverty reduction, gender equality, social justice, social cohesion and upward convergence; 6. Believes that the Sustainable Semester Process has to focus equally on three dimensions: environmental sustainability, economic sustainability and social sustainability; reiterates that social sustainability can only be achieved through the reduction of inequalities and poverty and by offering social and employment opportunities and shared prosperity; stresses that social justice, decent work with living wages, equal opportunities, fair mobility and robust social welfare systems are essential elements in the just transition to a sustainable and social EU; calls on the Commission to carefully assess the dimensions of the Annual Sustainable Growth Survey to ensure they are fully in line with Article 3 TEU, which establishes sustainable development as the objective the EU has to work toward, based on balanced economic growth and price stability, a highly competitive social market economy, aiming at full employment and social progress, a high level of protection and improvement of the quality of the environment; calls on the Commission and the Member States to focus, together with the European Parliament, on addressing these challenges through EU eco-social policies combining shared economic prosperity, social progress and sustainable development; Social dimension within the Recovery and Resilience Facility 7.

Understands that Member States must include measures on social and territorial cohesion, children and young people in their national recovery plans in order to access the fund; notes that social milestones and targets have been neither explicitly defined nor earmarked in the RRF Regulation, but that, according to the adopted regulation, the Commission should set out the common indicators to be used for reporting on progress and for the purpose of monitoring and evaluating the facility, and should define a methodology for reporting social expenditure, including on children and young people, under the facility; points out the particular importance of indicators related to the implementation of the EPRS principles, quality employment, upward social convergence, equality of and access to opportunities and social protection, education and skills, and investment in access and opportunities for children and young people related to education, health, nutrition, jobs and housing, in line with the objectives of the Child Guarantee and Youth Guarantee; calls on the Commission to work with the European Parliament, social partners and civil society, in the context of the recovery and resilience dialogue, to define these indicators, in accordance with those established by the European Parliament resolution on a strong social Europe for just transitions, in order to assess the investments in and reforms of the NRRPs, as well as the proposed measures to ensure progress towards these goals; 9. Points out that Member States will design their own tailored NRRPs based on the criteria and six-pillar approach of the RRF and the investment and reform priorities identified as part of the European Semester process, in line with their national reform programmes, national climate and energy plans, Just Transition plans, Youth Guarantee implementation plans, and the partnership agreements and operational programmes set up for EU funds; recalls that each Member States must include in its NRRP a detailed explanation of how the plan contributes to the implementation of the EPSR, as well as how it strengthens quality job creation, upward social convergence, investments in young people and children, gender equality and equal opportunities for all; encourages the Member States to also include social targets and milestones and specify the estimated amount of investment in social progress towards them; insists that the NRRPs must contribute to achieving the UN SDGs, implementing the EU\u2019s sustainable growth strategy as set out in the European Green Deal, and fulfilling the principles of the EPSR; calls on the Member States to make full use of the potential offered by the general escape clause to support companies which are in difficulty and are lacking liquidity, particularly by improving access for SMEs to public and private funding, safeguarding the jobs, wages and working conditions of people working in the EU and investing in people and social welfare systems; 10. Calls on the Commission to include the social indicators from the Social Scoreboard of the European Semester, in particular those related to decent work, social justice and equal opportunities, robust social welfare systems and fair mobility, in the common indicators to be used in the RRF for reporting on progress and monitoring and evaluating the plans, as well as in the methodology for reporting on social investment, including for the Child Guarantee and Youth Guarantee; stresses that the European Parliament will closely analyse the delegated act that the Commission will present on this matter, in order to establish if the social indicators, scoreboard and social methodology comply with the objectives, and to verify that there are no objections to be made; 11. Believes that robust welfare systems built on strong economic and social structures help Member States to respond more efficiently and in a fair and inclusive way to shocks and to recover more swiftly from them; highlights that social welfare systems contribute to guarantee that EU societies and everyone living in the EU have access to the integral services and economic support they need to lead a decent life, covering the following areas of intervention: social security, healthcare, education and culture, housing, employment, justice and social services for vulnerable groups; highlights furthermore that social welfare systems play a key role in achieving sustainable social development, combatting poverty and social exclusion, and promoting equality and social justice; warns that during the COVID-19 crisis, social welfare systems have been under unprecedented pressure, as they were not designed to cover the social demands triggered by a healthcare and economic emergency; calls on the Member States, with the EU\u2019s support, to strengthen their social welfare systems so that they can perform well and assist the entire population, particularly in situations of crisis or systemic shocks, including by establishing targets for social investment that match digital and green investments in ambition; 12. Calls on the Commission and the Member States, in their recovery measures, to address the needs of children and take measures to ensure equitable access for all children to early years support, education on new technologies, skills and the ethical and safe use of digital tools, and opportunities for social, mental, cultural and physical wellbeing; calls on the C 474/108 EN Official Journal of the European Union 24.11.2021 Thursday 11 March 2021 ",

Believes that to ensure the EU remains resilient, we must focus all policies on ensuring a lasting recovery and avoiding the premature ending of measures and financial tools to support companies and workers, and strengthen them where and when needed; welcomes the activation of the general escape clause under the Stability and Growth Pact until at least the end of 2021; expects that it will remain activated for as long as the underlying justification for the activation exists; insists that any future adjustment programmes should focus on sustainable growth and quality job creation and be coherent and not hamper reforms or investments in social progress towards the social milestones and targets identified in the European Semester process and the NRRPs, in particular progress towards the reduction of poverty and inequalities; points out that financial support through the RRF will have to be ensured in order for Member States to achieve these social milestones and targets; calls on the Commission and the Member States to ensure sustainable investment and to support SMEs and their employees in the transition to a more digital and greener economy and the resumption of economic activity, and to give adequate consideration to SMEs by analysing the possible effects of fiscal consolidation policies on them, as SMEs are one of the main engines of the EU economy and vital for sustainable growth; 15. Believes that the economic governance framework must avoid procyclicality, which could result in increases in poverty and inequalities and a deviation from the social objectives agreed in the RRF; calls for the potential social negative consequences of the deactivation of the general escape clause to be evaluated in accordance with Article 9 TFEU; calls on the Commission and the Member States, in the context of the Recovery and Resilience Dialogue and the interinstitutional agreement on better law-making, to work together with the European Parliament in order to propose the necessary economic governance changes that will ensure social progress and protect the most vulnerable from bearing the consequences of any potential future adjustment programmes; 16. Acknowledges that the NGEU is substantial, but regrets that the limited size of the EU budget, together with its expenditure-driven nature and its principle of equilibrium, mean that its redistribution and stabilisation functions are also very limited; acknowledges the importance of social and cohesion policies, and looks forward to strengthening them if more needs arise; stresses that it is therefore all the more important to take full advantage of all possibilities under the MFF, the NGEU and the own resources system to support an inclusive national recovery, social justice, and environmental, economic, social and inclusive resilience, and to boost social policies and investments, while also strengthening the EU budget with a broader portfolio of own resources; 17.

Stresses that the timely, effective and equitable implementation of the EU skills agenda is critical for promoting employment in the health sector and tackling skills shortages in new fields of work; warns, however, that a skills agenda is not enough to tackle the increasing precariousness and in-work poverty in the EU labour market; calls on the Commission and the Member States to ensure that high-quality, affordable and inclusive skills and vocational training are developed through the obtaining and mutual recognition of qualifications and the recognition and validation of competencies, learning outcomes and diplomas at all education levels, as well as of non-formal learning with tailored support and active outreach, notably for the most marginalised groups in society, thus avoiding stereotyping; emphasises the need to encourage lifelong learning practices across the EU, as they will prove an essential element for the transition towards a digital, green, competitive and resilient EU economy; 39. Recalls the importance of EU programmes such as the Youth Guarantee, whose package has recently been strengthened; calls on the Member States to quickly implement this programme, in close alignment with EU funds such as the European Social Fund Plus, to address their NEET situation, with particular concern for those living in rural areas and regions with natural or demographic constraints in their labour markets, in order to ensure that all young people under the age of 30 receive a good-quality offer of employment, continued education, vocational education or training, are able to develop the skills needed for employment opportunities in a wide range of sectors, or are offered a remunerated apprenticeship or traineeship within four months of becoming unemployed or leaving formal education; 40.

Emphasises that the EU budget\u2019s backstop, its borrowing and lending functions, and in particular the EU instrument for temporary Support to mitigate Unemployment Risks in an Emergency (SURE scheme), are perfect examples of how the credit capacity and reputation of the EU budget can be used to support Member State actions in line with EU priorities, particularly in the exceptional circumstances created by a health and economic crisis that was unprecedented in the history of the EU; 43. Calls for better coordination between environmental, economic and social policies and between the different recovery funds and structural funds, in order to improve synergies and boost social investment resources, including those aimed at first respondents to the crisis such as essential workers, embedding the principle of leaving no one behind; calls on the Commission and the Member States to involve all relevant national, regional and local authorities, at their appropriate levels, in the design and implementation of European-Semester-related actions, in particular in the health and social fields, which often fall outside of economic and fiscal considerations; 44.

Welcomes the fact that the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund is also being used to respond to this pandemic, by supporting the restructuring needs of EU companies; notes that the limit on worker dismissals for access to the fund has been reduced to the minimum of 200, and that this EU tool could help to fund personalised support measures, such as tailor-made training courses and re-skilling and up-skilling programmes; calls on the EU institutions involved to be flexible and quickly analyse the activation requests, ensuring that the time needed to mobilise the fund is reduced to a minimum; 47. Stresses that the brain drain phenomenon widens the economic and social development gap within the EU; calls on the Commission to assess brain drains in certain regions and sectors and propose support measures where needed, as well as to support mobile workers by ensuring freedom of movement of workers, without restrictions, and strengthening the portability of rights and entitlements; asks the Commission to put forward a proposal for a digital EU social security number; 48. Notes the need to provide specific support for the media sector, which plays a key role in our democracies, in a way that respects and promotes media freedom and pluralism at a time when the online environment is increasingly dominated by a few large players, with increasing market power and mobile tax bases, sometimes hampering the ability of many smaller EU companies to start up and scale up across the single market, as highlighted in the Commission communication on the EU Annual Sustainable Growth Strategy 2021 ( 36 ); draws the attention of the Member States to the specific measures set out in the Commission Media Action Plan unveiled on 3 December 2020 to help the broadcasting, news publishing and cinema sectors to recover from the big loss in advertising revenues experienced due to the lockdown imposed by the pandemic and to boost their production and distribution of digital content; 49. Points out that fairness conditions should be considered for companies that wish to access public funds and support in order to avoid such support going to companies based in a jurisdiction referred to in Annex I to the Council conclusions on the revised EU list of non-cooperative jurisdictions for tax purposes ( 37 ), and points out that they should not subvert collective bargaining, workers\u2019 participation or co-determination in company decision-making processes in accordance with national law and practice, and should be conditional on maintaining the same level of working and employment conditions and rights, including protection against dismissals and reductions in wages, with no bonuses or dividends paid to managers or shareholders respectively; 50.

At the same time, some Member States have imposed a unilateral reporting obligation, which creates an additional adminis- trative burden for platform operators, as they have to comply with a multitude of national standards of reporting. It would therefore be essential that a standar- dised reporting obligation apply across the internal market. That standardisation is essential in order to promote three major objectives: to minimise compliance costs for operators, to increase the efficiency of national authorities and to reduce bureaucracy for both taxpayers and tax administrations. Amendment 10 Proposal for a directive Recital 7 a (new) Text proposed by the Commission Amendment (7a) The digitalisation of the economy is one of the cornerstones of the Union\u2019s future economic and growth strategy. The Union should be an attractive terrain for digital companies, in particular for their commercial, innovation and employment potential. However, digital goods and services tend to be highly mobile and intangible and therefore more prone to suffering from aggressive tax planning practices, since many business models do not require physical infra- structure in order to carry out transactions with customers and generate profits. That calls into question the suitability of the Union corporate tax models designed for brick and mortar industries, including with regard to the extent that valuation and calculation criteria could be reinvented to reflect the commercial activities of the 21st century. Moreover, that leads to a situation in which online sellers and sellers operating via platforms currently have the opportunity to generate revenues that are poorly reported and thus at high risk of remaining undertaxed or untaxed.

        "Amendment 12 Proposal for a directive Recital 14 a (new) Text proposed by the Commission Amendment (14a) Considering that the progressively digitised and globa- lised economy reveals complex and challenging dimen- sions, such as crypto-assets, it is important to increase cooperation between national tax administrations in that field. A clear definition of crypto-assets, taking into account the ongoing work within the OECD and FATF, is important in combating tax evasion and promoting fair taxation. The FATF adopted a broad definition of virtual currency and recommended in- corporating within the scope of AML/CFT obligations any natural or legal person who conducts activities including exchange between crypto-assets, transfer of crypto-assets and participation in and provision of financial services related to initial coin offerings. The proliferation of crypto-currencies is a topical matter and should be considered in any effort to increase adminis- trative cooperation, based on the principles of sub- sidiarity and proportionality. Also, given global technological advancement, there is a need for advanced supervisory mechanisms that are in close contact with the relevant counter-criminal financing bodies.

As there is no explicit legal base for conducting joint audits, such joint actions are currently conducted based on the combined provisions of Directive 2011/16/EU regarding the presence of foreign officials in the territory of other Member States and on simultaneous controls.
