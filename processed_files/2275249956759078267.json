        "EN EN COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES Brussels, 9.10.2006 COM(2006) 579 final 2006/0184 (CNS) Proposal for a COUNCIL DECISION Providing Community macro-financial assistance to Moldova (presented by the Commission) {SEC(2006) 1258} ",
        "EN 2 EN EXPLANATORY MEMORANDUM 1) C ONTEXT OF THE PROPOSAL 110 \u2022 Grounds for and objectives of the proposal The Commission proposes to provide macro-financial assistance to Moldova in the form of a grant of a maximum amount of EUR 45 million with a view to supporting Moldova's balance of payments and the reserve build-up. The proposed assistance will help Moldova alleviate the financial constraints on the implementation of its economic programme. It will also facilitate and encourage the authorities' efforts to implement reforms under the EU-Moldova European Neighbourhood Policy Action Plan and the Economic Growth and Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper. The proposed macro-financial assistance will be exceptional and limited in time, will complement support from the Bretton Woods Institutions, bilateral donors and the Paris Club, and will be conditional, in particular, on progress in the implementation of the IMF-supported PRGF arrangement. This operation will take place at a time when EU-Moldova relations have entered a phase of deeper integration in the context of the European Neighbourhood Policy. 120 \u2022 General context In the initial stage of its transition to market economy, Moldova implemented successfully a number of first generation reforms. Subsequently, towards the end of the nineties and in the beginning of the current decade, reforms slowed down and the government's administrative interference in the economy increased. Against this background, policy lending by the Bretton Woods Institutions was discontinued. Two EU macro-financial assistance operations for Moldova \u2013 a loan of EUR 15 million decided in 2000 and a grant of the same amount decided in 2002 1 \u2013 could therefore not be implemented. In this period, Moldova's GDP grew at an average annual growth rate of 7%. Growth has been driven by domestic demand boosted by booming remittances that have increased over time to more than 30% of GDP. By 2005, Moldova's GDP per capita had more than doubled (in dollar terms) compared to its level in 2000. Yet, at only USD 812, it is still by far the lowest in Europe. Moldova is the only country in Europe to be classified as low-income by the World Bank. Towards 2004-2005, structural reforms re-appeared on the Moldova's policy agenda, notably with the adoption by the government of the Economic Growth and Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (EGPRSP). The government\u2019s commitment to reforms has been reinforced by its European aspirations, confirmed by the adoption in February 2005 of the EU-Moldova European Neighbourhood Policy (ENP) Action Plan. For most of 2005, the government pursued economic policy intended to demonstrate this renewed stabilisation and reform commitment. In view of the results achieved, 1 Council Decisions 2000/452/EC of 10 July 2000 (OJ L 181, 20.7.2000, p.77) and 2002/1106/EC of 19 December 2002 (OJ L 351, 28.12.2002, p.76). ",
        "EN 3 EN towards the end of 2005, the authorities and the IMF resumed discussions on a new programme that could be supported by a financing arrangement with the Fund. In February 2006 an agreement was reached on the parameters of such programme and in May 2006 the IMF Board approved a three-year financing arrangement under the Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF). The approval of the arrangement was followed by an agreement with the Paris Club of Moldova's official creditors on a restructuring of accumulated arrears and current payments falling due in the period of the programme on the so-called Houston terms. Helping the government normalise Moldova's relations with the official creditors was one of the key objectives of the arrangement. The PRGF programme is designed to maintain macroeconomic stability and in this way to support growth and poverty reduction, particularly in the context of continued strong inflows of remittances and substantially higher prices for imported energy. Under the programme, the authorities are committed to limit the budget deficit to 0.5% of GDP and the National Bank is aiming at increasing foreign exchange reserves to three months of imports by end-2008. The priority structural policy measures include in particular actions in the areas of foreign trade liberalisation, corporate governance, banking sector reform and tax administration. By the time of the adoption of the programme, it was assumed that the contemplated policies would translate into GDP growth of 6% in 2006 and 5% in 2007-2008, a gradual reduction of inflation to about 7% by end-2008 and current account deficits in the neighbourhood of 5% of GDP. Yet, the programme is being implemented in a particularly difficult external environment. Already in 2005, due in particular to a strong increase in oil prices, Moldova's trade and current account deficits had increased sharply. Since the beginning of 2006, Moldova is facing additional balance-of-payments shocks \u2013 a decision by Russia's gas monopoly, Gazprom, to increase the gas prices it charges to Moldova from USD 80 per thousand cubic meters to USD 110 in January 2006 and USD 160 in July, and a ban on Moldova's exports of wine and alcohol to Russia \u2013 that make the prospects for achieving the objectives of the PRGF programme extremely weak. The weakening of Moldova's external accounts will also complicate the achievement of the government's medium-term objectives in terms of growth and poverty reduction contained in the government's Economic Growth and Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper, and of the goals of the EU-Moldova ENP Action Plan. The economic developments in Moldova will require, first, some adjustment of the PRGF programme and, second, additional exceptional financing, on top of the financing currently available. In the past the EU has provided on several occasions macro-financial assistance (MFA) to Moldova aimed at responding to balance-of-payments shocks. The Commission considers that the current situation justifies a further recourse to the same instrument. EU MFA would contribute to meeting Moldova's external financing requirements in 2007 and 2008. This is further warranted by deepening EU-Moldova cooperation in the context of the European Neighbourhood Policy. Moldova is one of the EU partner countries in this context since the ENP was launched in 2004. Moldova is also, together with Ukraine, ",
        "EN 4 EN the only Eastern Neighbourhood country currently implementing an ENP Action Plan. The ENP aims at developing an increasingly close relationship between the EU and the partner countries, going beyond past levels of cooperation, at deepening political cooperation including in the area of foreign and security policy and, in the case of Moldova, in the resolution of the conflict in Transnistria, and at promoting economic growth and poverty reduction. 130 \u2022 Existing provisions in the area of the proposal None 140 \u2022 Consistency with other policies and objectives of the Union EU-Moldova relations have entered a phase of deeper integration since the launching of the European Neighbourhood Policy. Community's assistance through the macro- financial assistance instrument would contribute to the strengthening of the bilateral relations with Moldova. It is envisaged that from 2007 onwards the European Neighbourhood and Partnership Instrument (ENPI) will become available to Moldova, allowing assistance also in the form of budget support. Preparation of sectoral and/or general budget support programmes in favour of Moldova is expected to start as soon as the ENPI becomes operational. However, no disbursements under ENPI budget support are anticipated in the near future. Moreover, the instrument of budget support under the ENPI, designed to support structural policies in a medium- to long-term perspective, is not well adapted to Moldova's current difficulties resulting largely from short-term balance of payment shocks. Financing under the macro-financial assistance instrument is expected to be available well before a possible budget support operation under the ENPI. MFA, as a short-term instrument, will be specifically addressing the currently pressing external financing needs of Moldova arising from a significant deterioration of the country's external economic environment. Yet, macro-financial assistance will also support in the interim period structural reforms contemplated in the EU-Moldova Action Plan and the Economic Growth and Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper. 2) C ONSULTATION OF INTERESTED PARTIES AND IMPACT ASSESSMENT \u2022 Consultation of interested parties 219 Moldova's Finance Minister Mihail Pop requested financial assistance from the EC in May 2006. Commission services have been in contact with the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank and bilateral donors during the preparation of the present Commission proposal to discuss assistance needs. The Commission has consulted the Economic and Financial Committee before submitting its proposal. Following the adoption of the Council Decision, the Commission services will negotiate with the authorities of Moldova a Memorandum of Understanding and the grant agreement to lay down in detail the implementation modalities of the assistance. \u2022 Collection and use of expertise 229 There was no need for external expertise. ",
        "EN 5 EN 230 \u2022 Impact assessment Because macro-financial assistance is a policy-based instrument, it is particularly well- suited to support the efforts of the authorities of Moldova to improve the fiscal sustainability in the short-to-medium run. Macro-financial assistance will have an immediate impact on Moldova's balance of payments and reserves and will in this way contribute to the alleviation of financial constraints on the implementation of the authorities' economic programme. EC assistance will also help the authorities implement short- and medium-term policies identified in the EU-Moldova European Neighbourhood Policy Action Plan and the Economic Growth and Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper. 3) L EGAL ELEMENTS OF THE PROPOSAL 305 \u2022 Summary of the proposed action The Community shall make available to Moldova macro-financial assistance in the form of grants of a maximum amount of EUR 45 million. The assistance will be made available in three instalments over a period of two years. The period of the implementation of the programme could be extended by one more year. The assistance will be managed by the Commission which shall agree with the authorities the specific economic policy and financial conditions attached to the payment of the grant instalments. Specific provisions on the prevention of fraud and other irregularities, consistent with the Financial Regulation, will be duly taken into account. 310 \u2022 Legal basis Article 308 of the Treaty 329 \u2022 Subsidiarity principle The proposal falls under the exclusive competence of the Community. The subsidiarity principle therefore does not apply. \u2022 Proportionality principle The proposal complies with the proportionality principle for the following reason(s). 331 The amount of the assistance corresponds broadly to one-third of the residual financing needs of Moldova for the years 2007-2008, covered by the assistance. This is deemed an appropriate level of burden sharing for the Community, given the assistance provided to Moldova by bilateral donors and creditors and the international donor community at large. The assistance will be fully consistent with the macroeconomic targets already set in Moldova's economic policy documents, such as the Memorandum of Economic and Financial Policies in the context of the PRGF arrangement with the IMF, approved in May 2006. It will be also consistent with longer-term policy objectives contemplated in the Economic Growth and Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper approved in May 2004 ",
        "EN 6 EN and with the EU-Moldova European Neighbourhood Policy Action Plan adopted in February 2005. As regards specific conditions attached to the disbursement of the grant instalments, the Commission intends to focus on a limited number of areas, including in particular public finance management. Also, the Commission may consider targeting specific sectoral policies of particular importance, identified as such in the EU- Moldova ENP Action Plan. \u2022 Choice of instruments 341 Proposed instruments: other. 342 Other means would not be adequate for the following reason(s). In the absence of a framework regulation for the macro-financial assistance instrument, ad hoc Council decisions under Article 308 of the Treaty are the only available legal instrument for this assistance. 4) B UDGETARY IMPLICATION 401 Such assistance would be financed from commitment appropriations in 2007 under budget line 01 03 02 (Macroeconomic assistance), subject to final approval of the 2007 EC Budget, with payments taking place in 2007 and 2008. 5) A DDITIONAL INFORMATION \u2022 Review/revision/sunset clause 533 The proposal includes a sunset clause.
