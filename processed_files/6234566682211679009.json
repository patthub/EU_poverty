        "Research and Innovation The EU and global food systems are affected by major challenges such as climate change. Research and innovation are the key to find high-impact solutions that will future-proof our food systems. To provide strategic aid on food and nutrition security related policy and strategy development, a SCAR FOOD SYSTEMS SWG mapped existing policies/strategies and research and innovation funding of the food system in EU Member States. Mapping results show that policies and investments focus on primary production and food processing. This reflects the fragmented R&I investments in food systems, as well as the limited interest in food systems shown by non-primary production stakeholders. To improve the current situation, stakeholders should be more involved in R&I on food systems. Because the food system provides food and nutrition security, it is a major player in health promotion. But it is also a significant job provider and food system innovation could lead to even more growth. The results of this study clearly show that food system elements must be included in various research programs to gain additional R&I input regarding food and nutrition, and to exploit the latent potential in the food system.

        "3 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY Food not only supports human life; food production side-streams are also used for bio-fuel or bio-based products. Food has important historical, social, cultural, environmental and economic dimensions. Currently the EU and global food systems are affected by major challenges such as climate change, migration, a growing world population, urbanisation and resource scarcity, in addition to the \u201ctriple burden\u201d of malnutrition (undernutrition, obesity, and hidden hunger), ageing and food poverty. Research and innovation (R&I) is key to developing high-impact solutions to future-proof our food systems. There is a pressing need to avoid fragmentation, ensure policy coherence, and align programmes in order to adopt a food system approach that can effectively address multiple objectives. For this reason, the Standing Committee on Agricultural Research (SCAR) FOOD SYSTEMS Strategic Working Group (SWG) has performed a qualitative and quantitative mapping of food related policies and food system related public R&I funds in Member States. This mapping provides information on: \u2022 Existing policies and strategies linked to food and nutrition security \u2022 Public R&I funding at national and regional level related to food systems and their alignment to the FOOD 2030. This information will help to: \u2022 Provide strategic support to the further development of existing national, European and global policies and strate- gies that are linked to food and nutrition security as well as R&I policy, \u2022 Identify R&I investment gaps to be filled, \u2022 Catalyse future reflections and discussions at national and regional levels regarding the need to work better across institutional silos in order to tackle food system trans- formation through a systemic approach and to provide advice for possible next steps of the FOOD 2030 initiative. Assessment of existing policies/strategies of more than 20 countries revealed that in the last 5 years, agriculture, food production and food safety were the most prominent fields to have benefitted from R&I support, whereas food innovation and nutritional as- pects linked to health were less represented. More recently, national bioeconomy strat- egies are present or in preparation in the majority of the countries. The exercise also revealed that food and nutrition security, although identified as a great societal Table of contents Executive summary p.3 1 Baseline assessment of Member State food system policies and R&I funding p.5 1.1 Qualitative mapping of existing Member State policies and strategies linked to Food and Nutrition Security p.9 1.2 Quantitative mapping of R&I funding on food systems research in Member States p.10 2 Results reveal a need for policy coherence and leveraging of funds p.13 2.1 Results of qualitative mapping p.14 2.2 Results of quantitative mapping p.20 3 Conclusion and next steps p.31 3.1 Recommendations p.35 Vocabulary p.36 Appendix 1 Qualitative mapping questionnaire p.38 Appendix 2 Quantitative mapping guidelines p.39 Appendix 3 Summary country sheets p.43 This publication presents an extensive quantitative and qualitative analysis of the research projects and policies in Europe in the last 5 years as related to food systems.

The goals of the assessment, research methods, key points and participating actors are presented in the following sections. 2 . Executive summary .

Mapping of the R&I investments of 11 countries reveals that much of the funding has focused on primary production and food processing. R&I funding drops off as one approaches the consumer (e.g. retail, consumption, food waste). This reflects the fragmented and unbalanced nature of past R&I investments, as well as a lack of interest in other stakeholders (including society) beyond those involved in primary production. Consumer or distribution related R&I investments were minor in most countries that completed the quantitative mapping. Climate change, urbanisation and other issues are likely to result in even longer travel from the production site to consumption, which calls for better performing logistics systems and innovative packaging to keep the products safe and fresh. Product durability reduces food waste and contributes to food system sustainability. Food safety is of great importance to the European food system. Food safety R&I inputs have focused strongly on production. This is not surprising as food safety starts with good practices in primary production. Furthermore, primary production has received a great deal of food system R&I funds. Food safety R&I investments are also an important dietary health factor. Currently, only minimal investments are being made in food consumption related R&I. This requires careful evaluation of the tools available vs. the tools needed to change the trend from treating non-communicable diseases (NCD) to preventing NCDs through healthy eating. Public health R&I inputs need to include food system dimensions through healthy and sustainable diets. We need novel approaches to create non-obesogenic food environments that contribute positively to health and consumer physical and cultural needs. Citizens play a vital role as an active part of a sustainable food system. For example food waste related targets can be reached only if the whole food system \u2013 including citizens \u2013 is involved. The food system provides food and nutrition security, hence it is a major player in health promotion. It also provides a significant number of jobs and opportunities for growth through innovation. The quantitative map- ping results can stimulate national reflection regarding the allocation of R&I funds. The question is: are the inputs to the food system R&I sufficient to exploit the potential of the food system? The findings of the quantitative mapping exercise clearly show gaps in R&I. Food system elements and interconnections need to be included into various national research programmes to fill those gaps. By involving all relevant societal stakeholders and creating open innovation, novel approaches could lead to the crafting of future solutions. The food system is large and highly complex and has many actors. It is unlikely that one R&I project could cover it all. Therefore, we recommend whenever possible to look beyond sectoral approaches by creating links between food system categories that also simultaneously address multiple objectives (ex: climate adaptation, sustainability, health, etc.). Possible solutions to fill the cur- rent R&I gaps could be found by stimulating existing working platforms to enable collab- oration between the different sectors and stakeholders, including society. This type of \u2018systems thinking\u2019 provides stronger and more prolonged influence and co-ownership of outcomes. To see the future progress in strengthening food and nutrition security, we also need to create adequate targets and indicators for monitoring - indicators that cover the whole food system and reflect the outcome. Measuring the progress made will demonstrate movement towards future- proofing European food systems so they can become more sustainable, resilient, respon- sible, diverse, competitive, and inclusive. BASELINE ASSESSMENT OF MEMBER STATES FOOD SYSTEM POLICIES AND R&I FUNDING 5 ",
        "7 6 . Baseline assessment of Member State Food System policies and R&I funding . Assessment of R&I on Food Systems by European Member States 7 The main rationale for the SCAR FOOD SYS- TEMS SWG is that the SCAR Member States (MS) provide strategic advice and support to the EU Research and Innovation (R&I) policy framework FOOD 2030 1 as well as to the review of the bioeconomy strategy, in which food plays a central role based on the \u2018food comes first\u2019 principle. Food is defined as \u2018edible products derived from land or sea (including inland waters) destined for human consumption or animal feed\u2019. Food is more than just biomass used as input for life support, bio-fuel and bio- based products: it has historical, social, cultural, environmental and economic di- mensions. Currently the EU and global food systems are affected by major societal and interrelated challenges such as climate change, migration, a growing world popu- lation, urbanisation, resource scarcity, the triple burden of malnutrition (undernutri- tion, obesity, and hidden hunger), ageing and food poverty. The SCAR FOOD SYSTEMS SWG recognizes that food systems should not only deliver food security but also nutrition security . Food systems produce and provide sufficient, affordable, safe, convenient, tasty and nutri- tious food for healthy and sustainable diets for all citizens. Food systems also need to be environmentally sustainable (\u2018resource smart\u2019), implying a sustainable and efficient use of natural resources, and limiting nega- tive environmental impacts. In this respect, building blocks of food sys- tems should encompass the entire value chain in its broadest sense and their inter- actions; from ecosystem services to prima- ry production (agriculture, aquaculture and fisheries), harvesting, storage, processing, packaging, distribution, retailing, food ser- vices (restaurants, catering, hospitality, etc.), waste stream management and re- cycling, food and feed safety, all the way to consumers, nutrition for citizens\u2019 health and well-being, and diet related diseases. To ensure Food Nutrition Security (FNS), the European R&I policy agenda should focus on future-proofing food systems by making them more sustainable, resilient, responsible, diverse, competitive, and in- clusive. This will contribute reaching the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs pri- orities) by 2030 and it will contribute to the FOOD 2030 priorities: NUTRITION for sus- tainable and healthy diets, CLIMATE smart and environmentally sustainable food sys- tems, CIRCULARITY and resource efficiency of food systems, INNOVATION and empow- erment of communities. R&I is the key to find high-impact solutions for future-proofing of food systems. R&I helps to avoid fragmentation, ensure policy coherence and adopt an effective food sys- tem approach. For this reason, the SCAR FOOD SYSTEMS SWG provides strategic intelligence and orientation by integrating and analysing the different regional, natio- nal, European and international initiatives already in place. This document allows for sharing best practices, knowledge and data, and stimulates the standardisation and harmonisation of data gathering, moni- toring and R&I policy alignment within and amongst SCAR Member States as well as with the non-EU countries that are partici- pating in the EC\u2019s International Bioeconomy Forum (IBF).

        "9 8 . Baseline assessment of Member State Food System policies and R&I funding . Assessment of R&I on Food Systems by European Member States In Europe, public-funded R&I relevant to food systems is generally fragmented across different international/European/ national/regional programmes funded by different ministries and agencies. Until now, most of the R&I in this field has been targeted to exploring specific parts of the food system (e.g., primary production, nutrition, food processing) without much attention to linking land and sea, connect- ing producers to consumers, or engaging different sectors and actors within the food value chain. The importance of future-proofing our food systems to make them environmental- ly sustainable and climate-proof within a rapidly changing geographical, geopolitical and demographic global context has now been recognised. This is at the heart of the new Sustainable Development Goals, all of which are connected by \u2018food\u2019. To tackle the current challenges of ensuring food and nutrition security whilst ensuring citizen health and well-being and the competitive- ness of the European food-related sectors, EU R&I policy must be rethought in order to provide high-impact solutions that can lead to systemic change. Better R&I policy will foster better policy coherence, programme alignment and leveraging of funds. The qualitative and quantitative mapping in Member States provides a baseline assess- ment of: \u2022 existing policies and strategies that are linked to food and nutrition security, \u2022 public R&I funding at national and region- al level related to food systems and their alignment with the FOOD 2030 priorities. These findings will serve to: \u2022 inform and underpin discussions within and among the EC services and EU insti- tutions about the current situation and the R&I investment gaps that need to be addressed, particularly with the next EU Multi-Annual Financial Framework in view, \u2022 catalyse future reflections and discussions at national and regional level regarding the need to work across institutional silos in order to tackle food system transfor- mation from a systemic perspective, \u2022 provide the SCAR FOOD SYSTEMS SWG further advice on the development of a long-term national, European and global strategic approach to food systems trans- formation in MS (next steps of FOOD 2030) and will aid the determination of future R&I investment needs at national level (where, how much, and how long). Figure 2: The 21 countries involved in the SCAR FOOD SYSTEMS SWG qualitative policy mapping \u201cFood and nutrition security\u201d (FNS) was de- fined at the World Food Summit (FAO, 1996) as: \u201cwhen all people, at all times, have physical and economic access to sufficient, safe and nutritious food that meets their dietary needs and food preferences for an active and healthy life\u201d. The aim of the qualitative mapping was to provide insight into existing policies and strategies that are relevant to food and nu- trition security and the priorities of FOOD 2030. For this purpose the SWG developed a 3-part questionnaire to collect input from participating countries (Appendix 1): \u2022 FNS related policy and strategy documents (using keywords such as agriculture, health, food safety, climate, fisheries, etc.) \u2022 Bioeconomy strategy \u2022 R&I policy and programming Each country performed a self-analysis of its situation at the level of integration of FNS strategies/policies, its ambitions and the R&I gaps to be filled. The results from the qualitative mapping is based on answers collected from 21 countries (Figure 2) . 1.1 Qualitative mapping of existing Member State policies and strategies linked to food and nutrition security ",

Assessment of R&I on Food Systems by European Member States Figure 3: The 11 countries involved in the SCAR FOOD SYSTEMS SWG quantitative policy mapping The transparent and systematic methodology used to map R&I funding in Member States guaranteed the possibility of reproducing the questionnaire and generating comparable results. Appendix 2 presents the agreed-upon data collection guidelines. The guidelines were prepared by 3 pilot countries (Finland, Hungary, Belgium) and the Chairperson\u2019s country (France), in consultation with the EC. After results were received from the first pilot country (Finland), the countries used an Excel template for data collection. Our aim was not to rank the countries by total funding, but rather to reveal how the funding was distributed to the different parts of the food system. Due to the limitations in the data gathering methods, these data can only be used for this purpose. A timespan of 5 to 6 years is sufficient for a good idea of the relationships and ratios of national food system R&I inputs. It also shows the total amount of funding per coun- try. This can be used for discussion at a na- tional level and for comparison with the total R&I investments. The food system not only provides food and nutrition security; it is a significant job provider and represents an opportunity for growth through innovation. Quantitative mapping results call for national reflection if the inputs to the food system R&I are sufficient to exploit the momentum that the food system possesses. By arranging the food system R&I investments into cat- egories and using percentages of the total food system investment, we could compare the priorities between the countries to show similarities and differences. At the time this report was written (May 2018), 11 European countries had com- pleted the quantitative mapping: Finland, Hungary, Belgium, Denmark, Spain, Sweden, Lithuania, Estonia, Ireland, Austria and Romania. Other countries are still gathering data to achieve their quantitative mapping. A more complete vision of R&I European Member States investment in food systems should be obtained by the end of 2018. Despite the common protocol and agreed process, it is important to keep the limi- tations of the mapping results in mind, especially the amount of detail that can be drawn from the conclusions due to the limited number of countries represented (11 of 28). The results from the quantitative mapping is based on answers collected from 11 countries (Figure 3) . 1.2 Quantitative mapping of R&I funding on food systems research in Member States ",

Food Safety depends on Ministry of Health, Social Services and Equality (MSSSI). The National Bioeconomy Strategy depends on the Bioeconomy Observatory at INIA. There are regional bioeconomy strategies developed by each autonomous government \u2014 Two main national objectives are: - Resilience to the impact of climate change - Food safety The multitude of strategic and policy documents from the various Member States generated a great deal of information, including links to various websites (although often hindered by the lack of an English version of the documents on those sites). The list of keywords provided to identify the relevant segments of these policies serves as a basis for the summary of results in Figures 4 and 5 . 100% as Countries Presence Containing food related pillar Absence In preparation 52 20 48 33 Agriculture Health Food safety Climate Fisheries & Aquaculture Others (Food industry, innovation) FNS DESCRIPTOR 100% as Countries 100 71 86 81 71 71 Figure 4: Existing policies and strategies on the scope of Food and Nutrition Security (21 MS or Associated Countries) Figure 5: Existing Bioeconomy strategy (21 MS or Associated countries) The agricultural part of FNS is covered by policy/strategies in all countries, followed by food safety and climate issues. The food industry/innovation and health parts are less well covered. Bioeconomy strategies are present in the majority of countries, whereas more than 2/3 of countries who did not indicate a presence have such strategies in preparation. If we compare the results of Figures 4 and 5 , we observe that the number of existing policies and strategies related to food and nutrition security is larger than the number of policies related to bioeconomy. A possible explanation for that is that bioeconomy is a relatively recent policy topic. The degree of food and nutritional security integration is country-dependent, as illustrated by the questionnaire results. The main highlights are presented in Table 1 .

Assessment of R&I on Food Systems by European Member States The results of mapping the public R&I research funds presented in the previous tables and the country specific allocation are described in the following sections. Production All countries had strong financial input to food production related R&I. The financial inputs to primary production (% of total food system R&I funds) varied from 36% to 74%. Finland was the only country to prioritise financial R&I support to pro- cessing over-production (47% vs. 36%). Sub-categorisation of the production into aquaculture (\u201caqua\u201d), crops, fisheries, inputs (seeds, fertilisers, energy etc.) and livestock revealed more country specific allocation of funds. Funding of crop-production-related R&I was most common except in Hungary, Ireland and Austria. In Hungary, input- related R&I dominated primary production funding (41% vs 30%). For Ireland and Austria livestock R&I investments dominated (37% vs 30% and 66% vs 34%). Livestock-related R&I or inputs (seeds, fertilisers, energy etc.) took second place for the majority of coun- tries (BE, EE, ES, RO, SE). Fishing-related R&I funding was of interest to Estonia (28%) and Ireland (14%), with little interest (0 to 5% of production related R&I funds) in other countries. Sweden and Spain had 18% and 10% financial input, respectively, for aqua- related R&I. Processing Financial R&I inputs into food processing was of interest for the majority of the coun- tries, but variation was large (from 4% to 47%). Sub-categorisation of processing into feed, food, ingredients development and packaging showed further country specific allocation of funds. Processing related to food (for human consumption) was the main receiver of funds (AT, BE, EE, IE, LT, RO, SE), but depending on the country, there were also significant financial inputs into ingredient development (ES, HU, BE, RO). Packaging as part of processing divided the countries as it was of minor interest (0%) for Austria, Estonia, Lithuania and Romania, of moderate interest (10 to 18%) to Belgium, Spain, Ireland and Sweden and of signifi- cant interest (39%) to Hungary. Distribution R&I inputs into distribution in the food sys- tem was a minor priority for all countries ranging from 0 to 6% of total food system funding. Distribution related R&I funds were sub-categorised into 3 sections: Food ser- vices (hotel-restaurant-canteen-catering), Transport (including logistics and storage) and retail. Transport-related R&I projects received the most funding in Belgium, Spain, Hungary, Romania and Sweden. For Austria and Estonia the focus was on retail (100 % and 81%) and for Ireland on hotel- restaurant-canteen-catering (100%). Consumption Ireland invested 19% of the food system R&I funds to consumption. Spain and Sweden allocated 12% of food system R&I funds to food consumption. But for the majority of the countries food consumption related R&I investments were low (0 to 8%). Con- sumption sub-categories were nutrition and consumption (consumer research). For the majority of countries focus was on nutrition and this category includes all type of nutri- tion related research projects. Food waste Food waste R&I projects received some funding in all of the countries. The finan- cial inputs varied from 1% to 11%, being generally more than for distribution or con- sumption related projects, but less than for food safety allocated funds. Food waste was sub-categorised further to production, processing, distribution and consumption. Food waste funding was directed most often to production (54% to 88%) and processing (56% to 96%) and consumption was least funded (0% to 9%). Austria and Romania prioritised food waste at distribution (100%). Food Safety Food safety R&I represents a group of sub-categories, i.e. production, processing, distribution and consumption. Food safety was of interest to the countries: 9% to 33% of all food system funds were allocated to food safety R&I. For Austria (33%), Denmark (20%), Hungary (27%) and Lithuania (33%) food safety was the second biggest receiver of R&I funds after production. The key in- terest areas varied between countries. Food safety at production was the main interest for the majority (BE, EE, HU, IE, LT, RO, SE). Food safety at processing was of main inter- est to Spain. To Austria focus was on food safety at consumption. Food safety data was not available for Finland because their mapping was completed before the Excel template for data collection was finalised. ",
        "29 28 . Baseline assessment of Member State Food System policies and R&I funding . Assessment of R&I on Food Systems by European Member States FOOD 2030 key areas FOOD 2030 priorities represent the way forward, i.e. how to make the European food system sustainable, resilient, respon- sible, diverse, competitive, and inclusive. The 4 FOOD 2030 priorities are NUTRITION for sustainable and healthy diets, CLIMATE smart and environmentally sustainable food systems, CIRCULARITY and resource effi- ciency of food systems, INNOVATION and empowerment of communities. Countries mapped the food system R&I funds into these FOOD 2030 priorities to see where the national interest has been in recent years. It is important to remember that mapping of the priorities is even more prone to variation than mapping the funds into the food system categories, as there is more room for interpretation. In addition, country specific innovation policies play a role as for Denmark they did not have an innovation category, since innovation is a default for R&I projects. All of their projects would fall under innovation. The food system R&I funding division (%) into FOOD 2030 key areas is presented in Table 5 and Figure 9 shows country specific allocation. The results show that the key areas are overlapping R&I themes covering the whole food system from production to consump- tion, including food safety. The key area of nutrition and health received major inputs from Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Ireland and Lithuania. This reflects the research inputs into food safety, as food safety is a health factor. Climate and sustainability was of major interest for Estonia, Spain and Sweden. For Finland the key area of inter- est was innovation and communities and for Hungary and Romania circularity and resource efficiency.

MAIN RESULTS FROM THE QUANTITATIVE MAPPING OF FOOD SYSTEM CATEGORIES AND SUB-CATEGORIES: CONCLUSIONS AND NEXT STEPS 31 ",
        "33 32 . Results call for policy coherence and leveraging of funds . Assessment of R&I on Food Systems by European Member States 1 R&I investments are primarily found in pri- mary production and processing, with lower funding at consumer level. This reflects the fragmented R&I investments on food sys- tems, as well as the low interest in food systems shown by non-primary production stakeholders. To improve the current situa- tion, stakeholders should be more involved in R&I on food systems. The lack of col- laboration limits the opportunities to bring diversity to the production. Including fish and other aquaculture products would strengthen food and nutrition security as well as diversity of the foods available. 2 Food safety is of great importance to Euro- pean food systems. Food safety R&I inputs had strong production focus. This was not surprising as food safety starts with good practices in primary production, but food systems R&I funds also focused on primary production. Distribution related R&I invest- ment were minor in all countries completing the quantitative mapping. In the future food is likely to travel even longer from its site of production to its consumption due to issues such as climate change and urbanisation. This progress calls for good logistics sys- tems and innovative packaging to keep the products safe and fresh. 3 Including consumers or citizens in the scope of food systems R&I is necessary to improve public health through diets and to tackle the burden of non-communicable diseases (NCD). Currently only minimal investments are made on food consumption related R&I. This requires careful evaluation of the tools available vs. the tools needed to change the trend from treating NCDs to preventing NCDs. Public health R&I inputs need to include food system dimension through diet. Citizen inclusion is necessary to build a sustainable food system, including from a food waste perspective. Household food waste reduc- tion is needed to reach the sustainable development goal of halving food waste by 2030. ",
        "34 . Results call for policy coherence and leveraging of funds . Assessment of R&I on Food Systems by European Member States Based on the quantitative mapping exercise results, it is clear that the food system elements need to be included into various research programs to gain R&I input for the missing parts. This can be done in collaboration between countries. Especially the fields of food consumption and distribution currently lack R&I inputs and projects. Food safety R&I investments in primary production are an important dietary health factor, but to overcome the burden of nutrition related health issues, we need public health R&I inputs to include food system dimension with dietary aspect. Moreover, citizens\u2019 role as an active part of sustainable food system is significant. For example food waste related targets can be reached only if the whole food system is involved. We need novel approach to create food environment contributing positively to health and consumer expectation. The quantitative mapping results call for national reflection on the allocation of research funds. There is little interest in food systems from the stakeholders of society other than those with a primary production focus. The question is: are the inputs to the food system R&I sufficient to exploit the potential of the food system? It provides food and nutrition security and is therefore a major player in health promotion, but is also a significant job provider and even more growth could be achieved through innovation. Involvement of all relevant stakeholders and open innovation could bring a novel approach and solutions to future challenges. This mapping does not give information on integrated projects. However it is unlikely that one project could cover the entire food system. Therefore, we recommend to paying attention to integration of parts of the food system whenever possible to create links between food system categories and priorities. Possible solutions to fill the current information gaps could be found by stimulating existing working platforms to enable collaboration between the different sectors and stakeholders. This type of system thinking along the process provides stronger and prolonged influence. To see the future progress in strengthening food and nutrition security we also need to create adequate indicators for monitoring, indicators that cover the whole food system and reflect the outcome. Tracking the progress made would show that we are future-proofing the European food systems by making them more sustainable, resilient, responsible, diverse, competitive, and inclusive. 1 To develop further awareness with and for society as a whole about the impor- tance of food systems as a central part of the bioeconomy. Food systems create wellbeing in many ways, but they can also deplete or challenge the adequacy of natural resources. The benefits and the disadvantages need to be acknowl- edged and worked on by all societal stakeholders. Food and nutrition secu- rity is well identified as a grand societal challenge and should be equally well covered by more integrated policies. 2 Food systems dimensions need to be included into R&I at a wider scope. Cur- rently there is only little interest about food systems from the stakeholders oth- er than those concerned with primary production. For example, public health R&I inputs need to include food sys- tem dimension through dietary aspects; market and trade have an important role in shaping our food systems; and the citizens\u2019 role as an active component of a sustainable food system is signifi- cant. Successful execution requires the involvement of all the stakeholders. 3 The food system provides food and nutrition security and is therefore a major player in health promotion, but is also a significant job provider. Further growth could be achieved through innovation. Involvement of all relevant stakeholders and open innovation could bring a novel approach and solutions to future challenges. 4 The current results provide insight into a few countries (qualitative mapping of policies and strategies (21 countries), quantitative mapping of R&I funding (11 countries)). We recommend collect- ing additional data from the remaining MS and associated countries to improve this analysis. The mapping results offer a solid base for national reflection on the allocation of research funds and a common ground for contact with other countries.

Assessment of R&I on Food Systems by European Member States VOCABULARY FNS Food and nutrition security, as defined at the World Food Summit (FAO, 1996): \u201cwhen all people, at all times, have physical and economic access to sufficient, safe and nutritious food that meets their dietary needs and food preferences for an active and healthy life\u201d Food systems The definition of food systems goes beyond the production and delivery of sufficient food for all (quantity) to include the provision of safe and nutritious food for healthy and sustainable diets (quality). A definition of a food system includes the processes and infrastructure needed to feed a population: growing, harvesting, processing, packaging, transporting, marketing, consumption, and disposal of food and food-related items. The food system also includes the inputs needed and outputs generated at each of these steps. Food systems operate within and are influenced by social, political, economic and environmental contexts. Food services Hotels, restaurants, canteens and catering IBF International Bioeconomy Forum, forum established by the European Commission to share and cultivate affairs of the parts of the economy that use renewable biological resources from land and sea. NCD Non-communicable disease, non-infectious diseases such as diabetes type 2, cardiovascular diseases and some cancers. NCDs are the leading cause of death in Western countries. Many risk factors are lifestyle related, such as poor nutrition and lack of physical exercise. SCAR FOOD SYSTEMS SWG Strategic Working Group (SWG) focusing on food systems under the Standing Committee on Agricultural Research (SCAR) SDG Sustainable Development Goals, United Nations set of 17 goals to transform our world to end poverty, protect the planet and ensure prosperity for all set out in the 2030 agenda for sustainable development.

Weblink to the policies/strategies: \u2022 What issues do each of them cover? \u2022 Which institutional actors are responsible for each policy/strategy? \u2022 Are these policies/strategies focussed on your country only, on Europe or do they target International cooperation and development? \u2022 Do any of these policies/strategies contain an R&I focus? If yes, describe. \u2022 Are there any new relevant national/regional policies or strategies being currently developed that are relevant to ensure food and nutrition security? If yes, describe. PART 2 Bioeconomy Strategy \u2022 Does your country have a national Bioeconomy Strategy? \u2022 If yes, what does it cover? \u2022 Does it have a food related pillar? If yes, describe. \u2022 Weblink to the Bioeconomy strategy: \u2022 If there is no Bioeconomy Strategy yet, is there one being developed at the moment? PART 3 Research and Innovation Policy and Programming List specific national/regional R&I policies/strategies/funding programmes relevant to food and nutrition security (e.g.: agriculture, health, food safety; climate, fisheries, etc). * The full questionnaires from the 21 countries are accessible on the SCAR website: https//scar-europe.org/ SCAR FOOD SYSTEMS Strategic Working Group PART 1 Raw data collection \u2022 All past public R&I funding will be mapped \u2013 per year - over a period of 5 years from 01/01/2012 up to and including 31/12/2016 (this means public R&I funding for project started in 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015 and 2016 will be mapped). \u2022 The template forsees the insertion of the year of the call under which a project was selected (yyyy) as well as the start year of the project. \u2022 The total or full costs of each project should be taken (according to EC rules). Any costs should be entered in EURO (the date of the exchange rate will be the one of data input). \u2022 The number of R&I projects funded per year should be counted in total and per category/subcategory. \u2022 Only count a project once (so one project per row in Excel). \u2022 Only map national and regional public funded research and innovation projects. \u2022 EU funded and co-funded R&I projects and ERA-Nets are excluded (they will be mapped by the EC). \u2022 Structural funds, LIFE, Interreg, COST projects are excluded. \u2022 Privately funded R&I projects are excluded (e.g. funding through foundations). \u2022 The public funding of public-private partnerships or to private organisations should be included. For the public-private projects, the amount of public funding should be specified. The total amount of R&I funding of the public-private project may be provided in a separate column. \u2022 All type of research and innovation projects can be included as long as they have a link to food and nutrition security and/or one or more parts of the food system. These include basic and applied research, IT/ICT research, socio-economic research, epidemiological research, agricultural research, marine seafood research, international development cooperation, bioinformatics research, veterinary research, food related public health research as well as innovation, demonstration and pilot actions. The nature of the study/experimentation could include: R&I projects on soil/crops/plants, animals, humans, micro-organism, cells, genes and may include in silico, in vitro, in vivo experimentation and omics technologies. \u2022 In case of holistic projects, usually, it is more focused on one of the category and in this case select this category as the main one (e.g. production or processing). In the case, it is equal for several or all the categories, it is recommended to choose one of the category but signal in the last column \u00abcomments box\u00bb: \u00abSystemic approach\u00bb. This will allow to identify those projects easily and make further analysis, if necessary, at a later stage.

        "Research and Innovation The EU and global food systems are affected by major challenges such as climate change. Research and innovation are the key to find high-impact solutions that will future-proof our food systems. To provide strategic aid on food and nutrition security related policy and strategy development, a SCAR FOOD SYSTEMS SWG mapped existing policies/strategies and research and innovation funding of the food system in EU Member States. Mapping results show that policies and investments focus on primary production and food processing. This reflects the fragmented R&I investments in food systems, as well as the limited interest in food systems shown by non-primary production stakeholders. To improve the current situation, stakeholders should be more involved in R&I on food systems. Because the food system provides food and nutrition security, it is a major player in health promotion. But it is also a significant job provider and food system innovation could lead to even more growth. The results of this study clearly show that food system elements must be included in various research programs to gain additional R&I input regarding food and nutrition, and to exploit the latent potential in the food system.
