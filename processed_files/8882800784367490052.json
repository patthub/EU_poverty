        "ISSN 1025-871X Editorial wove employment National Action Plans fall short on equality E mployment and national action plans (NAPs in the official jargon) have once again dominated na\u00ad tional and Community current affairs. As a corollary, issues of equality have returned to the debates, and analyses have shown that the lack of visible efforts to take equality into account in these plans was almost a constant feature. After their presentation to the European Com\u00ad mission and subsequently to the Heads of State and Government at the Cardiff Summit which brought the British Presidency to a close, the NAPs received a 'poor' rating for what they contain with regard to the 'equal opportunities' dimension. They were disappointing,and rather negative reac\u00ad tions were not slow in making themselves heard.The civil society reacted and the meeting organized be\u00ad fore the Summit by the European Women's Lobby showed that women's organizations remain vigilant and wish to be present not only at the stage of defin\u00ad ing national and European policies, but also at the stage of monitoring their successful implementation. Also to be noted is the European Commission's political commitment (reiterated by the European Council) to strengthening the guidelines regarding vocational training, support for small and medium- sized businesses and the improvement of employ\u00ad ment opportunities for young people, women and disadvantaged categories. The theme will remain topical during the six months of the Austrian presidency, which, on I July, mentioned employment and equal opportunities among its priorities. As if to prove that its declara\u00ad tions of intention would not remain unfulfilled, one of the first meetings at ministerial level was that of min\u00ad isters responsible for social affairs and women's is\u00ad sues. It will be followed by a series of other meetings on the general theme of'equality' during this second half of the year (see the Agenda). Out of concern for proximity and transparency, Marcelino Oreja, European Commissioner responsi\u00ad bility for, amongst other things, information, commu\u00ad nication, audiovisual media and culture, has taken the initiative of resuming a monthly letter to European NGOs explaining current institutional developments to them.This letter may be obtained by organizations with European aims, (see page 4) \u00b7 A \\\u039b\u00a3>- 6a__ \u039b_ cx^XS. Y Ana Paula Laissy Head of Section - Information for Women A S part of a joint effort to promote employment, Member States submitted their National Action Plans for employment (NAPs) to the European Commission as planned. This allowed the Commission and the Council of Ministers to make a first assessment in time for the Cardiff Summit on 15 June. Reaction to the NAPs was generally positive, although a number of shortcom\u00ad ings were revealed, notably on the equal opportunities front. Both the Commission and the Council welcomed the NAPs and Member States were urged by the Cardiff Summit to pro\u00ad ceed with their practical implementation as speedily as possible. However, action on equal opportunities had to be strengthened. In its overall assessment of the NAPs, the Commission considered that Member States had focused on the \"employability\" and \"entrepreneurship\" pillars rather than \"adaptability\" or \"equal opportunities\". A number of reasons were given by the Com\u00ad mission to explain this. The choice made by the Member States re\u00ad flected their specific national priorities, it said, and strengthening equal opportunities was a relatively new component of their employment strategies. The Commission warned the employ\u00ad ment challenge \"can\u00ad not be tackled in a sustained way ifall the pillars are not ad\u00ad dressed in an integrat\u00ad ed, mutually supportive way\". Although a number of Member States had mentioned the importance of mainstreaming the equal opportunities objective into the other pil\u00ad lars, there was \"little evidence of concrete applications of this\". Nonetheless, the Commission said that preparing the NAPs had raised Member States'awareness of the importance of equal opportunities policies, both with respect to gender and disability. All Member States had taken the issue on board and had proposed or promised new policy measures. In some cases, legislative reforms were promised, in others training provision was to be im\u00ad proved or specific information services set up. Most Member States also said they planned to support the creation of more childcare places. EU social policy, including the employ\u00ad ment strategy and Member States' NAPs, were discussed during the Second European Social Policy Forum, organised by the Eu\u00ad ropean Commission in Brussels from 22-24 June. Future work on employment At the Cardiff Summit, EU Heads of State and Government invited ministers in charge of social and economic affairs to continue working together to exchange best practice, ensure evaluation of the NAPs and plan the 1999 Employment Guidelines in preparation for the Vienna Summit in De\u00ad cember. A number of areas were singled out by the Summit as requiring further work. They in\u00ad cluded strengthening action on equal oppor\u00ad tunities; tackling dis\u00ad crimination against the disabled, ethnic mi\u00ad norities and other dis\u00ad advantaged groups. They also included re\u00ad inforcing the develop\u00ad ment of a skilled and adaptable workforce, in particular for older workers; promoting new ways of organising work; reviewing tax and benefit systems to help employers create new and attractive jobs; developing a culture of entrepreneur- ship and encouraging small business growth. * Economic, structural and institutional reforms discussed The Cardiff Summit also welcomed the 1 \"historic decision\" of 3 May confirming 6 that 11 Member States met the conditions for joining the single currency as well as the establishment of the European Central Bank on 1 June. \u2022 It urged continued economic reform to ensure the success of monetary union and endorsed the Commissions Broad Eco\u00ad nomic Guidelines to promote reforms. A time frame for negotiations on the Agenda 2000 proposals was also agreed and a longer-term debate on the Unions future development launched. ",

Cardiff hosts Women's Employment Summit Women from all over Europe gathered for a European Women's Employment Summit, organised by the European Women's Lobby (EWL), in Cardiff on 5 June to discuss the policy measures needed to significantly increase women's participation and promote equality in the labour market. Among the speakers at the Women's Summit were representatives from the Eu\u00ad ropean Commission, the European Parlia\u00ad ment and major European NGOs who pre\u00ad sented their analyses on the barriers women face on the labour market. Prior to the Summit, the EWL evaluated all 15 national employment action plans. Al\u00ad though it welcomed the Commission's ini\u00ad tiative to provide guidelines including equal opportunities, EWL analyses revealed that Member States were still reluctant to accord equal opportunities its rightful place in poli\u00ad cies on employment creation. The Women's Summit adopted a set of recommendations aiming to make equality between women and men a core concern of EU employment policy. These recommen\u00ad dations underlined the importance of main\u00ad streaming equality between women and men into all policies. It also called for the development of tools for implementing and monitoring mainstreaming at EU level and stressed that an equal opportunities perspec\u00ad tive required an integrated approach, with employment policies linked to social policy and issues of care. In this respect, positive ac\u00ad tion measures were fundamental to achiev\u00ad ing equality. During the EWL General Assembly, held a week after the Women's Summit, a new board and executive were elected. The new President of the Lobby is Denise Fuchs, from the French coordination. Hellen Fel- ter from the Vrouwen Alliantie in the Netherlands and Jacqueline de Gro\u00f3te from the Commission Feminine Internationale du Mouvement Europeen were elected Vice\u00ad Presidents. Ludovica Tranquilli-Leali from EWL Italy was re\u00adelected as Treasurer. Advisory Committee urges improvements in 1999 The European Commission's Advisory Committee on equal opportunities be- tween women and men criticised Mem\u00ad ber States' National Action Plans which, in its opinion, fail to take account of equal op\u00ad portunities in an adequate way. In their opinion on the 1998 guidelines and the NAPs, adopted at their July meet\u00ad ing, Committee members said it was impor\u00ad tant that the equal opportunities pillar is re\u00ad tained in the 1999 guidelines with quanti\u00ad fied targets introduced. The integration of mainstreaming into all the other pillars should also be strengthened. Promoting equality should cut across all activities pro\u00ad posed by Member States, they said.This was not the case with the 1998 NAPs despite \"significant progress\" having been made. The Committee also discussed its draft opinion on the Commission's proposed re\u00ad forms of the Structural Funds. It said the proposed reforms show the Commission's \"willingness to integrate the dimension of equality into all policies and measures at all levels and in all fields\". However, it said it \"disapproves\" that there was no longer a specific Community Initiative within the Funds promoting equality between women and men. The Commission proposes to re\u00ad place this with an initiative that will con\u00ad centrate on combating all forms of discrim\u00ad ination and inequality which prevent access to employment. This Committee, which brings together representatives from the 15 EU Member States and the social partners, advises on EU policy\u00admaking and strategies on equal op\u00ad portunities. A number of interest groups al\u00ad so sit in on the meetings, held several times a year, as observers. \u00b7 ustrian Minister for Employmen Health and Social Affairs \u00a9 Biiftd\u00abipr\u00abts\u00abdl*ntt Nr. 1.211 Jobs and equal opportunities top the Austrian Presidency agenda Employment and equal opportunities are among the main priorities of the Austrian government, which took over the six month rotating Presidency of the EU Coun\u00ad cil of Ministers in July, for the first time since it became a member of the EU in 1995. Eleonora Hostasch, the Austrian Minister for Em\u00ad ployment, Health and Social Affairs, told the European Parliament's Committee on Employment and Social Af\u00ad fairs in June that reducing unemployment levels togeth\u00ad er with a special emphasis on equal opportunities for women and men were high on the Presidency agenda. Policies and initiatives targeting young people and children, particularly with a view to protecting them from exploitation and abuse, are other Presidency priorities. On the 50th anniversary of the UN Declaration on Human Rights, the Austrian gov\u00ad ernment said it would press for a strengthening of international human rights mecha\u00ad nisms and a reinforcement of the European Unions human rights policy. Among the other major priorities were the final preparations for monetary union, continuing economic and structural reform and enlargement. Work on equal opportunities starts early True to its word, the Austrian Presidency started working on equal opportunities within a week of taking up office by organising an Informal Meeting of Social and Women's Affairs Ministers in Innsbruck on 8 and 9 July. Women's employment was the focus of discussion at the meeting during which the Austrian Presidency presented a background paper providing an overview of the situa\u00ad tion of women on the labour market. The talks concentrated on a number of priority policy areas identified by the Austri\u00ad an Presidency.They included increasing women's share in employment; integrating equal opportunities into all pillars of the 1999 employment guidelines; the role of the Euro\u00ad pean Social Fund in promoting mainstreaming; the reconciliation of family and working life; tackling the wage gap and gender segregation in the labour market and the need for suitable indicators to allow quantitative and qualitative evaluations to be made of the sit\u00ad uation of women in employment. This work wi\u00cb be followed up during two Employment and Social Affairs Councils on 5 October and 20 November next. \u25a0 \u00b7 * \u00b7 \u25a0 \u2022 \u00ab \u00b7 \u25a0 \u25a0 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7\u00b7 \u2022 ft ft \u03a6 \u03a6 \u03c6 \u03a6 \u03a6 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u03a6 \u03a6 \u03a6 \u03c6 \u03a6 \u03c6 ",

Nel van Dijk (Greens, the Netherlands), President of the Com\u00ad mittee and a Member of the European Parliament since 1987, announced her departure from the Parliament to head a Dutch NGO with older people. The Women of Europe Newsletter wishes her good luck in her new post. Monika Wulf\u00adMathies, the European Commissioner responsible for regional af\u00ad fairs, spoke to the Committee about progress achieved on mainstreaming equal opportunities in the current Stuctural Funds programme. She announced that a number of evaluation studies focusing on equal op\u00ad portunities would be presented at a special seminar in Portugal on 13\u00ad15 September. These studies will be used as a basis for de\u00ad vising new programmes under the reformed Structural Funds where 11 of the 56 Articles proposed in ^^^^^^^^ the new regulations now re\u00ad \u03be late specifically to equal op\u00ad portunities. Single mothers and one-parent families Integrating single parents into society benefits every\u00ad one, was the message from the Committee on Women's Rights adopting a report by Ludivina Garcia Arias (PSE, Spain) on the situation of single mothers and one\u00ad parent families. These fami\u00ad lies represent 10% of families with children \u00b7 in the EU Some 80% to 90% of lone par\u00ad ents are women.

Improvements to legal systems so that both parents fulfil obligations towards their chil\u00ad dren, the inclusion of single parents as a tar\u00ad get group in the Structural Funds and tax credits to companies providing childcare fa\u00ad cilities will also be among the measures proposed. Women's health in the EU A European Commission report on the state of women's health in the EU, published this year, revealed that although women con\u00ad sidered themselves to be in good or very good health they were not always satis\u00ad fied with the way their health needs were met. In her report, Nel van Dijk called for women's specific health problems to be taken into account in the design and implementation of all EU poli\u00ad cies and activities on health and health pro\u00ad tection. Unemployment and women Replacing Raymonde Dury (PSE, Bel\u00ad gium) as rapporteur for the Committee's own\u00adinitiative report on the impact of un\u00ad employment on women, Elena Marinucci (PSE, Italy) called for specific and realistic solutions to tackle women's high unem\u00ad ployment rates. Raymonde Dury left the European Parliament on 1 May to take up a post as Governor of the Brussels Region. In the report, Elena Marinucci urged bet\u00ad ter training provision for part\u00adtime and full\u00ad time women workers, a percentage of Structural Funds to be earmarked for women and a full gender evaluation of Member States' National Action Plans for employment. Pensions, equal treatment and the 1999 budget Although Astrid Lulling (PPE, Luxem\u00ad bourg) agreed with the main thrust of the Commission's Green Paper on supplemen\u00ad tary pensions which argued that it is up to Member States to decide on the legal framework for such schemes, she said equal opportunities should be central to all future debates on the issue. She also urged the Commission to re\u00adexamine its proposals to reform statutory and occupational social se\u00ad curity schemes so as to pave the way for the individualisation of pension rights. A report by Lissy Gr\u00f6ner (PSE, Ger\u00ad many) examining the budget lines for women in the EU's preliminary 1999 draft budget called for specific resources to be set aside for the European campaign to combat violence against women planned for 1999. \u00b7 p #\u00b7 ~: \u03c8 :g i:;: ig W 4P ft ft ft ft ft ft S '\u03c6 t # IB \u03b2 S \u00ab development Gender mainstreaming only at a start A lthough \"considerable progress\" had been made on integrating gender issues into development cooperation following a 1995 Council Resolution, \"problems of im\u00ad plementation\" continued to exist, according to EU ministers responsible for develop\u00ad ment cooperation who met in May. Discussing a review of progress prepared by the European Commission, Ministers emphasised the complexity of integrating gender issues across the wide range of coun\u00ad tries and sectors covered by development cooperation. There were shortages of staff as well as other resources to allow working methods to be adapted. The necessary train\u00ad ing to achieve mainstreaming was also often lacking. The Ministers promised to renew their \u2022 efforts to ensure that a gender perspective t would be incorporated into all EU and a Member State regulations and guidelines on \u2022 development cooperation in future. Gender \u2022 issues will be analysed and considered as \u2022 part of normal project or programme \u2022 preparation and follow\u00adup and will be inte\u00ad \u2022 grated into project documentation, they said. Good practice guides will be drawn up s for staff and training will be provided. Deci\u00ad m sion\u00admaking processes will ensure that gen\u00ad \u2022 der aspects are properly integrated into pol\u00ad is icy, dialogue, planning, monitoring and eval\u00ad \u2022 uation activities. The Council and Member States also agreed \"to aim to set targets\" for the imple\u00ad \u201e mentation of gender mainstreaming. They urged \"strong political commitment and se\u00ad nior management direction and support\" and the \"sensitising of decision\u00admakers in partner countries\" so that such policies can be successfully implemented. Continued efforts should also be made to better understand the links between pover\u00ad ty and gender, the Ministers said. Support was promised for poverty elimination strate\u00ad gies that mainstream a gender perspective. Activities tackling some of the root causes which result in a disproportionate number of impoverished women or those which promote women's equal access to and con\u00ad trol over assets, resources and opportunities would also be supported. \u00b7 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 f t \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7\u00b7 W W w W W w \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 ft * s s m s ",

Commissioner Oreja has decided to resume these letters which will provide in formation on other important on-going EU developments such as the employment strat egy, enlargement, the single currency and next year's European Parliament elections.

Currently, three separate culture pro grammes operate - KALEIDOSCOPE (the living arts), ARIANE (literature) and RAPHAEL (heritage). \"Culture 2000\", to run from 2000-2004, would replace these and aim to transform cultural action into a separate policy area in its own right with an increased budget of 167 million ECU. It will support cultural cooperation, expres sion and diversity and promote cultural her itage. \u00b7 Women high achievers in education Women now outnumber men in higher education with an average of 103 women for every 100 men, according to a study by Eurostat, the EU's central statistics office. The study found that for every 100 men with higher education qualifications there are 110 women with similar qualifications. The female ratio is higher in all countries except Germany (83) and Ireland (96). Por tugal comes out top with 170 women for every 100 men with such qualifications.The pattern is the same at secondary school lev el.

Most are women. But only a minority of homeworkers enjoy the same pay and working conditions as people in traditional workplaces. An International Labour Organisation (ILO) Convention on homeworking, dating from 1996, requires signatories to improve the situation of homeworkers and promote equal treatment between these workers and other wage earners. In a Recommendation adopted in May, the Commission urged Member States to ratify the Convention. All have done so except the UK and Germany.
