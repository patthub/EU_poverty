Emphasises that in order for young people to confront challenges, become active European citizens and be successful in life and the labour market while also shaping the world\u2019s future, quality and inclusive education must provide them with the necessary knowledge, skills, media literacy and critical and autonomous thinking, as well as with democratic attitudes; 7.

Stresses the opportunities that digitalisation and the establishment of common educational platforms offer for modern educa - tion, especially in terms of distance learning, distance education, and blended learning, which should allow more flexibility in educa - tion by tailoring it more closely to learners\u2019 individual living situations and thereby benefiting lifelong learning, education quality, accessibility and the development of future skills; highlights the need for age-appropriate ICT and media curricula that respect child development and wellbeing and emphasise the importance of both responsible use and critical thinking; 16. Notes that effective learning and teaching through digital technologies requires equal access, a competent level of digital skills, high-quality learning resources, training in adapting technology for pedagogical purposes, and promotion of the attitudes and motiva - tion needed for meaningful digital participation; believes that digital and media literacy skills should be an essential part of education policies and include, among others, civic competencies and critical thinking; stresses the importance of critically assessing sources and their reliability, and of media literacy projects in this respect; 17.

Notes that efforts are needed to adapt the educational paradigm so that it balances both a teacher- and content-centred approach, individually and specifically attuned to learners and their living circumstances, with an understanding-centred approach, combining learning methods adapted to both traditional and online learning models, thus strengthening the personalisation of the educational process and thereby increasing retention and completion rates; 19. Highlights that educational systems should promote and develop interdisciplinary, cooperative and creative approaches and teamwork aimed at equipping pupils and students with knowledge and skills, including transversal and soft skills as well as with pro - fessional, transversal, social and civic competences; 20.

Emphasises that the facilitation of equal access to quality inclusive education is essential for the independence and integration in society of learners with disabilities; calls on the Member States to facilitate access to mainstream inclusive quality education taking into account the needs of all students with all types of disabilities, which means, for instance, providing bilingual inclusive education for deaf children with regard to their special linguistic needs; calls on schools to provide both formal and informal differentiated ser - vices, and extra support, also using the potential of new technologies so that the individual needs of all learners are met; calls on the Commission to monitor schools on their non-rejection policy, and to set disability-specific indicators within the Europe 2020 strategy; 22. Maintains that European education must seek above all to develop reasoning, reflection, and scientific curiosity; that it has to be capable of building on the foundations of an artistic, scientific, and technical humanistic culture; and that, proceeding from the practical reality of local, regional, national, and European life, it must impart the training necessary to resolve national and European problems and raise awareness of problems within the international community; 23.

Believes that Erasmus+ is the EU\u2019s flagship programme in the field of education, and that its impact and popularity have been fully proven over the years; calls, therefore, for a substantial increase of funding for this programme in the multi-financial framework (MFF) for 2021-2027, in order to make it more accessible and inclusive and enable it to reach out to more students and teachers; 30. Underlines that youth unemployment is a Union-wide phenomenon which is reported to stand at a rate around twice the ave - rage overall unemployment rate; expresses its concern with regard to the alarmingly high rates in Mediterranean Member States, with peaks in Spain (44,4 %), Italy (37,8 %), and Greece (47,3 % for youth unemployment and 30,5 % for young people not in employ - ment, education or training (NEETs)), according to Eurostat; 31. Points out that in spite of the 2 million job vacancies existing in the EU, more than 30 % of qualified young people with diplo - mas are in jobs that do not match their skills or aspirations, while 40 % of European employers have trouble finding people with the skills they require ( 18 ); 32.

Highlights the great benefits for all children, especially those from disadvantaged groups, of attending ECEC, and stresses in this context the importance of guaranteeing that every child can access ECEC; notes with concern, in this regard, that in several Member States the demand for ECEC places exceeds the supply, especially for younger children; 35. Underlines the importance of monitoring the quality of ECEC so as to allow children to develop their cognitive skills and deter - mine whether the best interests of children are being met; School education 36. Sees all schools as autonomous centres for fostering critical and creative thinking and promoting democratic values and active citizenship; considers that schools should focus on helping young people to acquire the skills necessary for understanding and using available information, as well as for developing their learning autonomy and language proficiency; 37.

Considers that Member States should guarantee that nobody graduates from school without basic skills, including basic digital skills; underlines the fact that most jobs now require greater literacy, numeracy, digital literacy and other crucial skills and that modern education systems should therefore combine all eight key competences outlined in the Commission\u2019s proposal for a Council recom - mendation on Key Competences for Lifelong Learning, which also include knowledge and attitudes; welcomes the fact that this propo - sal also defines digital skills as basic skills; 41. Considers that, notwithstanding the impact of new technologies on education, the school should still remain a fundamental learning environment where potentialities are developed, and where each individual can find space and time for personal and social growth; 42. Draws attention to the fact that granting schools more autonomy regarding curricula, assessment and finance has been shown to result in increased pupil performance, provided there is effective school governance and school-based accountability for pupils\u2019 lear - ning; 43. Emphasises the positive impact of cultural diversity and multilingualism in schools on pupils\u2019 linguistic and cognitive develop - ment, as well as on the promotion of intercultural awareness, respect and pluralism; 44.

Points out that secondary school exchanges do much both to encourage pupils to acquire the abilities, skills, attitudes, and values intrinsic to dynamic European citizenship and to develop constructive critical thinking; 46. Stresses the need to make schools more open in order to enable recognition of non-formal and informal learning and smoother transitions between different educational paths (e.g. technical and academic); 47. Underlines that learners should be encouraged to use self-assessment techniques to measure their learning progress; encou - rages educational institutions to ensure that feedback tools provide reliable information by using a mix of several instruments, such as student questionnaires, focus groups and suggestions boxes; 48. Emphasises the importance of leading an active life through sport; stresses, in this context, the need to promote and give an expanded role to physical activity and physical education in educational curricula at all levels, with enhanced possibilities for develo - ping cooperation between educational establishments and local sports organisations; also encourages educational initiatives and extracurricular activities with a view to supporting the fulfilment of students\u2019 individual needs and interests while also building bridges with local communities; 49. Underlines the importance of quality education, vocational training and community and voluntary activities in contributing to raising the status of work-based vocations; 50.

Believes that higher education systems should be more flexible and open, and that dual training paths should be promoted in universities and further education institutions, in particular by encouraging apprenticeships, enabling the recognition of informal and non-formal learning, and ensuring smoother transitions between different levels of education, including that between vocational edu - cation and training (VET) and higher education, as well as various forms of programme delivery; stresses that the above should be based on a better understanding of the performance of graduates; Higher education 54. Emphasises, within the context of creating a European Education Area, the importance of supporting cooperation and buil - ding on the potential of all European higher education institutions (HEIs) and of students in order to stimulate networking, internatio - nal cooperation and competition; 55. Is of the opinion that an all-encompassing approach to internationalisation, including increased mobility for staff and students (also through traineeships and apprenticeships), and an international dimension for the curriculum and for teaching, research, coope - ration and additional activities, should be an important element of EuropeanHEIs; 56. Advocates an increased focus on interdisciplinary study programmes, and encourages the promotion, in tandem, of Science, Technology, Engineering, Art and Mathematics (STEAM) disciplines and of human and social sciences; highlights the need to encou - rage the participation of women and other under-represented groups in STEAM subjects and the relevant professions; 57. Advocates that higher education must engage with society at large in order to promote innovative growth and social welfare; believes that cooperation between HEIs and external stakeholders is desirable, as the latter can contribute knowledge and expertise in the design and delivery of higher education programmes; stresses, however, that the responsibility for decision-making must always lie with students and pedagogical experts; 58. Recognises the pivotal role played by academics and students in disseminating knowledge, empirical findings and facts to the wider public; encourages, in this respect, economically and politically independent research that is relevant to and benefits society; 59. Highlights the role of research-based education and pedagogical research as a means of stimulating active learning, enhancing skills development, and improving teaching methodology; 60.
