        "PREFACE The Foundation's contribution to the work of the European Communities on long-term unemployment has been concerned with locally-based responses to the needs of the long-term unemployed. Based on earlier Foundation work on activities for the unemployed and on the need, as expressed in the Council of the European Communities Resolution of 19.12.1984, for further research into schemes which are successful in combating long-term unemployment, the Foundation in its 1985 work programme initiated a study to examine a selected number of locally-based projects. The 20 projects chosen for study provide a range of services and activities for long-term unemployed which are aimed at meeting a variety of their needs and not just those directly related to employment and the labour market. While offering no more than a part of the solution to a part of the problem, these projects, it was felt, had the potential to bring tangible benefits in certain circumstances and for certain very vulnerable groups. This report brings together the findings of the five national reports covering the 20 initiatives and provides an examination of the lessons that can be drawn from these local projects: the main issues that arise and the social, economic and geographical contexts, within which the projects operate. On this basis, the report makes a number of recommendations for action to improve and strengthen the effectiveness and efficiency of such locally based projects. These projects offer significant elements of hope, particularly for the most disadvantaged of the long-term unemployed but further action is required to increase the contribution they can make to the solution of long-term unemployment and to reduce their present isolation and fragility. Prior to the publication of this report, a meeting was held in Brussels, on 27 January 1988 to enable representatives of the employers, trade unions, governments and the Commission of the European Communities - the constituent bodies of the Foundation's Administrative Board - to evaluate the findings of this research. There was considerable agreement expressed on the value of the work that had been undertaken. While local projects such as those studies in this report could not be expected to provide a total solution to unemployment, they had a significant contribution to make and this research provided valuable information on how this could be improved. Questions of funding and better coordination and integration of work within and between the various agencies and levels responsible were seen as crucial elements for further attention. However, action in this area would need to be combined with major restructuring at the macro-economic level. In the final analysis what was required was more jobs, unemployment is a structural problem which needs a structural response. However, these local responses to long-term unemployment offered important opportunities to restore control of their own lives to the unemployed and to enhance their dignity as individual human beings. They provided valuable illustrations of how institutional assistance can be blended creatively with self-help and participative approaches so as to bring about positive improvements in the quality of life for individuals who have become part of one of the most disadvantaged groups in European society - the long-term unemployed.

        "",
        "In conclusion, the representatives noted the timeliness of the research which would provide a valuable input to the new action programme in favour of the long-term unemployed being developed by the Commission in response to the Council of Ministers' conclusions of 1 December 1987 on action to combat long-term unemployment. As a follow-up to this report, a workshop was held at the Foundation on 29- 30 March 1988 bringing together officials from international and national organisations, researchers, and practitioners from specific local projects. The aims were to exchange their experience, debate the issues arising from the Foundation's research and to formulate conclusions about how actions mounted in response to long-term unemployment can be developed in future, through new policies, research activities, practical programmes and projects. The results of this workshop will be published by the Foundation.

        "",
        "Chapter 1: The aims of the research 1.1 On 19 December 1984 the Council of the European Communities adopted a resolution on action to combat long-term unemployment. This resolution included a request to the Commission to: \"undertake further research into those measures or procedures, whether taken by govern ments or the two sides of industry, which are successful in combating long-term unemployment, with a view to extending their use to other areas of the Community\" (EEC, 1985) 1.2 As its contribution to this research, the European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions decided to include, in its programme of work from 1985 onwards, a pro ject which would have the aim of identifying, analysing and evaluating significant and innovative projects in the Member States which aim at providing locally-based, comprehensive and integrated assistance to the long-term unemployed with their economic, social, psychological and accommodation problems. In essence and summary, therefore, the aim of the research was to examine a selected number of what came to be termed 'locally-based projects' which provide a range of services and activities for long-term unemployed people, thus aiming to meet a variety of their needs,and not just those directly related to employment and the labour market . These projects typically have a close association and identify with the local community, as a result of emerging from the locality - perhaps as a result of action among the unemployed themselves - rather than being instigated by external agencies. They are variously termed 'grass-roots', 'community-based' or 'bottom-up' initiatives. It should be stressed, however, that the Foundation felt that these locally based projects represent one of many needed responses to the problem of long-term unemployment. There was no prior expectation that such projects might in any way represent more than a part of the 'solution' to a part of the 'problem'. The Foundation hoped that in choosing these particular types of initiative as the focus for its contribution to the research requested by the Council, it would be comple menting to more labour market orientated research work mounted by Directorate-General V in the Commission and the research mounted by the European Centre for the Development of Vocational Training (CEDEFOP) in the field of vocational training and long-term unemployment. 1.3 The objectives of the project which followed from the above overall aim were, in broad terms: ",
        "to identify the ways in which these types of locally-based projects heJp the long-term unemployed to meet their needs, to cope with their situation, to reintegrate with the communities in which they live and to break out of the cycle of deprivation in which many are trapped, etc; through analysing the activities, historical development and organisational methods and structures of the projects, to identify the features and factors which appear to contribute to, or inhibit, their success; to provide advice, based on such information and analysis, to policy-makers (at the Community, national and local levels) and to organisers of projects and schemes, on ways in which action to combat long-term unemployment (both to reduce it, and to reduce its negative conse quences) can be developed in the future. 1.4 The project was a follow-up to an earlier (1983-85) one mounted by the Foundation, and could therefore benefit from its findings. The previous project took the form of a five-country review and analysis of measures and schemes which provide a variety of activities for the unemployed to enable them to make structured and positive use of their 'free' time and to provide financial, social and psychologi cal support. (See European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions, 1985 I. 1 ] ) 1.5 The 1985-87 project, the findings and results of which are brought together in this consolidated report, has also taken the form of a five-country study, of projects in Belgium, the Federal Republic of Germany, Ireland, Italy and the United Kingdom. Reflecting the aims and objectives out lined above, its focus has been on a number of specific, locally-based projects and, in particular, on the ways in which these seek to meet the needs of long-term unemployed people. It therefore builds upon and complements the earlier study. The project began in October 1985, when representa tives of research agencies from each of the five countries, together with the research manager and rapporteur, and representatives of the European Commission, CEDEFOP, the European Trade Union Confederation, and the Employers' Liaison Committee met to discuss how the aims and objec tives of the project could be translated into an agreed programme, timetable and set of research guidelines and methods. 1.6 The five agencies which undertook the research were: Belgium: Universite Libre de Bruxelles (Institut de Sociologie) Federal Republic of Germany: Institut fur Stadtforschung und Strukturpolitik GmbH Italy : Fondazione Seveso Ireland : Irish Foundation for Human Development United Kingdom: The Centre for Employment Initiatives ",
        "1.7 Further coordination meetings of researchers and others punctuated the research programme, and were held in February 1986, June 1986, and October 1986. The five national reports were completed in October 1986, each containing descriptions and analyses of the projects studied (four in each country), overviews of the contexts (national and local) in which the projects operate, and a discussion of the conclusions that can be drawn about the work and experiences of the projects started. 1.8 This Consolidated Report seeks to draw together and syn\u00ad thesise the results of the research, yet without repli\u00ad cating the detailed information available in the five national reports (see Bolle de Bal et al, 1986; Buck et al, 1986; Ronayne et al, 1986; Gerold! et al, 1986; and Centre for Employment Initiatives, 1986). In its content and structure, this report aims to provide the reader with: \u25a0 a brief account of the research methods used (Chapter 2); I an understanding of what long\u00adterm unemployment is and means (Chapter 3); \u25a0 an account of the programmes and actions mounted by the Community and its Member States to combat long\u00adterm unemployment and/or help those affected by it to meet their various needs (Chapters 4 and 5); \u25a0 an overview and analysis of the twenty projects studied (Chapter 6); \u25a0 an examination of the lessons that can be drawn from, and issues which arise from the projects and the contexts within which they operate (Chapter 7); and \u25a0 a series of conclusions and recommendations (Chapter 8). 1.9 It should be noted that the statistical and information data used in this project dates from mid\u00ad1986 (in the case of data on the projects and some of the statistical data) and (as regards other statistical data) from other dates before or after mid\u00ad1986: where this is the case the date is noted. Unless otherwise stated, therefore, the reader can assume that the data relates to mid\u00ad1986. ",
        "Chapter 2: The research methods 2.1 It will be evident from the broad nature of the previous description of what is meant by 'locally based projects responding to the needs of the long-term unemployed', that the term is an umbrella one, encompassing an extemely diverse range of initiatives. Like elephants, these projects are rather easier to recognise in practice, on sight, than to define and describe in theory and on paper. This was clear from the very outset of the research and, in particular, it was agreed that, whatever projects were selected for case study examination, the research methods could not be comparative or rigorously evaluative in their nature. Given the diversity of the initiatives, compari sons would be artificial - and have the inherent danger of attempting to compare like with unlike - and, given the likely lack of measurable indicators, qualitative and quantitative, by which impact on needs - social, psycho logical, health, financial etc - could be judged, attempts at detailed evaluation would be likely to be frustrated for lack of data. It goes without saying that whilst at least crude indicators of the impact of strictly labour market-related activities exist - in the form of job place ment rates, etc - measures of, for example, healthiness, improved self-confidence and psychological well-being are much harder to establish. 2.2 Accordingly, the research began with an agreement that the case studies should and could not be chosen as being in any way 'typical' or 'representative'. Rather, the intention was to select a broad range of schemes having interesting, and if possible, innovative features, which, as a group, would reflect the diversity of approach that is to be found across the five countries. Each would be examined not just as a functional entity at a parti cular point in time, but in a historical context (how it originated and subsequently developed to its current form) and in its local social, economic and environ mental context (to see how what it does relates to local circumstances). Thus in reading the case studies - summary details of which are to be found in this report, and in greater elaboration in the five national reports - and in attempting to draw conclusions from them, it should be borne in mind that they were not in any way selected as a representative sample, but instead as a group which encompassed as much variety of approach as possible. The following paragraphs provide information on how the 20 schemes came to be selected for examination. 2.3 Variables At the October 1985 meeting referred to at para 1.5 previously, the criteria and process for selecting the case studies were discussed and agreed. As far as selection criteria were concerned, four main sets of 'variables' clearly exist among projects catering for the needs of the long-term unemployed: ",
        "in terms of the scope of their activities and services (i.e. what they do); - in terms of the client/target group or groups for which they cater (i.e. who they are for); in terms of the type of area/locality in which they operate (i.e. where they are); in terms of the individuals and agencies involved in their establishment, operation and financing (i.e. who is involved); and finally, there is another set of variables which consist of: external (current and historical) factors which influence and have influenced their development (including, for example, the regulations and attitudes of funding bodies and programmes; the effect of evaluation programmes; and inter-relationships with other local projects). 2.4 Table 1 overleaf provides a summary of what comprises each of the four main sets of variables.

Preliminary formats for both description and analysis were agreed in February 1986. These were used by the researchers to compile interim reports on each of the case studies during the period March 1986-June 1986. These reports were discussed at the June 1986 researchers' meeting, and as a result, the analytical framework was modified slightly. The researchers then completed the case studies during the period June 1986- September 1986 and their final reports took the form outlined in para 1.7 above. The final forms of the descriptive and analytical formats are summarised in Tables 2 and 3 below. Table 2: Descriptive formats used for each project Aims and objectives 2. Historical information 3.

        "12 2.7 Drawing lessons and conclusions As noted at para 1.3, the research aimed to do more than merely describe and analyse the experience of the 20 projects studied. On the basis of such experience, the objective was to draw out advice to policy-makers and practitioners which might use fully inform their actions in the future. Naturally, the researchers were unsure, at the outset, whether anything in the way of general conclusions and lessons would be likely to emerge from a necessarily diverse range of schemes, but as the research work proceeded, a number of clear overall themes and issues emerged, as well as a range of more specific and particular, but nevertheless noteworthy, ones. These inform the concluding chapters of this report, and those of each of the national reports. It should be noted, however, that the specific and general lessons and conclusions which are out lined in this and the national reports, were identified and discussed among the researchers from as early as the June 1986 meeting right up to the occasion on which they discussed the first outline of this report in July 1987. Hence, just as the projects themselves take the form they had at the time of the research as a result of (in some cases, long) processes of change and development, so too are this report's conclusions the result of similar processes, over a year-long period. 2.8 Similarly, the discussions among and reports to the researchers over the course of this project also helped to inform the content of the next chapter. It attempts to set out what the nature and effects of long-term unemploy ment are. As will be evident, this is a diverse and complex subject, but some understanding of it is essential if one is to gain an understanding of what the locally-based projects are trying to achieve, and why.

        "14 The prospects 3.3 Unemployment as a whole appears set to remain at high levels for the foreseeable future. The Commission's 1986-87 Annual Economic report (EEC, 1987 [2]) indicated that the Community's collective economic growth strategy had not yet achieved its objectives and that the outlook for growth had deteriorated since the previous year. Even if and when there is economic growth its benefits will no doubt only slowly find their way through to those areas, those groups and those individuals who have been most affected by unemployment. Put simply this means that regardless of the buoyancy or depression of labour markets in the immediate future, the long-term unemployed are going to remain at the back of the queue, and the longer they remain in unemployment, the harder it will be for them to secure employment. A recent study of attitudes and practices among 450 employers in the UK for example (Institute of Manpower Studies, 1987) found that the long-term unemployed are at a significant disadvantage when applying for jobs and are at risk of rejection in at least 507\u00bb of cases because they have been out of work for so long. As the Commission puts it: \"as economic recovery takes place, labour shortages and concomitant problems will start to appear well before expected 'full employment' levels are reached, since many of the long-term unemployed will no longer be capable of filling the jobs which become available\" (EEC, 1987 [1]) It goes on: \"In general the Commission sees a need to avoid current tendencies towards a polarisation on the labour market between the regularly employed and the normally unemployed, and to seek to maintain a closer attachment to the labour market for those who have suffered a period, or recurrent periods, of unemployment. This is seen to be the best long-term way to avoid permanent dependence on social security transfers progressively becoming the sole form of income support for many, thereby 'institutionalising' long-term unemployment as a way of life.\" (EEC, 1987 [1]) 3.4 Just as the long-term unemployed are a particularly disadvan taged sub-group of the unemployed as a whole, so too are there groups among the long-term unemployed who suffer even greater disadvantages. In other words the term 'the long-term unem ployed' does not describe a homogenous group of 8 million people in Europe: it is a rather unsatisfactory blanket term, encompas sing an extremely heterogeneous range of individuals and groups which is differentiated not just by such characteristics as age, sex and ethnic origin but also by the economic and social characteristics of the areas in which they live, social class and background, employment history, skill and educational quali fication levels, stage of the family life cycle, and so on. A number of the projects studied are based in areas in which the extent of long-term unemployment is very great and its ",
        "15 impact on individuals compounds, and in turn feeds upon, other aspects of social and economic disadvantage, producing communities of despair, comprised of individuals whose senses of hope, self-esteem and dignity and whole life styles and living conditions are seemingly as empty as their pockets. It is the existence of such an environ ment that has brought many of the projects studied into being. 3.5 It is this heterogeneity which produces manifold and diverse needs among long-term unemployed people, needs which are by no means solely or directly related to labour market reintegra tion, needs which the projects studied in this research seek to address, at least partly, and often by their own admission, inadequately and incompletely. In the following paragraphs some aspects of the heterogeneous nature of long-term unemploy ment are described, so as to give some specific substance to .the general remarks made above. But before doing so it is perhaps appropriate to return briefly to the problems inherent in differing national approaches to measuring and defining unemployment mentioned at para 3.2 above. As will be evident, many of the projects do not seek to cater only for a group known as the 'long-term unemployed' as defined by the fact that they are officially counted as such, and/or meet certain established criteria. There are other groups who have similar, if not identical needs who do not get included in the statistics and do not fall within the criteria. These include individuals who are variously des cribed as 'unwaged' or 'economically inactive' or 'unregis tered' or 'retired', and so on. Many of these are long-term unemployed but not officially so. For example Ashby (1985) notes, in the UK, that \"the official figures exclude long- term unemployed people who are registered for work, but not claiming benefit. They exclude long-term unemployed men over 60. They exclude married women whose husbands are working (and also many thousands of married men with working wives .... )\". Distinguishing between these groups - whether related by blood or common needs - may be necessary to statisticians, but at the practical level, this is not the case. In addition there is the obvious point that the long-term unemployed are most directly and obviously linked to their families, who will also have needs related to and caused by the long-term unem ployed member or members. Young and old 3.6 Long-term unemployment is a problem among both young people and adults. Across the 12 member states, 38% of the long-term unemployed are aged under 25, and 627, over 25. Among the countries included in this study, however, there are marked variations, shown in Table 4B overleaf. ",

Again, however, there are marked variations on these overall figures among the countries included in this study, as shown in Table 5 below: Table 5: Prevalence of long-term unemployment among the unemployed by sex: selected countries Germany Italy Belgium UK Ireland % UE males who are LTU 48.3 61.1 63.1 54.3 66.3 %UE females who are LTU 45.4 65.5 71.7 40.0 54.1 Source: Com (87) 231 final, European Commission Unevenly distributed 3.8 Although long-term unemployment is widespread, and affects all areas of the Community, its spread is not even. It affects especially, areas where unemployment is high - those areas, in other words, where the effects of structural and other changes in the economy and the labour market have been most marked. These include the urban areas and industrial towns where traditional industries have been situated, especially those dependent on a single primary or manufacturing industry. In addition marginal rural areas have been badly affected, too, and here long-term unemployment \"emerges out of earlier, more disguised, under\u00ad employment\". (Social Europe, 1985) 3.9 The way in which the incidence of long-term unemployment varies on a region-by-region basis across the Community is shown on the following page. (Map 1) ",

        "18 3.10 But, as one might expect, if one looks beneath the regional level, at individual localities and communities, the pattern of uneven distribution remains, producing particular concentra tions in particular localities, concentrations which make a 'nonsense' of the overall state and regional statistics which have been mentioned. It is in these localities and communities that long-term unemployment can become 'institutionalised', to use the word used by the Commission at para 3.3 above. 3.11 It is in these situations that the shortcomings of existing 'special' measures for the unemployed, when applied to the long-term unemployed or even focussed more specifically on them, become most obvious. As will be evident from the following chapters, these measures are dominated by policies and programmes aiming to help with reinsertion into the labour market. In areas where the labour market and the economy are functioning poorly, such measures can at best, only assist the long-term unemployed, if temporarily, at the risk of offsetting effects on others (EEC, 1987 [1]). Yet the longer a person has been unemployed and the more long-term unemployed there are concen trated in an area, the less utility, relevance and impact labour market orientated measures mounted in isolation have. for in these circumstances, the needs of individuals and commu nities become more diverse and complex than for a training and a job to match. As the Commission puts it, in its May 1987 Memorandum: \"action to combat long-term unemployment must inte grate both macro-economic and micro-economic aspects with the social dimension of the problem\" (EEC, 1987 [1]) The nature of this 'social dimension' is now examined, firstly in terms of the consequences of long-term unemployment and secondly in terms of some of the related conditions which often accompany it. Both have been written about exten sively over the past several years, and the following paragraphs therefore consist of quotations from a number of official and other sources. The social and personal consequences 3.12 Consequence 1: Poverty \"Long-term unemployment still greatly increases the risk of financial poverty. Any savings or redundancy pay ments are rapidly eroded and credit frequently resorted to, with the attendant anxieties and problems of debt repayment or defaulting. Even essentials such as food, fuel and clothing may have to be cut to the bare minimum. Data on this area appear to be parti cularly abundant in the UK and one example, quoted from the Supplementary Benefits Commission (1978), should prove illustrative, \"... a deprivation scale was drawn up, consisting of seven items: buying second hand clothes, going to bed early due to lack of fuel, inadequate footwear, no holidays, all day without a cooked meal, missing school because of lack of suitable ",
        "19 clothes, and missing a cooked breakfast due to lack of money. Three-quarters of the unemployed had a score of six out of seven.' Such financial hardships, endured for a sustained period of time, can place the long- term unemployed amongst the most disadvantaged groups in modern European society.\" (European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions, 1985 [1 ] ) \"For the individual and any dependents, long-term unemployment brings a series of financial and personal problems in its wake. Not all are entitled to claim unemployment benefits - notably young school leavers and some workers whose spouses or other close rela tives have incomes exceeding a certain level - but, even for those who are, the rate of benefit generally decreases as the period of unemployment lengthens. Within 1 to 2 years, most families (with or without savings to draw upon) can find themselves reduced to the minimum level of social assistance.\" (EEC, 1984) \"Contrary to the idea that a period of unemployment involves little personal expense, we should like to make it clear that the loss of income from wages, even during brief periods of unemployment, is a very real problem for workers. In this respect unemploy ment obviously has a much greater impact in low- income families, especially when unemployment continues and when it affects the head of the household. And it is precisely the persons or families which are economically most disadvantaged, which are the obvious targets of unemployment and especially long- term unemployment. Unemployment renders the situation of everyone affected by it more precarious, but it reduces the most disadvantaged groups to penury.\" (Council of Europe, 1985) 3.13 Consequence 2: Living conditions and family life \"Income reductions appear to have their most immediate effects on daily consumption, especially of food, but, within a year or so, problems of replacing clothing and household capital goods emerge. Little systematic information is currently available but the limited surveys that exist show how most households experience a drastic cut-back in living standards, obliged to sell possessions etc. In many cases, this can also lead rapidly to housing debts or forced sales of homes.\" (Social Europe, 1985) \"Various research projects carried out in Europe have established that unemployed persons are forced to spend considerably less on clothing, recreation, household equipment, food and housing than before. The appearance of famine spots in some areas of southern Europe, the shantytowns on the outskirts of some European cities, the eviction of people who can no longer pay their rent (to such a degree that some governments have been forced to take action), are all dramatic signs of the effects of loss of income ",
        "20 following unemployment in some poor households.\" (Council of Europe, 1985) \"When the head of the household is out of work .... failure to reassess the established sexual division of roles and domestic responsibilities can lead to rows and disputes, particularly when this is asso ciated by the unfamiliar, close proximity of both partners in the home throughout the day. Marital disharmony inevitably impacts upon any children and indeed diminished parental control may result. In the context of pre-existing deprivations, the eco nomic and emotional trauma of unemployment not only places strongly introspective pressures on the family unit but may further jeopardise the children's pros pects for educational and other advancements.\" (European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions, 1985 [1]) 3.14 Consequence 3: Relationships \"The loss of a job implies loss of contacts with colleagues and other persons in the work environment. Unemployed persons are less often required to leave the house so that their environment and behaviour tends to be relatively restricted, mostly to the family boundaries (if there is a family). Due to reduced income many of the unemployed can no longer afford to participate in social activities and enter tainment requiring money. All this leads to a change in the social position of an unemployed person. Through unemployment the person loses a socially accepted position The self-perception and self-evaluation that are connected with paid employment are altered - in many cases in a negative sense. The new position is generally felt to be inferior, of lower prestige and acceptability.\" (Council of Europe, 1985) \"Work is still the principal means of social integration (EEC, 1984) \"Social isolation and marginalisation are keywords in describing the daily lives of older people who remain unemployed for any length of time; all their other problems stem from this experience. They are under mined by neighbours, relatives, former work associates, the political and administrative apparatus and by the ritualisation of their contacts with the medical services, employment office and benefit agencies ... Working and receiving remuneration for labour are regarded as the principal determinants of status. Work is seen as a public activity which ought to be conducted outside the home and which provides the framework for social contact. It is crucial to self- esteem and social awareness; all other activities, whether private, semi-private or public, derive from it ... The '8-8-8' routine of work, leisure and rest ",
        "21 is disrupted and this in turn affects a person's relationship to the 'outside world'.\" (Twente Steering Group for the Older Unemployed, 1986) 3.15 Consequence 4 : Inactivity \"Being unemployed is such a demoralising experience for many that they find it difficult to compensate for lack of work by taking up other activities.\" (EEC, 1984) \"Time, like money, is usually appreciated for what it can 'buy'. If, like restricted currencies, it cannot buy things, social status, recognition, a higher standard of living, personal fulfilment of whatever, it has little value.\" (European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions\"] 1985 [ 2 ] ) 3.16 Consequence 5: Status, self-esteem and confidence \"There is no doubt from the majority of studies that unemployment, particularly long-term unemployment (one year and more) produces a decline in the follo wing aspects of well-being; positive affect, pleasure, present life satisfaction and happiness. Unemployment increases the negative aspects: negative affect, strain, anxiety, depression, psychological distress.\" (Council of Europe, 1985) 3.17 Consequence 6: Human resource wastage \"The unemployed rapidly lose their vocational skills and competences and - even more damagingly - lose the habits and discipline essential to learning. Most Member States have therefore made efforts to encourage and enable the long-term unemployed to regain their skills and self-confidence, for example by offering special preparatory courses leading on to further training, or by combining training with work experience. Such approaches, while welcome in many respects, have experienced two major difficulties. Firstly, it has not been enough simply to make provision available to the long-term unemployed. Many, in the face of pro longed high unemployment, sink into passiveness and despair. The experience of being unemployed over a long period - a year or more - thus brings changes in attitude and motivation which further reduce the chances of finding a job and which turns long-term unemployment into a problem which is different in kind from the problem of unemployment in general. This is confirmed by evidence that the probability of unemployed people leaving the unemployment register decreases the longer they remain on it.\" (EEC, 1984) \"Human capital cannot be stored \"passively\" for long periods of time. Qualifications or skills need to be used and developed by being put into practice. Unemployment interferes with such processes, and pro gressive dequalification may well be the result of ",
        "22 longer periods of unemployment ('disuse' hypotheses of human competence) .... The longer a person does not exercise his/her occupational qualifications, the more he/she loses not only practice and routine, but also self-confidence. Being rejected by potential employers very often leads to a psychological situ ation which makes the person feel he/she is no longer able to do his/her former job or leads him/her to become completely unemployable.\" (Council of Europe, 1985) Related conditions 3.18 The Council of Europe report, quoted above and in previous paragraphs, provided a rich source of information to act as a context and background for this study. It was timely, too, since it became available just as this study was beginning. It is both a well informed and a considered document, being the result of the work of a study group which gathered infor mation from questionnaires returned by 19 countries, from factfinding missions to 8 countries, and from reviewing an extensive number of existing publications. 3.19 One manifestation of the considered nature of the report is what is says about 'causality', noting, for example, with regard to the various aspects of 'consequences' of long- term unemployment, \" .... the existence of many mediating variables, which can either amplify or mitigate the possible detrimental effects ... \" Such 'variables' include occu pational values, and those related to the work ethic, sex- role definitions, the perception society has of unemployment, (i.e. unemployment is not necessarily regarded as a 'stigma' in localities where it has been high and persistent for long periods), and vulnerability to change and other problems. These variables thus produce another aspect of the hetero geneity of the long-term unemployed: the discussion of con sequences above amounts to a picture of the 'general rules', or the 'common effect', but the Council of Europe report use fully and thoughtfully points out that: - there are exceptions to every rule: \"some people do not suffer from unemployment, whereas other people behave in the 'expected' way .... \" (Council of Europe, 1985) - \"a precise identification or elaboration of specific consequences to specific groups or persons (or even generalised across countries) can hardly be done.\" (Council of Europe, 1985) However, weighing up the evidence and the information gathered, the report did identify a number of vulnerable, 'at risk' groups and these are noted at the end of this chapter. It is significant how many of the projects studied in this research seek to cater for the needs of such groups. ",
        "23 3.20 Taking account of this, it is appropriate to refer to certain needs among the long-term unemployed as emerging not neces sarily as a direct, sole, consequence of prolonged unemploy ment, but from associated or related conditions. These include (and the three mentioned below are by no means an exhaustive list) the following: \u00abHealth: \"Research to date has not demonstrated unequivocally that unemployment impairs physical health, although it is widely believed that this may be the case. However, the results are clear in respect of psychological symptoms: unemployment does reduce psychological health. Experiences of strain, anxiety, depression and hopelessness are likely to increase because of unemployment, and level of aspiration, sense of autonomy and positive involvement in the world are all likely to be negatively affected.\" (Warr, 1984) \"... there now exists a considerable body of inter national and, to a more limited extent, national literature documenting the negative health con sequences of unemployment among the unemployed themselves. Increasingly, however, it is being recognised that the personal and social costs of unemployment are not borne solely by the unemployed themselves while it is an individual person who becomes unemployed, many others, particularly those in the immediate family environment, are likely to be affected by the experience. \" (Ronayne, 1986) *Deviancy \"Research on 'deviant' behaviour like crime and delinquency is even more ambiguous and contra- dictory than research on unemployment and health. The unemployed are overrepresented both among accused and convicted criminal delinquents. Yet severe shortcomings in available statistics make it impossible to draw causal inferences; if at all, a direct link seems to exist between unem ployment and only certain kinds of criminal activities (such as severe violations of property). On the other hand, it must be assumed that resocialisation efforts are greatly hampered because of the selection processes dominating in the labour market at a time of mass unemployment. With rising unemployment crime rates tend to increase.\" (Council of Europe, 1985) ",
        "24 \"Educational attainment \"More than one in five of the long-term unemployed have difficulty reading, writing, or doing simple arithmetic, according to a confidential survey (in the UK) by the Manpower Services Commission.\" (Independent, 1987) Some conclusions 3.21 This chapter has attempted to set out the context in which the projects studied operate, and in particular to show how diverse the needs of long-term unemployed people are. The question of whether such needs are direct con sequences of unemployment, or of the conditions which very often accompany it, is immaterial to those seeking to address and respond to the needs. 3.22 Three conclusions are worth noting. Firstly, it would appear that the greatest concern must be for those groups and areas where these needs pile up, one upon the other. The geographi cal aspect has already been mentioned, in terms of the types of environment where long-term unemployment is widespread. The Council of Europe study identifies a number of particularly vulnerable and 'at risk' groups, and these are worth noting: - men aged 45-55 years, especially those who have been the wage-earner; - single young women; - middle-aged women with children at home; - single men and women leading family or friend networks ; - adolescents and low-qualified young unemployed people; - unemployed people with poor health records and/or having experienced mental and physical strain while in work; - older and/or disabled people. 3.2 3 Secondly, the sheer short and long-term costs of the needs and conditions must be kept in mind. At a time when European long-term unemployment amounted to 4.5 million people, the Commission noted: \"Apart from the social costs of long-term unemployment, there are considerable economic costs. In terms of loss of output, the long-term unemployed probably account for a loss of 3-47\u201e of Community GDP below potential and this does not take into account the economic contribution that could be made by those unable to obtain work, and who do not even appear in the unemployment statistics.\" (EEC, 1984) ",
        "25 ,24 Finally, it is worth reiterating the point that the complexity and diversity of the needs of the long- term unemployed require similarly diverse responses. Just how far this is the case presently is now examined. ",

        "",
        "29 Chapter 4; Labour market related policies and programmes 4.1 As has been noted in the previous chapter, some of the needs of the long-term unemployed are related to the labour market. In simple terms, their needs include the need to work, and to secure what comes from work - including income, relationships, status, and so on. 4.2 In each of the countries included in this study, and indeed in EEC Member States more generally, a range of policies and programmes designed to help the unemployed to reintegrate with the labour market, or, at the very least, to provide activity and related benefits to them while they are unemployed, have been mounted by governments. The vast majority of these have been established at various times since the first 'oil shock', and the ensuing recession, in 1972/73. As the years have passed, the policies and programmes have been revised and, frequently, extended, so that currently,in each of the member states they are very diverse in their nature and targeting. 4.3 It was not the purpose of this research to seek to document, let alone analyse, these policies and programmes. To an extent this had been done in the previous Foundation research described at paragraph 1.4 and the Commission itself has documented the programmes (for the most recent documentation, see EEC, 1987). However, as will be evident from Chapter 6 and Annex 2, the projects studied mount activities and provide services which are labour-market related, and, as importantly, make use of funds available from government and Community programmes in their work. 4.4 Accordingly, Table 6 attempts to summarise what is happening in the five countries in terms of government financed schemes which directly or indirectly aim to assist the long-term unemployed secure reintegration into the labour market, and additional information is set out at Annex 1. It should be stressed, however, that the information provided is not necessarily complete or up-to-date: in simple terms 'blank spaces' in Table 6 do not necessarily represent an absence of action, but, more likely, an absence of information. These national programmes have become, in themselves, a complex and rapidly-changing field. 4.5 Actions mounted at the Community Level The European Social Fund (ESF) is the main instrument by which European Community resources are deployed towards the needs of the long-term unemployed by supporting a number of the Member State programmes described above, and through innovation and demonstration projects. But as the Commission has ",
        "30 recently noted (EEC, 1987), only 25% of ESF resources were devolved to the long-term unemployed in 1986, of which 50% went in the form of support to recruitment subsidies, (mostly to the private sector), and 7.7% of which went to the adult long-term unemployed. Demonstration projects aimed at the long-term, unemployed accounted for only 1.5% of the Funds resources. 4.6 Some observations Special action orientated towards the needs of the long-term unemployed, both at Member State and Community level principally takes the form of policies and programmes geared, in various ways, to labour market integration or reintegration. Such policies and programmes evolved from an initial assesment, in the 1970s, that the unemployment prolbme was short-term and cyclical in nature. It is now seen much more as a structural problem, but, in general, and as yet, the measures for the unemployed have not yet been fully adapted to be in line with this revised assessment. However, in general it is evident that whilst many of the labour market policies and programmes for adults began (in the mid- to late- 1970s) with general targeting on the 'unemployed', there has been a tendency, as time has passed for some programmes to be introduced or reorientated solely and specifically on the long-term unemployed, and for others to give particular priority to the long-term unemployed, and for others to seek to 'favour' them in other ways. This may reflect tendencies in the composition of the unemployed which have recently been analysed by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD, 1987 ). What the OECD says is worth briefly quoting here: \"Initially, due to the influx of newly unemployed, the proportion in long-term unemployment will fall. One year later a proportion of those new entrants will move into long-term unemployment, and the proportion in long-term unemployment will rise. A rise in the unemployment rate in one year will therefore result, ceteris paribus in a rise in the proportion in long-term unemployment in the following year. This relationship between changes in the unemployment rate and the proportion in long-term unemployment is not symmetrical, however. If the unemployment rate falls, then no immediate fall in the proportion in long-term unemployment results; or if a fall occurs, it is only minimal relative to the fall in the unemployment rate. Similarly, if the unemployment rate stabilised, the proportion in ",
        "31 long-term unemployment continues to increase, at least in the short term. This outcome can be explained in terms of the \"long-term unemployment trap\", whereby those who have become long-term unemployed find it extremely difficult to leave that state. It has been argued that an outcome of this has been a \"r\u00e4chet effect\" with long-term unemployment. After each period of increased unemployment the proportion in long-term unemployment increases, and when unemployment falls the proportion does not return to its previous level but remains at a higher level.\" (OECD, 1987) 4.7 For the most part, however, the long-term unemployed still take a very distant second place in most countries to the young unemployed, which have been the overwhelming priority for Community and Member State actions since the mid 1970s. There are, however, signs that youth unemployment is becoming a less pressing concern (see, for example OECD, 1987), and perhaps therefore the next few years will see a change in the balance of priorities. For the present, two observations can be made: quantitatively, provision for the long- term unemployed is inadequate. Only a small proportion of Europe's 8 million long-term unemployed are being catered for by existing labour market policies and programmes. And it would appear that those who do benefit are the least disadvantaged among the long-term unemployed, reflecting an adoption of the policies suggested by the OECD recently (OECD, 1987) that: \"given the limitations on the resources which are likely to be available for these labour market programmes, the best course of action may be to assist the most at-risk (of becoming long-term unemployed) at an early stage, and then do whatever seems required and affordable to help those who nonetheless do become long-term unemployed\". qualitatively, the labour market orientated provision is limited. In itself such provision addresses only some aspects of the needs outlined in Chapter 3. ",

        "37 Chapter 5 : Other policies and programmes, not related to the labour market 5.1 As will be apparent from Chapter 3, the long-term unemployed have a diverse range of needs besides those related to re-integration into the labour market. Many of these needs are not exclusive to the long-term unemployed. Some are shared by other disadvantaged groups in society, some indeed by the population in general. Thus, just as it has been noted that the long term unemployed are not, by any stretch of imagination or definition, a homogenous group, so too can it be noted that in many ways their needs cannot be separated, nor the means of meeting them, from those of others. 5.2 In each of the countries included in this study, there are a range of social and welfare policies and services in action which aim to provide support and assistance to those who are handicapped (in the very broadest sense: socially, financially, environmentally, or however) by virtue of the inability either to contribute to, or gain benefit from society, with the result that they fail to achieve their potential as individuals, in their own eyes, or in the eyes of society. 5.3 It was not the purpose of this research to seek to document the social and welfare policies and services which exist in the five countries, any more than it was its purpose to examine in detail the provisions which have been described briefly in the previous chapter, related to the labour market. Such policies and services are very wide-ranging and complex, and have been well documented elsewhere (for example, see Council of Europe, 1985). But given that, as will be apparent from Chapter 6 and Annex 1, and as was recognised from the outset of this research, the projects examined in this chapter provide such services as advice and counselling; leisure, education and recreation facilities; opportunities to develop self-help activities, etc, it does seem necessary and appropriate to try to set these in the broader context of state-provided services. In necessarily selective and general terms (for inter-country comparisons can be made only with great difficulty). Table 7 attempts to provide this context, presenting information about those services addressed to the social and recreational needs of the unemployed; to their need for advice about social problems and social security entitlements; to their potential for voluntary work; to self-help schemes; and to general education and emergency financial support.

        "38 5.4 Actions mounted at the Community level At the Community level, the Action Programme to Combat Poverty, popularly known as the \"Ahti-poverty programme' is the instrument through which EEC funds are allocated to services and projects aiming to combat poverty and its effects on individuals. It is however, a small programme (ECU 25 millions over 4 years), with the bulk (75%) of its resources allocated towards 61 selected projects across the member states, by no means all of them concerned wholly or partly with the long term unemployed. 5.5 Some observations It is not possible to draw conclusions from the information presented. However, some important questions emerge. * Firstly, there is the question of whether 'special' provision for the unemployed or the long term unemployed helps to integrate them into 'employed' society or divides them still further from it. People often seek and obtain help through friends and acquaintances, so that for unemployed people to develop a separate social network, but remain isolated from the 'rest', cuts them off from an important link both to society generally and to the labour market. * Secondly, there is the question of to what extent measures to provide advice, education, recreation, etc. for the unemployed generates self-help or, alternatively, dependence on the state and other agencies. * Thirdly, there is the question of how the political self-expression of the unemployed, now an interest group of substantial size in each of the countries considered, is helped or hindered by 'separate' or 'integrated' approaches to meeting their actual needs.

Code letters are shown for each project, as these will facilitate the overview and analysis which follows. Having studied bhese Tables readers are urged to study the rather more extended descriptions provided at Annex 2. These have been distilled from the national reports and therefore still only provide essential details and remarks on noteworthy features. Nonetheless readers will find that their understanding of the overview and analysis will be considerably enhanced if they go from Tables 8A-8E to Annex 2 before proceeding to paragraph 6.2. It should be noted that the information provided about the projects describes them as they were at the time of the research (mid-1986). Given that many of the projects had experienced changes of objectives and activities prior to the research (as will be evident from the descriptions of them), it seems likely that such changes will continue. Thus what they do and look like at the time this report is published may well vary from the mid-1986 picture presented here. 6.2 Having thus set out the facts about the 20 projects, this chapter then proceeds to offer some commentary and analysis upon them on a country-by-country basis. Given the diversity of the projects, and of the con text in which they operate, this country-by-country analysis produces a fairly complex picture. Chapter 7 therefore brings together the analysis on a more simplified, issue-by-issue basis. ",

        "60 6.3 The projects in Belgium (See Table 8A and Annex 2, BEL 1-4) The four projects in Belgium introduce a number of themes and issues which will also be apparent in other schemes in other countries. Perhaps the most important theme is the one which concerns the process by which the projects were initiated, and the process of development which is still apparent in a number of them. BEL 1, for example, is a job creation initiative which grew out of an earlier (training) one, which itself was established in response to local plant closures. BEL 2, like (for example) FRG 1, ITA 2 and UK 3 (as will be evident) is in essence an 'off-shoot' development of the work of a long-established body, in this case the Workers' University of the Italian Social Action Centre. And, finally, BEL 3 and BEL 4 introduce a theme which will become very familiar to readers as they progress through these pages: initiatives which begin with meetings of concerned individuals, whether professionals (BEL 4) or the unemployed themselves (BEL 3). This is an extremely significant aspect of what the term 'locally-based' means in practice in many of the schemes : people at the local level getting together to begin processes of action. Indeed in BEL 3 can be perceived an ensuing process which will be evident, in one way or another, in many other schemes in the other countries. Here a group of long-term unemployed (women in this case) began to discuss their situation. Their progress was then helped and encouraged by a 'development agent' (a trade union official in this case), who helped them progress a stage further, through more structured discussions. From there, the women were able to progress to, among other things, participation in a 9-month-long, government-financed training course, out of which, no doubt, further progress and development will take place. The origins of, and focus upon, women evident in BEL 3 is in itself worthy of note. Women, both as a specific 'target group' among the long-term unemployed, and as 'agents' of change and community development, will appear prominently in other contexts in other countries, most notably in Ireland, where two schemes (IRL 2 and 3) are specifically targetted upon them and where three schemes, (IRL 1, 3 and 4) were initiated by women. To return to the question of process discussed above, the schemes in Belgium illustrate another aspect of its nature which will also be apparent in many others. In short, this can be described as the progression of ideas, actions and projects in spite of the prevailing surrounding circum stances, rather than because of them. These 'surrounding circumstances' concern, in particular, the supply and conditions of government funding. BEL 1 had 15 months \u00d5T government finance - by all the evidence, too short a period of time in which to allow unemployed people to develop their own local employment initiatives. BEL 3 ",
        "61 sees 15 women on a 9-month course. Then what? is the question. And BEL 2 suffers from having to rely on short-term, insecure government funding. In sum, a contradiction appears: the initiatives involve long term processes of action and develop ment, yet the funding available is often only short term. Finally, BEL 3 also introduces another problematic aspect of self-help which will appear elsewhere (in UK 2, for example). When self-help succeeds for individuals (for example in terms of an individual obtaining a job) it can be at the expense of the group to which she (in this case) belongs, for the group has lost a part of its most precious asset - human resources. 6.4 The projects in the Federal Republic of Germany (See Table 8B and Annex 2, FRG 1-4) Perhaps the most interesting and significant feature of the four projects in the Federal Republic is the very diverse nature of their origins, each of them reflected closel\"y in at least one scheme in another country. These origins can be summarised as follows: in a pre-existing (often long-standing) organisation. Whilst FRG 1, in itself, dates back to 1983, its real origins go back to the establishment of the first community centre in Bremen in 1951. This scheme can thus usefully be compared (for example) with BEL 2 and ITA 2. in the actions of a concerned and forward looking local authority. In FRG 2 the city mayor and his most senior official were the key instigators. This scheme can usefully be compared with (for example) UK 4, where the local authority has also played the prominent role. in the church. In FRG 3 it was the Rector of Reckling hausen who took the original initiative. The church, in one way or another,also appears similarly prominently in, for example, ITA 1 and IRL 1, 3 and 4. in the post 1960s search for 'alternatives'^ In FRG 4 one sees clear parallels with the motivations behind those involved in the Italian cooperatives (most especially, ITA 2 and 3). Diversity is also apparent in the nature of the services provided by, and activities involved in, the four projects. At the one extreme is the orientation of FRG 2 to the labour market. In essence it provides work. At the other extreme is FRG 1, the principal (though not entire) focus of which is upon activities not directly related to the labour market. In between are FRG 3 and 4 ', which are' both 'mixed' schemes. In FRG 3 the centre is primarily non-labour market orientated, ",
        "62 the workshops the reverse, while in FRG 4 a wide range of integrated programmes and services can be seen, as well as an important element of residential provision, an element which also figures prominently in some of the Italian schemes. As in Belgium and elsewhere, difficulties and frustrations caused by the short-term nature of much Federal Government funding are apparent in all the schemes. In addition the particular difficulties inherent in the use of 'job creation' funds for staff positions apparent in FRG 1 will also be seen in several of the United Kingdom schemes. Finally, an interesting issue arises from a comparison of FRG 1 with FRG 4, an issue which also is apparent in other projects in other countries. It concerns the evident danger of isolating the long-term unemployed (or indeed, the unemployed as a whole) as 'targets' for special, separate, 'treatment' and provision. Whilst FRG 1 seeks to provide special services and activities for the long term unemployed within the context of provision for the community as a whole, there is, (see Annex 2 , description) an evident concern that, notwithstanding this 'integrationist 1 aim, unemployed participants are isolated and marginalised. Much the same issue is apparent in FRG 3, Conversely FRG 4 is thoroughly, and evidently successfully, 'integrationist'. ",
        "63 6.5 The projects in Ireland (see Table 8C and Annex 2, IRL 1\u00ad4) The four projects in Ireland, whilst all located in and around Greater Dublin, operate in a greater yariety of environmental contexts than their close geographical proximity might initially suggest. IRL 2 is in the inner city of Dublin, while IRL 1, 3 and 4 are in different peripheral urban and suburban contexts around the fringes of the city. Even so, it is interesting to note that despite their geographical proximity there appears to be little contact between the schemes, and in consequence no means by which they can learn from one another's experience. Perhaps the most striking theme which emerges, across all four projects, is their origins in either the initiative of one or two individuals (IRL 1, 3 and 4) or a community\u00ad based committee of several individuals (IRL 2). Thus in these projects the key 'actors' were, both at the outset and thereafter, a quite small number of active, even inspirational, individuals. Three of them (in IRL 1 and 3) were nuns, and the home\u00adhelp organiser who initiated IRL 4 was also connected to a religious order. Thus the Church has played, and still plays, a significant role in these schemes, and women have played equally key roles as catalysts and 'development agents' (in IRL 1, 3 and 4). Quite unusually among all the projects across the five countries included in the studies, there are three projects among the four targeting their activities on one designated sex. IRL 1 is targeted on young males; IRL 2 began with a specific focus on provision for women, and while it is no longer deliberately so targeted, it has retained a. major orientation towards provision for women. IRL 3 also identified unemployed women, or the wives of unem\u00ad ployed husbands as the members of the community in which to 'invest', via training and confidence\u00adbuilding, for the future development of the community. This purpose of 'investing for the future (long\u00adterm) development of the community' also appears \u0393\u03b7 IRL \u00c3~, but \u0393\u03b7 it the targets for investment \u00ad again via training \u00ad were unemployed people of both sexes, who had become active in local voluntary and community organisations. What this 'capacity building' investment has in common with some of the projects in Italy \u00ad and perhaps both to contribute to and learn from such projects \u00ad is noted at paragraph 6.6 below. As will be evident from Table 8E and paragraph 6.7 below, there are clear similarities between and lessons to be drawn from, IRL 2,3 and 4 and UK 1 and 3, and, for that matter, UK 2 and BEL 3, to an extent. The common theme is that of starting the process which leads to responses being mounted to meet the needs of the long\u00adterm unemployed, through some form of course. Within this common theme, two variables emerge. Firstly, what happened after, or as a result of the course appears in some cases to be accidental and in others part of a purposeful design. ",
        "64 Secondly, the precise nature, targeting, length and context of the course appears to be highly variable, to the extent that if the courses are examined across not only the three projects in Ireland but also those in the other countries, they are not just different in all of those respects, but very different! Several points concerning government finance can be observed in the four projects in Ireland. Firstly, as in all the other countries, excepting Italy, all the schemes receive finance from central government. Secondly, a wide range of government departments appear: including the Department of Justice (IRL 1\u00b7, Environment (IRL 2) and Labour (various projects) and government linked training and youth employment agencies (all projects). Thirdly, notwithstanding this, none of the projects is large-scale in terms of numbers catered for and operating budgets and fourthly , the projects have to contend with finance which is either inadequate or insecure (year-by-year at best) or inappropriate to the precise purposes being pursued by the project. 6.6 The projects in Italy (see Table 8 D and Annex 2, ITA 1-4) The four initiatives in Italy include three (ITA 2, 3 and 4) which either are in themselves, or involve, cooperatives of a form which are quite distinctive to Italy, although if they have a 'close relative' among the projects in other countries, it is most obviously FRG 4 - the Osloer Street Factory - where cooperation, idealism among the student generation of the 1960s, concern for the establishment of alternatives, and for the needs of the disadvantaged are also evident. Three cooperative-based schemes in Italy originate in some historical factors and events which merit a brief explanation, as many readers may not be familiar with them. Changes in the balance of responsibility - between the state and the church in particular - for the provision of personal social services, allied to both the aftermath of student unrest in the 1960s and the growth of unemployment in the 1970s all contributed to the promotion and encouragement of workers' and social services cooperatives in the late 1970s. Through social services cooperatives in particular the hope was that young unemployed graduates and professionals could play their part in the provision of social, welfare and health services. Many of the fledgling experiments did not survive long but the projects described as ITA 2, 3 and 4 show how some at least succeeded and flourished. At their core is a theme which appears not only in FRG 4 but, to an extent at least, in a number of projects in other countries, too. It is that of mutual self-help among the unemployed extending to embrace the needs and concerns of other, even more disadvantaged, unemployed and long-term unemployed people, including the handicapped, offenders, the mentally and psychologically ill, and drug addicts. ",
        "65 The projects in which this particular theme -\u03b9 not so much of 'self-help' among the unemployed, but rather of some among the unemployed realising their potential to help others even more disadvantaged than themselves - is at least partly evident in UK 2 and 3, BEL 3 and, perhaps most obviously, IRL 3 and 4. In these latter one sees an attempt to build up the capacity(Confidence and abilities of, respectively, women (IRL 3) and unemployed 'community activists' (IRL 4) so as to help them as individuals and, through them, others in their communities. Three main groups of 'actors' involved in the instigation of all four of the projects in Italy can be perceived: the trade unions, the church and , as noted above, the unemployed themselves. In ITA 4 all three appear, while the trade unions and the church combined to instigate ITA 1, in a manner strongly resembling the way in which university and trade union action came together in the very different surroundings of Northern Ireland to begin the process which led to the establishment of UK 1. This prompts a further observation, already apparent in the other countries: as significant as the 'self-help plus concern for others' theme noted above in Italy is the fact that ITA 2,3 and 4 have all emerged to their present form, and will no doubt go on changing, as a result of long (and difficult) processes of development. None of them happened overnight, or even within the period of one year which financers in other countries, as has been noted, typically work to. Two further observations conclude this overview and analysis of the Italian projects. Firstly, the cooperative schemes in their nature lead them to earn a large proportion of their income from the sales of goods or services, in a manner and to an extent which makes them distinctive from almost all the other projects, excepting FRG 2 and FRG 4. Reflecting the fact that they are 'enterprises ' , loans as well as grants appear in their finances. Secondly, as has been apparent in other countries, none of the projects in Italy specifically isolate the long-term unemployed as their target group. 6.7 The projects in the United Kingdom (see Table 8 E and Annex 2, UK 1-4) As has been noted previously, especially in the remarks on the projects in Ireland, UK 1 and UK 3 are projects which, respectively, began and begin with courses. In the former it doubtful whether the University and trade union based instigators of the course on unemployment for unemployed people realised that it would the first step towards the eventual establishment of the Derry Unemployed Workers' Group and its centre. But the UK 3 courses, regularly mounted, are seen and ",
        "66 planned as means towards wider purposes and ends, perhaps most resembling the courses involved in IRL 3 and IRL 4, and, like them,promoting the philosophy and practice that self-help and wider mutual aid are part of necessary response to the needs of the long term unemployed, having much in common with the Italian cooperatives. All of the projects have been in existence for more than 5 years and all have gone through changes, as a result of a variety of internal and external events and factors. In all, it is\" The unemployed themselves who were or have become the most significant 'driving forces', although this is perhaps least evident in UK 4, perhaps because of the fact that the project was largely promoted by local government, which sponsors and provides the major share of the finance. UK 1 and UK 2 show that reliance on the unemployed themselves as such 'driving forces' does have inherent dangers. At the core of UK lis presently a relatively small group of Tong-term unemployed people, concerned to wider, the participative base, but not finding it easy to do so. In UK 2 the very fact that participants found work benefited the individuals, but at the same time weakened the project. So, as a result, it has changed, altering, in particular, its target group, but also its range of activities, \"in UK 3 change, over the years, is reported to be the result of continuous evaluation of the content and impact of the courses: such a mention of evaluation is rare among all the 20 projects studied. In UK 4 the centre's very existence appears partly related to the failure of a previous initiative by the local authority. Funds set aside for cooperatives were unused, thus an agency to promote and develop them was encouraged, and set into convivial and social setting. Thus, in various ways, and for various reasons, all four projects do not just provide yet further examples of the long and often complex processes which have led to both the instigation and onward development of the schemes, but they also show the various ways in which change - often major - comes about. Whilst all the projects are 'multifunctional' (ie they have services and activities orientated towards both the labour market and to meeting the personal and social needs of individuals! emphases vary. The emphasis of provision in UK 1 and 3 is more towards needs not related to the labour market, in UK 2 the emphasis is the reverse, while in UK 4 there appears to be more of a balance between the two. Differences in what 'labour market orientation' means in practice are also evident, currently and historically. In\u00b7UK 2 for example it means both help with locating and securing jobs and enterprise start-up, while in UK 4 the emphasis is very much on enterprise, and in particular, cooperative enterprise. Two financial themes run through all four projects. Firstly, all the projects receive some finance from local government. ",
        "67 such finance being linked in two cases to central government urban programmes (UK 1 and 3) and in another to the European Social Fund (UK4). At the time of the study UK 2 was seeking to compensate for the loss of local government finance by securing urban programme finance. Secondly, all the schemes also rely, in some cases to a significant extent, on the funding staff positions through central government temporary employment programmes. The year-at-a-time nature of this type of funding and its inappropriateness to such applications clearly gives the projects a sense of insecurity and vulnerability. ",
        "68 Chapter 7: Lessons and issues 7.1 Table 3^ sets out a long and perhaps ambitiously wide- ranging set of questions which this research study set itself to address insofar as they applied to each individual case study project. The previous chapter having reviewed some of the lessons and issues which are apparent in the projects on a country-by-country basis, this chapter now seeks to bring the analysis of the experience of the projects together in an overall manner within the same structure set out at Table 3. In reading this, three points should be kept in mind. * Firstly, just as it was noted in paragraph 2.1 that there is an \"inherent danger of attempting to compare like with unlike\", so too is there an equal danger in seeking to draw out lessons and issues from such a diverse range of projects. But such a danger should not deter the analyst entirely, and it does not here. * Secondly, at paragraph 2.7 it was noted that: \"the researchers were unsure, at the outset, whether anything in the way of general conclusions and lessons would be likely to emerge from a necessarily diverse range of schemes.\" Nonetheless some do seem to emerge. * Thirdly, the approach taken in this chapter is not that of exhaustive, detailed and comprehensive analysis of every aspect of every scheme that could conceivably be of interest. Such exhaustiveness on the part of researchers and analysts can produce nothing more than exhaustion among even the most diligent of readers. Instead, the intention here is to try to select what appear to be the most important and noteworthy of the lessons and issues apparent in the experience of the projects studied and to discuss them briefly. Before proceeding, readers might like to remind themselves of the questions set out in Table 3. 7.2 Aims and objectives There were two questions here: firstly, do the projects aim at the 'reintegration' of their clients into the labour market, or at 'helping them manage unemployment better' or at creating new jobs, values and lifestyles? Secondly, do they aim to 'produce and deliver' services and activities ('products' ) or to promote processes? Before discussing what findings emerge from the research ",
        "69 on these two questions, it should be noted that one of the criteria for choosing the projects in this study was that they should be broad in terms of their scope and activities. Thus many have a range of aims and objectives. Often these have changed over the history of the projects as local conditions and perceptions of the needs of individuals have changed. But, in general, as regards the first question, all three aims are evident within and between the projects,,although it should be added that, almost without exception, the projects interpret the 'helping manage unemployment' aim dynamically and positively, rather than in any negative way, even in those social, economic and environmental contexts where senses of despair and hopelessness would appear to be perfectly warranted. Among the projects, only two (BEL 1 and FRG 2) have aims (as reflected in activities/services or the lack of them) which do not include the 'helping manage ...' one. Only one project (BEL 4) does not have services/activities reflecting the 'reintegration' aim. For the majority, the presence of services and activities orientated both to labour market-related needs and those not related to the labour market, indicates the presence of at least two of the three aims. Where two or three aims exist in any one project, the emphases placed on each vary, as one might expect, and no clear patterns emerge, but it would appear that: * it is easier for the projects to get funds from labour market programmes (although, as noted in the previous chapter, and below, the ways in which such funds can be used pose problems); and it is difficult for many of the projects (especially the small ones) to address fully and properly the full range of aims and objectives many of them have; A first lesson therefore emerges: * the activities and services of locally based projects tend to get biased towards the ' reintegration' aim, even in areas and among individuals where the possibilities of such reintegration are remote, because thiT \u0393\u00a5 the aim of principal funding sources. As regards the second question (products or processes?), there is again a wide variety of approach, but there are relatively few schemes which are solely, or almost solely, 'product' orientated. These include, most obviously, FRG 2, which is primarily a project which offers work, and little else, in a highly efficient and effective way. A second lesson can therefore be stated: * In the great majority of the projects one sees ",
        "70 the notion of process at work, not just in the history of their instigation and development, but in the manner in which they work with the long-term unemployed. This is most obviously manifested in those schemes which run activities - typically courses - in order to build confidence and/or skills which will then lead to other activities - in the form of enterprises, community development activities, etc. One implication of this 'process' orientation is profound and it represents a third lesson: * While year-by-year funding is tolerable (but not necessarily Ideal ) for product-orientated schemes, it is at best unsatisfactory and at worst entirely intolerable for process- orientated schemes. A final point about the aims and objectives of the projects can be made, one that is more an issue than a lesson, and is elaborated in more detail at para 7.8, since in concerns relationships. In essence, it is this: broad-ranging, even 'comprehensive' aims and objectives might be more likely to be achieved by better coordination and integration, at the local level, across all projects and services needed by the long-term unemployed, than within individual (and often small) projects. 7.3 The role of the projects The question here (see Table 3) was, in essence, about whether the projects aim to 'catalyse' or 'organise'. Two observations can be made. Firstly, the informal 'drop-in' style is evident in many projects. Secondly, and closely related to the discussion about process above, a number of the projects do see their role as catalysts - triggering off and stimulating a chain of reaction. The latter is most evident in some of the projects in Belgium (BEL 1), Ireland (IRL 3 and 4) and the United Kingdom (UK 3) where conscious attempts to make 'one thing lead to another' are very obvious. In addition, FRG 2 organises work, but for environmental improvement, which, in turn is for the economic development of the area. Thus, two characteristics can be noted, which can be set out as two more lessons: * Activities and services in many schemesare not regimentally 'organised', but run on 'drop-in' lines. ",
        "71 * Even where activities and services are more formally organised, they frequently have some wider purpose. That is, activity is not organised for its own sake but acts as a catalyst for other activities. All of this further reinforces the impression of dynamism given by the initiatives. 7.4 Methods The question here was (see Table 3): are the projects institutional in their methods (ie characterised by professionals organising and administering unto 'clients') or are they more characterised by self-help? Before addressing this question it is perhaps worth noting that where self-help methods do appear, the reason for their presence is that they are an important means of helping long-term unemployed people restore their self- confidence and of giving them responsibility for making choices and decisions. By and large, the majority of the schemes blend the institutional and self-help approaches, both as they appeared to the researchers at the time of the study, and historically. But the balances and emphases vary. At one extreme, as has been noted, are the institutional methods of FRG 2 and of elements (such as workshops, training courses) of a number of others. At the other, are the self-help origins of a number of the schemes in Italy (and for example, of the women's project, BEL 3), and the self-help focus of UK 1. All this can be summarised as a further lesson: * The majority of the projects have elements of both institutional and self-help methods : typically one sees professionals acting~to facilitate and support individual and collective forms of self-help. Having said that, another important implication can be noted. By and large, the labour market programmes outlined in Chapter 4 (and described in more detail at Annex 1) are institutional in their methods, although the programmes geared towards self-employment promotion are a notable exception. Thus, as one might expect, the more the locally-based projects make use of the funds available for such programmes, the greater their institutional tendencies. This is most marked, as noted, in FRG 2, but there are many others which get funds from the labour market programmes to employ and pay (professional) staff or allowances to participants. There is therefore evidence in the experience of many of the projects which suggests a further lesson: ",
        "72 * the wishes and abilities of the projects to develop self-help are, in part at least, eroded by the criteria and regulations attached to the funds available from labour market programmes. 7.5 The origins, control and management of the projects The question here was (see Table 3): are these schemes 'top down' or 'bottom up' in their origins and subsequent control and management? A clear answer emerges as a further lessons * The great majority are, in one way or another, 'bottom up'. In these schemes, three forms of 'bottom up' origins appear: origination in action among the unemployed; origination in action among one or several 'concerned outsiders'; origination among collective action by the unemployed and 'concerned outsiders'. Examples of the first form include BEL 3 and ITA 3; examples of the second include UK 2 and 3, IRL 3 and 4, and FRG 4; examples of the third include ITA 4, and BEL 1. In terms of current management and control, however, there would appear to be some tendency for 'bottom up' to become 'top down', although the Italian cooperatives and UK 1 are notable exceptions. Typically, control and management of projects is vested in boards and committees on which a variety of interests are represented, including participants, concerned outsiders, and various local agencies. Four further lessons about origination and management are worth noting. * Firstly, the trade unions and/or the church (or agencies closely related to the church) appear very frequently as originating or facilitating 'actors'. One or both were involved in ITA 1 and 4, UK 1 and 3, IRL 1, 3 and 4, FRG 1 and 2). All this leads to a lesson which especially concerns origination: * In and around the origins of many of the schemes can be seen one or a very small number of what can be termed 'key Xndividuals', whose vision, commitment and energy made things happen. Nuns, academics, trade union officials, professional ",
        "73 workers, and unemployed people appear in their ranks, and the role of women as catalysts and development agents is significant in a number of schemes. Given that Labour market programmes administrators are used to looking for organisations with which to work to establish initiatives, this lesson about the importance of 'key individuals' suggests another: * In developing broader-ranging initiatives for the long-term unemployed it is perhaps these 'key~Tndividuals' who need to be founcT and then assisted by programme administrators The experience of some schemes suggests that a cautionary note needs to be sounded about the dangers of expecting or investing too much in action among the unemployed themselves. The experience of UK 1 suggests that self-help among the unemployed can become introvert, too reliant upon a core group of the active. The experience of UK 2 and BEL 3 points to the weakening of the group that can be caused by the very success of individuals within it moving on, whether to work or elsewhere. All this points to a further lesson: * The need to avoid over-reliance on key individuals and/or core groups further illustrates the desirability of blending self- help and institutional methods, and of blending the 'top down '\"\"with the 'bottom up '. 7.6 Content There were two main questions here (see Table 3): how comprehensive are the services and activities and how integrated (within the project) are they? This is perhaps the most complex issue and this analysis is best restricted to the most major and obvious comments that can be made. While there is no project which offers all the services/activities listed at Table 1, all except three (FRG 2, BEL 1 and BEL 4) offer both labour market and non-labour market orientated services and activities. Indeed a clear lesson which emerges is that: * Education and/or training (of a pre-vocational or vocational nature) provisions are found in the great majority of schemes. As noted, these provisions often take the form of courses (whether of a 'personal development' or 'awareness-raising ' or more vocational nature) which are frequently seen as 'stepping stones' to other activities, and in that respect, 'integration' in the progressive sense of the word, can be seen in the ",
        "74 projects. The courses can be seen to be of four main types: education/training for labour market reinsertion (eg IRL 1) education/training for traditional forms of new employment creation (eg UK 2) education/training for non-traditional forms of new employment creation (eg BEL 1, ITA 2) education/training for \"life\" (eg UK 2, IRL 3 and 4) The obvious related issue which arises is: why is the presence of education/training services and activities so common? Some of the earlier lessons noted in this chapter suggest that the answer to the question, in part at least, is that it is relatively easy to secure funding for such activities from major funding programmes. But it would be wrong to conclude that this is the complete answer. Those schemes emerging from self help, such as UK1 and BEL 3, developed from informal discussion into more formal education and/or training courses. Finally it is evident in a number of projects that education/training courses are a first or early stepping stone, appropriate to and thus capable of attracting, in unthreatening and informal ways, participants who not only lack the skills and knowledge the course can provide, but self-confidence too. Courses are thus appropriate to and part of the 'drop- in ' style many projects have adopted to encourage people to overcome their lack of self-confidence. The fact that the projects are very often trying to grapple with needs among extremely disadvantaged individuals means that in general, few of the activities are geared towards obtaining formal recognised 'qualifications'. Thus a further lesson emerges: * The 'qualifications' offered by the education/training\"provisions of the projects are frequently thosi~~to do with self- confidence, personal capacity and esteem, none of which can be put on paper. 7.7 Targeting Who are these projects for? was the essential question here (see Table 3). The general answer is: only rarely specifically for the long-term unemployed. The lesson here is: ",
        "75 * Most of the projects have either a broader focus (\"on the unemployed more generally, and sometimes even on yet more broadly-defined\" target groups) or a more narrowly defined specific target group fror example young males or women or migrant workersJ Overall, there is great diversity as regards targeting, but some particular features and experiences are worth noting. The issue of targeting raises another aspect of the meaning of 'integration'. In the Italian cooperatives (ITA 2, 3 and 4) there is the attempt (by all accounts, successful) to integrate extremely marginalised and disadvantaged groups (the handicapped, ex-offenders, drug addicts, etc) with younger unemployed people. In the community centres in Bremen (FRG 1) the attempt is to integrate the unemployed into the general activities of the centres, although there is concern that the two elements of FRG 3 (a centre and several workshops) are tending to cater for separate groups. The multi-faceted nature of FRG 4 in Berlin also results in the integration, within the building, of a wide range of target groups, but this seems to have occured more because the scheme as a whole has grown by a process of the development and coming together of separate initiatives. What can be termed the 'fear of the ghetto' (ie labelling the unemployed as a separate group) appears in some initiatives. It is, however, an unresolved issue rather than a lesson: if the long term unemployed are to be assisted, efforts must, in part at least, be specially targetted on them. But on the other hand they are not necessarily attracted or held to schemes which 'label' them as in special need, in their own eyes or those of others. 7.8 Relationships This was a question (see Table 3) about another aspect of integration: integration with other provisions, services and agencies. whilst, as has been noted, other agencies are, typically involved in the management committees of projects, the lesson which emerges would appear to be that insofar as day-to-day activities are concerned: * the projects are, in the majority, self- contained, and thus more characterised by isolation than integration with other provisions, services and agencies. ",
        "76 As has been noted at para 7.2, this raises an important issue, comprised of a number of questions. Should locally-based projects be expected or encouraged to pursue broad aims and objectives, reflected in a wide range of services and activities, for broadly defined target groups? Might a greater degree of 'specialisation', plus better integration and coordination with all local projects and services (including education, health, housing, social security, leisure and recreation etc), provide a more adequate response (qualitatively and quantitatively) to the needs of the long-term unemployed in any area? Could such integration and coordination be achieved? If so, how? What would be the roles of individual projects, local and central government, the social partners, and other agencies, in such an approach? Would such an approach destroy what seem to be the most important features of the locally based projects (process-orientation, informality, flexibility, dynamism, non-institutional approach) or would it add to their effectiveness? 7.9 Funding The questions here (see Table 3) were about the breadth of funding achieved by, or available to, schemes, and the effect of funding conditions on them. The latter has been partly addressed at various points in the preceding paragraphs, and in Chapter 6: funding via labour market programmes is common, and such funding does, in various ways, appear to restrict the schemes, both in terms of what they can do with it and to what extent they can always rely on getting it. As regards the breadth of funding, it should be noted that some of the schemes have assembled funding bases which, while they may not be broad, at least contain unexpected elements: inner urban funds in the United Kingdom and Germany; funds from the Department of Justice and from health authorities in Ireland; large scale loans and agricultural funds in Italy; local fundraising (many schemes); earned income (many schemes), etc, etc. Overall, the lesson which emerges is not encouraging: * If_ one discounts the schemes with large trading turnovers and those in which budgets are somewhat artificially inflated by allowances paid to participants on training courses, one is left with a picture of the majority of projects trying to do a lot with a little from a limited range of sources, dominated by_ central government and local authorities Again, this raises major issues: how can other resources ",
        "77 be mobilised, and from what sources? How can they be used to secure maximum impact on the problem of long- term unemployment? Is it just that governments and the Community should do more, or should other sources of finance - from banks, trade unions, the churches, credit unions, etc - be mobilised? 7.10 Lessons and issues about outcomes What do these projects achieve? (see Table 3) is what the questions here boil down to. Such is their diversity, it is difficult to draw out general observations, so the lessons here are: * The outcomes of locally-based projects are as diverse as individuals possessing more self- confidence and skills (at the 'social' extreme) and the creation of new jobs and enterprises (at the 'economic' extreme). * Quantitative impacts, in terms of numbers of people reached or affected, are not great, although it would appear that the less schemes involve~~themselves with individual needs, through counselling and support programmes, the more people they can assist in more general ways. Thus there is, as in other fields of human need, a trade-off between quality and quantity. For the most part the philosophy of the schemes does appear to be twofold: process is more important than product; and quality is more important than quantity. Two final issues are evident when the outcomes and achievements of the projects are considered. Firstly, there is a clear need for better monitoring and evaluation of these types of project (and for the results to be made available widely, so that schemes can learn from one another.) Secondly, the lack of current monitoring and evaluation may well reflect the fact that, presently, criteria by which to evaluate the effectiveness of these types of project are lacking. The criteria by which mainstream labour-market orientated national programmes are evaluated are clear, if perhaps crude and simple: the numbers of people obtaining jobs after participation in such programmes. It will be evident from this report that such criteria are only relevant to a part of the work and activities of locally based projects. Their effectiveness can only be judged over the long-term but how, and in what way? How can the increased personal self-esteem and self- confidence of people be measured? ",
        "78 Chapter 8: Conclusions and Recommendations 8.1 Conclusions The objectives of this research project were set out at para 1.3. In summary, they amounted to asking these three questions: how do these locally-based projects seek to meet the needs of the long-term unemployed, help them cope with their situation, reintegrate themselves, and break out of the cycle of deprivation in which they are trapped? what features of the projects, and factors involved in them, appear to contribute to or inhibit, their success? based on the experience of the projects, what advice can be given to policy-makers and practitioners concerned with long-term unemployment? 8.2 At their conclusion, research projects such as this need to ask themselves whether they have achieved what they set out to achieve. The third question above is addressed from para 8.10 onwards in this chapter, in the form of a series of recommendations. But before setting these out, it is worth pausing to reflect on the first two questions, in particular to ask, simply, to what extent has the research been able to offer answers? 8.3 As far as the first question is concerned, the research has provided a wealth of detailed information not just about how the projects operate, but how they came about, and how they have developed into the form and structure they had at the time of the research. Tempting as it is to claim that this particular objective of the research has therefore been fully achieved, it is perhaps more accurate to say instead that as a result of the research a great deal is now known about not just how these locally based projects operate and how they came about, but what distinctive features they have, and what is significant and important about them. 8.4 As has been noted frequently in this report, the clearest and easiest answer to the question: how do these locally-based projects operate? is: variously. Whilst particular features can be found across some, and often many of them, the plain fact is that they are all different. But this can hardly be construed as a research finding, bearing in mind that the sample was constructed to produce variety. It is necessary to look at the common features, and the re-occuring themes and ",
        "79 issues to find answers - or rather 'lessons' as they have been termed in the previous chapter - to the question: how? The most significaant would appear to be as follows: * The operating methods of locally-based projects (with few exceptions among the projects studied) typically blend institutional forms of action with self-help. In other words, the actions of the 'professional' to meet the individual's needs are balanced by the actions taken by the individual him or herself. * In both the operating methods and historical development of locally-based projects, dynamic processes are evident: this further distinguishes them from the more static, product-orientated large-scale job creation and/or vocational training schemes established under national labour market programmes. In other words the projects seek to build one activity on another, in a progressive way, to make ' one thing lead to another'. * It is through such progressive processes that locally-based projects integrate some at least of the variety of services and activities they offer. * Two clear approaches to targeting emerge. Some projects target their activities on specific groups within the long-term unemployed, while others, at the opposite extreme, have a very broadly defined target group, stretching beyond the registered unemployed to other economically inactive groups. * Activities - often informal and based on self- help or 'drop-in' approaches and styles - to help build self-confidence are frequently the basis for and starting point of the projects. They thus start at a lower level of need than do the major labour market programmes. * In consequence, education/training courses and activities orientated towards personal development are to be found in many projects. 8.5 As regards the second question posed at para 8.1, concerning factors and features which contribute to or inhibit 'success', the research has identified some, as follows: ",
        "80 * One key factor in the projects is the person or group of people who can be found in its origins and/or at its current heart. Such people may be 'insiders' or 'outsiders', they may be among the unemployed themselves. Finding and investing in such people helps give momentum to projects; losing them can cause setbacks. * Lack of appropriate finance is a key limiting factor: the objectives and activities of many locally-based projects, and their process- orientation make it difficult for them to qualify for finance from labour market programmes. * The isolation of many projects (in two respects: isolation from each other; and isolation from other local services, agencies and activities) may be an inhibiting factor. 8.6 The third question posed at para 8.1 can now be addressed. The experience of the projects does prompt some advice - given in the form of recommendations in succeeding paragraphs - but before outlining them it is perhaps advisable to ask: what is significant about these locally-based projects? Why should they be supported? Why should policy-makers and other practitioners heed their significance and learn from their experience? After all, the fact that they are there does not necessarily mean that they are significant enough to warrant further development or support. 8.7 It will be apparent from the earlier chapters of this report that long-term unemployment is a major problem, across Europe and that large numbers of people will be affected by it for some considerable time to come. The scale of the problem is enormous, and its qualitative dimensions complex. While it is possible to envisage a situation in which more resources do become available, at both Community and Member State level, as the worst effects of Europe's other pressing problem - youth unemployment - begin to recede, nonetheless resources are, in total, necessarly limited. But if the Community and/or Member States were to decide either to do more, or to reorientate some existing resources, why should locally-based projects figure in their plans? 8.8 From among all the lessons and conclusions which have been drawn out in this report on the research, those which concern the project's methods - blending institutional provision with self-help - appear to provide the most important answer to the question just posed. In these projects: ",
        "81 * those that comprise the 'problem' are at least being afforded the oppoortunity of having the chance to be part of the solution. There are many ways of looking at the importance of this phenomenon. Philosophically, it means caring, without disabling the individual by reducing him or her to the status of 'victim' or 'client' and making him or her dependent on the services of the professional. To the individual, it provides a precondition for the building of self-confidence: in the form of the sense dignity or self-worth that comes from having a measure of control over one's destiny, however small. To the policy-maker, and in particular the exchequer, it can represent a more cost-effective use of financial resources, because it can trigger other resources: especially human resources, but also financial resources from other sources. 8.9 The context for this is wider than the problem of long- term unemployment and the question of how best to respond to it. Increasingly policy makers are, under the pressure of resource constraints, re-examining how societies in the industrialised and developed world go about meeting their needs, for health, for education, for jobs, for social well-being, and the like, and questioning whether the right balance has been achieved in the power and responsibilities of institutions (on the one hand) and those of the individual (on the other). In microcosm, therefore, the work of locally- based projects, and the balances they are seeking to achieve, perhaps reflect these wider debates, and contribute to them. 8.10 Recommendations The remainder of this chapter sets out a number of recommendations which, in the view of the reseachers, would strengthen the effectiveness of the work of locally-based projects. * Recommendations to the European Community and its associated agencHTs Recommendation No. 1_: In the light of the difficulties locally-based projects have in securing adequate, appropriate, secure and long- term funding, and in the light of the fact that long-term unemployment has become institutionalised in many localities and among various groups, consideration should be given either to extending or revising the scope and purposes of the European Social Fund and/or the Action to Combat Povety Programme, or to establishing a new European Programme of Action to Assist the Long- ",
        "82 term Unemployed. In broad terms, the broad purposes of such a new programme would be: to provide resources to encourage Member States and other public authorities and voluntary agencies to maintain and develop both locally-based projects and locally coordinated and integrated provisions for the long-term unemployed; to provide resources for the development, demonstration and testing of innovative techniques and new practices, particularly in respect of: o methods of improving integration and coordination within and between projects and services for the long-term unemployed; o the development of criteria for improved monitoring and evaluation; o better information-sharing among projects and localities (through ELISE, perhaps); o the exchange of expertise among projects and localities; - to provide resources for further research on responses to long-term unemployment (see Recommendation No. 2). Besides making financial resources available for the above purposes, the new programme should, it is suggested, mirror one of the features that can be found in locally-based projects: it should act as a catalyst. In particular it should seek to inform the policies of those community agencies concerned with, for example, poverty, the regions, health,the environment, and the labour market, and help them determine how such policies can be brought specifically to bear on the problem of long term unemployment, in collaboration with the new programme. Recommendation No. 2x In the light of the fact that this research has been necessarily limited in its scope, akin to shining a very small torch into a very large dark room, the Commission itself and agencies such as the European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions and CEDEFOP should be encouraged and enabled to pursue ",
        "83 further research, especially action research, so as to continue the process of improving and understanding how responses to the needs of the long-term unemployed can best be mounted. In particular, this research study might most usefully be followed up by a further study examining how strategies and actions to meet the social and economic needs of the long-term unemployed can best be developed in a comprehensive, coordinated and integrated manner. As has been noted in Chapter 7, the issue of local coordination and integration is an important one, containing a number of questions about desirability and feasibility . The study might therefore best be seen as a development of the Commission's existing programme of research on local labour markets, and mounted along similar lines (ie as a series of coordinated studies taking place in collaboration with local authorities across Europe, so as to involve areas having widely differing social and economic circumstances). Given its broad-ranging remit, the Foundation itself would appear to be well-placed to initiate such research. * Recommendations to Member States Recommendation No. 3_: For the same reasons and purposes noted in the first recommendation, and linked to any new Community programme, Member States should consider establishing a range of new policy, programme and financial instruments to increase the ability of locally-based projects to respond to the needs of the long-term unemployed. Such instruments should not be restricted to facilitating the provision of labour market-related activities and services, or be so designed as to inhibit the long-term process of development often involved in locally-based projects. Recommendation No. 4: Consideration should be given by Member States to establish mechanisms by which central government departments can better coordinate their policies and services to improve their impact on, or availability to, the long-term unemployed. Such central coordination will encourage better local coordination. * Recommendations to other concerned parties Recommendation No. 5^ In the light of the important role which has been played by bodies such as the trade unions, local authorities, the church, institutions of higher education, such ",
        "84 organisations together with employers' organisations and private sector bodies, are urged to continue to develop the scope and extent of the assistance they have provided. In particular, with Member State governments and the Community, they should consider how they could improve information and experience - sharing among locally based projects, through, for example: promoting and facilitating exchange programmes among individuals involved in locally based projects; promoting and facilitating study tours ; making technical expertise available to locally-based projects, for example through the secondment of personnel, and the provision of consultancy services. In addition all these other concerned parties are urged to consider how they can make resources - in cash, in personnel, or in kind - available to locally based projects. In particular they should consider the establishment, on a collaborative basis, of locally based trust funds to make loans or grants available to the projects. Recommendations to practitioners Such is their diversity, there is much that practitioners can learn both from one another, and from their collective experience. It is hoped that the circulation of this report will help to facilitate such learning. The formation of local alliances and information-sharing networks will also facilitate mutual support and information exchange at the more local level. Practitioners are also urged to play their role in reducing the isolation of locally-based projects, by widening their contacts and strengthening their links with other services and activities. Recommendations to all Recommendation No. 6: There is no one single body at Community, Member State, regional or local level, either within government, among the social partners, or other concerned parties, that, alone, can take action to help locally-based projects overcome what appears, in the final analysis, to be their most pressing problem: their isolation and fragility. Better and more adequate funding will help, but it is not the answer. Better integration and coordination. ",
        "85 too, will help, as will better support and information sharing. All these actions and more are needed if these types of locally based projects are to become strong and secure enough to do what they appear to be uniquely placed to do: giving people hope and confidence, and thus turning wasted assets into useful resources.

        "",
        "89 1, Measures aiming to create additional permanent jobs for the long term unemployed In the Federal Republic of Germany, the creation of permanent work opportunities is encouraged through the Forderung von Massnahmen zur Arbeitschaffung (ABM scheme). Projects are targeted at the long term unemployed, older workers and those with reduced capacities. Work must be of community benefit and there is a strict \"additionality\" rule - the work must not have been carried out otherwise, or only at a later date. Either private or public bodies may set up projects, and are assisted with subsidies of up to 60- 80% of wage costs, together with loans. These are provided partly from the Federal government and partly from the 'Land' governments. For the benefit of workers threatened with redundancy, the 'integration premiums' (Einliederungshilfen) are also available in Germany. These go to private employers in return for taking on a threatened person on a permanent employment contract. The subsidy is 50% of normal pay (occasionally 70%) for 6 months, or sometimes 1 year. In the Federal Republic of Germany there is also a programme to create extra job opportunities in local authorities, public utilities and church organisations for unemployed people receiving social assistance from the districts or towns. The employment must be for at least one year, and the sponsoring districts or towns receive a grant from the Land, as well as contributing to the project the money they would otherwise have spent on social assistance. In Belgium, the Troisi\u00e8me Circuit de Travail aims to provide permanent work for structurally unemployed persons who have been out of work for at least two years. Projects aim to meet needs which cannot be met by public or commercial services. Here, too, there is a strict additionality rule. Wages are paid at the collectively agreed rate for the type of work, and some jobs are part time. 2. Measures aiming to create temporary work opportunities for the long term unemployed In the United Kingdom, the Community Programme provides temporary work opportunities, some having a small training element, for up to twelve months. Eligible persons are those who have been unemployed and claiming benefit for at least a year (or at least six months for those aged under 25). New eligibility rules are shortly to be introduced which restrict places entirely to those aged 25-50. The providers of the ",
        "90 opportunities are voluntary organisations and local authorities. Here, too, there is an additionality rule, and work done must not be for profit or displace work which would otherwise have been done. Most projects involve social or environmental work, construction or building maintenance, and most jobs are part time. During 1987-1988 the United Kingdom government plans to change the Community Programme to offer only full time work in exchange for payment of the normal unemployment assistance, plus an extra payment of \u00a315 per week. In the Republic of Ireland, the Social Employment Scheme offers part-time jobs to the long term unemployed over 25 years, for between four and twelve months. Work is in non-profit organisations and subject to an additionality rule. The wage is IR\u00a370, for two and a half days. (A parallel scheme, the Grant Scheme for Youth Unemployment provides temporary work of community benefit for persons aged 15-25 who have been out of work at least 6 months.) Also in the Republic of Ireland, the Employment Incentive Scheme is designed to create additional jobs for unemployed persons over 25. It pays a weekly subsidy to the employer of IR\u00a330, or IR\u00a360 if the recruited person has been out of work over 12 months. The subsidy lasts for 24 weeks. Only two jobs per year per employer can be subsidised, and financial services and the public sector are not eligible. In Italy a temporary job creation scheme places long term unemployed persons under the age of 29 (older in the case of graduates and technicians) with private companies working on cultural assets. Placements can last between 6 and 36 months. ",
        "91 3. Measures aiming to get the long term unemployed into existing jobs The policy instruments used under this heading are of three main types: recruitment incentives to private employers; making participation in a special work scheme a condition of individuals receiving unemployment assistance; schemes to encourage an individual to give up a job in order that an unemployed person may be hired instead. Two recruitment incentive schemes operate in the United Kingdom. The first encourages employers to recruit, at low wages. The New Workers Scheme offers \u00a315 per week to an employer who takes on an unemployed person under the age of 21, but provided the wage is under \u00a355 (for those under 20) or under \u00a360 (for those aged 20). The Jobstart Allowance offers \u00a320 per week to long term unemployed persons who accept a job which pays less than \u00a380 per week. In contrast, the equivalent Belgian scheme, Ch\u00f4meurs difficiles a placer offers to pay the entire minimum wage, plus employers' social security contributions for one year, to employers who take on older long term unemployed persons (over 55 for manual jobs, or over 40 for clerical jobs), or those who have disabilities. Turning to the second category, there are three job placement schemes which are compulsory, in the sense that working on them is made a condition of receiving unemployment assistance. They are: the local authority work for redundant persons on special benefit in Italy; Ch\u00f4meurs mis en travail in Belgium, and 'work of public utility ' in the FederaT Republic of Germany. In the Italian case, redundant workers receive a specially high rate of unemployment benefit, 80% of their former earnings, and are expected to accept work of community benefit in return. In Belgium, long term unemployed persons can be 'placed at the disposal' of public authorities or certain non-profit organisations to perform certain public utility duties. In the Federal Republic of Germany, there are provisions for compulsory work of public utility, on a short term and part time basis, in return for a small allowance. As far as the third category is concerned, (substitution of unemployed or long term unemployed for existing workers) it is encouraged by the Job Release Scheme (United Kingdom) and the early retirement allowance (Vorruhestandsleistungen) in the Federal Republic of ",
        "92 Germany. In the case of the former, the financial incentive takes the form of a grant to the employee who retires a year before the normal pensionable age, provided their employer agrees to replace that employee with an unemployed person. In the Federal Republic of Germany scheme, it is the employer who gets the grant, and the scheme can apply to any employee over 58 provided that the employer agrees to pay a reduced pension from that age. The United Kingdom also has a Job Splitting Scheme, a financial incentive for employers who create two part-time jobs rather than one full-time one, and recruit people from the unemployed or government temporary work or training schemes. In the Federal Republic of Germany, recruitment of long term unemployed persons is encouraged by a subsidy for fixed-term 'trial' employment (Befristete Probebeschaftigung), and by a subsidy to employers for taking on unemployed workers over the age of 50. Measures which offer work experience with training Several measures across the five countries combine work placements with training. As with job creation schemes, the extent to which the participants take the place of existing workers is an important issue. In this respect it is interesting to compare the 'Building on Experience' scheme in Ireland with the United Kingdom 'Job Training Scheme'. The scheme in Ireland alternates periods of college-based training with training 'on the job' over a period of six months; the former element occupies altogether 4 months and the latter two months. Thus the trainee works with an employer for only two one-month periods. This scheme was piloted in 1984. In the United Kingdom scheme, by contrast, the trainee spends the whole six months with one employer, during which time at least 300 hours of training must be given. The rest of the trainee's time is spent on production duties. In the United Kingdom scheme, participants' incomes are made up of a training allowance plus, in most instances, some unemployment assistance as well, in order to provide the same level of income as when unemployed. Belgium, Italy and the Federal Republic of Germany have combined training and job creation programmes which provide participants with normal wages. In Belgium, all employers of over 50 people are required to recruit and train a certain number of extra employees each year, in order to provide vacancies for persons under 30 who have not previously had a job. In the Federal Republic of Germany, temporary part-time work with training is provided for unemployed people under 25 by local authorities, up to a maximum period of one year. ",
        "93 In Italy, 'training work contracts', for those aged 18- 29 and out of work at least one year, are encouraged by offering employers a grant equal to 15% of the wage costs (20% for employers in information technology or computerised sectors). If the training-work contract is for a permanent job, the employer receives an extra monthly grant. 5. Training and education measures All countries offer special vocational training schemes for unemployed workers, but the length and quality of training, and the degree to which trainees are successful in obtaining work afterwards vary. The United Kingdom permits recipients of unemployment assistance to study for up to 21 hours per week, provided they are willing to take a job if one is available before the end of the course of study. A wide range of both general and vocational education is available to unemployed persons taking advantage of this rule, and educational institutions frequently have special low fees for the unemployed. In both the United Kingdom and the Federal Republic of Germany, certain unemployed persons can also obtain subsistence allowances for the duration of full-time training courses. In Ireland the Educational Opportunities Scheme provides a subsistence allowance, equal to the level of unemployment assistance, for unemployed persons over 25 who wish to undertake full- time study for one year. In the Federal Republic of Germany, a vocational guidance service (Berufsberatung) is offered free to any individual on request, and to unemployed persons every three months. 6. Measures aiming at increasing the intensity and effectiveness of job search These measures may aim at: - increasing the intensity of job search (ie the number of job applications which unemployed people make, and the frequency and thoroughness of their attempts to look for work); improving the effectiveness with which they present themselves to employers (by, for example, improving letter-writing skills, interview practice, and general building of self-confidence). ",
        "94 Counselling schemes will generally result in intensified job search, particuarly if they are, as in the United Kingdom connected to monitoring the individual's eligibility for unemployment assistance. This monitoring may result in the recipient being challenged to prove his or her availability for work by applying to a particular vacancy or scheme. Regular interviews are provided for all unemployed people in the United Kingdom and the Federal Republic of Germany. In the Federal Republic, these take place every three months. In the United Kingdom, it is every six months, under the Restart programme, and attendance is compulsory, on penalty of losing unemployment benefit. In the United Kingdom, these interviews are also used to recruit people to special employment measures such as the Community Programme, Job Training Scheme, etc. In the United Kingdom Job Clubs have been established, which are designed to improve both job search intensity and effectiveness. Participants agree to attend a 'club' regularly and make job applications under the guidance of the club 'leader'. Free use of telephones, typewriters, paper etc. are offered. A similar scheme is operated in Ireland under the title of Job Search Scheme. The United Kingdom also offers Restart courses lasting one week, to long-term unemployed people to improve their job search technique and build their confidence. Measures aiming at fostering self-employment All the five countries except Italy have some scheme of providing financial asistance to long-term unemployed people who begin working on their own account. In the United Kingdom the Enterprise Allowance Scheme offers \u00a340 per week for 12 months. In Ireland^ a similar scheme pays I\u00a350 to married persons and I\u00a330 to single persons. In the Federal Republic of Germany, the Bridging Allowance (\u00dcberbr\u00fcckungsgeld\")\" is equal to the unemployment assistance the individual would otherwise have received, but it lasts only three months. In Belgium, a lump sum equal to the individual's unemployment assistance entitlement may be paid to provide capital, for business start-up. In Ireland there are also two schemes which aim specifically to encourage self-employment and small enterprise creation by young people: the Community Youth Enterprise Programme and the Youth Self- Employment Programme. ",
        "95 8. Measures which encourage early retirement, and other work sharing measures Whilst not directly targeted on the long term unemployed, these measures are mentioned because of their indirect effect - potentially at least - of Opening up' opportunities for employment for them. Apart from the Job Release Scheme (United Kingdom) and its equivalent in the Federal Republic of Germany, both described above, all the five countries make some provision for unemployed persons approaching retirement age to leave the labour force. In the United Kingdom, this is available for men only and takes the form of allowing men over 60 to receive a long term rate of benefit, equal to the state retirement pension, without having to seek or register for work. In the other countries, the provision takes the form of an early pension entitlement. Measures to secure or encourage shorter working hours are also widespread. In Italy, 'solidarity contracts ' are made between an employer and the workforce to reduce working hours; a temporary social security benefit is then paid to the workforce equal to half the normal rates for the hours given up. In Belgium, the government has legislated for a 5% reduction in working hours, and tried to promote part-time working. In the Federal Republic of Germany the federal government has also sought to promote part-time work and more flexible working hours. In Ireland the Part-Time Job Allowance Scheme offers a wage supplement from state funds to long-term unemployed persons who take up part-time work. ",

        "",
        "99 CASE STUDY: BEL 1 Name of project: Local Job Creation in the Borinage Location: Mons-Borinage region. Context Mons-Borinage is part of the Walloon (French-speaking) region of southern Belgium, where some 19,000 jobs were lost between 1974 and 1983 as a result of closures in the coal-mining industry, iron and steel works, textile concerns and the shoe and tanning industry. Both manual and white-collar workers were made redundant. In response the National Employment Office (ONEM) established a number of Training and Retraining Units (CFR). In the case of the Jemappes steel rolling mills, closed in 1983, the CFR was followed a year later by the establishment of a local job creation scheme (ILE), supported by ONEM, trade unions and local and regional development authorities, to assist those who had been made redundant and had not succeeded in finding work as a result of their experience in the CFR. The new scheme was envisaged as operating for a period of 15 months up to the end of September 1986. What does it do? The scheme is based in a former factory on the outskirts of the town of Mons, in premises which were also used by the CFR. Staff, consisting of coordinators, instructors and leaders, assist trainees to identify and test their ideas for setting up new enterprises; provide technical assistance in order to undertake product and market studies and business plans and analyse financial requirements and possible sources of external funding. They also help those coming to the centre to clarify their needs for further training, both in technical and vocational skills, and in management and financial control. Among the projects which the trainees in the ILE have tried to develop either individually or in groups, with the help of the staff are: a tannery industrial welding wholesale vegetable market a muslim butchery fish farming market gardening insulation panels - creche - restaurant centre for the mentally handicapped ",
        "100 Who is it for? Unemployed persons between the age of 20 and 50+ use the scheme. Some 35 people had found work by the time that the CFR shut in December 1984 but there were another 65 left who had started to explore the possibilities of establishing different projects. These were the people for whom the ILE scheme was set up, to enable them to launch their new enterprises. How did it come about ? The first CFR was set up in 1979 in the Charleroi area when a glass works made large numbers of workers redundant. The trade unions brought pressure on ONEM to find a new organisational setting within which to provide accelerated vocational guidance and training. The idea of a one-year training unit (CFR) was jointly supported by ONEM, trade unions and adult education bodies. The proposal to continue the work of the Jemappes CFR after its year, by establishing a job creation scheme, was based on the encouragement provided by the publication in November 1984 of the European Community's first communication on Local Employment Initiatives (COM (83)662 final). The sponsors of the CFR (ONEM, trade unions and training bodies) made an application to the Ministry of the French Community, which was accepted. Although the management structure of the new scheme was different from that of the CFR , many of the same people and organisations were involved either as board members or training staff. Organisation, structure and finance Whereas the CFR structure was one of a workers' collective, the ILE has a more traditional administrative structure. Its activities are linked, at two separate levels with ONEM, the training facilities being dependent on the policy and budget of the Vocational Training Directorate of ONEM in Brussels, while administrative matters are handled by the ONEM sub- regional Employment Unit, which itself is part of the Placement rather than the Vocational Training Directorate. Arising out of the CFR, a management cooperative was established to follow up the projects being established, but this is not part of the ILE structure, is based in different premises and has no permanent staff. The ILE premises are also used as an ONEM Guidance Centre and the ILE training staff are all experienced instructors and teachers from the Guidance Centre. There are 15 trade and social skill instructors plus an agricultural engineer and an economist specially recruited for the ILE. Groups are taught by teams of two instructors, one with a background in secondary education and the other higher education. For those intending to become self-employed there is only one ",
        "101 instructor. Instructors have to fill several roles: teacher, consultant, group leader, negotiator and also providing personal support and encouragement through counselling. The budget for the one year ILE scheme was some 50 million Belgian francs (\u00a3825,000) of which three quarters was for the remuneration of trainees, the rest being for payment of staff and operational costs. No allocation was made to provide funding for the launching or development of any of the enterprises. This has to be sought from grants for social projects or from the government Enterprise Scheme of start-up loans for unemployed persons starting their own businesses. Issues, problems, potential Just as was the case with the CFR training unit, so too will the ILE have problems because of the time-limited nature of the project, each being planned and budgetted for a one-year period. This is too short to help the unemployed face up to their new situation, decide what to do, determine what training or other assistance they require and, above all, to work through the bureaucratic channels from whom assistance has to be sought. Within the scheme questions arise as to the capacity of training instructors, however skilled they are in their particular sector, to provide the information and support required to enable those who had not previously been entrepreneurs, to enter business markets. The trade unions felt their position might be ambiguous, on the one hand wishing to be seen as opponents of redundancy, while on the other wishing to take part in an innovative approach to restructuring of the labour market. Their interest was more in the sector of cooperatives than in encouraging individuals to become self-employed. The bureaucratic inflexibility of the National Employmnent Office, which is in any case within a highly complex pattern of responsibility shared between different ministries, was another constraint. At the same time, although there was some recognition that the region itself, and government authorities, universities, private and public enterprises, had much to offer, the ILE scheme itself did not find any co ordinated or joint effort locally through which it could put down roots and find continuing sustenance. This appears to be not only an organisational issue but also one of the absence of political will. ",
        "102 CASE STUDY: BEL 2 Name of project: CASI-UO (Workers' University of the Italian Social Action-Centre) Location: Brussels. Context A fifth of the total population of Brussels (1 million) are immigrants and of these 16% are Italians. Many of them came as long-term immigrants from Southern Italy during the 1960s and 1970s when there was a big public works programme. Little was done to ensure the social integration of these workers or their families. By the 1980s more than half of the unemployed were foreigners and one third came from the construction industry in which Italians were predominant. What does it do? Through a small group of politically conscious educators, all of them of Italian origin, a range of educational and socio- cultural activities are provided through CASI-UO, the central feature of which is a vocational guidance and training scheme started in 1983 and based in premises rented from the Italian Consulate in Brussels. Other activities started earlier include: - Workers' University evening classes in French, Italian and general political awareness (twice a week ) - socio-cultural groups including photography, video, poetry, singing and drama - remedial groups for adolescents parents ' groups for those whose children are at the Italian government-run school - legal advice centre (once a week) library The original vocational training scheme provided a first stage of general basic and remedial education and a second stage which provided pre-vocational knowledge and skills and the working out of a vocational plan. Stage one included language teaching in French and Flemish as well as mathematics; the second included both specific skills and teaching in social skills and effective job seeking. Later stages included English and accounting as well as training in computers. Special attention was paid to 'alternance' training by providing a \"mix\" of instruction and work- experience which might lead to stable employment or regular apprenticeship training. Who is it for? The target group were the young immigrant Italian workers and ",
        "103 their children, who because of their generally low skill level were especially hard-hit by unemployment. The original Workers' University classes and the socio-cultural activities catered for a wide range of people in the Italian community. The vocational training scheme was aimed at the young unemployed between the ages of 18 and 30, 60% of whom had been out of work for at least 12 months. As the course progressed the proportion of long-term unemployed decreased so that in the final year of activity (1985-6) 47% had been unemployed for more than 1 year, 16% between 6 and 12 months and 37% less than 6 months. How did it come about? The Workers' University was started in 1970 as an expression of national and social solidarity by four Italian academics. They were influenced by the vigorous rethinking about education which took place in Italy in the 1960s and by a concern for the lot of Italian immigants and in particular the education of second generation immigrants. The initiative had the support of the Italian authorities, and when the vocational training project was started in 1983, two of the five salaries were paid by the Italian Ministry of Labour. Having identified the need for vocational training and guidance, those directing the project were able, through their contacts with organisations concerned with adult education, trade unions, training-for-employment agencies, with bodies working with other immigrant groups eg Spanish, to find firms and offices prepared to collaborate by providing work experience and training opportunities for the trainees. Even before the training scheme was started, the Workers' University had helped to launch a garage cooperative in 1979 followed by 3 others in printing, plumbing and Italian craft work, providing some 10 jobs in all. From 1985 the CASI-UO was formally given recognition as a training institution by the Belgian authorities, the Brussels City Council and the Italian government. Considerable attention was paid to working out a progressive educational plan: starting with a common core of subjects, moving through a phase of remedial education to a choice of training options in specific skills. The next stage depended on the success and capacity of the trainee and consisted of one of three possibilities; finding a job; more work experience/training; additional remedial studies. In each case the programme is made the subject of a contract between the trainee and CASI-UO. Organisation, structure and finance The vocational training and guidance scheme for the unemployed was set up within the framework of the Workers' ",
        "104 University which had already been operating for more than 12 years. The organisation of the training scheme reflected both its political and its educational background. Participation by the trainees and the development of a 'collective conscience' was encouraged along lines inspired by the teachings of Paulo Freire. At the same time individual counselling and support became necessary because of the particular personal and family situations of the trainees. The training scheme was set up in the first instance for one year only; but was then repeated. However, its future remained uncertain because of lack of long term funding. In addition to the contribution of the Italian Ministry of Employment, funding was obtained from ONEM, and the European Social Fund. However, there were considerable delays in the actual payments and because of the lack of finance the scheme was threatened with closure and eventually could only be operated on a reduced scale. In its peak year 1984-85 there were 11 persons in the teaching and administrative team. Issues, problems, potential The CASI-UO scheme has a restricted target group since it is concerned with those of Italian origin. In fact course members have also included a few immigrants from North Africa. Through its membership of a network of training, educational and socio-cultural bodies it has established links with parallel efforts among immigrant groups and the population at large. The need to respond to a wide range of educational backgrounds and potential among the trainees has posed difficult problems of educational method and content, which have added to the already complex issue of achieving a balance between basic education (provided through formal teaching methods,skill training and work experience), and the process of seeking and finding a job. This has meant that the modules of training have been re-worked and the course as a whole reorganised even during the first 3 years of its existence. Added to the problems of funding is the fact that the Workers' University has no money of its own and it, too, has been dependent on sources (Belgian, Italian and European) which have been uncertain and erratic. CASE STUDY: BEL 3 Name of project: Femmes 2000 Location: Charleroi. ",
        "105 Context Charleroi, 60 kilometres south west of Brussels is an old coal mining town with a population of 212,000. The crisis in the coal mining industry began in the 1950s and was followed by similar crises in the iron, steel and glass industries which had been established near the mines. All the mines have now closed and Charleroi has a lower than average birth rate and is suffering from depopulation. Employment prospects for women exist but are mainly in the limited services sector and require skills which are not widely held. Of the registered unemployed 54% of women and 48% of men have been one of out of work for 2 years or more. In the Charleroi sub-region over 7000 women were unemployed in 1985, of whom some 1700 were under the age of 25 and 4000 between 25 and 40. What does it do? A group of 15 women out of work for 2 years or more held a series of events in order to raise support for the opening of a centre. They held a women's week in June 1985, had a stall in the town centre, held a press conference and distributed leaflets; they also opened a temporary office. In 1986, with the support of ONEM, the group was accepted on a 9 months training course which was established when a local factory closed and its workers were made redundant. The on-going activities of the group include: providing information, canvassing, and printing a newsletter running a cafeteria and small workshop - management of its own affairs, keeping accounts public relations Who is it for? Femmes 2000 is a women's organisation created to meet the needs of women who have been out of work for a long time. They are drawn from different age groups (21-54) and nationalities; some have come from outside the Charleroi area and lack of finance has created problems for them to meet their travel costs. There has been some turnover in membership of the group because of these difficulties and because some of them have found jobs. Most of the women have low levels of skill and were interested in getting training both to improve their work capability and also to learn more about their rights and how to play a more active role in society. How did it come about? The group was started by a woman trade union organiser who had long wanted to establish a centre for promoting the cause ",
        "106 of women and combating discrimination at work. Following the activities inspired by International Women's Year she tried to implement her plan, but was not able to do so until 1982 when, as trade union training officer, she started a series of classes on women's rights. Femmes 2000 consisted of women from these classes. Organisation, structure and finance The founder and inspirer of the group having withdrawn, it now has an elected leader/coordinator, herself unemployed. The group has a core of founding members who are likely to stay, while newcomers tend to see the group more as a springboard from which they can better start their own projects. The group has great difficulty in finding financial support in Belgium. They were allocated a grant from the European Commission (for the promotion of sexual equality) but though they received the first instalment, the rest will be forfeited because they were unable to raise the matching amounts. They raised a small grant for educational work in one area from the Belgian authorities, but this was not sufficient to cover their basic costs such as the office rent and expenses. Some members do occasional work in restaurants and elsewhere to produce additional income. The acceptance of the members of the group on the ONEM training course represents the first major financial support, since not only will they improve their skills, but during the 9 months they will receive a tax free monthly income and travelling expenses. Issues, problems, potential Under the influence of a skilled and highly-motivated leader, a group of low-skilled working class women have established themselves within a society which as a whole does not accord high status to them. They have been able to survive despite the withdrawal of their founder and the slowness with which the authorities have responded to their demands for training. A first request in April 1985 for acceptance into government training and job creation schemes, which might have led to the creation of 22 jobs, appears to have been shelved, though it could have led to the establishment of a well staffed centre for womens' activities. However, the acceptance of the 15 women on the 9-month training course gave some reason for optimism, although it was not clear to what extent, after the training, the result would be a strengthening of the group and the establishment of the centre or merely the possibility that a number of the members would succeed in finding individual jobs. Even so Femmes 2000 is notable for being one of very few such initiatives in Belgium. *** ",
        "107 CASE STUDY: BEL 4 Name of project: Unemployment and Health Location: Brussels. Context A group of some 10 social workers, psychologists and sociologists, all members of the Association for Health Education and Primary Prevention in Mental Health met regularly from 1983 in Brussels to discuss issues and experience concerning psycho-sociological and human relations aspects of their work with the unemployed. Members of this group worked in a variety of institutions for the unemployed including ONEM, the local authority Social Services Centres and asociations such as CASI-UO. What does it do? A series of courses, each of 10 weekly 1 day sessions were held, each session concerned with a particular health topic and attended by a group of 10-12 persons. A technique of psycho-social group work was used in which the participants were encouraged to identify and discuss their feelings about themselves and their situation, to improve their self-esteem and to remove feelings of guilt at being unemployed. Who is it for? All the 50 or so who took part, aside from the professional leaders and therapists, were long-term unemployed. They were contacted by leaflets handed out at employment offices, advertisements in the press and on posters ; by information disseminated through existing training courses; and through the local authority unemployed centres run by the social services departments. More women took part than men; there was a broad age range with most in the middle age bracket. Participants came from a wide variety of backgrounds, from managerial to unskilled manual workers. How did it come about? No preliminary selection was made. An information meeting was held and participants who wanted to could register at the end of it. No financial contribution was required but they were expected to attend regularly and most did so. Organi sation, structure and finance The working party on Unemployment and Health was set up within the not-for-profit Association for Health Education and Primary Prevention in Mental Health, a professional body. ",
        "108 The pilot project was funded by the Belgian government through their temporary job creation programme, by which they provided salaries for 1 year for 2 group leaders and 1 secretary. The conditions of this grant to some extent determined who the participants were and how they were recruited. Issues, problems, potential An evaluation done on the last day of each course appears to have shown that a high proportion of the members of the groups found help from their participation either to find jobs, or to take up training, or to make significant decisions in their family or social lives. In other words the courses helped in the process of socialisation and in overcoming the psychological constraints of unemployment, especially those linked to ill-health. An extensive application of group therapy and group dynamics devised and run by qualified professionals appears to have had a positive impact in the re-integration of the participations. A first attempt to engage in a contract with each trainee was not pursued; the approach adopted was to get each trainee to see his or her re-integration as a personal project to be undertaken. The future of the project is in some doubt since the conditions for funding do not take account of the special health needs of participants. ",
        "109 CASE STUDY: FRG 1 Name of Project: Community Centres Location: Bremen. Context Unemployment figures in general peaked in the Federal Republic of Germany in 1985 with a total of 2.6 million or 10.6% of the working population. The 1986 figure for registered unemployed in Bremen was some 42,500 or 16.1% , the highest rate in the country where the national average figure had by then dropped to 10.4%. Bremen also had the highest level of public debt and the largest number of welfare recipients. The main traditional industries, shipbuilding, food and tobacco had all been hit by economic decline. Some of the 8 Community Centres which were already in existence as social and leisure-time centres both in the inner city and in its housing areas started to do something specific about the unemployed from 1983 onwards. What does it do? The traditional programme of community centres included the provision of leisure and cultural activities for children, young people and adults. Unemployed persons were welcome into these programmes without any distinction being made. Individual counselling is also available both as part of the existing services, but in some centres specialist staff have particular responsibilities towards the unemployed: these staff come from both statutory and voluntary bodies including trade unions, social services, tenants' associations and the like. Their work is supplemented by additional staff recruited to provide a range of individual and group support services for the unemployed, in particular women. Free or cheap meals are provided, special talks and discussions are organised and arrangements are made to introduce training opportunities. Some unemployed are given part-time work in the cafeterias. In the Oslebshaven Centre a waste recycling project has been started by a group of workers made redundant from the nearby shipyard and machine tool factory: jobs have been created and training in the new skills required (such as bookkeeping and management) is provided. In the Vegesack Centre two government-funded training schemes have been set up in cooking and dressmaking. Other activities carried on in one or more of the community centres include: production and house-to-house distribution of a newsletter making a video on the daily life of the unemployed participation in an information campaign among alternative, ecological and peace ",
        "110 movements providing a mobile information office for the unemployed which is stationed in market places, and outside labour and welfare offices etc. - provision of hobby workshops joining with members of local political parties and churches to work out a local action plan to eliminate or soften unemployment. Who is it for? Since the main aim is to integrate the activities for the unemployed with those run for and by all the members of the local community,it is difficult to give details of who is involved. It is probable that 200-300 unemployed people take part in community centre based activities, representing all age groups but with a slight majority of men. How did it come about? The first community centre in Bremen was founded in 1951 under the influence of the American occupation. It was linked to the left-wing 'Workers' Welfare' movement and influenced by the settlement movement started in the UK in the 1880s, based on which a pioneer effort had been launched in Hamburg in the pre-Hitler era. The first Bremen example was not followed up locally until the 1960s and the 1970s when other centres were set up, partly as an offshoot of the student activity of the time and partly in response to large- scale slum clearance and rehousing programmes. The initiatives came from groups of concerned citizens and were supported by the Social-Democratic controlled party which dominated politics in Bremen. Some of the centres were housed in custom-built premises provided by the authorities; three which used converted existing buildings remained rather more under the influence of local residents' action groups. The City Council provided a budget for the centres as from 1976 and although they were at first uncertain about them as being 'leftist centres of agitation', in 1985 the opposition party (Christian Democrats) decided to support the centres, proposing their privatisation and commercialisation. Social Democrat politicians and the Committee for Social Affairs, Youth and Sport encouraged the centres to provide facilities for the unemployed and additional workers were provided under official 'job creation' schemes as from 1983. Organisations, structure, and finance One of the centres is sponsored by the Workers' Welfare Association; the other seven are independent voluntary organisations with their board members drawn from prominent local people, including politicians, from each area. The eight centres have established a joint \"umbrella\" association ",
        "111 which undertakes: financial administration for each centre; recruitment and training of staff; publicity; liaison with the authorities and other bodies. The board and staff of each centre are mainly responsible for the management, but some of the centres have 'user' or programme committees in which unemployed people participate like any other user. Between them the eight centres have some 150 paid staff, including instructors, administrative, cleaning and service staff. Half of them are funded through various training and job creation schemes for a maximum period of 1 or 2 years; this applies in particular to staff working in the services for the unemployed. In 1985 apart from the workers and schemes funded from these 'external' sources , the Centres had a total income of DM 4.66 million (approx \u00a31.5 million) of which more than 75% was provided by Bremen City Council, the balance being generated from activities, hiring out of rooms, canteen profits etc. Lotteries also provide an additional source. Capital schemes, such as building and conversion of premises are mainly funded by the City with some grant aid from government urban renewal schemes. Issues, problems, potential The integration of the unemployed with the employed users of the centres is a key objective; however, as the number of unemployed increases, there is pressure on space and a tendency to find separate premises for them. This contradiction is unresolved. The centres in general are closely linked into several different networks of organisations working in the social, cultural and recreational fields as well as with bodies whose main concern is with unemployment. As noted, the centres have a strong political sponsorship through the Social Democrat party, which controls the city government. However, the city is suffering from having accumulated a load of debt and has to make cuts, not least in the social services. There is therefore increasing pressure on the centres to provide additional \"stop gap\" provision especially for the disadvantaged and unemployed. This is being resisted by the centres, which argue that they wish to continue to serve their neighbourhoods as a whole and to cater for the needs of all sectors of the population. Since much of the work for the unemployed is funded under short-term 'job creation' schemes, it tends to suffer from the inevitably short-term nature of the funding of the ",
        "112 programmes, which has consequences for the employment of staff. The workers recruited under these schemes are of variable quality and there is rarely enough time for adequate in-service training , which is particularly needed for those involved in counselling and social group work. The work with the unemployed has only been started comparatively recently within the community centres which have a longer history and tradition. There is therefore a danger that it is regarded and treated as 'marginal' to the mainstream of activities, and this in turn could isolate the unemployed. This danger is increased by the short-term basis on which the staff work and by the fact that the unemployed participants themselves may fluctuate in their attendance as training and job opportunities arise. CASE STUDY: FRG 2 Name of project: Job Initiatives Location: Papenburg Context Papenburg is a town (population 30,000) in the District of Emsland in Lower Saxony. It is part of the low-lying fenland area and was originally built in the 17th century on reclaimed land. In 1986 the rate of unemployment in the district of which it is part was 26.9% as compared with 13.8% for Lower Saxony and 10.4% for the Federal Republic as a whole. The Job Initiatives started in 1980/81 with the reconstruction of a number of typical old houses. What does it do? The initiative brings together the resources available from several funding sources so as to promote jobs and training for those who are unemployed. They are employed on the reconstruction of buildings so as to turn the whole of a district into an open-air section of the Fens Museum. They do only basic work so as not to compete with existing skilled craftsmen in the area. Who is it for? By agreement with local trade unions and employers, only those who have special difficulty in finding work are employed on the scheme. It is aimed in particular at the older unemployed (50+) and young workers entering the labour market. 60 persons are involved of whom 36 are over 50 and 24 are young. More applications were received than can be accepted. ",
        "113 How did it come about? The project was started and pushed through by the Mayor and Chief Executive of the City: it was sponsored by the Papenborger Hus Association of which the Mayor and Chief Executive are, respectively. Chairman and Vice-Chairman. After the first four houses had been rebuilt in 1981, the workers urged the association to find other employmnent for them. This was done by expanding the scheme so as to cover a whole district. This is able to provide enough employment for the next ten years. Under dynamic leadership the scheme has been identified as a model to be followed by other cities in Germany. The Christian Democrat Party, which is in the majority locally, (and of which the Mayor is a member) has supported the scheme and has assisted in gaining financial and other backing at national level. Organisation, structure and finance The Papenborger Hus Assocation has a membership of 130, from all social classes: the management committee is made up of the chairman (the Mayor) the vice chairman (the chief executive) the treasurer (a bank official) and two school principals. Most of the work is done by the chairman and vice-chairmen. The mayor is also the chairman of the Historical and Ecological Training Centres Association which is responsible for the training. The City Council is the sponsor and major employer for the jobs established under the official job creation programmes. In future both the Papenborger Hus Association and the City will hand over their management responsibilities to a new body to be called the Association for the Development of, and Training for, Job Opportunities in Papenburg. Financing in the main is shared between the city, the district and the Land (state). The city has provided DM 514,000 (approx. \u00a3172,000): the district DM910,000 (\u00a3303,000) and the Land of Lower Saxony DM 1,004,000 (\u00a3334,300). 48 of those engaged on the scheme are on one-year contracts under the federal government job creation scheme. A further 12, also on one-year contracts, are paid for by the district, since they are eligible for social assistance. 21 young people are being trained as office workers and juniors are paid for by Lower Saxony or under the federal Ministry of Education and Science's programme for the training of the disadvantaged. Other costs such as those of materials for building are shared between the federal government, the land of Lower ",
        "114 Saxony and the district and the city. Issues, problems, potential The key principle of the scheme is that counselling, guidance and training are not enough by themselves: what is needed is employment, preferably of a kind which is personally satisfying and socially useful - and seen to be so. If this can be provided then it is felt that social workers and advisers are not needed. It has been possible to involve a number of other organisations, including a youth detention centre, the adult education institute, the local guild of craftsmen, ecological and conservation bodies as well as the Universities of Essen and Muenster. The short-term nature of the financing under the federal job creation scheme has created difficulties about the continuity of employment and the general stability of the scheme: pressure is being put on the federal government to change existing regulations. As their one-year period ends, those on the scheme who have not found jobs sometimes experience depression and the recurrence of other personal problems, such as alcoholism. This should be lessened as the development of job-related training is carried through and as the area of Papenburg begins to experience an upswing economically, especially as tourism increases as a result of the initiative itself.

        "115 CASE STUDY: FRG 3 Name of project: Centre and Workshops for the Unemployed Location: Recklinghausen. Context Recklinghausen, a district of 628,000 people of whom 118,000 live in the town itself, is in North-Rhine-Westphalia in the north west of the Ruhr, the traditional centre of the German coal and steel industry. Between 1980 and 1983 alone the number in employment in dropped by over 10%: in 1986 the unemployment rate in Recklinghausen was 14.6% as compared with 10.4% for the Federal Republic as a whole. The project has two parts: a centre which is in a workers' residential area; and three workshops, of which one is in a residential area and the other two on the edge of the town and of an industrial area. What does it do? The centre provides a meeting place with a cafe open every weekday. There is an advice service covering housing, budgeting, social and personal questions. A hobby workshop contains facilities for bicycle maintenance and small-scale carpentry. Recreational activities include sewing, photography, jewellery-making, sport and social groups for children and youths. A group of unemployed teachers meets weekly at the centre. An information campaign is conducted through sending articles to the press and setting up a stand at markets, festivals, and other functions. Visits are paid to schools and to church groups, The centre also involves itself in trade union activities. The workshops provide jobs in the following areas: repair and refurbishing of furniture and household goods ; repair and refurbishing of clothing; - odd jobs: repair and renovations to church and old buildings; gardening; - transport services; manufacture of woooden toys; - waste materials collection. Counselling services are being introduced: a special debts adviser ensures that by the end of their one-year period in the workshop most participants are almost free of debt. ",
        "116 Who is it for? The centre has about 20-40 visitors a day. The regular users are mainly between 30 and 60 years old and one-third are women. The young unemployed tend to go elsewhere. The workshop employs 112 people of whom one third are women. 80% are under the age of 36. Over 60% were unemployed for more than a year. Over half have had some kind of previous vocational training. 20% are handicapped and a number have drug, alcohol or other psychosocial problems. The unemployed are referred to the workshops mainly by the labour exchange and the social welfare office, with only a few coming from the centre itself or from other referrals. How did it come about ? As part of the general aim of the Evangelical (Lutheran) Church in North-Rhine/Westphalia to take a more active line with regard to unemployment and the 'new poverty', the rector of Recklinghausen started a weekly meeting for the unemployed in 1983 in the parish hall. The group grew rapidly and many ideas for future activities were discussed. A publicity campaign began in 1984 and this led to the local authority providing a building with 180 sq. metres of space for 3 years and two staff members being provided under the government's job creation scheme. The idea of the total project (centre and workshops) was worked out by a church worker (who became the manager of the workshop project) and a social scientist working for the an independent welfare body linked to the Church. The workshop premises were provided by the local authorities who also bear the cost of heating and power. The workshops have reached their capacity insofar as numbers are concerned. Organisation, structure and finance The Centre is sponsored by the Recklinghausen Evangelical Church, three workshops by the Parish Welfare Organisation and a fourth one at Marl is a limited company of which both the Parish Welfare Organisation and the local authority in Marl are members. The centre holds a weekly assembly in which all users, visitors, and full-time voluntary helpers may take part and vote. It discusses programme activities and day-to-day matters. An executive committee made up of two church members, volunteer assistants, one full-time helper and two representatives elected from the assembly is responsible for administration. The workshops have a project manager who works under the Parish Welfare Organisation. Each workshop holds weekly ",
        "117 meetings and elects a staff representative on to a works' council. All employees take part in a monthly assembly. There is also an advisory board made up of influential institutions in the district (chamber of commerce, trade unions, labour exchange, social services officers, etc). The centre has 2 full-time staff members: a teacher and a craft instructor, The workshop leaders are graduates in social science, business and education: group leaders are instructors with technical qualifications. Issues, problems, potential While the two projects (the centre and the workshops) are seen as complementary parts of one endeavour by the Church to fulfil its responsiblity to the unemployed, they are in fact quite different. The centre is designed to help the unemployed to come to terms with their situation, now and possibly for the foreseeable future. The workshops aim to provide jobs and thus an income for at least a period and possibly to help those in the workshops to regain self-confidence and perhaps to acquire new skills so that they may be able to re-enter the labour market. To this end plans are being made to increase and extend the availability of training. At the same time the products of the workshops are themselves a valuable additional asset for the whole community (in the case of the recycling activity) and to the poorer and more disadvantaged (insofar as the refurbished furniture, equipment and clothing is concerned). As in the other case studies, the temporary nature of the schemes constitutes a constant source of anxiety both for trainees and the staff, all of whom experience uncertainty about their future. Another difference between the centre and the workshops is that the latter were created by the Parish Welfare Organisation which still, in effect, maintains control over their management. The centre on the other hand came into being as a result of the discussions in, and the pressure exerted by, the first discussion group of unemployed people. The centre, perhaps as a consequence of this, but also because of the nature of its activities, has a more participatory or democratic style of management. However, it is significant that the centre's users have changed over time: the founder group contained a large element of unemployed academics and white-collar workers. Subsequently the general level of qualification has declined and so too has the possibility of their finding re-employment\u00b7 The centre users therefore mainly come from those who are seen and see themselves as having less chance of getting back into the labour market. The workshop employees see themselves as employees and therefore at least for the time being, as no longer unemployed. There is therefore a tendency for the distance between the two projects to grow and this tendency is increased by the fact that each scheme has its own ",
        "118 sponsoring body and that the two, though both within the Evangelical Church, do not cooperate as closely as might be expected. Relations with other bodies vary and there is a tendency for church and non-church projects for the unemployed to have only occasional contacts and exchanges of experience. The local authority, trade unions and political parties have taken little notice of the centre: their attitudes to the workshops have been one of caution, with fears expressed of possible unfair competition, and job displacement occuring because of the workshops, which are publicly subsidised. Nonetheless financing for the future seems assured both from church and public funds. CASE STUDY: FRG 4 Name of project: Osloer Street Factory Location: Berlin Context Berlin is in a unique situation being an 'island', part of a major city, still nominally under foreign military government isolated within the German Democratic Republic and yet having its own city government as part of the Federal Republic of Germany. Between 1975 and 1986 the unemployment rate rose from 3.7% to 11%, at which point it was slightly above the 10.4% rate for the Federal Republic as a whole. The Osloer Street Factory is a complex of factory, business and office buildings in which a variety of different types of initiatives, all of a social, educational or employment nature, have come together. Although threatened with the loss of the premises, the groups were able to retain its use, in part because of strong political reaction to incidents involving the occupation by squatters of numerous buildings in 1980/1, which in turn led to severe police reaction and subsequently to a series of negotiations and offers to legalise the use of occupied buildings. Osloer Street is in an old working class area of the city which has lost most of its economic activity. It has a high proportion of old people, single-person households, large families and in particular large immigrant families,many of them Turkish. The factory premises have 6000 square metres of usable space and 3,500 square metres of land around them. What does it do? Because of the diversity of activities, it is simpler to consider these group by group: ",
        "119 the German Scout Association occupies one floor of the building in which there is: * a youth hostel, with arrangements for self- catering * a youth residential unit provided as an alternative to institutional care for young people in need of care * a residential community of those working in the youth unit * a hobby workshop for woodwork The Breakthrough Project has a training workshop in which disadvantaged and unemployed young people, both German and foreign, are trained as plumbers and fitters. As work experience the trainees do plumbing and fitting both in the Osloer Street Factory and for clients outside. The Citizens Initiative Putte Project provides facilities for Turks, Arabs and Germans comprising: * a pre-school group for children * a school shop * a youth centre for young Turks * a womens' group for Turkish and Arab women * a similar girls' group * an advice and counselling centre for Turkish residents in the area. The Residential Workshop provides accomodation for a group of young people in need of social care and guidance and training facilities in fitting. The Communal Workgroup consists of a number of small commercial businesses including a printing shop and a car- repair workshop: a recycling business is planned. The Osloer Street Factory Association carries out the overall administration and the development of the building. It also provides: a meeting place with a cafe social and cultural activities for local residents especially for Turkish residents There are plans for a youth training scheme in the entertainment field and the conversion of part of the factory complex for use for cultural functions. Who is it for:? It is estimated that some 200 young people and adults use the cultural and leisure activities and the counselling services In addition there are: ",
        "120 34 adult employees (full time, part time and volunteers) 15 adults living in the residential units and working partly as volunteers - some 30 young people in the various training workshops, most of them living in the complex: six of them are in care under the Youth Welfare Act 16 pre-school children in the Putte project Some 35-40 young people using the overnight hostel facilities. The young people are German and Turkish, mainly in the 14-20 age group, with very low levels of educational or vocational qualification. Many come from problem and underprivileged families. The general social facilities are open to all residents of the area. For the most part not many older people come. How did it come about? The initiative was taken in 1970 by the German Scout Association (GSA) which adopted a policy of providing small residential communities of adults and young people living together in order to provide an alternative to institutional treatment of children and young people receiving special care and guidance. By 1977 35 residential youth communities had come into existence in Berlin with the support of Department for Family, Youth and Sport. GSA got permission to use the building in 1978 and the authorities financed the removal of debris and the reconnection of the electricity and water supply. Initially they refused further funding. At the end of 1978 ten adults, with an average age of 30, moved in with the idea of living as a community, undertaking the necessary repairs and eventually passing on their skills to young people. In the summer of 1979 the first seven young people came in and joined in the work to refurbish their own accomodation. The original plan for 4 residential groups for some 20 young people with the adults working mainly as volunteers had to be revised. A second group was started in 1981 and at the same time 2 full-time paid helpers were added. In 1979 the Putte Project moved in to convert one floor for work with foreign young people. Sponsored by Young Socialists this group had started in 1972 with an adventure playground and a school shop. This was part of a Citizen's Initiative to stop the domestic demolition being done by the City Planning Department. However, the Putte Group's own building was finally taken for demolition in 1974 and from then on it used temporary premises, changing frequently. Once in Osloer Street, the programmes grew to include a counselling centre and various forms of group work for the Turkish immigrants. ",
        "121 Together GSA and Putte began to use the government temporary job creation programmes to take on staff (architects and teachers) in order to start up vocational and training projects for young people. This led to the Breakthrough Project to train 12 young people with no secondary education qualifications in fitting and plumbing. In 1981 another group of young people who were evicted from their \"squat\", where they had also tried to set up their own educational project, were accepted into the building and became the Residential Workshop. Permission to occupy the building was only granted for a limited period which ran out in 1983. Complex negotiations resulted in an agreement between the City's Department of Construction and Housing, a large redevelopment organisation (linked to the Workers' Welfare Organisation) which was engaged in large-scale construction projects, and the Osloer Street Factory Association, which was established to take overall responsibility for refurbishing the building complex and coordinating activities within it. Arrangements were made so that the agreement, which was negotiated through the Social Democrat-controlled city government would be accepted and carried on by the Christian Democrat party which had just succeeded in getting control of the Senate (City Council). The greater stability and certainty about the future was accompanied by a trend to change from largely voluntary staff to paid workers, generally financed through the government's job creation scheme. It also became clear that the higher standards of work needed in the actual construction work in the building were too great to be left to young trainees to do as work experience. It was therefore taken over by full- time job creation workers, some voluntary help, some outside contractors and the Breakthrough trainees. Organisation, structure and finance As might be expected of such a composite project, the funding and management structure is extremely complex. Each project has its own system of organisation, with emphasis being put on self-management and equal participation in the youth residential schemes. There are usually weekly or monthly meetings of all participants, whether adult or young, to decide on day-to-day issues. The full-time professionals include teachers, social workers, tradesmen and administrators, according to the requirements of each project. For the overall body, the Osloer Street Factory Association, membership is open to all who live in or use the building, irrespective of their age or status. They constitute a Members' Assembly which meets regularly: authority to run the whole affair is delegated to the Factory Council which is the Board of Directors and is made up of one representative from ",
        "122 each of the sub-projects. This, however, has a smaller executive committee all of whom are full-time staff. There are also technical sub-committees such as the one in charge of the building work. The financial structure is also complex. The total cost of converting the building, and, allowing for the proposed cultural centre, is approximately DM 5 million of which DM 3 million had been expended by February 1986. 85% of this came from the Land(State) of Berlin. 15% of this was represented by 'sweat' equity - the more than 55,000 working hours put in by the members. The costs of the generally shared community activities (DM 95,000) are met by grant from the Health and Social Affairs Department of the city; other income is derived from renting accommodation. The GSA Scouts project receives a grant from the Youth and Family Department of the city, supplemented by the District Youth Welfare Offices. The youth hostel was started with a loan from the GSA national office but is planned to become a source of income. Breakthrough gets funds from the Youth and Family Department, as does the Putte Project. The Residential Workshop is financed up to 60% from a special job creation scheme established jointly by the Federal Labour Department and the City. A further 27% of its budget comes from the City Department for Environmental Protection and Urban Development and 13% from fees, subscriptions and donations. Issues, problems, potential The project is of interest both because it provides residential facilities and, indeed, regards them as an integral part of its methods, providing a more stable atmosphere and training for young people whose chances of success in the labour market are very small. By combining a number of organisations and initiatives it is able to provide a wide range of activities with diverse objectives and approaches, both in the field of employment and training and of socio-cultural activities. This means that users of one set of facilities find it possible to use others and to experiment with pursuits which they would otherwise not have known about. At the same time all the groups in the building are part of a neighbourhood facility, providing services and opportunities for the population at large in an area of disadvantage. ",
        "123 CASE STUDY: IRL 1 Name of project: Candle Community Trust Location: Ballyfermot, Dublin. Context The project is based in a district of Dublin which is characterised by having higher levels than most other areas of the city in: the unemployment rate (17.7% in 1981 as compared with a national average of 10%; the rate is estimated to have risen subsequently to 35%) the size of households the proportion of population in the age range 10- 19 years labour force participation: relatively low numbers of young people continue in education after the age of 15 - the proportion of those engaged in manual occupations (very few work in professional and technical jobs). What does it do? The services provided include a \"drop-in\" day centre which has facilities for taking a shower and having a cup of tea. There are counselling services; social and cultural activities; literary and craft programmes; specialist drug counselling; and organised excursions and sporting events. Arising from the \"drop-in\" activities, work-related 'part- time' training is provided, mainly to develop social skills, good time keeping and willingness to seek employment. There is also a 'Community Training Workshop' which provides more structured training in woodwork and welding, including one day a week of general and technical education in a classroom setting. For those who complete the training, assistance is given to move on to further technical training or opportunities for self-employment. Who is it for? The scheme is confined to young males of whom: 60% are aged 16-20; ",
        "124 25% are aged 20-25; 15% are over 25. 50 were attending at the time of the study and some 400 have gone through the scheme. The vast majority have criminal records and many have been in prison. Most have literacy or numeracy problems. Some have a drug problem. In general they ar regarded as developmentally retarded from a psychological viewpoint and have low self-esteem. Some are school drop-outs, often at a very early age. How did it come about? The project started through the initiative of a nun who in 1978 was teaching in a girls school but also concerned herself with the 'problem' element of young men. She started informal meetings in the convent parlour, but this was soon transferred elsewhere. The work was, however, carried on thanks to a local business man providing a flat for meetings. Following lobbying and fundraising, a company with charitable status was set up and central premises obtained. In 1983 the workshop facilities were added. The scheme thus began with concern about the problems of young offenders and ex-offenders but has increasingly (although not exclusively) become focussed on employment issues. Organisation, structure and finance Candle Community Trust in run by a 12 member Board and a 5 mem ber Management Committee. The committee, which has responsibility for the day-to-day running of activities, is made up of the full-time director, a representative from the Department of Justice, the Probation and the Welfare Services and one of the first volunteer leaders. The staff is made up of full-time and part-time staff, some 15 in number, and 25 volunteer helpers. The core staff have their salaries paid by the Department of Justice(3) and the local Vocational Education Committee(1). The Director, a woman with great experience in education and youth work, is made available by her convent. The expenditure for the year 1985 amounted to I\u00a390,600. Funding came from a variety of sources; the largest being the Department of Justice: funds for the workshop facilities and training programme are provided by AnCo, a government training agency, including allowances to the trainees. Three of the staff are employed and paid for under a government short-term employment scheme. Other agencies have also contributed, including the Youth Employment Agency and the Dublin Youth Service Council: some income is generated from the sale of furniture made in the workshops and by private fund raising. ",
        "125 Issues, problems, potential The origins of the Candle project come from a personal effort to meet the immediate needs of young men who were among the most socially backward of the population. It was often a need for primary relief: shelter, food, a wash and contact with a sympathetic person. Over the years this work has not been lost sight of, but on to it has been added preparation and training for employment. Young offenders and young people at risk may be referred by the prison or probation service or may simply \"drop in\" to the centre and then progress to the training workshops. The attitude of local people in general to the centre is mixed. For some it has a stigma and they make no use of it and may even be hostile to having it in their neighbourhood. However, for many its services are seen as helpful and positive: the number of applications to join has increased and not all of them are from offenders. There is pressure to start similar schemes for young women, and also to provide some kind of after-care and follow-up service. CASE STUDY: IRL 2 Name of project: Tosach Training and Development Location: Dublin. Context The scheme is housed, not altogether adequately, in a converted old school building in a somewhat decayed inner city area of Dublin near the docks. The area has high levels of unemployment, low levels of income and educational attainment and high levels of crime and drug abuse. What does it do? Tosach is a training scheme and provides training in hairdressing, light engineering and office skills. There is also a women's sewing cooperative. Courses are run in personal and cooperative development; counselling is provided on vocational matters finances and health (both physical and mental). There are classes in literacy and numeracy and a range of social and cultural activities. Trainees completing the courses are assisted to self-employment and a club is held once a week to maintain contact with ex-trainees. Holidays abroad are organised. Staff members are active in educational, social and political campaigns. Who is it for? The project is aimed at the young long-term unemployed of both sexes. They often suffer from multiple social ",
        "126 deprivation ane cannot reach the standards required to gain entry to courses in the formal training system. Of the 36 workshop trainees the majority (22) are female, possibly reflecting Tosach's origins as a women's activity. 31 are aged under 20 and 5 between 20 and 24; all are unmarried. The demand for places is such that 7 to 8 times more young people apply than can be accepted even though there are 2 other community training workshops in the locality in addition to mainstream government-run courses. The sewing cooperative has 10 members aged between 30 and 45. Many of them had been unemployed for more than 2 years before it was started, following a personal development course run at the end of 1982. How did it come about? In 1980 a locally-based committee which had helped to start courses for women in personal development and return to work, studied the problems arising from the failure of local young people to take advantage of the formal vocational training opportunities available to them. They identified a need to start some kind of locally-based and organised pre-vocational training. Their work with women developed so that a cooperative was set up and a Community Information Centre was run in 1982. This in turn generated more interest and Tosach organised more training courses for women leading to the formation of the Women's Inner City Alliance and the start of the sewing cooperative. This then led to a training course in cooperative development in the clothing industry. All this experience suggested the need for a more long-term and planned scheme and this became a reality when premises (previously used by the government training agency) became available in July 1982. The Tosach Training and Development Company was set up as a non-profit making company, to manage and promote community based training workshops. At this time political interest was growing in the problems of the inner city areas. A candidate who stood on behalf of the local community was elected to the Dail (Parliament) and subequently it became easier to obtain funding for community based projects like Tosach. Thus the training courses were supported by AnCo, the government training agency. Organisation, structure and finance Tosach has a management committee, on which there are local representatives, a member of Parliament and representatives of the staff. The project manager is in charge of activities and acts as liaison between the management committee and ",
        "127 AnCo: he has been with the scheme since it started. The administrative secretary who has worked for the project for 4 years was formerly one of the trainees. There are 3 qualified training instructors, one for each of office procedures, hairdressing and light engineering. The main funding, which originally was shared between the Inner City Fund of the Department of the Enviroment and AnCo now comes wholly from AnCo whose grant includes allowances for trainees. A part-time literacy teacher is funded by the Dublin Vocational Education Committee. Some equipment is provided by the City Corporation and by private businesses. Support for the sewing cooperative is forthcoming from the Catholic Social Services Conference. Issues, problems, potential Tosach has developed from being a local initiative to assist in the personal development of women, who were seen as the 'hidden unemployed' of the district, into a locally administered centrally-funded, community-based training scheme for the young unemployed of both sexes. The element of community development is maintained by the adoption of a philosophy of training open to anyone locally who expresses interest in it, rather than training determined by the demands of particular industries. There is considerable emphasis on the creation of an environment in which people can increase their feeling of self-worth and their ability to take control of their own lives. CASE STUDY: IRL 3 Name of project: Greater Blanchardstown Development Project Location: Blanchardstown and surrounding area, Dublin, Context The project operates in an area which covers a number of villages and six rapidly developing housing areas on the periphery of Dublin. The area is one of planned housing development with some 55,000 people, a figure which is due to be doubled over the next 20 years. Some of the housing estates are of privately owned houses, in others there is a mixture of privately owned and municipal (rented) housing. There is a tendency for the more successful families to move into the \"better\", privately-owned aeas, thus leaving behind ghettos of rented housing. One of the areas has been designated as a CODAN (County of Dublin Area of Need). Employment prospects in the area are very limited and unemployment rates among male heads of households go as high as 60% or 80% in some parts of the area. Morever, the area is ",
        "128 isolated and a long way from where people were previously employed. This leads to so-called \"voluntary\" unemployment, when people decide not to work because of the factors of low pay, the cost of travel and the many hours that have to be spent on travel to and from work. Typical of many peripheral and uncompleted housing schemes, there is a great local lack of social and recreational facilities. The isolation is heightened because of the distance between new residents and their older established communities where they had kinship and friendship networks. What does it do? The project provides development and leadership courses, mainly for women. These are run by the staff of the project, usually in schoolrooms near to where the participants live. Out of these courses have emerged a series of other activities : mothers' \"drop-in\" morning; - swap shops ; groups for single parents; development of a services cooperative ; training for parents and for youth leadership; - mothers and toddlers group; community play group; organisation of an Easter Parade; organisation of tenants' associations; Other activities which have arisen locally as a result of the project include: a fruit and vegetable market; - a sewing cooperative; \"clean-up\" campaigns; street parties; - compiling a directory of local services. Who is it for? The project was originally aimed at women who had difficulty in coping with the effects of long-term unemployment on their family situation - for example, young mothers whose husbands were long-term unemployed. The scope has been somewhat broadened as time has passed and there are now both men and women on the leadership courses, the men being both those who are themselves long-term unemployed and those who have unemployed spouses. Most of them are aged between 25 and 45 and have low levels of educational attainment. How did it come about ? The project was started, initially for a 2-year pilot period, in 1984 by two nuns, one a former public health nurse and the other having experience of community work and pre-school ",
        "129 groups. They both worked on a \"freelance\" basis in housing development areas and began to make contacts through the staff of the health and social services as well as through the priests and parish workers. In this way they contacted community groups and local residents. Having identified the problem of women at great risk because of the impact of unemployment and their lack of personal, financial and other resources, they gradually developed a strategy of providing courses to give women - and in one case unemployed men - confidence and the ability to cope with their problems. These developed into the leadership courses and a variety of spin off activities. Organisation, structure and finance The main costs, some \u00a3117,000 pa are provided by the Catholic Social Services Conference, which in turn recoups 50% of its annual \u00a3112,000 contribution from the local Health Board. Other financial help comes from the Department of Labour, which provides the costs of a secretary, and smaller amounts are received from other statutory bodies, voluntary organisations, and individuals. The staff are relatively autonomous, reporting to the CSSC and the Health Board. They have enlisted the support of local parish workers and also ex-participants of the earlier courses. Ex-participants are in the main responsible for most of the follow-up activities. Issues, problems, potential This project is concerned with the impact of long-term unemployment on the families of the unemployed. It is tackling social phenomena which are the result of policies of relocating people from inner city communities in comparatively low-density yet isolated peripheral housing areas and which, even in periods of higher employment, have been seen to lead to personal and family breakdown. The courses that have concentrated on women have in general reinforced their role as home-makers and carers and leaders in their home neighbourhoods rather than as job-seekers and potential breadwinners. The follow-up groups and activities have tended to be much more participative in style and led by local women. The involvement of men in some courses has arisen through local demand but does not yet appear to be a major part of the project. ",
        "130 CASE STUDY: IRL 4 Name of project: Leadership and Community Development Project Location: Ballymun, Dublin Context Ballymun is local authority housing estate with a population of over 30,000 in the north of Dublin. Most of the people are housed in blocks of flats. The estate has the reputation of being the single most disadvantaged area in the county. There is a transient population, numbers of single parent families and a high level of alcoholism, drug-taking, petty crime and vandalism. What does it do? This is one of many local initiatives which have arisen in the area, which has been prolific in giving birth to voluntary organisations and community groups. This particular project was 'time-limited', being a training course lasting six months. It gave rise, however, to a number of initiatives, in particular the establishment of a resource centre. 20 long term unemployed residents in the area,each having a track record of having worked as volunteers in local community groups, were accepted on the six months training course which ran from September 1984 to March 1985. The course ethos was participatory, action- orientated, and based on experiential learning. It involved both individual and small group work, field trips and on-the- job practice in local organisations. Out of the course have come a series of practical results: course participants working through a local forum, the Ballymun Community Coalition, have contributed to the establishement of the 'Job Centre', a local job creation scheme; a women's writers group has been established; a tentants' association has been created; - a campaign against the withdrawal of a major bank from the area was initiated; the SUSS Resource Centre was established in which 5 course members are now directly involved as staff members. The resource centre provides: services for local community groups; a newsletter; an information and research team,compiling a report on the local housing situation; a social welfare information service; ",
        "131 a home-school Links scheme; a literacy programme (it is estimated that 20% of the local population have literacy problems). In addition a cooperative bakery has been started and a Youth Initiative Project launched. Who is it for These involved are both men and women in the 16-40 age range, mainly unmarried with low educational qualifications and previously unemployed for an average of 18 months. How did it come about? A local home-help organiser, a woman, struck by the lack of provision for long-term unemployed men, organised a 3-day seminar for them in 1983 on the theme \"Exploring Unemployment\". 10 men took part. This gave rise to the need for further training to enable them to develop community projects and to secure employment. After 18 months of negotiation, the six months course was approved for funding by AnCo, the government training organisation. It was open to both men and women. 20 took part, all long-term unemployed. Only one of them had taken part in the original seminar. Those on the course subsequently played leading roles in establishing the activities listed above, often working thorugh existing community organisations. Organisation, structure and finance The funds provided by AnCo which included allowances for participants and a 'capitation' grant of \u00a354 per trainee/week. This provided some I\u00a326,000. The SUSS Resource Centre was financed under the Department of Labour's temporary job creation programme for young people. This provided some I\u00a360,000 in the first year of operation. The course was run by the original initiator who was a member of a religious order, and she had two trainers to assist her. Both the trainers were experienced teachers, one with special skills in the area of conflict resolution. Other specialists, such as a drugs counsellor, and other social workers contributed to the course content. Issues, problems, potential While the organisation of the original course was a \"top down\" process, it led to a considerable strengthening and expansion of the \"bottom up\" activities engendered by the course participants. The initiator had difficulty in achieving credibility in her original application for ",
        "132 funding, but this was resolved by working through her religious order. The funding body made changes in the original proposal, to include women as well as men and to intensify the course by making it full-time over 6 months. The initiator in retrospect would still have preferred to run it part-time over a longer period. Some difficulties arise because of the level of the trainee allowances, and more because of the lack of funding to enable them to carry through their initiatives after the course period itself was concluded. Despite this much was achieved, and this may in part be due to the fact that one of the main criteria in selecting trainees was their previous involvement in local community groups. ",
        "133 CASE STUDY: ITA 1 Name of project: Centro per il Lavoro ('The Work Centre') Location: Milan, Italy Context : The Work Centre was established in 1985 to provide information and advice to the unemployed. It is sponsored by three agencies: the Milan branch of the Italian Confederation of Workers' Trade Unions (CISL) the second largest trade union body in Italy; the Milan branch of the Italian Christian Workers' Association (ACLI), a Catholic organisation; and the Ambrosian Social Centre (CSA) a local educational and cultural centre linked to the diocese of Milan. Milan is the provincial and regional capital of Lombardy, in the industrial north of Italy, and is the leader among Italian regions for industry, commerce banking and international trade. The official unemployment rate in the Province of Milan rose from 5.2% in 1980 to 8.2% in 1984 but to this should be added another 1.6% (ie giving a total of 9.8%) because of registered \"disguised\" unemployment (ie those whose earnings are officially subsidised during what is officially counted as \"temporary redundancy\" but which is almost certainly going to be permanent). What does it do? The primary activity of the Centre is to provide information on work and training, with regard to both the public and private sectors: it also provides information on how to enter seIf-employment through co-operatives. The counselling provided to those who come to the centre also covers educational, family and personal problems, so the centre is also providing psychological support and counselling, as well as referring people to other agencies, not only about jobs but also about finance and accommodation problems. A monthly bulletin is produced. Occasional evening discussion courses are organised on job seeking, cooperatives and self-employment. Most of the activities are orientated towards individuals and their search for work, but the centre has helped to counsel immigrant families seeking both accommodation and employment. While not a political pressure group, the Centre also ",
        "134 provides public information about the situation of the unemployed. Who is it for? During the six months to March 1986 the centre had 1650 visitors of whom one-third were seeking specific items of information and gave no details of their background. Among the other 1000+ people, theaie were slightly more men (55%) than women. 87% of the women were between the ages of 15 and 29 as compared with 66% of the men; more than half the women were under 21, as compared with one-third of the men. The general educational level was such that 54% had completed lower secondary education, some with additional vocational courses, and 37% upper secondary, some with further specialist courses. Half of the visitors had no work experience or only occasional and temporary jobs. How did it come about? Early in 1985 the local branches of three largest trade unions in Italy held meetings in Milan with a view to taking joint action to tackle employment problems. CISL made a proposal to establish a joint agency but no agreement could be reached with the other two bodies. CISL, however, went ahead with new partners ACLI and CSA. The centre was established with two full-time staff members. Organisation, structure and finance The centre has no separate legal existence of its own but is a serice jointly provided by the 3 sponsors. They also share the costs as follows: CISL - Lire 20 million (\u00a310,000) to cover the costs of one of its own staff and overheads. ALCI - a similar amount for the salary of one of its employees. CSA - an unspecified amount towards the cost of material; it also does all the printing for the centre and underwrites any deficit. Application for grant-aid was made to the Lombardy Regional Administration but no response had been received: this was in particular for the purchase of a computer in order to set up a data bank. The management committee of the centre has 9 members (3 from each of the sponsors) and meets monthly. The staff come from the two main sponsors and have access to the research and information facilities of their parent bodies, as well as ",
        "135 to training schemes organised by them. The centre staff systematically gather information about job and training opportunities of all kinds, as well as about the opportunities for young people to form social service and worker cooperatives. They also work closely with local church bodies which specialise in job search for young people and with other youth organisations. Issues, problems, potential The work of the centre illustrates that the need to combat the effects of unemployment is felt even in the comparatively most prosperous areas of the country and that information and advice is required to enable individuals to cope with the complex bureaucracy of the formally organised labour market. However, the provision of information about job and training possibilities is closely linked to helping unemployed people deal with their social, psychological and personal difficulties. Although created by an alliance between organisations with a powerful social conscience and linked through them to a wide network of other bodies, the centre had not yet given rise to any follow-up activities of a job creation nature. This may be due to the fact that it is a comparatively recent creation. *** CASE STUDY : ITA 2 Name of Project: 'SOL. CO.' (Solidarita e Cooperazione) Location: Brescia, Italy Context: SOL. CO. is a consortium of some 40 social service cooperatives catering for the handicapped and other groups in society with special disadvantages. It is an offshoot of the Brescia Cooperative Union, itself affiliated to the Cooperative League, one of the major national cooperative bodies in Italy. Brescia, with a population of 200,000, is the fourth largest industrial city of Italy. The traditional industries of the area, metallurgical engineering, textiles and footwear, suffered from considerable restructuring between 1976 and 1983. Between 1980 and 1984 the province's overall job total fell from 413,000 to 405,000 despite an increase of 22,000 in the service sector, while the number of registered job seekers rose from 17,750 to over 28,000: from 17.4% of the population to 27.8%. Young people were hardest hit and the handicapped of all ages experienced particular difficulty ",
        "136 in finding work. What does it do? SOL. CO. uses 2 rooms in the office of the provincial Cooperative Union as its headquarters. The individual cooperatives run their activities in a range of different premises: those in the health field usually are in part of local health centres, production cooperatives usually rent their own premises: cooperatives which are full-time residential communities have apartments from the local authority or other public bodies for which they pay token rents. The range of activities covered by SOL. CO.'s member cooperatives is very wide but all focus on the needs of five particular groups of disadvantaged people: the severely and moderately handicapped; drug addicts; - the elderly; juvenile delinquents and children in care; adults with problems of alcoholism and ex- offenders, in need of psychiatric care. The activities of the cooperatives can be briefly summed as follows: For the handicapped. The provision of social welfare centres for the severely handicapped: these centres are in local health centres to which the users are bussed daily. Specialised therapy is provided, including physical exercises to improve mobility. There are social and cultural activities, as well as individual and group counselling for the disabled and their families. A 2-week summer holiday is organised. The less severely handicapped are given individual programmes of rehabilitation and training in computing, assembly works, clothing, electrical and radio/TV repairs, leather work and ceramics. The products of these workshops are sold and the handicapped trainees receive wages in proportion to their production capacity and the output of the workshop. The aim is to find them jobs outside or to set up new production cooperatives. For drug addicts. There are ten cooperatives in this sector, one of which run a number of residential communities, each community consisting of from 6 to 15 addicts and the social workers who live with them. Individuals remain for from 1 to 3 years and at the end of them time are expected to find employment outside. The communities work on contracts of ",
        "137 public cleansing, upkeep of parks and gardens, printing and a number of crafts. There are recreation and educational activities and advice is provided for the families. In some of the activities the participants begin to earn a wage. For the elderly. 8 cooperatives provide home care or run day centres associated with local health centres. They provide personal care, social and psychological support, domestic help, recreation and travel opportunities. The staff include a number of qualified nurses. For juveniles. 3 cooperatives work under contracts with juvenile courts to provide residential care for these aged 8- 18 who are ordered into care. There is provision of shelter, health care, education, personal guidance, recreation and leisure opportunities. Those in care may leave to go to adopted, or to their own families or to seek a job and become independent members of society. For adults with problems. One cooperative set up by SOL.CO. in 1984 takes 20 or so ex-alcoholic and ex-prisoners on a residential basis, and others on a daily basis, to do agricultural work and upkeep of public gardens. This provides both training and some income. In general, the leisure activities include excursions, a football championship, theatre and jazz events. Who is it for? Those who come as users of the cooperative services are defined by the problem they have. The catchment area varies for different units, some covering the whole region, others the province or a district or smaller unit. In 1985 the SOL.CO. cooperatives together had 1733 clients and about 1000 members: of the latter about 400 worked as volunteers, 136 worked on a paid basis and there were 89 non- member employees. SOL.CO. does not encourage the user/clients to become members, though a minority do stay on and become members. They are encouraged to find jobs, but SOL.CO. does not act as a placement agency. How did it come about? In the 1970s there were major changes both in the allocation of responsibilities generally among local authorities in Italy (region, province, commune) and also in the administration of health and social services. Since this happened there has been a growth of co-operatives. Some of these, dealing with drug addicts applied in the late 1970s for affiliation to the Brescia Cooperative Union. Despite some initial resistance, by 1981 the union had established a social services section with one part-time officer. Application for membership increased in number and scope and in 1983 SOL.CO. was ",
        "138 established to promote and coordinate the work of community and social service cooperatives, with an eventual staff of 3 officers, 2 full-time and 1 part-time, and 2 clerical assistants. As expanison has taken place the work has become increasingly professional and SOL.CO. has seen its aim as being \"entrepreneurial professionalism\", which has requireed more attention being paid to management and training. SOL.CO. has thus become expert in planning and training for health and social service projects and sells its expertise to authorities in other provinces and regions. Its scope has therefore developed beyond mere coordination. At the same time rather than depend on volunteers, SOL.CO. has become more and more concerned to create permanent jobs for its members/helpers and to work towards better chances of obtaining jobs by its client/users. In the year 1984/5 the number of internal jobs rose from 105 to 221, while the number of clients rose from 500 to 1733 and those in paid work from 240 to over 700. Organisation, structure and finance All the costs of the SOL. CO. central office and staff are borne by the Brescia Cooperative Union . The member cooperatives derive their incomes in part from grants and in part from contracts and from the sale of their products. A major example of this is the 'Green Operation' by which the Brescia local authority pays three of the SOL.CO. cooperatives Lire 2,000 million (\u00a31 million) over 3 years to take over the upkeep of 85% of its open spaces, gardens, trees and hedges. Similar contracts are made with other cooperatives to run disabled centres. In 1984 the social service cooperatives had a combined turnover of Lire 2,600 million, more than half of which came from contracts with local health authorities, the balance coining from sale of products. Each cooperative is a member of the SOL.CO. cooperative, which is itself a member of the Brescia Cooperative Union. There are twice-yearly meetings of the member cooperatives which control the programmes, budget and accounts and elects a 13-member board for a 3-year period; and a 5 member committee of auditors. The full-time and part-time staff members serve on the board and also are on the boards of some of the cooperatives. Each cooperative has a broadly similar structure to SOL.CO. and there is a grouping together of cooperatives working in the same sector. The users/clients take part in a wholly voluntary manner and may leave at any time. In general the aim is to help them, wherever possible, to reach the stage of autonomy at which ",
        "139 they can go out and live independently. Obviously, however, this varies according to the sector and will not generally apply to the elderly. Issues, problems, potential SOL.CO. sees part of its task as one of public education and has succeeded in having a bill drafted to secure public regeneration of social service cooperatives and enable them to have access to credit facilities. It has developed its training programme covering the principles and practices of cooperation. 5 courses are run yearly by a specialist cooperative training body (15-20 trainees taking 20-40 hours training in each course) and one course is this covering cooperative administration. With funds from the European Social Fund, matched by the Lombardy Region. SOL. CO. ran a cooperative training course for 20 young unemployed people under the age of 25, at the end of which all were taken on as community health workers by different cooperatives. It has also run specialist training courses on dealing with drug addiction. While many of the members come from a Catholic background and Catholic groups, the cooperatives themselves are run on a purely secular and non-hierarchical basis. The success of the scheme is such that it is being taken as a model for the development of similar coopeatives in other parts of Italy. CASE STUDY: ITA 3 Name of project: Il Forteto Agricultural cooperative Location: Mugello, Tuscany, Italy Context : The cooperative is in the mountainous northern part of the Tuscany Region in the Mugello district of the Province of Florence. As a result of the general economic depression and in particular of the decline in agriculture, the area has been suffering from steady depopulation ever since the 1950s, the population density being 57 per square kilometre, compared with the regional average of 155 per square kilometre. Since 1982 the cooperative has been located on the Riconi Farm. It covers some 350 hectares, achieving for the first time in its 5 years of existence secure tenure of its land. Starting as one of many youth cooperatives created after the passing of Law 285 of June 1977, Il Forteto, despite difficulties and unlike most of the new creations of that ",
        "140 time, has survived and grown to become a model cooperative combining agricultural production and social care. What does it do? There are two types of activity: agricultural, and social care. The agricultural activity includes: - Livestock: sheep, cattle and horses 12 hectares of apple orchards Reclamation and land drainage - Farm shop, laboratory, office management - Maintenance of buildings, reconversions, new construction. On the social side: the community runs its own school minors and adults are taken into care and fostered by the families on the farm; they come from juvenile courts, the social services, psychiatric classes and local health units. So high is its reputation that applications are received from all over Italy. The cooperative has a therapeutic atmosphere, which helps to rehabilitate people so that they can leave and become independent, while at the same time offering then an opportunity to work with dignity. All this is done within the framework of running a flourishing farming buisness which provides a livelihood for the members and their families. Who is it for? Up to May 1986 129 persons have been members of the Forteto community: 32 were in the founding group (19 men and 13 women), 21 others have joined them over the 9 years that the scheme has functioned and become members. During this period 71 persons in need of care have been taken in by the families and cared for. The founders came from a discussion group set up around 1968/9 in the textile town of Prato, near Florence. They decided to use the 1977 law to try out in practice their idea of running a farm, and at it, providing an alternative form of care for the mentally handicapped; many of them had been regarded as either temporarily or permanently unemployable. ",
        "141 How did it come about? Unlike many of the discussion groups started at the time of the student unrest in 1968, the II Forteto group survived and flourished and, by 1975, numbered some 50 members, who had set up a social centre, with out-of-school activities for children, theatre and film events, and public discussions. A few physically and mentally handicapped began to attend and their plight became the focal concern. Immediately after the enactment of the law on youth agricultural cooperatives in June 1977 they registered their cooperative. Having started on a 6-hectare smallholding near Prato they moved on to a farm at Mugello in October. They ran the farming and the caring activities side by side and by 1980 65 people were involved, of whom 15 had previously been in institutions. Members' earnings went into a common fund, whether they lived and worked in the community or not. Individuals draw from the fund according to their needs. By 1980 they had run into severe financial difficulties and decided to tackle this by publicising their activities: this was done by the publication of books and making an audio-visual presentation. By 1981-2 they had gained recognition and support from local authorities, health and cooperative orgnaisations. This was just as well because after complex legal problems they had to give up the original farm and move to another in the same area. On this land they have security of tenure and have been able to invest in it and develop it to become a model farm. Organisation, structure and finance Legally, Il Forteto is a cooperative in which all the members have a vote and elected the officers. There is a board of 6 members and committee of auditors. It has a charismatic chairman who has provided leadership and inspiration . The managerial staff, administrators, agricultural management, maintenance staff and teachers, have in general, specialised qualifications but in several cases work in the cooperative was their first employment. Forteto is closely linked to the health services and the juvenile court through which those in need of care are referred: each case is dealt with individually and a separate arrangement made with the fostering family. A monthly allowance of Lire 500,000 (\u00a3250) is made for each person in care but this ceases when the person becomes a fully active member of the cooperative. Forteto has gained a very high reputation for its care services. Once the cooperative had obtained secure tenure of its farm it was able to get agricultural credit to improve the quality of the land which had been previously abandoned. In this way it obtained a number of major captial loans, an investment grant of Lire 100 million (\u00a350,000) and an annual credit of ",
        "142 Lire 200 million (\u00a3100,000) at 10% interest for working capital. Other financial help for building improvements came from the Regional and Provincial Administrations and from the EEC/Agricultural Fund. The farm itself has had a steadily increasing turnover from Lire 70 million (\u00a335,000) in 1979 to Lire 1,113 million (\u00a3556,000) in 1985. Further funds for a long-term development plan, to a total of Lire 2000 million (\u00a31 million) have been requested from the EEC's Integrated Mediterranean Programme. Issues, problems, potential The idealism and perseverance of the original members under inspiring leadership have been key elements in making the project into a recognised success. They have pursued their goals of trying to establish an alternative model of development, alternative to consumerism and competition, putting a high value on manual work amd making better use of national resources, while undertaking the reintegration and rehabilitation of the handicapped unemployed as a form of solidarity and without regard to personal profit. From a mental health viewpoint, they are making a significant contribution to the evolution of an economically sound and humanly acceptable from of community care. ",
        "143 CASE STUDY: ITA 4 Name of the project: Nouva Frontera Location: Salerno, Italy Context : Salerno is on the coast in the Region of Campania one of the poorer, partially mountainous , regions of Southern Italy. Its unemployment rate is higher than the national average - almost 10% as compared with 7% - and the difference is especially marked for women - 23.6% as compared with a national rate of 17.3%. In 1985 the regional total of registered unemployed was 673,000 of which 92,666 were in the Salerno area. There is a long history of people leaving the land and this was accelerated by the major earthquake of 1980. The Nuova Frontera Cooperative has a one room office in the centre of Salerno, provided rent free by a parish church, and a plastic greenhouse and a small portable shed located on a square kilometre of land outside the town , and a further 2 square kilometres of market garden land some distance away. What does it do? A group of 20 members, 10 able-bodied and 10 suffering from some form of physical or psychological disability, comprise the membership, the chief activities of which are to produce and market house plants and run a market garden producing outdoor plants. The members work together on all the jobs needed to be done, irrespective of whether they are disabled or not. There are also volunteers who provide support and advice to those who have psychological or mental problems. Training in horticulture is provided as well as in the skills of business management and the values of cooperation. Together with an Italian Volunteer Movement (MOVI), Nuova Frontera is planning to set up a day centre. The members live at home with their families or alone. Personal advice and support is provided for all the members. Who is it for? Of the 20 members, 13 are men and 7 women. The age range is from 20 to 47: only 6 are married, five of whom are able- bodied. 6 of the members are engaged in plant production, 5 in social work, 3 in administration, and the other 6 members are volunteer helpers and consultants. The members come form very different backgrounds and with differing motivations - political, religious, humanitarian - to improve their quality of life and to find work to do. Most of those with handicaps came through the Spastics Society, where they were getting occupational therapy. The core group came from the parish of Salerno. The level of education is fairly high; for some ",
        "144 members the cooperative is probably a temporary phase, through which they can gain experience, for example in social work. How did it come about? The group which started Nuova Frontera began with the idea of establishing a sheltered workshop but rejected it as being divorced from the realities of the working world, merely providing support for the handicapped in isolation. The first volunteers and the handicapped persons and their families had difficulty in finding a suitable solution. The suggestion to start the cooperative came from the trade unions which saw the possiblity of using the new (1977) legal framework for the creation of youth cooperatives. Discussions were conducted over a period of 5 months and the cooperative came into being in June 1981 when the church offered premises and the unions help to draw up a constitution. The first major capital donation came from the solidarity fund set up by the main trade union federations. However, even so, there was a two-and-a-half year period of stagnation until Cenasca, a newly formed agency (The national centre for the development of cooperatives and self management) which had been established by CISL, the Catholic trade union federation, injected new momnetum and helped the cooperative to come to life. At this stage there were some changes in membership both among the handicapped and the volunteers. The greenhouse was started when a trade union venture capital fund became available to provide more finance. The land for the greenhouse was made available at a token rent by a land reclamation consortium. Much work was needed, including the building of ramps and platforms so that those in wheelchairs could tend the plants. The local community, scouts and other volunteers helped in the scheme, but the first growing season (the greenhouse is unheated and is used only in the summer) showed a small profit, which was reinvested in the watering system. After this there was a period of loss of enthusiasm but this was revived when a loan was obtained from the Swiss Caritas Venture Fund which enabled both new equipment and the, services of specialist consultants to be brought in. This meant that at the end of the season members got a bonus in addition to their wages. The first grant which paid for the greenhouse was of Lire 45 million (\u00a3225,000). The second loan was of Lire 10 million (\u00a3150,000) was for equipment and overheads. The interest rate on the loans is 7%. The cooperative is self-managing with a typical constitution, each member having a vote and being responsible to all the others: those in each sector (production, social, administrative) decide on their own weekly work programme. To start with, a management services cooperative (TECNOCOOP) ",
        "145 undertook the administrative and accounting work. Later, Nuova Frontera took over these tasks using TECNOCOOP, only as a consultant. Issues, problems, potential As with other cooperatives working with handicapped persons, the purpose is not just to provide employment, but to enable them to improve the quality of their life and to enjoy the dignity of contributing to the group endeavour. Thus, while the decision to take over the accounting may not have been the most efficient or economic way of doing it, it was important to provide work for physically handicapped members who were unable to do manual work. When organising the horticultural training, Nuova Frontera deliberately chose to use volunteer trainers who would adapt the training to the specific needs of members, rather than seek a grant to pre determined courses of training over which they would have little or no control. As in the other cooperative projects there is an overlap between the 'helpers' (able-bodied) and the 'helped' (handicapped). Many of the helpers have themselves been long-term unemployed and community care and production are closely linked. ",
        "146 CASE STUDY: UK 1 Name of project: Derry Unemployed Workers Group Location: Londonderry, Northern Ireland Context: In August 1985 official male unemployment in Derry was 38.5%. An independent survey found that over 70% of unemployed male Catholics and over 60% of unemployed male Protestants had been unemployed for 2+ years. The group operates one of a number of facilities for the unemployed which are to be found in the city. Settlement patterns reflect the city's religious divides, and so many of the facilities in turn reflect these. The group's activities do \"not discriminate against people on the grounds of sex, race, religion or physical disability\". What does it do? Through a centre which is based in a former primary school, a range of activities and facilities are offered. There is a coffee/snack bar, and a number of social/recreational facilities, a job vacancies board, (provided in conjunction with state employment services), indoor sports, TV etc. The two principal services offered by the centre are: a welfare benefits advice service, run by two formerly unemployed staff employed through a government temporary employment programme, and five volunteers. This service is provided both at the centre and in three villages outside the city; educational courses, run in conjunction with the (national) Workers' Educational Association. The range and number of courses run at any one time have increased over the years since the centre's inception and unemployed people can voluntarily enrol an any of them. At the time of the research more than 10 courses were being run, including basic maths and english, art, cookery, drama, guitar, the 'politics of unemployment', psychology, women's studies, yoga and relaxation. All are free. The group also operates a gardening/environmental improvement scheme (also funded under a government temporary employment programme) which employs six people (two of them part-time) ",
        "147 and attracts voluntary labour; and, jointly with a similar centre in Belfast, the group receives funds from the EEC Anti-Poverty Programme and Derry City Council for a 4-year action-research programme which employs three people. Who is it for? The centre is open to unemployed, unwaged and retired people: there is no specific targeting on the long-term unemployed. How did it come about? Origins Its emphasis on educational course provision reflects its origins in an educational course. This was instigated in 1981 by a group of educationalists and trade unionists and run by a university college, on 'unemployment' for unemployed people. As a result of it the Derry Unemployed Education Project was set up, funded by two private foundations, to run a range of five courses, in which 80 people enrolled. Following them, a core group of some 16 people who had been on the or involved with the Courses wanted to develop further course programmes, and they established the Derry Unemployed Workers' Group to do this, establishing it in 1982/3 as a not-for-profit charitable company. Further funds were raised, from private and public sources, and the primary school was found and refurbished for use as the centre. Development The establishment of the centre, from which to run courses and provide social, advisory and recreational services was one of the central original objectives of the group. Others were to establish a childminding facility and cooperate with other organisations. The childminding facility was provided only briefly - it was underused and the premises were not really sutiable for it. As noted above, the group also now operates government-funded temporary employment schemes (and would like to expand these), and aims to develop into a resource and information centre for groups throughout the city. In 1986 the group began discussing new and wider objectives for its work, which included job creation and campaigning as well as the original ones. It also was looking for new premises - the school had always been too big, and not ideally located, and was about to be demolished. Organisation, structure and finance The group is a company whose members elect the directors annually. Membership (for a \u00a31 annual fee) is open to any unemployed, unwaged or retired individual. The current directors are comprised of 4 trade unionists (one of them a government official), a student\u00bb a housewife, two unemployed people and one retired person. Although many people use the ",
        "148 centre, only 35 have become members of the company, and the group is concerned to become more participative and democratic. The staffing consists of a coordinator, finance/development worker, 2 snack bar staff (one part-time), the two welfare benefits advice staff, the three researchers, a receptionist and a (part-time) cleaner/caretaker. The major part of the finance (\u00a340,000 per year total budget currently) comes from the central government's temporary employment programme (80%), supplemented by small grants from the local authority and private foundations. Local fund raising produces some \u00a33,000. Issues, problems, potential The group's emphases and priorities have changed over time (from 'courses' to 'courses and social and advisory facilities, plus some temporary work projects') and the group would like to extend the comprehensiveness of its activities still more in the future. But planned expansion of temporary work schemes has been inhibited by lack of funding, and major funding sources do not exist for other planned areas of development. In addition, it should be noted that government temporary employment programmes also fund the centre staff positions - including the coordinator - and are not ideally suited to this usage, for these need to be permanent positions. Increasing involvement through membership is also an ambition, as is the acquisition of premises of a size and location suited to the groups aims. Moving from a centre for people to come to, to becoming a facility and resource centre for all groups in the city and an operator of temporary employment and job creation projects will not be easy.

        "149 CASE STUDY: UK 2 Name of Project: Job Change Project Location: Birmingham, UK Context Birmingham was at one time the largest industrial city in England. Situated in the West Midlands it has an unemployment rate of 16.6%, marginally lower than that of the whole W. Midlands region (16.8%) but the average conceals great extremes with some districts of the city having rates as high as 40%. The region's rate of unemployment is itself higher than the national average. The Job Change Project, a joint venture of the Birmingham Settlement and the Birmingham Polytechnic, is housed in the Settlement building about a mile from the city centre. The Settlement was established at the end of the 19th century as part of a movement to set up centres of social welfare and educational work in the slum areas of the industrial cities. The Settlement houses a range of services, counselling services of different kinds, and a day centre for the elderly. What does it do? The project aims to provide support and practical help for the older unemployed - over the age of 40 in the form of: counselling services for individuals; secretarial services to enable job seekers to make job applications; advice and assistance on starting small businesses or cooperatives; - advice on sources of finance for training and business start-ups; a job search scheme, matching candidates' skills to jobs advertised; access to a computer; - two small workshops for practical work. The project has also become the centre of a national network of similar schemes for the unemployed in the UK as a whole. Training courses are run on a residential basis and other 'Job Change Projects' helped to start up. A group of redundant middle managers was formed to provide advice for small businesses being established by the unemployed and this has developed into an independent ",
        "150 enterprise and business develpment centre. There is a special women's section. Who is it for? Those using the project are the target group of over-40s who have been made redundant, often after long years of employment in the motor and other allied industries of the region. When the scheme started there were seven times more men than women using the project. With the creation of a women's section there are now 200 women registered. The age range now is from 25-65: 35% of users are black and 50% single parents. The project seeks to attract users who are deemed to be \"vulnerable\" to come to the centre frequently, if necessary issuing them with free bus passes. How did it come about? The project was started on the initiative of two people: the Director of the Settlement and a lecturer at the Polytechnic. It initially opened three days a week, with 2 part-time workers. From the start the project was seen as one of mutual aid, in which the unemployed supported each other, but the problem was that the most competent of the volunteers were precisely the people who succeeded in getting jobs and so were no longer available for the scheme. After six months, funding was secured for a full-time worker. The project moved from the Polytechnic building where it had started to the Settlement. This resulted in several changes. The trend was away from the more qualified 'middle class' user to the less skilled working class: at the time overall unemployment was rapidly increasing in the region. The full- time staff of the project rose to 7 full-time workers and one full-time and one part-time secretary. Work was also expanded on a national basis and othe centres were started in the region. Organisation, structure and finance The staff of the project under its director are responsible to an advisory group made up of representatives of the Settlement and the Polytechnic, of the main funding agencies and the Bank of England. Ultimately this group is responsible to the management group of the Settlement. Funding came from the West Midlands County Council which in the first instance provided \u00a326,000 pa over 3 years. By the time the WMCC was abolished (1986) its commitment was \u00a370,000 pa. It was hoped that this main funding would be increased and taken over by the central government Department of the Environment up to 1989. Other finance came originally from a government temporary employment programme for the salary of 2 ",
        "151 workers, but this ceased as a result of a change of policy. In addition the salary of 2 women's workers was provided by the government Equal Opportunities Commission, and other funding has come from trusts and foundations. Issues, problems, potential While the project has found stability through being established within the framework of two long-standing educational and social institutions (the Polytechnic and the Settlement) it has suffered from two kinds of instability. One was the abolition of its chief funding body, the Viest Midlands County Council: this created much uncertainty as to its financial future. The other is the inherent problem of being dependent for its essential element of mutual aid on the unemployed themselves. While because of the age group selected - 40+ - the chance of them finding jobs was less than for a younger group, there has still been the problem of the most active and helpful being the ones most likely to find jobs and therefore to leave the project. Moreover, this has meant that as time goes on, those who are left behind in the project may become discouraged and less likely to take an active part in a project which is essentially based on seeking and finding employment. CASE STUDY: UK 3 Name of project: Coodham Unemployment Project Location: Kilmarnock, Strathclyde, Scotland Context: The project provides courses for the long-term unemployed. The courses are held in a retreat house, 3 miles from Kilmarnock, belonging to a Catholic religious order which was one of the founders of the project. The courses are attended by residents of an area which has suffered a drastic economic recession and a corresponding rise in unemployment. There had previously been a strong and diversified manufacturing base to the economy, but by 1986 the unemployment rate was 19% (some 6000 people) in the Kilmarnock district. What does it do? The courses which occupy some 20 days over a 4-month period include short residential periods, discussions and project work in small groups. Through the experience gained at the courses and from working together several groups were formed for which support services (travel costs, clerical services, advice and assistance to get access to continuing funding) are provided. Such groups have organised: ",
        "152 computer courses ; the exploitation of opportunities for community businesses; - arts and crafts, producing goods for sale; a local history group; the establishment of an unemployed resources centre, supported by trade unions and the local authority The project does not set out to train participants for work, but to improve their confidence. Some 30%, however, find work after the course. Who is it for? The Kilmarnock area, because of its multiple deprivation, was designated as an Area for Priority Treatment by the Strathclyde Regional Council. The first course in 1982 attracted some 20 participants but only 9 completed it, most of those leaving, having obtained jobs. Subsequently the means of recrutiment, which had been originally by general publicity (poster, advertising etc) became more personal, relying largely on contacts with individuals and holding information meetings. This produced larger numbers: 79 for the courses held during 1983. Close contact is maintained with many local organisations, this being felt to be all the more necessary because of the geographical separation of the centre from the town and because of the high turnover of staff. Of the course participants (about 100 in 1985-6) there were slightly more men than women, about half were under the age of 35 and a quarter between 16 and 25 years of age. The majority, over 85%, had been unemployed for more than one year and of them 19% for between 2 and 5 years, 17% for between 5 and 9 years and 6% for more than 10 years. How did it come about? The project was started on the initiative of a social woker and the staff of the Retreat House who felt that the resources of the House were not being fully used. Their aim was to provide the unemployed with opportunities to identify and tackle their needs and to do this by providing them with opportunities to meet together with the assistance of professional staff. Assistance was obtained from the Manpower Services Commission to use the government temporary employment programme to fund staff. Each year's courses were carefully evaluated and amendments made in order to achieve a more flexible and integrated course programme. More emphasis was put on courses for women and girls, staff training and on ",
        "153 the educational methods used. Recruitment is done mainly in local priority areas. Organisation, structure and finance The project is ultimately the responsibility of the Coodham Community, the religious order, which acts as Trustee. There is a steering committee with representatives of the order the local authorities, trade unions and between 3 and 5 of the participants themselves. It meets monthly and reports to an Annual General Meeting. The staff is headed by the Rector (head) of the religious commmunity, and the main day-to-day work of management is done by a woman assistant director. Other staff members, employed under the temporary employment scheme are the course coordinator, two project workers, and three part-time workers, in addition to clerical and other support (after care) staff. In addition a half-time secretarial post is funded by a government 'Urban Aid' grant: 11 of the 28 persons who have worked on the project have been recruited from among the participants on the courses. The main funding for the course has been shared between the 'Urban Aid', government temporary employment programme and its grant. Of which the local authority (Strathclyde Region) provides 25% and central government 75%. The amounts provided were: 1982-3 1985-6 Temporary employment scheme \u00a316,650 \u00a335,500 Urban aid \u00a313,000 \u00a333,280 Issues, problems, potential From the participants own evaluation it emerges that their self-confidence and self-esteem are considerably increased by the courses. They acquire new information and learn new skills and are enabled to come together in group to undertake projects. The future is uncertain especially with regard to funding: the temporary employment scheme support is on a year to year basis and the urban aid grant lasts only for 3 years. The project is aware that it has little control over or ability to change the opportunities for funding employment projects in the area. It plans to intensify its follow-up of participants and to find ways of strengthening its links with and contribution to, the Areas of Priority Treatment in its vicinity\u00b7 ",
        "154 CASE STUDY: UK 4 Name of project: Wansbeck Community Initiatives Centre Location: Ashington, Northumberland. Context The Wansbeck district has a population of 62,000 and in the past has been mainly dependent for employment on the coalmining industry. In 1961 more than 15,000 people worked in 11 local pits: by 1986 the last pit had closed. There has only been very limited commercial investment and few new job opportunities. The centre is in centrally-situated premises owned by the district council. What does it do? There is a \"drop-in\" centre, consisting of a lounge and cafeteria and a wide variety of other activities and services including: creche; single-parent group; advice on welfare rights; 'do-it-yourself' facilities; women's do-it-yourself group; craft group; workshop for car and motorcycle maintenance; organisation of excursions; guitar tuition; photography; screen printing; video group; exhibitions; writers' group; chess club; mural painting; music groups. There is also a cooperative development centre which organises training courses, some with support from the European Social Fund for young people to enable them to gain the confidence and skills needed to start them in cooperative businesses. A number of cooperatives have been established and others are being developed, as follows: - building and maintenance; rest-home for the elderly; welding; day nursery; secretarial services. ",
        "155 Other groups have been helped to get going, such as a women's health advice centre, a music collective and art sessions for patients from a hospital for the mentally handicapped. Many other organisations use the building regularly, including an unemployed sports group. Who is it for? Because the closing down of the basic industry of the area has been in progress for over a decade, there are large numbers of long-term unemployed people locally. The centre was set up by the local authority with this in mind and with the aim of, specifically, providing activities for young unemployed. Special efforts were made to attract women to use the centre. Some of the cooperative training courses are targetted especially at women and young people. How did come about? The local authority (Wansbeck District Council) has a limited budget with which to promote alternative forms of economic activity to the traditional dying source of employment in the coal industry. Following a seminar on cooperatives held in 1978, a fund of \u00a324,000 was established by the council to provide loans for cooperatives. However, none existed and so the idea of a cooperative development agency within a broader centre was proposed. The centre was started as a result of a formal resolution of the District Council in 1982. The centre is staffed by 9 people whose salaries are funded under the government temporary employment scheme. One of these , responsible for cooperative development is designated as a \"key worker\" and has a longer-term contract, the others are on short-term (1 year) contracts. There are strong links with other bodies in the area - political, social, educational, trade unions, and cooperatives. 0 rgani s at ion, structure and finance The Centre is administered by the district council. There is a management committee, consisting of representatives of the local authority, of trade unions, of the cooperative movement, of a local voluntary organisation, of the Workers' Educational Association, of the staff, and of the users of the centre. The Common Ownership fund, which makes loans to cooperatives, has its own management committee. The budget for 1985/86 was \u00a363,000 of which \u00a340,000 came from the government temporary employment scheme and \u00a322,000 from the district council. \u00a313,000 of this latter amount came as a grant from the European Social Fund. ",
        "156 Issues, problems, potential As with other projects, the dependence on government temporary employment scheme funding for salaries creates problems because of the short-term nature of the financing. Possibly because of the comparative smallness and homogeneity of the area, the project appears to have very strong links with other bodies - the Worker's Educational Association rents an office in the centre building. However, the local authority being controlled by the Labour Party, there are good relationships between it, the centre and the trade unions. Other issues concern the 'social and political education' work of the centre which might be construed as coming into conflict with the rule that activities financed by the government should be non-political. Because of its two types of activities, the centre is able to combine a welfare side (providing activities for those who are and are likely to remain unemployed) while at the same time (through its cooperative development activities) training, in particular younger people, to be able to start into self-employment or into cooperatives of various kinds.

        "! LOCALLY-BASED RESPONSES TO LONG-TERM UNEMPLOYMENT This report provides the final results of a research study commissioned within the framework of the Foundation's 1985 work programme. The work is based on an analysis of 20 locally-based projects from five Member States (Belgium, Germany, Ireland, Italy and the United Kingdom), cases selected so as to provide a broad range of projects and schemes which had interesting and innovative features and which as a group reflected the diversity apparent in the European Community in locally-based social and economic initiatives. The ways these types of locally-based projects help the long-term unemployed to meet their needs, cope with their situation, reintegrate economically and socially with the communities in which they live, and to break out of the cycle of deprivation in which many are trapped are examined in this report. It also identifies the features and factors which appear to contribute to, or inhibit their success and provides conclusions and recommendations to policy-makers and practitioners on ways to strengthen such action so as to better combat long-term unemployment and improve the living conditions of the long-term unemployed.
