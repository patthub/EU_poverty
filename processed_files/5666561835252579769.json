        "____________________________________________________________________________________________ Country Report on Belgium for the Study on Member States' Policies for Children with Disabilities EXECUTIVE SUMMARY Belgium has ratified both the Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC) and the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD), which are both directly applicable in the country, and can, as a result, be invoked before Courts. The legal framework has a strong focus on the right to non-discrimination including on the grounds of disability and age. The rights of children and of persons with disabilities are well reflected in the national and regional legislation. As a result, overall children with disabilities\u2019 rights are guaranteed in the Belgian legal framework. The policy towards children with disabilities has been, until recent years, focused on specialised care and education, in residential care or special schools settings. Consequently, much investment has been and still is channelled towards institutions and special schools. In 2010, around 1 out of 20 students (out of all students, with and without disabilities) attended specialised schools in Belgium. However, recent years has seen a new push for inclusion in society of children with disabilities, in part from the impetus of the CRPD. For example, children with disabilities attending special education can now attend classes or activities part-time or full-time in mainstream schools with the support of special education. Today, inclusion and participation in society is the cornerstone of the policy towards person with disabilities in Belgium, albeit it remains to be fully implemented in practice. Overall, while the rights and principles recognised in the CRC and CRPD are implemented in the legal framework at the national and regional level, the practical implementation of many of them is problematic. The right to non-discrimination on the grounds of disability is fully recognised including in areas pertaining to the situation of children with disabilities (such as access to goods and services, education, social benefit). In addition, the legislation establishes the denial of reasonable accommodation as discrimination. Nevertheless, the right to reasonable accommodation remains misunderstood and is sometimes perceived as a privilege rather than a right. The right of the child to express his/her views in all decisions affecting them is fully recognised. However, it is not fully implemented in judicial procedures, often depending on the willingness of the judge. In addition, the lack of sign language interpreters is a considerable barrier. Freedom from violence is guaranteed under the Criminal Code and violence against children and persons vulnerable due to disabilities is sanctioned. However, corporal punishment is not yet banished (outside of school) and mortality resulting from abuse against children is higher in Belgium than in most OECD countries. Access to assistance is guaranteed and personal assistance budgets provide for financial support for at-home assistance for children with disabilities and their families. But the long waiting lists to receive personal assistance force some parents to opt for placement of the child in residential care. Parents have the right to freely choose the education (mainstream or special) of their children. However, most mainstream schools are not equipped to receive children with disabilities. In addition, teachers in mainstream schools lack training to care for the needs of children with disabilities. 7 ",
        "____________________________________________________________________________________________ Policy Department C: Citizens' Rights and Constitutional Affairs Lastly, some rights and principles lack specific legal requirements or procedures to ensure the full implementation. This is the case for the principle of best interests of the child and the concept of evolving capacities of the child. While both are recognised in the legal framework, there are little to no specific procedures or requirements in place for their implementation. Albeit several gaps exist in the legal implementation of the rights and principles in Belgium, children with disabilities benefit overall from a satisfactory legal protection and assistance to enjoy their rights. 8 ",
        "____________________________________________________________________________________________ Country Report on Belgium for the Study on Member States' Policies for Children with Disabilities INTRODUCTION In December 2010, the European Union (EU) became a party to the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD). In doing so, the EU recognised the challenges persons with disabilities face in securing their rights and highlighted the need for EU actions in that to be firmly on the agenda of the European Union and its Member States. Children with disabilities are already vulnerable because they are children. Their disability renders them particularly vulnerable. As such, they deserve specific safeguards and protection from the EU and its Member States. The key legal framework for EU action in this field is the EU decision to ratifying the CRPD, the requirement under Article 10 TFEU for the EU to combat discrimination based on disability, as well as the EU objective of promoting the rights of the child found under Article 3 TEU. This framework provides the EU with a unique position to push forward for further protection of the rights of children with disabilities, and to develop legislative or policy initiatives. The UN Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC) provides another basis for action in this area. 1 This country report for Belgium is part of a larger study which aims at providing the European Parliament with an overview of the situation of children with disabilities in selected Member States, with a view to evaluating the need for European legislation to enhance the rights of children with disabilities in the European Union. The project reviews the existing legal, policy and institutional frameworks in 18 Member States. Each country report analyses the implementation of international principles and rights stemming from the CRPD and the CRC to uncover any particular issues that necessitate further policy and legislative actions at national and EU level. The results from the country reports also form the basis for the comparative analysis in the report \u2018Study on Member States' Policies for Children with Disabilities\u2019. The key elements deriving from the CRC and CRPD, with regard to children with disabilities include: \uf0b7 The obligation to act in the best interests of the child; \uf0b7 The right to non-discrimination; \uf0b7 The consideration of the evolving capacities of the child; \uf0b7 The right to be heard/to participate; \uf0b7 The right to be free from violence; \uf0b7 The right to family life; \uf0b7 The right to assistance; \uf0b7 The right to education, including inclusive education. Given their ratification of both UN Conventions, Member States are obliged to take 1 All the 27 Member States have ratified the CRC, and all 27 Member States have signed the CRPD (Finland, Ireland and the Netherlands have signed but not yet ratified). 9 ",
        "____________________________________________________________________________________________ Policy Department C: Citizens' Rights and Constitutional Affairs necessary measures to ensure the respect of the rights set forth for each child or person with a disability within their jurisdiction. Member States should take the appropriate measures to ensure that children are protected against all forms of discrimination or violence, including adopting all appropriate legislative, administrative and other measures for the implementation of those rights. Moreover, the protection of the rights of children with disabilities should be mainstreamed in all policies and programmes in accordance with Article 4(3) of the CRPD on the involvement of persons with disabilities in all decision- making processes. Due to the scale of this subject and the scarcity of materials available, the scope of this study does not cover in detail the wide range of issues arising from and relating to the situation of children with disabilities. It does not aim to provide an in-depth analysis but rather an overview of the situation of children with disabilities\u2019 rights in Belgium. This study presents a snapshot of some of the major issues and obstacles faced by children with disabilities and their families, a legal analysis of the implementation of the main rights and principles recognised in the CRC and CRPD and relevant in the context of the situation of children with disabilities and points to some potential solutions at national and EU level to improve their situation. Each country report is structured as follows: it first looks at the situation of children with disabilities at the national level. It describes the national legal and institutional framework for the protection of children with disabilities and analyses national implementation of principles and rights developed in the UN Conventions (CRC and CRPD). It then considers specific issues relevant to the situation of children with disabilities, including children as suspects, gender issues, violence and education. Finally, the report covers the mechanisms in place to implement the legal framework, highlighting gaps, problems, best practices, and recommendations found by the literature or via interviews with stakeholders. 10 ",
        "____________________________________________________________________________________________ Country Report on Belgium for the Study on Member States' Policies for Children with Disabilities 1. OVERVIEW OF THE SITUATION AND CHALLENGES FOR CHILDREN WITH DISABILITIES IN BELGIUM KEY FINDINGS \uf0b7 The national policy focuses on the following areas: inclusion, participation, the Rights of the Child guaranteed by the CRC, and the right to anti-discrimination. \uf0b7 The following gaps, problems and challenges have been identified: insufficient school transportation; limited opportunity to choose between mainstream and specialised schools; lack of accessibility in schools and outside of schools; limited participation of children with disabilities; waiting lists to receive assistance; lack of at home support to families forcing them to turn to residential care and lack of data. 1.1. Introduction to the situation of children with disabilities in Belgium Belgium ratified the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD) in July 2009 and it became binding and directly applicable in Belgium in August 2009. The Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC), which has been ratified by Belgium in 1991, is also directly applicable in Belgium (see section 2.1). Since 1970, Belgium\u2019s policy with regard to children with disabilities has been mainly focused on their institutionalisation, originally due to the demand of the parents of children with disabilities themselves, 2 to the extent that Belgium has become one of the European countries with the highest percentage of children with disabilities institutionalised. 3 Following the ratification of the CRPD in 2009, policy efforts have been made towards further inclusion. However, up to now, resources have mostly been directed towards institutional structures. 4 The legal and policy framework for the protection of children with disabilities appears strong in Belgium, but fragmented through different levels of authorities. The framework for children with disabilities is composed of regulations and policies on the rights of the 2 Information collected via a consultation with stakeholder.

Furthermore, policies and legislation have been developed at the Federal, Regional and Community levels, in addition to municipalities\u2019 action in the area. The aim of Belgian\u2019s policy towards persons with disabilities is to ensure their integration and participation in society. 5 In 2005, the Federal government and the governments of the Regions and Communities adopted a National Plan for Children . 6 The plan contains 10 thematic priorities for the rights of the child for all governments in Belgium: 7 \uf0b7 To give priority to children; \uf0b7 To eradicate poverty: invest in children; \uf0b7 To ensure that no child are forgotten \uf0b7 To take care of each child; \uf0b7 To provide every child access to education; \uf0b7 To protect children against abuse and exploitation; \uf0b7 To protect children against war; \uf0b7 To fight against HIV / AIDS; \uf0b7 To listen to children and ensure their participation; \uf0b7 To protect the earth for children. The National Plan covers children with disabilities and specifically mentions them under certain thematic priorities. As regards children with disabilities the following goals are referred to in the National Plan: improving the quality of specialised education, financial assistance for families with children with disabilities or improving inclusion of children including in outside school activities. In addition to the National Plan, Regions and Communities have also established specific policies towards the realisation of the rights of the child. In Flanders , the Flemish Action Plan for the Rights of the Child 2011-2014 ( Vlaams Actieplan Kinderrechten ) lays down specific goals targeting children with disabilities. 8 Those goals include inter alia ensuring appropriate social services to children in needs and strengthening psychiatric counselling, including increasing family support. The Flemish Youth Policy 2010-2014 ( Vlaamse jeugdbeleidsplan ) also includes specific goals to enhance the situation of children with disabilities, such as bringing the situation of children with 5 Overview of the policy in favour of persons with disabilities, available at http://www.handicap.fgov.be/sites/handicap.fgov.be/files/explorer/fr/brochure-politique-personnes-handicapees\u00ad belgique.pdf (last accessed on 19 January 2013). 6 National Plan for Children ( Plan national consacr\u00e9 aux enfants \u2013 Nationaal actieplan voor kinderen ), available in French at http://www.oejaj.cfwb.be/index.php?id=2802 (last accessed on 18 November 2012). 7 See more at Federal Public Service for Justice website, available at http://justitie.belgium.be/nl/themas en dossiers/kinderen en jongeren/kinderrechten/op nationaal niveau/ (last accessed on 18 November 2012). 8 Flemish Action Plan for the Rights of the Child 2011-2014 ( Vlaams Actieplan Kinderrechten ), available at http://www.vlaanderen.be/nl/publicaties/detail/vak-vlaams-actieplan-kinderrechten (last accessed on 23 January 2013). 12 ",

The 2011-2014 Action Plan contains the goals to ensure a more inclusive education for children with disabilities, to ensure that new school buildings are accessible, as well as to train childcare professionals to inclusion and support them in their work with children with disabilities. 11 No national plan or strategy specifically concerning persons with disabilities has been identified. However, Belgium has developed a strong regulation against discrimination on the grounds of disability (see section 3.1.2). 1.2. Review of issues and identification of possible regulatory gaps There is a certain amount of literature on different aspects of the situation of children with disabilities in Belgium. In line with the scope of this study, the literature review will be limited to NGOs alternative reports, annual reports from children rights or equality institutions and a survey of children with disabilities in Belgium, as they reflect issues of children with disabilities in Belgium in general, rather than specific problematic issues linked to a type of disability, a particular sector or a geographic region. Issues raised by children with disabilities: UNICEF Belgium has carried out a survey of children with disabilities aged 12 to 18, where children were asked various questions on their rights and issues they may encounter with the aim to promote participation and allow children to have their voices heard. 12 The results of the survey point to the fact that children with disabilities want first and foremost to be considered as children , rather than being reduced to their disability. Most children do not identify with their disability, but rather, when talking about who they are, they relate to similar characteristics to their able-peers, such as their hobbies. They have the same desire and dreams as most children of their age; however they face obstacles from a society which is not adapted to their needs, often due to a lack of awareness and information on the difficulties they encounter. Stigmatisation and misunderstanding of the actual abilities of children with disabilities lead to their segregation. The biggest change they hope for is the change of perception of society towards them. Children want their real abilities to be recognised, as there is a tendency from their carers or families to overprotect them. 9 Flemish Youth Policy 2010-2014 ( Vlaamse jeugdbeleidsplan ), available at http://www.vlaanderen.be/nl/publicaties/detail/vlaams-jeugdbeleidsplan-2010-2014 (last accessed on 18 November 2012). 10 Decree of the French Community of 28 January 2004 establishing the production of a report on the application of the principles of the Convention on the Rights of the Child, available in French or Dutch at http://www.ejustice.just.fgov.be/loi/loi.htm (last accessed on 18 November 2012). 11 Action Plan 2011-2014 of the Wallonia-Brussels Federation ( Plan d\u2019Action 2011-2014 de la F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Wallonie- Bruxelles ), available at http://www.oejaj.cfwb.be/index.php?eID=tx nawsecuredl&u=0&file=fileadmin/sites/oejaj/upload/oejaj super edi tor/oejaj editor/pdf/FWB PADE 2011 Partie B C DEF.pdf&hash=764bc2510e8faada29dfc4c303b4a24e99a36e4c (last accessed on 18 November 2012). 12 UNICEF Belgium, What do you think? project, \u2018We are first and foremost youth\u2019, Report of young people with a disabilities on the enjoyment of their rights in Belgium, available in French and Dutch at http://www.unicef.be/nl/page/project-what-do-you-think (last accessed on 18 November 2012). 13 ",
        "____________________________________________________________________________________________ Policy Department C: Citizens' Rights and Constitutional Affairs Another point raised by children with disabilities is the need to have a real opportunity to choose the school they wish to attend (between mainstream and special schools). Some children prefer attending a mainstream school, while others prefer attending a special school, where they receive attention tailored to their needs and can share their experience with like children. They encounter difficulties in finding schools equipped and willing to accept them. In addition, they feel there is not enough interaction between children with and without disabilities leading to less integration and to cases of bullying from children not used to children with disabilities. Children are also concerned about the lack of accessibility in and outside schools. \u2018It is nice to have the same rights, but if there is no access, it is useless\u2019, a child said. At schools, access to adapted material, or adapted sport equipment, and accessibility to various parts of the schools is not always provided. Many playgrounds, cinemas, football stadium or attraction parks are not accessible to them. In addition, many pavements, restaurants and public transports lack accessibility. Children want also access to information regarding their disability and health, as doctors tend to only address such information to their parents. Lastly, children with disabilities want their views to be more taken into consideration and to be able to take decision independently. Their ability to express themselves is often underestimated and their opinion is rarely requested. The following issues have been raised by the literature: A major concern relates to school transportation . Children with disabilities who did not have the possibility to find a school welcoming them near their home have to endure long daily journeys often under inadequate travel conditions. 13 The literature expressed concerns with respect to institutionalisation . While measures exist to support parents, such services generally do not offer a sufficient solution to the daily support needs for families with children with disabilities. Some parents are forced to either give up their jobs to care for the child, which leads to a decrease of income. In addition, waiting lists to receive personal assistance budget and to access service, as well as lack of support force parents to turn to residential care instead. 14 The problem of waiting lists is especially a concern in the Brussels Region and in Flanders. Children with complex disabilities, autism and behavioural disorders are particularly concerned with the waiting lists. This is generally due to a lack of trained professionals able to care for children with such type of disabilities. 15 The needs for childcare for children between birth and age 3 are largely unmet, especially in the Brussels Region. Childcare for children with disabilities below age 3 and 13 Information collected through interviews via interview with General Delegate for the Rights of the Child associate and reported in the reports of the General Delegate for the Rights of the Child Annual Report 2010\u00ad 2011, p. 27 and the CEOOR. 14 Equal Rights for Every Person with a disability ( Gelijke Rechten voor Iedere Persoon met een handicap (GRIP) ) \u2018Human Rights and Disability \u2013 Shadow Report Flanders (Belgium) 2011\u2019 ( Mensenrechten en handicap schaduwrapport Vlaanderen (Belgi\u00eb) 2011 ), p.40, available in Dutch at http://www.gripvzw.be/vn-verdrag/523\u00ad grip-brengt-het-eerste-schaduwrapport-vn-verdrag.html (last accessed on 23 January 2013) and Alternative Report by the NGOs on the implementation of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child in Belgium, 2010, p.71 available at http://www.lacode.be/IMG/pdf/Alternative Report by the NGO s on the implementation of the UN CRC in B elgium - 2010.pdf (last accessed on 23 January 2013). 15 Information collected through interviews via interview with General Delegate for the Rights of the Child associate. 14 ",
        "____________________________________________________________________________________________ Country Report on Belgium for the Study on Member States' Policies for Children with Disabilities afterschool care for children between the ages of 3-12 faces the lack of regulations and financial support. In addition, childcare suffers from structural underfunding, low skill levels of staff, lack of links with the most vulnerable families, de-professionalisation and reduced emphasis on skill requirements and working conditions. 16 There is a lack of appropriate response and framework for the care of children with disabilities who require specific daily care or medication. The lack of response to these needs may hamper the integration of these children in nursery, primary and secondary mainstream schools. 17 Children with disabilities often lack choice of school and educational options . In 2010, it was estimated that around 2% of students with disabilities were integrated into mainstream education with a specialised programme, making Belgium one of the most segregated countries of the OECD. While a series of measures to promote integration of children with disabilities in education have been adopted, the ability to attend a mainstream school of choice remains challenging for most children with disabilities, especially for children with severe disabilities. One of the reasons for such low level of inclusive education lies in insufficient support to students with disabilities attending mainstream schools and support to mainstream schools to accommodate them. 18 Children with disabilities from disadvantaged families are particularly vulnerable and have less access to mainstream education. Where families have financial resources, they have the opportunity to invest in support and assistance for the child and will generally take steps to get information and negotiate the registration of their child in schools of their choice. Children from disadvantaged families do not have the possibility to do the same and often lack information about the available services. Education indicators showed an overrepresentation of disadvantaged children in the special needs education system. 19 The question whether children are competent to form their own opinion is often used to limit the right to participation of children, especially of children in vulnerable situations such as children with disabilities, sick children, children in psychiatric institutions or very young children who risk that adults would make decisions without their involvement. The following barriers to participation have been identified: lack of information and reception; difficult financial; geographical and cultural access; lack of climate of trust; respect of the pace (speaking slower and giving the child time to speak), time and stages; and lack of awareness of differences. 20 Lastly, there is a lack of data disaggregated by age, the presence of any physical or mental disability, etc., which would take into account all children from 0 to 18 years (and not only from 0 to 3 years on a given subject, 14 to 25 years on another, etc.). Data is particularly lacking on children belonging to vulnerable groups including sick and hospitalised children and children with disabilities. 21 16 Alternative Report by the NGOs on the implementation of the CRC in Belgium, 2010, p. 54-55. 17 General Delegate for the Rights of the Child Annual Report 2010-2011, p. 28. 18 Alternative Report by the NGOs on the implementation of the CRC in Belgium, 2010, p. 50. 19 Alternative Report by the NGOs on the implementation of the CRC in Belgium, 2010, p.50 and information collected through interviews via interview with General Delegate for the Rights of the Child associate. 20 Alternative Report by the NGOs on the implementation of the CRC in Belgium, 2010, p. 24. 21 Alternative Report by the NGOs on the implementation of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child in Belgium, 2010, available at http://www.lacode.be/IMG/pdf/Alternative Report by the NGO s on the implementation of the UN CRC in B elgium_-_2010.pdf (last accessed on 18 November 2012), p. 14. 15 ",

The legal system is based upon a continental system of codification, with legislation being the primary source of law. The main fields of law have been codified into specific codes. The Codes are hierarchically superior to the Law, Decrees and Ordinances. 23 The Federal government issues acts ( wet/loi ). In Flanders, and the Walloon Region, legislative powers of the Regions are exercised through \u2018decrees\u2019 ( decreten and d\u00e9crets ), and in the Brussels Region, via \u2018ordinances\u2019 ( ordonnances ). Belgium has a monist system of international law. As a result, international agreements ratified by Belgium have primacy over national law and can be invoked before Courts. 24 The Judiciary has the power of judicial review. It can annul subsidiary legislation, if it goes beyond the enabling powers stipulated in the legislation. The court system consists of regular courts in different appeal levels (private and criminal law matters), an administrative court (the Council of State, dealing with appeal against irregular administrative acts) and a constitutional court competent to review the compliance of regulations with the Constitution (Articles 8 \u2013 32 on the rights and freedoms of Belgians; Articles 170 and 172 on principle of equality in fiscal matters; and Article 191 regarding the protection of foreign nationals) and the rules governing the division of powers between the Federal State, the communities and the Regions. In practice, while there is no binding law of precedent, judgments, in particular those of higher Courts, carry a considerable weight with respect to the interpretation of the law. Belgium has undergone several constitutional reforms starting in 1970, with the most recent in 2011, in order to develop a federalist structure . Today, Belgium is a Federal State composed of three communities (the Flemish Community, the French Community and the German-speaking Community) and three Regions (the Walloon Region, Flanders and the Brussels Capital Region), 10 Provinces and 589 municipalities. Each Region and 22 Unless otherwise cited, all the legislation cited in this report is available in French or Dutch at http://www.ejustice.just.fgov.be/loi/loi.htm (last accessed on 18 November 2012). 23 There is no hierarchy between acts, decrees and ordinances as they cover difference competences. If a conflict arises, the Constitutional Court is competent to decide. 24 Belgian Court of Cassation decision of 27 May 1971 (Case Franco-Suisse Le Ski ). 16 ",

The Flemish Region and the Flemish Community have the same government and parliament. The Federal authority is competent in several areas, such as justice, labour law, consumer protection and some aspects of public health. The Federal level has some residual competence for matters related to disability, including social benefits allocation, social security, tax benefits, functional rehabilitation, national non-discrimination policies, national railway, air and maritime transport, fundamental rights guaranteed by the Constitution, legislation on prolonged minority, access to justice and employment law. However, the last reform of the federalist structure transferred competences in terms of family allowances and support to persons with disabilities to the Communities. 25 The three Communities are competent for sport, culture, education, and defence and illustration of the language of the Community, as well as \u2018personalisable\u2019 matters ( persoonsgebonden materies \u2013 mati\u00e8res personnalisables ), which include some aspects of public health and matters relating to aid to people, such as social aid and youth protection. For children with disabilities, relevant Communities competences are education, including special education, vocational training and care, technical aids, orientation and counselling. 26 The three Regions are competent for territorial matters related to the economy, employment and training, access to building, mobility, housing, public works, energy, transport (with the exception those under Federal competence), material aid to persons with disabilities, land use and urban planning, environment and nature conservation. Finally, municipalities are competent for disability assessments resulting in the production of a general certificate with which persons with disabilities or their legal representative can ask certain social, fiscal and tariff measures. Matters related to the rights of the child and of persons with disabilities fall under the competences of the Federal, Regional and Communities authorities. 2.2. Children with disabilities specific legal and institutional framework 2.2.1. Legal framework There is no specific legislation on children with disabilities; rather various legislation exists either regulating children\u2019s or persons with disabilities\u2019 rights or specific sectors, such as education, and includes provisions applicable to children with disabilities (for detailed legislation see section 3). The Belgian Constitution dedicates a specific provision to the rights of the child. According to Article 22bis, \u2018[e]ach child is entitled to have his or her moral, physical, mental and sexual integrity respected. Each child has the right to express his or her views in all matters affecting him or her, the views of the child being given due weight in accordance 25 The reform is planned to enter into force in 2014 or 2015.

Definitions At the national level, there is no harmonised definition of disability ; rather specific legislation provides criteria for eligibility or application in accordance to the matter at hand. For example, the Act on allowance to persons with disabilities uses different wording depending on the allowance and therefore enlarging or restricting eligibility for the type of allowance. 44 The Anti-Discrimination Act does not provide a definition of disability, which led Courts to decide that the interpretation of the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) of the notion of disability should be followed. 45 The CJEU defines disability as \u2018a limitation which results in particular from physical, mental or psychological impairments and which hinders the participation of the person concerned in professional life\u2019. 46 The Civil Code defines minor as \u2018an individual of one sex or another and who has not yet reached the age of eighteen years old\u2019. 47 The French Community defines a child when implementing the CRC as a person under the age of 18 years, and a person under 20 years old to whom assistance has been requested before she/he turns 18 years. 48 41 Website of the Office of the Federal Ombudsamn available at http://www.federalombudsman.be/homepage (last accessed 18 November 2012).

LEGAL FRAMEWORK AND IMPLEMENTATION ASSESSMENT KEY FINDINGS \uf0b7 Overall, the legal framework is thorough, partly because both the CRC and the CRPD are directly applicable in Belgium, but also thanks to an extensive Federal and Regional legal framework. It is noted that some Regional disparities exist. \uf0b7 The implementation of CRPD and CRC rights and principles is satisfactory with some gaps, mostly related to the practical implementation. The consideration of the best interests of the child is required in all decisions affecting the child, but few implementation requirements exits; the right to non-discrimination is fully recognised but accessibility (to schools, transports and building) remains an issue; the respect for evolving capacities is not explicitly recognised but its elements are present in legal acts; the right of the child to express his/her views require additional procedural safeguards; the right to be free from violence is guaranteed but corporal punishment is not banished and child abuse remains high; the right to assistance is ensured but remains problematic due to waiting lists; the right to education and inclusion is guaranteed, however children with disabilities are segregated into special schools despite recent years\u2019 efforts for greater inclusion. 3.1. Implementation of the provisions of the CRPD and CRC 3.1.1. Best interests of the child (Art. 3 CRC; Art. 7 CRPD) The Constitution guarantees that the interests of the child must be a primary consideration in all decision affecting them. 49 In civil proceedings, any adoption and filiation decision can only take place in the best interests of the child and in the respect for fundamental rights as recognised in international law. 50 In situations where the parents of the child are separated , the competent court entrusts decisions on the health, education, entertainment, training, religious or philosophical orientation to one of the parents, according to the child\u2019s interests. 51 The Youth Tribunal may intervene \u2018in the interests of the child\u2019 in various ways: child\u2019s custody, maintenance of personal relationships with grand-parents, 52 administration of the child\u2019s property, guardianship appointment and measures of accommodation. With regards to social security , the \u2018interests of the child\u2019 is taken into consideration in decisions to determine the beneficiary of family allowances. 53 Similarly, the Committee of Youth Protection responsible for taking action when the child\u2019s health, safety or morals are in danger considers the interest of the child before exercising preventive social action , 49 Article 22bis of the Constitution. 50 Article 344.1 of the Civil Code. 51 Article 374 of the Civil Code. 52 Article 375bis of the Civil Code. 53 Article 66 of the Coordinated laws on family allowances for employees. 21 ",
        "____________________________________________________________________________________________ Policy Department C: Citizens' Rights and Constitutional Affairs provided that assistance has been sought or accepted by those invested in the child. 54 Despite the absence of specific procedural safeguards in most legislation to ensure the application of the best interests of the child, as a result of the guarantee foreseen in the Constitution and the direct application of the CRC, the best interests of the child must be in any event the primary consideration in all decisions affecting children in Belgium. With respect to unaccompanied non-national minors who entered illegally onto the territory, protection measures are in place to ensure the best interests of the child. A guardian must be appointed to support the child in the proceedings. The guardian is in charge of searching for a lasting solution for the child, for which the safeguard of the family unit is a priority, in accordance with the CRC and the best interests of the child. 55 The Youth Protection system applies to children who committed an offence and to children in danger or in need of protection. While the Youth Protection Act regulating the youth protection system does not explicitly refer to the principle of the best interests of the child, the system is based on a certain number of principles including the respect of the rights and freedoms guaranteed in the Constitution and the CRC. 56 The Act mentions the consideration of the \u2018interests of the child\u2019, but there is no explicit requirement for systematic consideration of the best interests of the child when applying educational, care or protection measures against the child, some of which include a placement in a closed institution of youth protection. The Youth Judge has nevertheless a list of factors to take into consideration such as the personality and maturity of the child, the family environment, previous measures taken against the child, the seriousness of the act etc. 57 In addition, the Act foresees that children should suffer minimum interference with their rights and freedoms as possible. Nevertheless, it is regrettable that the principle of best interests of the child is not more explicitly and systematically considered throughout the Youth Protection system. In Flanders , youth welfare services not only established the interest of the child as the primary consideration when providing assistance to youth, but they also explain how to determine the interest of the child. \u2018The interest of the child is determined in dialogue with the minor him/herself. An appropriate follow-up is provided for the minor's opinion, given her/his age and maturity. In determining the child's interest, the opinion and responsibility of the parents must be respected\u2019. 58 In contrast, in the French Community , the approach of the youth welfare services does not contain such a detailed obligation to consider the child\u2019s interest. Nevertheless, the services are required to respect the rights of the child and to act in their interests . 59 No requirement to consider the interests of the child in education has been identified. Nevertheless, Article 3 CRC and Article 7 CRPD directly apply in Belgium and can be invoked before Belgian Courts in relation to education matters. While the principle of best interests of the child is recognised in the legal framework, there 54 Article 2 of the Youth Protection Act. 55 Act of 15 December 1980 on access to the territory, residence, establishment and removal of non-nationals, Article 61/17. 56 Youth Protection Act of 8 April 1965, Preliminary Title. 57 Article 37 of the Youth Protection Act. 58 Article 5 of the Flemish Decree of 7 May 2004 on the minor status with regards to integrated youth welfare. 59 Article 4 of the French Community Decree of 4 March 1991 on youth welfare. 22 ",

For this research, only the Flemish Decree on the status of the minor in integrated youth welfare has been identified as providing specific requirements to ensure the implementation of the principle. 3.1.2. Non-discrimination (Art. 2 CRC; Arts. 3 and 5 CRPD) The Constitution guarantees the right to non-discrimination and equal treatment without specifying any grounds of discrimination. Article 10 establishes equality between all Belgian nationals, as well as men and women. Article 11 ensures that Belgians enjoy the rights and freedoms without discrimination. The Constitutional Court is competent to review legislation adopted by the Federal Communities and Regions Parliaments against rights and freedoms guaranteed by the Constitution, including Articles 10 and 11. 60 The right to non-discrimination on the grounds of disability is recognised and secured by the Anti-Discrimination Act . 61 The Act prohibits discrimination on the grounds of the following protected criteria: age , sexual orientation, marital status, birth, wealth, religious or philosophical belief, political conviction, trade union conviction, language, current or future health status, disability, physical or genetic characteristic , social origin. Under the Act, discrimination can take the following forms: \uf0b7 Direct discrimination; \uf0b7 Indirect discrimination; \uf0b7 An instruction to discriminate; \uf0b7 Harassment; \uf0b7 A refusal to implement reasonable accommodation for a person with disabilities. The Act prohibits direct and indirect discrimination. 62 Direct and indirect distinction made on one of the protected criteria will not be considered as discrimination if it is objectively justified by a legitimate aim, which can take the form of positive action . The scope of the Act is quite extensive as it applies to all persons in both the public and the private sector, including public bodies, in relation to: 1) access to and supply of goods and services available to the public; 2) social protection (social security and healthcare); 3) social benefits; 4) supplementary social security; 5) employment relations; 6) official document or an official report; 7) membership and involvement in an organisation of workers or employers; 8) access, participation and any other exercise of economic, social, cultural or political activity accessible to the public. This Act does not cover education, which is regulated under the Communities competence (see below). National legislation does not prevail over Community legislation as they cover different areas of competence. 60 Constitutional Court of Belgium website available at http://www.const-court.be/. 61 Act of 10 May 2007 combatting various form of discrimination. 62 Direct discrimination is understood as a direct distinction based on one of the protected criteria, which cannot be justified. A direct distinction results from the situation that occurs when on the grounds of one of the protected criteria, a person is treated less favourably than another person is, has been or would have been in a comparable situation. Indirect discrimination is defined as an indirect distinction based on one of the protected criteria, which cannot be justified. An indirect distinction results from the situation that occurs when a provision, criterion or practice neutral in appearance is likely to result, in comparison to others, in a particular disadvantage for persons characterised by one of the protected criteria. 23 ",
        "____________________________________________________________________________________________ Policy Department C: Citizens' Rights and Constitutional Affairs In the Flemish Community , the Decree on equal opportunities and treatment prohibits discrimination on the grounds of inter alia disability, health status, physical or genetic characteristics and age in the areas of education, health care, access to training, social benefits, access to goods and services available to the public, including housing and access and participation to economic, social, cultural and political activities. 63 In the French Community , the Decree combatting certain forms of discrimination prohibits discrimination on the grounds of inter alia disability and age. 64 It has a slightly more limited scope than its Flemish counterpart and applies to education, health policy, social benefits, employment and access to goods and services available to the public. Reasonable accommodation 65 Under the Anti-Discrimination Act, reasonable accommodation is understood as \u2018appropriate measures taken to answer concrete needs, to enable a person with a disability to access, participate and progress in the areas to which this Act applies, unless such measures would impose in respect to the person a disproportionate burden. This burden shall not be disproportionate when it is sufficiently remedied by measures existing within the framework of public policy conducted on persons with disabilities\u2019. 66 While all definitions contain similarities, there are certain discrepancies in the definition between the Communities. The definition of the French Community Decree is similar to that of the Anti-Discrimination Act. The Flemish Community Decree defines reasonable accommodation (\u2018adaptation\u2019) as \u2018any concrete measure of material or immaterial nature which neutralises the constraining influence of an unsuitable environment for the participation of a person with a disability\u2019. The Decree considers a denial of reasonable accommodation as discrimination \u2018when adjustments are rejected as they do not represent an undue burden or load which can be compensated adequately by existing measures\u2019. 67 The Protocol relating to the concept of reasonable accommodation in Belgium specifies this concept. 68 It establishes that an accommodation is \u2018a concrete measure that can neutralise the impact of a restrictive environment not adapted to the participation of persons with disabilities\u2019. To this end, the accommodation must: \uf0b7 Be efficient to enable persons with disabilities to participate effectively; \uf0b7 Allow equal participation of the person with disabilities; \uf0b7 Allow autonomous participation of the person with disabilities; \uf0b7 Ensure the safety of the person with disabilities. 63 Decree of 10 July 2008 on the equal opportunities and treatment Flemish policy. 64 Decree of 12 December 2008 combatting certain forms of discrimination. 65 The right to non-discrimination requires reasonable accommodation in the sense that \u2018necessary and appropriate modification and adjustments not imposing a disproportionate or undue burden, [must be made] where needed in a particular case, to ensure to persons with disabilities the enjoyment or exercise on an equal basis with others of all human rights and fundamental freedoms\u2019 (Article 2 CRPD). As a result, the application of the right to non-discrimination \u2018does not mean identical treatment\u2019, it may require \u2018taking special measures in order to diminish or eliminate conditions that cause discrimination\u2019. 66 Article 4(12\u00b0) of the Anti-Discrimination Act. 67 Article 19 Decree of 10 July 2008 on the equal opportunities and treatment Flemish policy. 68 Protocol between the Federal State, the Flemish Community, the French Community and the German-speaking Community, the Walloon Region, the Brussels Capital Region, the Common Community Commission, the French Community Commission for persons with disabilities relating to the concept of reasonable accommodation , available at http://www.ejustice.just.fgov.be/cgi/article body.pl?language=fr&caller=summary&pub date=2007\u00ad 09-20&numac=2007023335 (last accessed on 6 February 2013). 24 ",
        "____________________________________________________________________________________________ Country Report on Belgium for the Study on Member States' Policies for Children with Disabilities The character of reasonableness of the accommodation is evaluated using indicators including financial and organisational impact of the accommodation, the impact on the quality of life of users or disabled persons, as well as the absence of alternatives. 69 Persons who claim a breach of the right to non-discrimination on the grounds of disability may file a complaint before the CEOOR, which provides advice, support and mediation services. Persons, the CEOOR 70 and interests groups may also file an action for before Courts relying on the above legislation. The burden of proof is reversed; as a result, it is upon the defendant to prove that there was no discrimination. 71 A number of complaints have been received by the CEOOR on the grounds of discrimination due to the refusal or lack of reasonable accommodation (see section 4.4). Many of the refusals concern children with learning disorders (dyslexia, dyscalculia and dyspraxia) and children with autism. Those children may request to bring a computer to class (with a spelling corrector) or to have more time to pass exams or tests. The CEOOR often intervenes to offer conciliation and to explain what a reasonable accommodation entails and that it does not necessarily entail heavy investments. In practice, the requirement for reasonable accommodation is not always understood or well received (see section 4.2). Criminal liability Discrimination on the basis of the protected grounds, including disability, can lead to criminal sanctions . A person who encourages discrimination or incites hatred because of a protected criterion can be punished by imprisonment from one month to one year and a fine of fifty thousand euros, or one of these penalties. Accessibility The Anti-Discrimination Act does not establish a general requirement of accessibility , but prohibits discrimination in accessing goods and services only. 72 The issue of accessibility of persons with disabilities to public transport and buildings falls under Federal competence with regards to national transports (national railways, air and maritime transport) and under Regional competence with regards to buildings and transportation (buses). Anyone who applies for a permit for the construction or significant renovation of a building accessible to the public must respect the requirements for ensuring the access of persons with disabilities or reduced mobility to the building. However, the legal requirements do not apply to existing buildings. 73 In 2006, a plan was adopted by the Government to make 175 existing public buildings in Belgium accessible. 74 Regarding public transportation, transport companies must comply with national and Regional legislation.

The national rail company (NMBS/SNCB) offers various advantages to persons with disabilities. For example, persons with sight impairments and their guide dog can travel free of charge on trains, the accompanying person, in addition to free of charge assistance with the wheelchair and boarding the train. 76 Nevertheless, not all the railway stations are fully accessible yet (see section 4.2). 3.1.3. Evolving capacities of the child (Art. 5 CRC and Art. 3 CRPD) 77 While the concept of evolving capacities is not explicitly recognised in the Belgian legal framework, its components are recognised under various Acts, starting with the Constitution. The Constitution secures the right of each child to have their views given due weight in accordance with his or her age and maturity and the right of each child to benefit from measures and facilities which promote his or her development . Within the Youth Protection system, the Judge can order educative, care or protection measures with regard to child offenders or children in danger or need of protection. When ordering such measure, the judge must take into account the personality and the maturity of the child . 78 In addition, the Youth Protection Act recognises that child offenders are in a state of dependency where their level of development and maturity creates special needs that require listening, advice and assistance. A child unable to govern him/herself and to manage his/her property because of his/her severe intellectual disability can be placed under extended minority status . Severe intellectual disability is understood as a condition of mental or congenital impairment having started in early childhood, characterised by a lack of development of all intellectual, emotional and volitional capacities. The consequence of the extended minority status is that the child will be considered as a minor of less than 15 years old until his/her majority. The status can also be extended after the person has become an adult. 79 With respect to youth welfare , in the Flemish Community , a child, duly informed, has the right to freely consent to or refuse youth assistance. A child exercises his/her rights in an autonomous way provided he/she is capable of a reasonable assessment of their interests, given her/his age and maturity . The child of 12 years or more is assumed to be capable of a reasonable assessment of his/her interests. 80 In the French Community , individual youth welfare assistance can only be provided with the written consent of a child of 14 years of age or above. If the child is under 14 years of age, the consent of the 75 STIB accessibus, available at http://www.stib.be/Accessibus.html?l=fr (last accessed on 6 February 2013). 76 NMBS/SNCB website available at http://www.belgianrail.be/fr/service-clientele/voyageurs-a-mobilite\u00ad reduite.aspx (last accessed on 6 February 2013).

In light of the CRC, the concept of evolving capacities of the child entails that parents (or persons legally responsible) should have the right and the duty to provide, in a manner consistent with the evolving capacities of the child, appropriate guidance in the exercise by the child of his/her rights. See the report \u2018Study on Member States' Policies for Children with Disabilities\u2019 for more details on this concept. 78 Article 37 of the Youth Protection Act. 79 Article 487bis of the Civil Code. 80 Articles 4 and 5 of the Flemish Decree of 7 May 2004 on minors\u2019 status with regards to integrated youth welfare. 26 ",

In addition, in many cases the hearing of the child is conditioned to a specific age of the child in the law (see below section 3.1.4) and in practice, children below 12 of age are rarely heard. 3.1.4. The right to be heard/to participate (Art. 12 CRC; Arts. 7 and 30 CRPD) The Belgium Constitution recognises the right of the child to express his/her views on any question which concerns her/him. His/her opinion must be taken into account in accordance with the child\u2019s age and discernment. 82 Hence the right to participation and right to be heard are guaranteed in the Constitution. In formal judicial proceedings , there is no specific obligation for the judge to hear the child . Rather it is done on initiative of the judge, on a case-by-case basis. The judge may by a motivated decision decide to hear the child in Court, if (s)he deems it necessary. 83 Otherwise, the audio-visual recording of the interview will be used for the hearing of the child. The child has the possibility to request to be heard. Such request must be accepted, unless the public prosecutor or the judge, upon motivated decision, decides that the minor does not have the necessary discernment. In the case where the hearing is ordered by the judge, the minor may refuse to be heard. In any case, the child will be heard alone, unless the judge considers that it is the interests of the child to be assisted. The minor under the age of 15 cannot be heard under oath. As a result, the child\u2019s declaration will only be collected as information and not used as formal evidence. 84 In adoption proceedings, the child of at least 12 years of age must consent to his/her adoption. The consent is not required if the child of 12 years of age or above is under a status of prolonged minority or does not have the necessary discernment. 85 Similar provisions exist in matters of filiation 86 and guardianship . 87 The Youth Protection Act, which regulates the rights and procedures for the Youth Tribunal to deal with child suspects and children in danger or need of protection, guarantees the application of the rights and freedoms, including those set forth in the Constitution and the CRC. The right of the child to be heard during the process leading to decisions affecting them and to take part in this process is recognised, in addition to the special guarantees for children offenders explained in section 3.1.3. 88 In addition, the Youth Judge is required to personally hear children of 12 years old or above before any measures concerning/taken against the child is ordered, unless the health conditions of the child justify a waiving of this obligation or if the child refuses. 89 As a consequence of his/her lack of legal capacity, a child cannot file an action or perform legal acts on his/her own; only his/her legal representatives can do so. However, the Civil Code provides that in case of conflict between the child and his/her parents, the judge can 81 Article 7 of the French Community Decree of 4 March 1991 on youth welfare. 82 Article 22bis of the Constitution. 83 Article 100 CCP. 84 Article 931 of the Judicial Code. 85 Article 348.1 of the Civil Code. 86 Article 329bis of the Civil Code. 87 Article 394 of the Civil Code. 88 Preliminary title of the Youth Protection Act of 8 April 1965. 89 Article 52ter of the Youth Protection Act of 8 April 1965. 27 ",

This shortage results from insufficient budget and investments in structures for sign language interpretation and lack of recognition of the training and diploma giving access to sign language interpretation. 92 The right to participation is recognised in the Constitution, in addition to the direct applicability of Article 12 of the CRC and Articles 4 and 7 of the CRPD. Various laws and initiatives promote the participation of children in general and sometimes specifically of children with disabilities. For instance, the National Commission on the Rights of the Child must involve children in a structured and adapted manner. 93 In education, the Flemish Community 94 and the French Community 95 provides that school pupils must be included in the school councils and contribute to school policy. The aim of school should be to develop and encourage a participatory schooling environment. Several municipalities have established municipal councils for children and young people, where children and young people elect their representatives from each school of the municipalities. Child representatives can discuss various topics such as environment, security, cultural activities or humanitarian projects. 96 3.1.5. Freedom from violence (Art. 19 CRC; Art. 16 CRPD) The Constitution guarantees to each child the right to the respect of his/her moral, physical, psychological and sexual integrity. 97 The Criminal Code includes a specific chapter on offences against minors, vulnerable persons and the family. The neglect and abandonment of a child or a person vulnerable as a result of age, pregnancy, illness, infirmity or physical or mental disability, apparent or known by the offender is punished by imprisonment up to three years and a fine. 98 The sanction is more severe if as a result of neglect, the person or child remained severely mutilated, suffering from an incurable illness or has lost the use of an organ or if the neglect has caused death. The offence of intentionally depriving of food or care, to the point of compromising the health of a child or person vulnerable is similarly criminalised. 99 Abusing the vulnerability of a person, due to his/her age, physical or 90 Articles 378 and 410 of the Civil Code. 91 CRC Committee Concluding observations on Belgium report (CRC/C/BEL/CO/3-4), 18 June 2010, point 37. 92 Information collected through interview with the Belgian Disability Forum. 93 Article 10 of the Cooperation Agreement on the creation of the National Commission on the Rights of the Child, available at https://1168.fedimbo.belgium.be/sites/1168.fedimbo.belgium.be/files/accord de cooperation 0.pdf and National Commission on the Rights of the Child website https://1168.fedimbo.belgium.be/ (last accessed on 6 February 2013). 94 Decree of the Flemish Community of 2 April 2004 on participation at school. 95 Decree of the French Community of 24 July 1997 on the priority mission of primary and secondary education. 96 For example, see the municipal council for children and munitcipal council of young people of Li\u00e8ge at http://www.liege.be/jeunesse/le-conseil-communal-des-enfants and http://www.liege.be/jeunesse/ccjl. 97 Article 22bis of the Constitution. 98 Article 423 of the Criminal Code. 99 Articles 425 and 426 of the Criminal Code. 28 ",

This includes abusing the vulnerability of a person by selling or renting a good (including housing), making an abnormally high profit or leading a vulnerable person to carry out certain acts or abuse of their property. 100 The Criminal Code sanctions as an aggravating circumstance when some offences are carried out against a child , including molestation with or without violence, rape, prostitution of children, outrage to public decency, assault and voluntarily inflicting physical injuries, female genital mutilation, inhuman treatment, non-assistance to a person in danger. 101 For some of these offences, the Code provides for more severe sanctions the younger the child victim is. For example, rape against a child between 16 and 18 is sanctioned by imprisonment between five and 10 years, by imprisonment of between 15 and 20 years if against a child between 10 and 16, and by imprisonment between 20 and 30 years if against a child under 10. 102 It is also an aggravating circumstance if the motive of the crime is hatred, contempt or hostility towards a person because of inter alia his/her age, current state or future of health, disability , or physical or genetic characteristic or social origin. Such circumstances can lead to an increase of up to double the sanction. 103 As mentioned in section 3.1.2, encouragement to discrimination or incitement to hatred against a person or group of persons because of a protected criterion (including age and disability) can be punished by imprisonment and a fine. With regard to domestic violence , when police and judicial officers handle a domestic violence case, they must check whether any children are involved or present in the family and whether they have suffered any consequence as a result of the domestic violence. The presence of children must be recorded and sent to the public prosecutor in order to ensure appropriate follow-up. 104 In addition, the violent partner can be prohibited from entering, or staying near the residence of the victim, or coming into contact with the victim and persons living with the victim. 105 Specific assistance is in place to support child victims or witnesses of domestic violence, via specific centres and free helplines. 106 See more on the impact of violence on children with disabilities in section 3.2.2. Corporal punishment is prohibited in education since 1900. There are no general legal provisions prohibiting corporal punishment in Belgium. The criminal provisions sanctioning physical violence are considered applying in case of corporal punishment. In Flanders, corporal punishment, mental abuse or deprivation of food is prohibited in youth welfare institutions, including centres caring for children with disabilities. 107 Nevertheless, following a collective complaint from the World Organisation Against Torture, the European Committee of Social Rights condemned Belgium for lack of explicit prohibition of physical violence against children by their parents in violation of the European Social Charter. 108 100 Articles 433decies and 442quater of the Criminal Code. 101 Articles 372, 373, 375, 379, 385, 386, 405bis, 409, 417ter, 417 quater and 422bis of the Criminal Code. 102 Article 375 of the Criminal Code. 103 Articles 377bis, 405quater, 422quater, 438bis, 442ter, 453bis, 514bis, 525bis, 532bis and 534quater of the Criminal Code. 104 COL Circular No. 4/2006 of the College of Public Prosecutors of the Courts of Appeal, 1 March 2006. 105 Act of 15 May 2012 on temporary prohibition of residence in case of domestic violence. 106 Ecoute violences conjugales website available at http://www.ecouteviolencesconjugales.be/qui-peut\u00ad appeler.php (last accessed on 26 January 2013). 107 Articles 27 and 28 of the Decree of 7 May 2004 on the status of minors within the integrated youth welfare. 108 European Committee of Social Rigths, Complaint No. 21/2003 World Organisation against Torture (OMCT) v.

        "____________________________________________________________________________________________ Policy Department C: Citizens' Rights and Constitutional Affairs Social services are competent to intervene in case of child abuse or neglect. Specialised multidisciplinary teams 109 can assist the child and the family to find a solution or the Youth Judge can intervene to order specific measures for the protection of children. Finally, not helping a person in danger, which includes the absence of reporting a case of abuse, is considered as an offence and is sanctioned more severely by the Criminal Code where it concerns a child or a vulnerable person due to his/her disability. 110 3.1.6. Right to family life (Art. 9 CRC; Art. 23(3) CRPD) As already discussed, a high number of children with disabilities, in particular intellectual disabilities, are placed in residential care in Belgium. This is the result of the large support, including financial, provided to institutions and the fact that institutions are often presented as the solution to families with children with disabilities. 111 Family support exists (see section 3.1.7), but the information about such support is not always easily accessible and access to such assistance is in high demand leading to long waiting lists (see section 4.2). Everyone is guaranteed the respect of family life by the Constitution. 112 In case of separation of the parents , parental authority is exercised jointly; unless the judge decides that it is against the interest of the child. If one of the parents does not exercise parental authority, he/she maintains a personal relationship with the child. These relationships may be refused only for very serious reasons. Anyone who does not exercise authority retains the right to supervise the education of the child. 113 In the Flemish Community, youth welfare services must guarantee the right of the child not to be separated against his/her consent, unless a judicial decision orders otherwise. If youth welfare services decide to separate the child from his/her parent, the child retains the right to information and regular personal and direct contact with his/her family, unless it is contrary to his/her interests, or a court decision orders this. 114 Youth Tribunal measures should enable a family focused action, including limiting the distance between the location of the implementation of the measure and the child\u2019s home, unless the interest of the child requires otherwise. 115 Similar guarantees exist in the French Community 116 where measures and decisions taken by youth welfare services should support and foster as a priority the development of children in their family environment. 117 109 The Trust centre for child abuse ( Vertrouwenscentrum kindermishandeling ) providesassistance service for the child victim of abuse in Flanders.

Right to assistance (Art. 23 CRC; Arts. 23(5), 26 and 28 CRPD) The Constitution guarantees every child the right to benefit from measures and services that contribute to their development. It also recognises the right of everyone to lead a life in conformity with human dignity . To this end, the following rights are inter alia ensured: the right to social security, health and welfare, medical and legal protection; the right to decent housing; the right to cultural and social development. 118 Every family has the right to a monthly allowance for each child (until the child reaches 18 years of age) and a one-time special allowance upon the birth of a child. The extent of the allowance depends on the number of children in the family. 119 Families with children with disabilities can benefit from a supplementary family allowance , which can vary from EUR 79.17 to EUR 527.80 monthly. 120 To assess whether the child\u2019s family can benefit from the allowance, the situation of the child and the impact on the family will be verified: \uf0b7 Whether the disability has serious physical or mental consequences; \uf0b7 Whether the disability affects the child's daily activities; \uf0b7 Whether the disability has implications for the household. 121 The medical service of the General Direction for Persons with Disabilities verifies if the child satisfies the medical requirement to benefit from the allowance, and if granted, a child may receive it from birth to age 21. According to the Belgian National Institute for Social Security and Self-employed, 2,324 children aged 0 to 18 were receiving supplementary family allowances (due to a disability) for the first three months of 2012. 122 In addition to family allowances, families with a child with disabilities have the right to other benefits, including tax deductions. Parents of a child with disabilities can benefit from a reduced VAT when buying a car or adaptations of the car used to transport a child with certain type of disabilities (such as paralysis of the upper or lower body). 123 Belgium has a system of mandatory health insurance, which covers part of most main health costs. Persons with disabilities may apply for a specific status (status BIM and/or Omnio), where the health coverage will be more extensive. 124 Persons with disabilities, including children, can also receive a Personal Assistance Budget (PAB) . In Flanders , the PAB can vary between around EUR 9 000 to EUR 43 000 annually, depending on the nature and seriousness of the disability and the personal circumstances. 125 The PAB can be used for assistance at home or at school, for support in 118 Articles 22bis and 23 of the Constitution. 119 Articles 51 and 63 of the Coordinated laws on family allowances for employees 19 December 1939.

However, access to PAB is difficult due to long waiting lists (see section 4.2). Similarly in Wallonia , families of children with disabilities can apply for a PAB. Due to a lack of budget, access to PAB may take some time. As a result priority is given to persons with certain type of disabilities (progressive disabilities such as sclerosis or degenerative disease and those who have very limited autonomy). 126 In Brussels , children with disabilities from French speaking families can apply for individual integration assistance for adapting the house, communication support equipment, mobility support or other equipment. 127 Other types of support exist, such as programmes to support young people (16-25 years of age) to make the transition from school to work or individual assistance covering costs of adapted material or accommodation (Wallonia), accompaniment services for early childhood starting from the disability diagnosis date, and assistance for the inclusion of the child at school (Brussels) (see more details in sections 3.1.8 and 3.2.3). 128 In conclusion, the right to assistance is guaranteed in the Belgian legal framework at the Federal and Regional level. Children with disabilities and their families can benefit from various support and assistance, although it can be fragmented between the Federal and Regional level. Nevertheless, in practice, some problems exist in accessing the assistance. The International Federation for Human Rights (FIDH) submitted a collective complaint against Belgium before the Council of Europe European Committee of Social Rights in 2011. The complaint pertains to violation of the revised European Social Charter with respect to lack of effective access to social and medical assistance, social services and housing and shortage of care and accommodation solutions. While the collective complaint was introduced for the benefit of adults with disabilities, it notes that the issue of lack of accommodation options is also crucial for youth with disabilities. The number of applications for assistance has increased starting from the youngest age, given changes in lifestyle of families (one-parent family, separated parents, etc.) and the financial difficulties many of them face. Waiting lists for access to residential care and specialised structures for the care of children and adolescents are getting longer. 129 The Committee has declared the complaint admissible and the complaint is currently under review. 130 3.1.8. The right to inclusive education (Art. 28 CRC; Art. 24 CRPD) The Belgian Constitution guarantees the right to free education to all in the respect of fundamental rights and freedoms. 131 Access to education is free until the end of compulsory schooling.

As already mentioned, Belgium has a history of segregating children with disabilities in specialised schools . Starting in the 1950s, children with disabilities were educated in special classes within ordinary schools. However, the Act of 6 July 1970 created specialised schools for students with disabilities from age three to 21, where paramedical staff supported teachers. The creation of specialised schools was based inter alia on the demand of parents of children with disabilities to have their children educated in better-supported and organised structures. In 2010, it was estimated that, including all types of students (with and without disabilities), around 1 out of 20 students attend specialised schools in Belgium (for more data see section 3.2.3). 133 As education falls under Communities competences, the right to education is further detailed at Community level. Flemish Community Of all the Regions of Belgium, Flanders currently has the highest level of inclusive education. Nevertheless, specialised education remains strong and well organised. Special schools are organised according to 8 types of disability (the same classification exists in the French Community, see below). 134 \uf0b7 Type 1: Mild mental disability; \uf0b7 Type 2: Moderate or severe mental disability; \uf0b7 Type 3: Serious character and/or personality disorders; \uf0b7 Type 4: Physical impairments; \uf0b7 Type 5: Living in a medical institution; \uf0b7 Type 6: Visual impairment; \uf0b7 Type 7: Hearing impairment; \uf0b7 Type 8: Serious learning needs. Special education aims at providing education, on the basis of teaching, care and therapy tailored to students who cannot or insufficiently develop their full personality, either temporarily or continually, in mainstream education. 135 School support centres help to 132 Article 1 of Act of 29 June 1983 on compulsory schooling. 133 In 2010, around 4,6% students attended specialised education in the French Community. In Flanders, 0,79% kindergarten students attend specialised schools; 6,79% students attend primary specialised schools and 4,24% students attend special secondary education (for the academic year 2009-2010).

        "____________________________________________________________________________________________ Policy Department C: Citizens' Rights and Constitutional Affairs evaluate whether a child should attend specialised or inclusive education. 136 The Flemish government has established a system of integrated education where mainstream and special schools work together to provide children with disabilities and/or with learning and behavioural disorders classes or activities in a mainstream education school with assistance from special education (see data in section 3.2.3). 137 To this end, an integration plan must be prepared by consensus after consultation with the student and/or his/her parents. The integration can be full time or part-time (for at least two half days per week). The support can consist of peer support (team-oriented work); learner-centred work; parent-oriented work; planning; material adjustments or material assistance. Children with disabilities (or serious disease) of at least five years old can also receive temporarily or permanent education at home if they are not able to attend school for a while. It is organised in partnership with a school close to the child\u2019s home. 138 In addition, students with disabilities in mainstream schools can be exempt from attending certain classes or activities they are unable to follow due to their disabilities. 139 Every child has the right to register at the school of their parents\u2019 choice. If the child is 12 years old or older, the choice of the school must be made in consultation with the child. 140 Lastly, as mentioned in section 3.1.2, discrimination on the grounds of disability is prohibited in education. The right to non-discrimination also includes a right to reasonable accommodation for persons with disabilities, unless it is proven that no reasonable accommodation can be provided or would represent a disproportionate burden. 141 French Community Similarly to the Flemish Community, the French Community has established a special education system based on the same classification of 8 types of disabilities, where education is tailored to the type of disability needs and specific needs of each pupil. Children from two and a half years old until 21 years old can attend such special education. Children can attend a special education school following the preparation of a report by the psycho-medico-social centre which will specify which education type corresponds to his/her needs. The report is drawn up after a multidisciplinary assessment of the child. 142 Also as in Flanders, in 2009 a system of integrated education was established. 143 The system of integrated education allows children with disabilities to attend mainstream schools, on a part-time or full time basis, temporarily or permanently; either by attending 136 School support centres ( Centra voor Leerlingenbegeleiding ) website available at http://www.ond.vlaanderen.be/clb/ (last accessed on 5 February 2013). 137 Circular Integrated Education GD/2003/5 ( Omzendbrief Ge\u00efntegreerd onderwijs ), available at http://www.ond.vlaanderen.be/edulex/database/document/document.asp?docid=13422 (last accessed on 5 February 2013). 138 Articles 34 and 35 of the Decree of the Flemish Community of 25 February 1997 on basic education.

Specific support is available to children with disabilities who want to benefit from a permanent integration in a mainstream primary or secondary school, which includes free transportation between home and school. Each pupil can benefit from a period of support organised by special education teachers according to the needs of the child and disability type. Temporary or permanent education at home is also available for children with severe disabilities or illness in the French Community, where the child is not able to move or go to school using transportation means. The education will be carried out by a special school close to the home of the child. 144 Children with disabilities are protected from discrimination on the grounds of disability in education and benefit from a right to reasonable accommodation (see section 3.1.2). It is noted that schools in the Brussels Region may be affiliated either to the French Community, the Flemish Community or the Brussels French Community Commission (COCOF). 145 German Community Where it is established that a child needs educational support, the psycho-medico-social centre, after evaluating the child, will suggest that the child attend a special school or that specialised support is organised. If the parents want to register a child with special needs to a mainstream school, a multidisciplinary \u2018conference\u2019 will be convened to assess the support measures needed for the child. The decision will be made on the basis of the individual needs of the child in accordance with the CRPD and must be motivated in details. The decision of the mainstream school on the registration or refusal to register must be fully motivated and detail the means to provide the support to the child. 146 In conclusion, while Belgium has a strong special education system, efforts have been made in all the Communities to guarantee inclusive education to children with disabilities. However, in practice the number of children attending mainstream schools remains low and children face a number of difficulties to access them (see section 3.2.3). 3.2. Specific issues faced by children with disabilities 3.2.1. Gender vulnerability The right to equality between men and women is recognised in the Belgian Constitution and the Act combating discrimination between men and women prohibits discrimination based on sex in the public and private sectors. 147 There are no clear rules with regard to sterilisation of girls with disabilities in Belgium. While sterilisation is not prohibited, doctors having practiced sterilisation could be sued for voluntary harm under the Criminal Code. No sterilisation programme exists, nor is the 144 Article 159-164 of the Decree of the French Community of 3 March 2004 on special education. 145 Since schools affiliated to the COCOF are limited in numbers, this report will not cover COCOF regulations.

Authorities focus their efforts on contraception methods for girls with disabilities. According to some reports, some institutions would recommend the sterilisation of women with disabilities before accepting their placement. It is not clear whether this practice applies to children and is still occurring. 148 A bill was drafted in 2003 to regulate sterilisation, which could only be carried out on adults, but it has not been approved yet. 149 A Belgian expert estimates that 40% of women with intellectual disabilities are abused within their lifetime. 150 However, no data has been identified to support this assertion. The percentage of boys in specialised education amounts to around 63% against 37% of girls. The overrepresentation of boys concerns particularly the so-called type 3, which relates to behavioural and personality disorder, where the percentage of boys reaches 81%. One of the explanations put forward for such difference is that girls are more open to the socialisation required at school (to obey, listen and stay calm), while boys would experience more difficulties with the schooling system. 151 3.2.2. Violence While it is widely recognised that children with disabilities are particularly vulnerable to abuse and violence, no data is available in Belgium to understand the scope of the problem. In Flanders, the Flemish trust centres for child abuse received notification of 9402 cases of children abused or neglected in 2010 (the presence of disability is not specified). 152 Mortality resulting from abuse of children is higher in Belgium than in most OECD countries and abuse is the second cause of infant mortality in Flanders. 153 As mentioned in section 3.1.5, specific assistance is available to support child victims or witnesses of domestic violence , via specific centres and free help lines. 154 Prosecution offices in the country have registered about 50,000 cases in 2010. On the ground, managers of centres assisting victims of domestic violence have noticed that they welcome today daughters of victims they assisted 20-25 years ago. This fact shows the importance of dealing with child victims and witnesses of domestic violence, as it could lead to an intergenerational reproduction of such victimisation. 155 The National Plan on combating violence between partners and other forms of intra-familial violence 2010-2014 acknowledges the consequences on the development of the child to witness domestic 148 Information collected via an interview with the Belgian Disability Forum referring to a study carried out in 1999. 149 Proposed legislation on contraceptive and therapeutic sterilisation, 12 December 2003, available at http://www.dgde.cfwb.be/fileadmin/sites/dgde/upload/dgde super editor/dgde editor/documents/A Moi/chap 13 /Proposition de loi - sterilisation.pdf (last accessed on 26 January 2013). 150 Inclusion Europe, \u2018Children\u2019s Rights for All: Monitoring the Implementation of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child for Children with Intellectual Disabilities \u2013 National Report of Belgium\u2019, available at http://inclusion\u00ad europe.org/images/stories/documents/Project CRC/Results/National Reports/Belgium EN.pdf (last accessed on 26 January 2013). 151 Trialogue Magasine, File Special education, 2010, available at http://www.fapeo.be/wp\u00ad content/Publications/Trialogue/tria 57.pdf (last accessed on 2 February 2013). 152 Kinderrechtencommissariaat, \u2018Violence, reported and counted\u2019 ( Geweld, gemeld en geteld ), available at http://www.kinderrechtencommissariaat.be/publications/detail/geweld-gemeld-en-geteld (last accessed on 26 January 2013). 153 Alternative report by NGOs on the implementation of the CRC, March 2010, p.27. 154 Ecoute violences conjugales website available at http://www.ecouteviolencesconjugales.be/qui-peut\u00ad appeler.php (last accessed on 26 January 2013). 155 Amnesty International, \u2018Domestic violence: state of affairs in Belgium ?\u2019 ( Violences conjugales : o\u00f9 en est la belgique \u00e0 l\u2019heure actuelle ? ), available at http://www.amnestyinternational.be/doc/les-blogs/le-blog-de-claire\u00ad pecheux/article/violences-conjugales-ou-en-est-la (last accessed on 26 January 2013). 36 ",

Studies and actors on the ground confirm that abuse against children with disabilities exists in residential care in Belgium. However, it is also noted that this problematic is not taboo anymore and some prevention initiatives have been adopted. The STOP project and the \u2018 over grenzen \u2019 (\u2018across borders\u2019) awareness raising initiatives are examples of prevention measures. 158 Nevertheless, there is no systematic approach on how to prevent and deal with abuse. Some institutions promote awareness raising and include reproductive education in their curriculum, while others take no initiatives. 3.2.3. Children as vulnerable suspects In Belgium, the age of criminal responsibility is set at 18 years old . 159 As a result, a child does not commit crimes under the Belgium system; rather they commit acts qualified as an offence, for which a specialised jurisdiction, the Youth Tribunal, is competent to order measures of protection, care and/or education. However, such measures can amount to deprivation of liberty in a closed educational centre or institution of youth protection. There is no minimum age to which the juvenile protection system applies. It is up to the public prosecutor to decide whether or not to send a child before the Youth Tribunal. In practice, a child under 10 or 12 is rarely prosecuted. 160 There are two exceptions to the criminal liability rule: 1) the declining of jurisdiction from the Youth Tribunal and deferral to adult criminal law 161 and 2) frequent traffic offences. 162 1) For children between the age of 16 and 18, when the Youth Tribunal considers that a protection measure is not appropriate, it will relinquish its jurisdiction and defer the case for the child to be judged under adult criminal law. The decision is made in consideration of the child and the seriousness of the offence, taking into account the degree of maturity of the child and his/her personality. To this end, a psychosocial investigation must be carried out. The deferral can occur if at least one of the following conditions is fulfilled: \uf0b7 If the child has already been the subject of a protection measure by the tribunal; or \uf0b7 It relates to a serious offence, including murder, murder attempt, sexual abuse, physical assault resulting in lasting physical injuries, torture or violent theft. 156 National Plan on combatting violence between partners and other forms of intra-familial violence 2010-2014, available at http://igvm-iefh.belgium.be/fr/binaries/101123-PAN%20FR tcm337-113078.pdf (last accessed on 26 January 2013). 157 UNICEF study Violence against Children in care and justice institutions, available at http://www.unicef.org/violencestudy/5.%20World%20Report%20on%20Violence%20against%20Children.pdf (last accessed on 26 January 2013). 158 Inclusion Europe, \u2018Children\u2019s Rights for All: Monitoring the Implementation of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child for Children with Intellectual Disabilities \u2013 National Report of Belgium\u2019, available at http://inclusion- europe.org/images/stories/documents/Project_CRC/Results/National_Reports/Belgium_EN.pdf (last accessed on 26 January 2013) and CRC Committee Concluding observations on Belgium report (CRC/C/BEL/CO/3-4), 18 June 2010, point 473. 159 Article 36 (4\u00b0) of the Youth Protection Act of 8 April 1965. 160 Johan Put, \u2018The Juvenile Justice System in Belgium\u2019, in Juvenile Justice Systems in Europe: Current Situation and Reform Developments , Volume 1, p.6. 161 Article 57bis of the Youth Protection Act of 8 April 1965. 162 Article 36bis of the Youth Protection Act of 8 April 1965. 37 ",
        "____________________________________________________________________________________________ Policy Department C: Citizens' Rights and Constitutional Affairs When the deferral relates to a misdemeanour or crime, the case will be sent before a special chamber applying adult criminal law within the Youth Tribunal. For serious crimes, the Court of Assize is competent and will be composed of at least two judges with specific training. The declining of jurisdiction concerns between 96 - 294 cases per year. 163 2) Adult jurisdictions are competent for children, between the age of 16 and 18, suspect of traffic offences, including homicide and involuntary injury related to traffic offence, and provisions on mandatory car insurance. The adult jurisdiction has the possibility to refer the minor back to the Youth Tribunal if youth protection measures are more appropriate. As a result of these rules, in the event where a child with physical disabilities is suspected of a crime, he/she will fall under the competence of the Youth Tribunal unless the Tribunal decides to refer the child to be judged under adult criminal law. No distinction is made on whether or not the child has a disability during the proceedings, but the disability can be taken into consideration by the judge in his/her decision. As mentioned in section 3.1.4, children of 12 of age or above have the right to be heard. However, it is noted that in practice the lack of sign language interpreters can be a barrier to the implementation of the right. For children with intellectual disabilities , the Criminal Code states that a person is not held accountable when the suspect, at the time of the offence, had an intellectual or psychosocial disorder which seriously affected his/her discernment. 164 In this case, after psychiatric expertise, the person can be placed in psychiatric services. 165 The Youth Judge is solely competent to take decisions. The judge can take protection measures towards the child or, as a matter of emergency, place the child in observation in a psychiatric service for a maximum 40 days. After the 40 days, the Judge can decide that continued treatment is necessary and the child will remain in psychiatric services or, after a report from a doctor, the Judge can order any measures from the youth protection system (measure of care, protection or education). 166 Such measures can consist of (non-exhaustive list): \uf0b7 Monitoring of the child by the competent social service; \uf0b7 Intensive educational support and individualised coaching by an educator; \uf0b7 Outpatient treatment with a psychological or psychiatric service, sex education or a service competent in the field of alcoholism or drug abuse; \uf0b7 To entrust the child to a trustworthy person or placement in an appropriate facility for their housing, their treatment, their education or their training; \uf0b7 To entrust them to a Community institution of public youth protection in a closed or open environment; \uf0b7 Placement in a hospital; \uf0b7 Residential placement in an institution specialised in alcoholism, drug addiction or any other addiction; 163 In 2007, the number of children convicted in court as adult amounted to 294 (Committee on the Rights of the Child, Written replies by the Government of Belgium to the list of issues prepared by the Committee, Document CRC/C/BEL/Q/3-4/Add.1).

Police officers do not receive specific training on how to handle children in general, with the exception of officers specially trained on interviewing child victims and witnesses. As a result, cases have been reported where a teenager with a light intellectual disability brought for questioning by the police was refused the presence of a person of trust. 169 3.2.4. Inclusive education As mentioned above, special education is highly organised in Belgium and remains a strong option for children with disabilities. No national data has been identified on children with disabilities in education. Data on pupils with special educational (SEN) needs however provide a snapshot of the situation in Belgium. In 2010, out of 1,559,057 pupils in compulsory education; 85 329 pupils had special educational needs. 76 864 SEN pupils attended segregated special schools, which amounts to around 90% of SEN pupils attending special education. 170 Nevertheless, as noted in section 3.1.8, in recent years, efforts have been made towards the inclusion of children with disabilities in mainstream education. A system of progressive inclusion of children from specialised education to mainstream education has been established in both French and Flemish Community to progressively integrate the child into mainstream school. A child can share the week between a mainstream and a specialised school. At the end of the temporary part-time inclusion experience, the child can either keep this part-time inclusion or fully integrate a mainstream or special school. In Flanders, as mentioned in section 3.1.8, children with disabilities from special schools have the possibility to attend, temporarily or permanently, part-time or full time, classes or activities in mainstream schools with the support of special education. In Flanders, for the academic year 2010-2011, 11 678 students benefited from this option, including 1 715 in kindergarten (64.7% of which were boys/35.3% girls), 4.809 in primary education (75.1% boys /24.9% girls) and 4.741 in secondary education (77.9% boys /22.1% girls). 171 It is reported that more than 30,000 pupils attend special education in the French Community of Belgium. The majority of those pupils attending special education are regrouped in type 1 special education, for mild intellectual disabilities (25.6%) and type 8 aimed at behavioural disorder (35.4%). Since type 8 does not exist in secondary education, type 1 special education welcomes a greater number of pupils with disabilities in secondary 167 Article 37 of the Youth Protection Act. 168 Alternative report by NGOs on the implementation of the CRC, p.37. 169 Kinderrechtencommissariaat Annual Report 2010-2011, available at http://www.kinderrechtencommissariaat.be/sites/default/files/bestanden/kinderrechtencommissariaat jaarverslag 2010 2011 webversie.pdf (last accessed on 26 January 2013), p.112. 170 EU press release \u2018Special needs children and disabled adults still getting a raw deal from education\u2019, available at http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release IP-12-761 en.htm (last accessed on 6 February 2013). 171 Belgium 1st Periodic Report on the implementation of the CRPD, 2011, available at http://www.ohchr.org/EN/HRBodies/CRPD/Pages/futuresessions.aspx (last accessed on 5 February 2013). 39 ",

As a result, not all children with disabilities participate in education. In a survey in (semi-) boarding schools and special education in Flanders, 1881 children and adolescents (age 2.5 to 21 years old) with severe intellectual disabilities and sensory limitations were identified. 23.5% of these children and young people did not go to school, but attending a care facility instead. 174 While the number of children with disabilities in mainstream education has increased in recent years, (in the French Community, attendance increased from 500 for the school year 2009-2010 to 1 100 in 2010-2011), schools in general are not equipped to inclusive education. Teachers in general lack training on the needs and care of children with disabilities. Buildings are generally not adapted either. It is estimated that up to 90% of schools buildings are not accessible to children with disabilities. 175 Reasonable accommodation remains a largely misunderstood right and it sometimes perceived as an advantage rather than a right (see section 4.2). Most of the complaints on discrimination in education received by the CEOOR concerned the refusal of reasonable accommodation (see section 4.4). The recognition of learning disorder as a disability, and consequently benefiting from the legislation on non-discrimination is not always evident in practice, by fear of stigmatisation of the students or misinterpretation of the legislation. 176 Other issues reported with regard to education relate to the lack of actual choice of schools. Often special education is presented as the only solution, or no mainstream schools are equipped to welcome the child near the child\u2019s home, partly due to insufficient support, leading the parents to turn to special education. Especially children with specific needs, such as those with autism or behaviour disorders, which are difficult for a school to handle, have difficulties finding an adequate school. 177 See more details in section 1.2. The difficulty to find an adequate school for the child, often results in the child attending a school far from home. In 2010, it was reported that in the Walloon Brabant province alone, 137 children spent more than 3 hours in the bus to go to and from schools, for a six hour school day (three hours on Wednesdays). These long transport journeys are an important concern for children and their families. 178 172 Sebasti\u00e1n Franco, School and disability: Special education or classes relegation?

Other particular issues faced by children with disabilities in Belgium The group of children with disabilities identified as particularly vulnerable are those from disadvantaged households . According to data compiled by ANED, the proportion of persons with disabilities (aged 16-59) living in households\u2019 at-risk-of-poverty or social exclusion in Belgium was 28.9%, compared to 7.7% for non-disabled people in 2009 (31.0% for men with disabilities and 27.2% for women with disabilities). 179 Education indicators show an overrepresentation of disadvantaged children in the special needs education system. A child living in a very poor district is four times more likely to be oriented to the special needs education system. This risk is increased to eight in cases of mild disability. However, it is noted that most affected children have no specific disability detected. As a result of their social, economic and/or cultural vulnerability, they have accumulated difficulties and delays to which mainstream education has failed to respond. 180 The economic crisis does not seem to have had an impact on budget allocated to services to children with disabilities in Belgium, although it has had an impact on the economic situation of families with children with disabilities themselves. The identification of persons with disabilities as most vulnerable to the economic crisis seems to have led to an increase in disability benefits. 181 Nevertheless, actors on the ground fear cuts in the coming years. 182 For other issues, see section 4.2. 179 ANED Facts and Figures, available at http://www.disability-europe.net/content/facts-and-figures-21 (last accessed on 26 January 2013). 180 Alternative report by NGOs on the implementation of the CRC, March 2010, http://www.lacode.be/IMG/pdf/Alternative Report by the NGO s on the implementation of the UN CRC in B elgium - 2010.pdf (last accessed 26 January 2013), p.50. 181 Assessing the impact of European governments\u2019 austerity plans on the rights of people with disabilities, available at http://www.efc.be/news events/Pages/austerity-measures.aspx (last accessed on 25 January 2013), p.13 and 86. 182 Information collected via interviews. 41 ",

ASSESSMENT OF THE PRACTICAL IMPLEMENTATION OF THE RIGHTS AND LEGAL PRINCIPLES KEY FINDINGS \uf0b7 The legal representative of a child with disabilities can turn to either judicial proceedings or complaint and mediating mechanisms to seek redress from violation of their child\u2019s rights. \uf0b7 The main gaps identified in relation to the practical implementation relate to the misunderstanding of the right to reasonable accommodation; obstacles to accessibility and long waiting list to access assistance. \uf0b7 There are a number of best practices aiming at raising awareness of the situation of children with disabilities, on improving the inclusion of persons with disabilities in society, as well jurisprudence advancing the right to reasonable accommodation. \uf0b7 There is a lack of data collected and segregated on the presence of a disability and age. However, Ombudsmen and the CEOOR collect data on the complaints they receive from children with disabilities and their parents. \uf0b7 Recommendations pertain mostly to education: right to freely choose the school, school transportation and care at school, but also to participation in society. 4.1. Enforcement and reporting mechanisms Enforcement mechanisms As mentioned in section 3.1.2, the Constitutional Court is competent to review legislation against rights and freedoms guaranteed by the Constitution, including Articles 10 and 11. The Constitutional Court can either be seized by a Court or Tribunal for a preliminary question on the conformity of a legal provision with the Constitution; or, the Council of Ministers and the governments of the communities and Regions or the presidents of all legislative assemblies, at the request of two-thirds of their members can file a action for annulment. Persons (including Belgians as well as foreign nationals, or a public or private organisations) can challenge a legislation if they are personally, directly and unfavourably affected by it. 183 The right to legal protection is a constitutional right. 184 Children with disabilities\u2019 legal representatives can file an action before Courts and Tribunals for violation of their rights. Victims, adults and children have the right to a legal counsel, assistance and representation. There are two forms of legal aid: primary and secondary legal aid.

Complaint mechanisms Both the General Delegate for the Rights of the Child (French Community) and the Children Rights Commissioner (Flemish Community) have the mission to defend and promote the rights and interests of children. They are competent to verify the correct application of laws and regulations concerning children and they can receive information, complaints or requests for mediation or investigations relating to infringements of children\u2019s rights and interests. 186 The Federal Ombudsman is competent to examine complaints from citizens and to investigate how the Federal administrative authorities act. The Federal Ombudsman may receive complaints from children and persons with disabilities (see section 2.2.2). 187 The Centre for Equal Opportunity and Opposition to Racism is competent to receive complaints from any victim of discrimination on the grounds of disability, including children. The Centre may provide advice, support and mediation services. 188 4.2. Gaps, problems and issues in the implementation As developed in this report, the situation of children with disabilities falls under the competence of the Federal and Regional authorities, which results in fragmented legislation and policies . While many policies converge and cooperation agreements between the Federal and Regional authorities ensure the convergence of some aspects of the policies, discrepancies exist between the different Regions of the country. The fragmentation of competences and multiplication of actors leads to a duplication of procedures for seeking assistance and bureaucratic burden on parents and families. In addition, discrepancies exist in the level of inclusiveness from Region to Region. As noted in section 3.1.2, while, in recent years, there has been an improvement in accessibility of persons with disabilities to public transports and buildings, lack of accessibility remains challenging. In 2011, it was assessed that only 13 (out of around 543) railway stations were fully accessible in Belgium. 189 In the management contract of the national railway company for 2008-2012, it is indicated that 52 stations must be fully accessible by 2012 and all the railway stations by 2028. 190 185 Article 54bis of the Youth Protection Act of 8 April 1965. 186 Webistes of the Delegate General for the Rights of the Child ( D\u00e9l\u00e9gu\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9ral aux droits de l\u2019enfant ) available at http://www.dgde.cfwb.be/index.php?id=2109 and of the Children Rights Commissionner ( kinderrechtencommissaris ) http://www.kinderrechtencommissariaat.be (last accessed on 18 November 2012). 187 Website of the Office of the Federal Ombudsamn available at http://www.federalombudsman.be/homepage (last accessed 18 November 2012).

        "____________________________________________________________________________________________ Policy Department C: Citizens' Rights and Constitutional Affairs The notion of reasonable accommodation is, more often than not, misunderstood and not well received or the accommodation is perceived as a privilege offered to the person with disabilities as rather than a right. 191 With respect to children with special education needs, complaints have been received by the CEOOR of refusal to accommodate examination procedures to allow the child more time to pass tests or exams. Reasonable accommodation can also be perceived as necessarily implying investments and costs; while reasonable accommodation does not require a school to renovate its entire buildings to be accessible; but rather to accommodate the child with disabilities by ensuring that his/her classes are held on the ground floor and that a ramp allows the access to the cafeteria. While inclusion of children with disabilities in mainstream school is increasing, most schools are not yet adapted to welcome children with disabilities. Many buildings, including newly constructed ones, are not accessible. In addition, most of the teachers are not trained in handling children with specific needs. 192 Even though the legislation comprehensively protects the rights of children with disabilities, their full implementation depends on adequate budget allocation . For example, the lack of funding for sign language interpretation structure leads to a lack of sign language interpreters in judicial proceedings and a gap in ensuring the right to be heard. Low budgets also result in long waiting lists for access to assistance as explained below. Waiting lists to access services or placement in a medico-pedagogic institution are particularly problematic. Some children wait months, sometimes years, for a place in a specialised institution. In response to long waiting lists in Flanders, a bottleneck file ( knelpuntdossier ) system was created for difficult cases to receive more attention and priority on the waiting list. However, the ombudsman received complaints, which indicate that despite the bottleneck file, children with complex problems stay on the waiting list. The fact that a difficult case receives priority does not guarantee admission to a school or a service. The difficulty in finding placement relates to the fact that institutions feel those children do not fit into the community, they are not competent/trained to welcome and care for them or that there is no school nearby. The age can also be a reason for difficulty of placement as preference is given to young children based on the idea that they are still able to travel along a path. A long-term solution is needed for the care of children with complex needs. 193 Similar waiting lists exist for receiving support via the Personal Assistance Budget (PAB). It has been recorded that more than 5,500 persons (adults and children) are waiting for such assistance in Flanders. 194 Some children qualify to receive the Personal Assistance Budget faster: children with neuromuscular disease or a metabolic fast- degenerative disease if they meet the criteria for accessing the support. The issue of waiting lists for access to PAB and placement in residential care is not isolated to Flanders and occurs also in Wallonia and Brussels. Access to accompaniment assistance and support, as well as to early childhood and residential care is reportedly particularly difficult in Brussels. 195 One reason whereby assistance to children with disabilities can be refuse is the 191 La Libre Belgique, \u2018A society not yet adapted to persons with disabilities\u2019 (\u2018 Une soci\u00e9t\u00e9 pas encore adapt\u00e9e aux handicap\u00e9s\u2019 ), available at http://www.lalibre.be/actu/belgique/article/733960/une-societe-pas-encore-adaptee\u00ad aux-handicapes.html (last accessed on 24 January 2013). 192 Ibidem and information collected via interview with the CEOOR. 193 Kinderrechtencommissariaat, Annual Report 2010-2011, available at http://www.kinderrechtencommissariaat.be/publications/detail/jaarverslag-kinderrechtencommissariaat-1 (last accessed on 24 January 2013), p.54. 194 Assessing the impact of European governments\u2019 austerity plans on the rights of people with disabilities, available at http://www.efc.be/news events/Pages/austerity-measures.aspx (last accessed on 25 January 2013), p.15 and http://www.10jaarpab.be/rapport/standvanzaken/ (last accessed on 25 January 2013). 195 Information collected via interview with a General Delegate for the Rights of the Child associate. 44 ",

Police station and courthouses lack generally accessibility, despite being public buildings. The staff, police and judicial officers lack training and awareness on how to respond to the child\u2019s needs. As mentioned in section 3.1.4, there is a lack of sign language interpreters. Even ombudsman services are not always easily accessible to children with disabilities. 197 Other gaps reported include the exclusion of Down syndrome children from family insurance, the particular difficulty to integrate children with intellectual disabilities after a certain age, lack of teachers\u2019 training in dealing with children with disabilities, difficulties to access early childhood services or care centre availability especially for children with multiple disabilities, autism or behaviour disorder. 198 4.3. Best practices There are a number of best practices developed from public or private initiatives in Belgium. This section only aims at providing a snapshot of best practices established. Belgian legislation guarantees the right to non-discrimination on the grounds of disability to a wide range of areas and requires the provision of reasonable accommodation . The CEOOR can support children with disabilities and their families into negotiating reasonable accommodation with the stakeholder (such as a school or an attraction park). In case such mediation does not lead to a satisfactory solution, action can be taken before Courts. Courts have a role to play in establishing jurisprudence setting the requirement to reasonable accommodation to high standards. This was the case of the Tribunal of First Instance of Ghent, later confirmed by the Court of Appeal, where parents of four children with hearing impairments filed an action against the Flemish Minister for Education and several schools on the basis of the refusal from the lack of sign language interpretation for half of the classes. As a result, children with hearing impairments could access education only for half of the time. The Tribunal condemned the Flemish Government to ensure sign language interpretation for at least 70% of the time spent in class . The Court of Appeal confirmed the decision and rejected the justification of the Flemish Government that there are not enough sign language interpreters to meet the demand, considering that the Netherlands was able to ensure sign language interpretation in school at 100%. 199 In 2003, sign language has been recognised in the French Community of Belgium as the language of persons with hearing impairments. 200 The school Sainte-Marie in Namur ensures a bilingual education in French and sign language to children with and without hearing impairments. The project receives the support of public and private funding. It represents a good practice in a country where specialised education still remains the norm 196 Ibid. 197 Information collected via an interview with the Belgian Disability Forum. 198 Information collected through interview with the various stakeholders. 199 Information collected via an interview with the Belgian Disability Forum and CEOOR Article, \u2018A victory for inclusive education\u2019, available at http://www.diversite.be/index.php?action=artikel detail&artikel=575 (last accessed on 25 January 2013). 200 Decree of the French Community of 22 October 2003 on the recognition of the sign language, available in French at http://www.gallilex.cfwb.be/document/pdf/28210_000.pdf (last accessed on 25 January 2013). 45 ",

Each municipality can apply to receive the label \u2018handycity\u2019 recognising the effort of the municipality to include a \u2018person with disabilities\u2019 dimension in the municipality\u2019s projects and their investments in terms of inclusion. 204 4.4. Data and monitoring mechanisms Various monitoring mechanisms exist in Belgium at the Federal and Regional level. Both the General Delegate for the Rights of the Child (French Community) and the Children Rights Commissioner (Flemish Community) are competent to verify the correct application of laws and regulations concerning children and to make recommendations to the Government, Parliament and any competent authority to adapt the regulations. 205 The Centre for Equal Opportunity and Opposition to Racism is the focal point for the implementation of the CRPD in accordance with Article 33(2) of the CRPD (independent mechanism of protection, promotion and monitoring of the CRPD application). In addition, the CEOOR is competent to receive complaints, reporting, provide advice, support and mediation services for any victim of discrimination on the grounds of disability. 206 Since matters related to disability fall under Federal and Regional competences, statistics are collected on different levels. The lack of coordination and lack of uniform definition of \u2018disability\u2019 results makes access to data on disability issues difficult. 207 However, the SPF Economy, the CEOOR and Regional agencies collect some relevant data. 201 School and Deafness ( Projet \u00e9cole et surdit\u00e9 ), available in French at http://www.ecoleetsurdite.be/?es=EspritGeneral and http://www.lalibre.be/actu/belgique/article/296202/comment-integrer-les-enfants-sourds.html (last accessed on 25 January 2013). 202 The database on accessibility is available at www.toevla.be.

        "____________________________________________________________________________________________ Country Report on Belgium for the Study on Member States' Policies for Children with Disabilities In 2011, the CEOOR noted an increase of reporting for discrimination on the grounds of disability, accounting for one case out of five received by the Centre (one out four if include cases related to health). 208 In 2011 alone, 320 cases, from adults and children, were dealt by the CEOOR on the grounds of disability. Overall, in 2011 disability has become the first \u2018non-racial\u2019 motives of complaints. 209 Within all the complaints to the CEOOR by legal representatives on behalf of children for the years 2008-2011 , about 10% were on the basis of disability . Most cases concerned issues with regard to education (70 cases out of 104) at all levels (pre-school, primary and secondary). Within the cases dealing with discrimination in education, most of the cases were related to refusal or lack of reasonable accommodation (29 cases), which is considered discriminatory under Belgian law as explained in section 3.1.2. Other cases concerned various issues such as refusal to register at the school of choice (7 cases) or exclusion of a child with disability from a mainstream school (3 cases) or reorientation to specialised school against the family\u2019s wishes (3 cases), harassment from students or teachers in mainstream schools, stigmatisation and not taking into consideration of the needs resulting from the disability (6 cases) or inclusion difficulties (3 cases). A certain numbers of cases (9 cases) related to the issue of school transportation, mostly with regards to long journeys, inadequate travel conditions and lack of accompaniment or exclusion from transport due to behavioural or physical disorders. The other cases concerned issues such as access to assistance for equipment by public authorities (2 cases); concerns from neighbours or people bothered by the presence of a child with severe disabilities or autism (4 cases); access to welfare housing adapted to children with disabilities (such as housing on the ground floor) (3 cases); refusal to register a child with disabilities to summer activities, sport activities or a playground on the motives that the child would disturb the group (mostly regarding children with autism) (9 cases); inappropriate behaviour when assisting children with disabilities in health care facilities or even excluding them from the health care facility (2 cases); exclusion of children with disabilities from family insurance or not being able to open an online bank account (2 cases); parents feeling discriminated at work and encountering difficulties to obtain accommodation, such as a flexible schedule, in order to take care of their child with disabilities (discrimination by association) (4 cases); lack of space in day care or institutions adapted to the needs of the child (6 cases); or media using words perceived as offensive or stigmatising towards children with autism or Down syndrome (2 cases). 210 The Delegate General for the Rights of the Child (French Community) and the Children Rights Commissioner (Flemish Community) both receive reporting and complaints from children on the violation of their rights. The Children Rights Commissioner notes in its 2010-2011 annual report that 7 out of 1077 of such reporting and complaints related to assistance to children with disabilities for that period and 246 of the complaints and reporting related to education (from children with and without disabilities). 211 The Delegate General on the other hand received 33 complaints related to health matters and 136 208 CEOOR 2011 Annual Report Discrimination/Diversity, p.66. 209 Around 11% of all those cases related to education and 44% related to goods and services (mostly issues of access to transport and housing). 37% of the cases concerned physical disabilities and 22% concerned sensorial disabilities.

Recommendations given by the literature In their alternative report to the CRC Committee, NGOs provided a number of recommendations to Belgian authorities including inter alia the following: \uf0b7 Belgian authorities should aim at eliminating barriers to freely choose the school (mainstream or special) for children with disabilities. Adequate financial, material and human resources need to be made available to stimulate inclusion. 213 \uf0b7 The organisation and accommodation should be ensured for providing children with disabilities or illness with care and medication in mainstream education . Guidelines should be enacted to give directions to teaching and educational staff on medical treatments and the legal limits of certain acts. 214 \uf0b7 School transport should be organised to ensure that a child does not spend more than three hours in total travelling to and back from school. In addition, appropriate travel conditions should be ensured for children with disabilities. 215 \uf0b7 To ensure full participation authorities, public and private actors should consider \u2018children with disabilities as full members of the society with the same entitlement to participate in their families, schools, institutions, and courts and in all decisions affecting them\u2019. 216 \uf0b7 To achieve the goal of deinstitutionalisation of children with disabilities, a variety of family support measures should be taken. The literature recommends a more flexible allocation of the budget available depending on the concrete needs. 217 \uf0b7 To develop the issue of disability and integration in the initial and continuing training of all professionals involved. 218 \uf0b7 Belgian authorities should systematically collect data on children's rights disaggregated by age and presence of a disability , taking into account all children between 0 to 18 years of age, in order to define policies tailored to the needs of children with disabilities. 219 \uf0b7 Lastly, interpretation in sign language should be available in hospitals at all time.

        "____________________________________________________________________________________________ Country Report on Belgium for the Study on Member States' Policies for Children with Disabilities 5. CONCLUSIONS Overall, the rights of children with disabilities are guaranteed in Belgium. Their legal implementation is done at the national and regional level. While all the rights and principles are recognised in the legislation, the practical implementation of many of them remains problematic. The right to non-discrimination on the grounds of disability is fully recognised including in the right to reasonable accommodation. However, this right remains misunderstood by stakeholders and access to public transport and buildings remains widely problematic, whether it is access to train station or to schools buildings. The right of the child to express his/her views in all decisions affecting them is guaranteed in the legal framework. However, the lack of sign language interpreters is a considerable barrier to the effective implementation of the right towards children with disabilities. Violence against children and persons vulnerable due to disabilities is severely sanctioned by the Criminal Code, but mortality resulting from abuse against children is higher in Belgium than most OECD countries. Access to assistance is ensured, notably through personal assistance budgets providing for financial support for at-home assistance for children with disabilities and their families. But the long waiting lists to receive personal assistance budget force some parents to opt for placement of the child in residential care. Similar waiting lists exist for day care and residential care, making it particularly problematic for children with behavioural disorders and complex disabilities to find adequate care facilities. Children with disabilities can attend mainstream or special education. However, most mainstream schools are not equipped to receive children with disabilities and teachers in mainstream schools lack training to care for their needs. In conclusion, children with disabilities\u2019 rights are guaranteed and benefit overall from a satisfactory legal protection. However several gaps exist mostly with regard to the practical implementation of the rights and principles in Belgium, which result in important barriers to the full enjoyment of their rights. In the words of a child with disabilities: \u2018it is nice to have the same rights, but if there is no access, it is useless\u2019. 221 221 UNICEF Belgium, What do you think? project, \u2018We are first and foremost youth\u2019, Report of young people with a disabilities on the enjoyment of their rights in Belgium, available in French and Dutch at http://www.unicef.be/nl/page/project-what-do-you-think (last accessed on 7 February 2013), p.57. 49 ",

        "____________________________________________________________________________________________ Policy Department C: Citizens' Rights and Constitutional Affairs ANNEX 3 - STUDY ON MEMBER STATES' POLICIES FOR CHILDREN WITH DISABILITIES - EXECUTIVE SUMMARY There are about 100 million children in the European Union and about 80 million European persons with disabilities. While the number of children and the number of persons with disabilities is well documented, the same cannot be said of children with disabilities. Children with disabilities combine different factors of vulnerability. As children the protection of their rights requires the adoption of special measures that are recognised by the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC). As individuals with disabilities, they are particularly vulnerable EU citizens who deserve specific safeguards and protection as acknowledged by the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD). Children with disabilities and their families face on a daily basis specific problems such as the lack of assistance and support for their inclusion in schools, experiences of violence and the lack of proper tools for reporting them, difficulties in accessing buildings or services or troubles in being heard and participating in decisions affecting their lives. The Conventions include provisions addressing these concerns and providing protection to the right to enjoy all human rights and freedoms with no discrimination ensuring \uf0b7 equality of opportunities and accessibility, \uf0b7 the best interests of the child as a consideration in all actions concerning them, \uf0b7 the evolving capacities of children with disabilities as a consideration in decisions affecting them, \uf0b7 the right to be heard in proceedings and decision-making processes affecting the child and the right to a full and effective participation, \uf0b7 the right to family life, \uf0b7 the right to effective access to education and inclusive education, \uf0b7 the right to health care, \uf0b7 the right to assistance, and \uf0b7 freedom from violence. This study is structured to mirror the requirements of both conventions reflecting the main rights of children with disabilities to be implemented generally in the EU due to the high rate of ratification by EU Member States. Moreover, in December 2010, the European Union became a party to the CRPD. In doing so, the EU recognised the challenges persons with disabilities face in securing the fulfilment of their rights and assumed the responsibility for its implementation alongside Member States. The EU\u2019s responsibility towards the implementation of the CRC is of a different scale. Despite the lack of ratification by the EU, the CRC rights and principles guide the EU policies and action since the Treaty recognises the rights of the child as an EU objective. This study assesses the current situation with respect to the rights of children with disabilities in the EU and the need for EU legislation or for other measures. The options to act at EU level are framed within the extent of the competences conferred by the Treaties, which can be exclusive, shared or supporting competences (Article 2 TFEU). 66 ",
        "____________________________________________________________________________________________ Country Report on Belgium for the Study on Member States' Policies for Children with Disabilities The current EU legislative and policy framework give recognition to the Conventions\u2019 rights and principles applicable to children with disabilities and a certain degree of implementation. However, the existing EU legislation relevant to this area is mainly sectoral (i.e., employment or immigration). The legislation addresses the situation of persons with disabilities separately from the rights of the child, whereas there is a need to consider children with disabilities as they face multiple discrimination, on the basis of age as well as disability, and to tailor measures to ensure that their rights are respected. A. Comparative analysis of national legal frameworks The comparative analysis of the national legal frameworks on children with disabilities\u2019 rights in 18 Member States 226 is based on a set of criteria developed to enable an assessment of comparable data reported in each national study. The criteria are based on the requirements within each right and principles identified as pertinent to the situation of children with disabilities. 227 The criteria are derived from the text of both conventions and the CRC General Comments on their interpretation. Overall, the 18 Member States have in place comprehensive legal frameworks reflecting the main aspects of the rights and principles identified under the CRPD and CRC. While it may be stated that the rights of children with disabilities are broadly recognised under national legal systems either through general or specific legislation, their practical implementation revealed to be problematic in most Member States. Consideration of the principle of best interests of the child is generally recognised under national laws. However, implementation is mostly limited to family and social protection decisions affecting children and the specific needs of children with disabilities are not recognised. The country studies found a lack of understanding of what the principle entails, along with insufficient development of the concept through law or jurisprudence and an overall lack of implementing rules. The right to non-discrimination based on disability or age is reflected in national legislations, however, the implementation of the right is generally only partial and the reasonable accommodation measures are generally insufficient to guarantee the right. In practice, accessibility remains a key problem in most Member States. Reference to the multi-discrimination factors faced by children with disabilities or girls with disabilities is rarely acknowledged. There is a lack of monitoring results and of data on cases of right\u2019s violations that could help define more effective measures. Most countries partially take account of the evolving capacities of the child mainly on the basis of considerations of age, maturity and development of the child. However, the situation of children with disabilities is not specifically acknowledged. The implementation is limited to a certain type of decisions and Member States tend to primarily take into consideration the child\u2019s age, which for children with disabilities may not be relevant and which can effectively exclude them from decision making processes that affect them. 226 For this study 18 Member States legal frameworks have been analysed: Belgium, Czech Republic, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Italy, Ireland, the Netherlands, Malta, Poland, Romania, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden and the United Kingdom. Those countries have been selected by the European Parliament in the Terms of Specifications of this study. 227 8 rights and principles have been identified as most relevant to the situation of children with disabilities: the best interests of the child, the right to non-discrimination, the consideration of evolving capacities, the right to participation/to be heard, the right to be free from violence, the right to family life, the right to assistance and the right to education. 67 ",
        "____________________________________________________________________________________________ Policy Department C: Citizens' Rights and Constitutional Affairs The rights to participation and to be heard in decision making processes affecting children with disabilities are recognised under the legislation of the 18 Member States. However, their implementation is often limited to some sectoral procedures mostly regarding family law and at a certain extent in education. In practice, children with disabilities are not systematically involved and do not get to participate in public and private life at the same level than their able-peers. In general freedom from violence is recognised by Member States\u2019 legislation. However, abuse against children with disabilities is a key problem acknowledged in all country reports. Violence occurring in institutions is of particular concern. The lack of systematic data and the difficulty for victims to report abuses do not allow an overview of the situation needed for the adoption of appropriate policies and measures. The right to family life is widely recognised in the laws of the selected Member States. However, insufficient guidance and support to families for the integration of the child with disabilities and for helping them in their day to day lives is a key problem in most of the 18 Member States. Without proper assistance, families with difficulties might give up on their responsibility leading to a situation where alternative options are unlikely and institutionalisation is the only response available. Overall the right to various forms of assistance (financial, social, health care, etc.) both for children with disabilities and for their families is recognised in legislation or regulatory rules. However, again in most cases assistance is sectoral (mainly social and health) and insufficient (financially and human assistance). The economic crisis is contributing to the removal and reduction of assistance in most Member States. Access to assistance is often perceived not as an instrument enabling protection of rights but rather as a discretionary measure subject to budget constraints. All Member States recognise the right to education in their Constitutions or legal frameworks; however, the ability to access the school of choice for children with disabilities remains very challenging in practice. Mainstream schools remain largely inaccessible to children with disabilities in many Member States, while in other countries schools have insufficient resources and support for the child with disabilities is scarce. In addition, teachers in mainstream schools lack training and awareness on the needs of children with disabilities and programmes are not systematically adapted to them. Compliance mechanisms are weak and lack adaptation to the situation of children with disabilities. Lack of information and guidance to families with children with disabilities on their rights, procedures and competent authorities decreases their ability to access these tools. On the basis of these findings, the study sets forth conclusions and recommendations for EU action, taking into account the competence of the EU conferred by the Treaties on a range of policy areas, including disability and children\u2019s rights. 68 ",
        "____________________________________________________________________________________________ Country Report on Belgium for the Study on Member States' Policies for Children with Disabilities B.1 The role of the European Union The EU has no explicit competence on children with disabilities. However the EU framework contains provisions recognising the EU\u2019s role to promote the protection of the rights of the child as an EU objective as well as its competence to combat discrimination based on disability. Furthermore, the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, with similar legal value as the Treaties, recognises the right to non-discrimination on ground of disability in Article 21 and the rights of the child under its Article 24. This recognition, while important, cannot extend the competences of the EU as conferred by the Treaties. The EU, together with Member States in areas of shared competence or national competence, is bound by the CRPD obligations and is required to take the necessary measures to combat discrimination on the grounds of disability within the framework of Article 19 TFEU or in other matters falling within EU competence. Article 19(1) TFEU provides the legal basis for EU action (see among others the proposal for equal treatment Directive of 2008 228 ) but the unanimity requirement makes achieving agreement under this legal base difficult. Article 19(2) provides the possibility for the EU to adopt basic principles and incentive measures to support Member States\u2019 action to combat discrimination through the ordinary legislative procedure. Neither the above mentioned proposal for an equal treatment Directive nor any other EU measures provide for a definition of disability . Prior to the adoption of the CRPD, in a judgment in July 2006, the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) defined disability in the same sense as the CRPD within the context of employment policy as \u2018a limitation which results in particular from physical, mental or psychological impairments and which hinders the participation of the person concerned in professional life\u2019. 229 Recently, the CJEU has further developed this concept 230 stating that disability results from barriers hindering the full and effective participation of the person concerned in professional life on an equal basis with other workers and calling on the employer to take reasonable accommodation measures. EU action is also possible when linked to other policy areas of EU competence. Several issues related to the rights of the child with disabilities are linked to EU policies such as social policy, economic, social and territorial cohesion, transport, freedom, security and justice all of which are shared competence. In addition, the EU has the option to take action to support Member States policies in a number of areas affecting children with disabilities such as education, sports, youth or health. B. 2 Existing relevant EU secondary legislation The best interests of the child as primary consideration in actions relating to children is a fundamental requirement recognised in EU legislation. Article 7 of the Mediation Directive 2008/52 231 requires the mediator to take into account the best interests of the child when deciding whether the child can give evidence in judicial proceedings.

The protection of the best interests of the child is explicitly mentioned in Council Directive 2004/81/EC 234 on victims of trafficking in human beings. Non-discrimination at EU level is currently addressed by four EU Directives to combat discrimination on the basis of protected grounds such as sex, racial or ethnic origin, religion or belief, age and sexual orientation, most of them restricted to the area of employment. 235 They lay down rules \u2018for combating discrimination (\u2026) with a view to putting into effect in the Member States the principle of equal treatment \u2019. 236 Disability is recognised as grounds for discrimination under Directive 2000/78/EC and, furthermore, protection of equality between men and women in matters of employment and occupation under Directive 2006/54/EC applies to persons with disabilities. Directive 2000/43/EC on equal treatment between persons irrespective of racial or ethnic origin does not include disability as a protected ground. Directive 2004/113/EC on equal treatment between women and men in access to supply of goods and services refers to discrimination on grounds of sex but not on age or disability. The European Commission has acknowledged the differences of protection provided across the various grounds and published a proposal for a Directive in 2008 aiming at completing the legal framework on anti-discrimination law and providing for a more equal level of protection across the grounds 237 . Other measures in policy areas such as the internal market or transport have an impact on children with disabilities\u2019 access to services with no-discrimination. For example, Directive 2001/85/EC on the carriage of passengers, requires accessibility features for persons with reduced mobility and visually impaired persons. Other instruments cover rights of persons with disabilities when travelling by air, accessibility to lifts, in carrying out public procurement or in measures for telecommunication 238 . Within the remit of its competences, the EU\u2019s action to combat discrimination is complemented with activities by the EU Institutions to improve knowledge about discrimination (e.g. by raising awareness), support intermediary actors (e.g. NGOs, social partners and equality bodies) to improve their capacity to combat discrimination and to encourage the exchange of national good practices. The consideration of children\u2019s evolving capacities is recognised in the Brussels II bis 232 Council Directive 2003/86/EC, on the right to family reunification. 233 \u2018Developing indicators for the protection, respect and promotion of the rights of the child in the European Union\u2019 FRA, March 2009, available at http://fra.europa.eu/sites/default/files/fra uploads/358\u00ad RightsofChild summary-report en.pdf. 234 Council Directive 2004/81/EC on the residence permit issued to third-country nationals who are victims of trafficking in human beings or who has been the subject of an action to facilitate illegal immigration. 235 Directive 2006/54/EC on the implementation of the principle of equal opportunities and equal treatment of men and women in matters of employment and occupation (recast directive); Directive 2004/113/EC on the principle of equal treatment between women and men in the access to and supply of goods and services; Directive 2000/43/EC on the principle of equal treatment between persons irrespective of racial or ethnic origin and Directive 2000/78/EC establishing a general framework for equal treatment in employment and occupation. 236 Article 1 Directive 2000/43/EC. 237 Proposal for a Directive on implementing the principle of equal treatment between persons irrespective of religion or belief, disability, age or sexual orientation (COM(2008)426).

        "____________________________________________________________________________________________ Country Report on Belgium for the Study on Member States' Policies for Children with Disabilities Regulation 2201/2003 which requires courts to hear the view of the child according to his/her age or degree of maturity. The same formulation is found in EU legislation concerning immigration and asylum in relation to unaccompanied minors. Children\u2019s right to participation is recognised in some Commission strategic documents including the 2005 \u2018European policies concerning youth\u2019, the 2006 \u2018EU strategy on the rights of the child\u2019, the Youth in Action Programme and the EU Agenda for the Rights of the child of 2011. EU legislation on immigration and asylum recognise the right of the child to be heard during proceedings under the Brussels II bis Regulation 2201/2003. The EU has adopted a number of measures on the protection of children from violence 239 relating to child trafficking, to the sexual exploitation of children and to the protection of victims including several Directives 240 that have been adopted to replace some of these instruments. For example, the Directive 2011/36/EU on preventing and combating trafficking in human beings and protecting its victims, focus on the protection of children which are more vulnerable than adults and establishes more severe penalties when the offence is committed against vulnerable persons such as children and persons with disabilities. The Directive 2012/29/EU establishing minimum standards on the rights, support and protection of the victims of crime recognises that a victim of crime should be treated without discrimination based on any ground including age and disability. Lastly, Directive 2011/92/EU on combating sexual abuse, the sexual exploitation of children and child pornography 241 provides the need for specific protection of children with disabilities. The right to family life and the maintenance of the child in family context is at the heart of Council Regulation 2201/2003 Brussels IIbis (EC) 242 . In the field of immigration policies, the right of the child to family life is ensured by the rules on family reunification 243 and the provisions of the Directives on asylum 244 regarding unaccompanied minors and the respect for the family unit. 239 Framework Decision 2002/629/JHA on combating trafficking in human beings; Council Directive 2004/81/EC on the residence permit issued to third-country nationals victims of trafficking in human beings; Council Framework Decision 2004/68/JHA on combating sexual exploitation of children and child pornography; Council Framework Decision 2001/220/JHA on the standing of victims in criminal proceedings; Council Resolution 2001/C 283/01 on the contribution of civil society in finding missing or sexually exploited children.

        "____________________________________________________________________________________________ Policy Department C: Citizens' Rights and Constitutional Affairs The principle of maximum inclusion in society of children with disabilities is reflected in strategy documents such as the Disability Strategy 2010-2020 245 and the EU 2020 Programme in relation to education and training 246 . The 2003 Council Resolution on equal opportunities for Pupils and Students with Disabilities 247 addressed the problem of access to education by children with disabilities. In 2010, the Resolution of the European Parliament on mobility and inclusion of children with disabilities 248 stressed the need to ensure full respect for the rights of the child, including the right to education and the right to participate in community life of children with disabilities. The EU Institutions also support the European Agency for Development in Special Needs Education, the independent organisation acting as a platform for collaboration on special educational needs and the promotion of full participation within mainstream education and training 249 . C. Recommendations for EU action When evaluating the need for specific recommendations aimed at improving the situation of children with disabilities, it is important to highlight that children with disabilities are first and foremost children with the same needs as any other children and who should be beneficiaries of all rights recognised by the CRC. Their intrinsic difference with their peers needs to be recognised for designing appropriate legislative and policy measures. Horizontal issues \uf0b7 As a first and general recommendation, all EU Member States which have not already done so should ratify the two conventions referred to in this study and implement their provisions by adopting national legislation and ensuring its practice. \uf0b7 The European Commission, liaising with the UN Secretariat for the CRPD and the UN Secretariat for the CRC, should ensure Member States understanding and implementation of several definitions of the Conventions that are cornerstones for the implementation of the rights of children with disabilities, namely the definition of \u201cdisability\u201d, the \u201cbest interests of the child\u201d and the \u201cevolving capacities of the child\u201d. They should lead the development of initiatives to ensure that the specificities of children with disabilities are taken into account. To that end, it is recommended that the Commission takes the initiative to provide clarification at EU level of the CRDP definition of \u201cdisability\u201d as it is considered to be too broad in practice and its implementation at national level is therefore difficult. The development of guidance documents, exchange of best practices and promotion of existing manuals are recommended. \uf0b7 The European Commission should take action to promote that children with disabilities are considered in existing mainstreaming initiatives for non-discrimination and equal treatment. \uf0b7 The EP, the Council and the Commission should promote the development of national 245 Area of action 5 of the Commission Communication European Disability Strategy 2010-2020: A Renewed Commitment to a Barrier-Free Europe COM(2010) 636 final. 246 Council Conclusions of 12 May 2009 on a strategic framework for European cooperation in education and training (\u2018ET 2020\u2019), 2009/C 119/02, OJ C 119/2, of 28 May 2005. 247 Council Resolution of 5 May 2003 on equal opportunities for pupils and students with disabilities in education and training, 2003/C 134/04. 248 European Parliament Resolution of 25 October 2011 on mobility and inclusion of people with disabilities and the European Disability Strategy 2010-2020 (2010/2272(INI)). 249 European Agency for Development in Special Needs Education website available at http://www.european\u00ad agency.org/about-us. 72 ",
        "____________________________________________________________________________________________ Country Report on Belgium for the Study on Member States' Policies for Children with Disabilities information tools to assist families with children with disabilities to understand the legal frameworks applicable to them, including access to assistance measures, competent authorities, procedures and compliance mechanisms. Specific tools addressed to these families could include an EU web portal which could be linked, where possible, to national portals providing full information on rights, requirements, criteria for implementation, competent authorities, and coordination systems. This initiative could bring citizens closer to the EU. \uf0b7 The EU Institutions should take a leading role in promoting awareness-raising on issues concerning the rights of children with disabilities, their interests and specific needs in order to promote the full implementation of the principle of best interests of children with disabilities. The EP and the Council could also use their budgetary powers to provide for financing of awareness-raising campaigns. Best interests of the child \uf0b7 While most countries have legislation recognising the principle of best interests of the child, only few Member States contain in their legislation a general requirement for its systematic consideration in all decisions affecting children. Some Member States (such as Sweden and the UK) have introduced child impact assessments of proposed legislation. It is recommended that the European Commission promotes the exchange of these initiatives and develops a guide on methodologies for carrying out these child impact assessments implementing the best interests of the child principle. Right to non-discrimination \uf0b7 The concept of reasonable accommodation in relation to the specific situation of children with disabilities needs clarification and further development to define the boundaries for the use of disproportionate burden. The EU, through the Commission, could support this through exchange of best practices at national level on the implementation of reasonable accommodation covering different situations. This would help defining the baselines from which the respect of the right requires public authorities\u2019 action and prevents it from being subject to arguments of disproportionate costs. \uf0b7 The 2008 Proposal for a Council Directive on implementing the principle of equal treatment between persons irrespective of religion or belief, disability, age or sexual orientation, if adopted, has the potential of addressing the situation of children with disabilities. Amendment 37 introduced by the European Parliament refers to multiple discrimination. Within this context, clarification could be introduced in the recitals of the proposed Directive in order to ensure that the situation of children with disabilities is considered as a part of its scope. \uf0b7 The European Commission\u2019s draft for an upcoming European Accessibility Act should explicitly cover children with disabilities\u2019 access to goods and services, at least with a reference to multiple discrimination cases. Evolving capacities of children with disabilities \uf0b7 The EP should consider ways to raise awareness and promote taking into account the evolving capacities of children, including children with disabilities, with the aim to have the principle applied in all decision making processes affecting them. \uf0b7 Any new legislation on child-friendly justice should include consideration of the ability of the child with disabilities to be heard in judicial proceedings affecting them. The 73 ",
        "____________________________________________________________________________________________ Policy Department C: Citizens' Rights and Constitutional Affairs Commission should ensure that these provisions are included in the anticipated EU law on special safeguards for suspected or accused persons who are vulnerable, including children, or the anticipated EU law for the recognition and enforcement of decisions on parental responsibility. \uf0b7 Furthermore, it is recommended that the European Commission, the Council and the EP promote the use of the Council of Europe Guidelines on child-friendly justice and support training for the relevant professionals at all levels. Right of participation of children with disabilities \uf0b7 The anticipated European Accessibility Act could provide for the development of tools to ensure the participation of children with disabilities in the consultation processes of the legislative and policy initiatives affecting them. \uf0b7 The EP should explore ways to raise awareness on the requirements needed to ensure the right of participation of children with disabilities through concrete measures such as simulation of plenary meetings in the EP involving children with disabilities, guaranteeing physical access to the EP buildings or designing tools to ensure non\u00ad physical participation. Right to be heard of children with disabilities \uf0b7 In order to enable effective implementation of the right to be heard by children with disabilities, changes in the attitudes of judicial, administrative and enforcement officers are needed. To that end, the EP, the Council and the Commission should encourage Member States to develop awareness-raising actions and training addressed at public authorities. \uf0b7 The Commission in preparing legislation on child-friendly justice, should ensure that adequate steps are taken to identify the ability of the child to express his/her views in judicial proceedings affecting them, enabling a climate of trust between the child and the judicial and enforcement officers and providing reasonable accommodation to ensure the effective right to be heard of children with disabilities. Freedom from violence \uf0b7 It is recommended that the EP, the Council and the Commission promote the development of statistical information on the situation of violence affecting children, and in particular children with disabilities. Furthermore, they should promote the development of indicators (such as disability, children, girls, family environment) to be mainstreamed in other policy or general surveys so as to provide systematic data on the situation of children with disabilities. \uf0b7 The European Commission and the EP should promote FRA to examine the situation of violence against children, particularly in institutions, including children with disabilities as they are particularly vulnerable. The necessary funding should be proposed to the budgetary authority. \uf0b7 The European Commission should consider in particular the need for measures at EU level aimed at reducing the number of cases of violence against children, especially children with disabilities, in Member States (both in a domestic context and in public institutions). The Commission could start preparatory work by organising working 74 ",

The budgetary authority should provide adequate funding for these activities. Right to family life of children with disabilities \uf0b7 The Commission, the Council and the EP should encourage Member States to set up appropriate support structures for families with children with disabilities in order to reduce the risks of the child losing family life while safeguarding the best interests of children with disabilities. \uf0b7 Within the Open Method of Coordination, the Commission should develop Guidelines on minimum requirements of residential institutions with regards to children with disabilities. The Guidelines would aim at ensuring that residential care centres have a small number of users and the capacity to host children with autism or with intellectual disabilities. \uf0b7 The Commission should propose to the budgetary authority the use of EU funds for the protection of children\u2019s right to family life, prioritising funds for families while ensuring that the good quality of the institutions is maintained. Access to assistance \uf0b7 A special single national body (with regional offices) responsible for the management of services, budget and assistance of children and their families should be established in order to ensure consistency, coordination, effectiveness, increase accessibility and better guidance for families on the funding support available. \uf0b7 The EP should continue to lead actions on children with disabilities to inform Member States on the negative impacts of budget cuts on implementation of their rights, especially in the field of education, social protection and health care. \uf0b7 Within the European Semester process, the Commission should provide appropriate recommendations to Member States on how to use existing resources effectively instead of just cutting the necessary assistance for children with disabilities who belong to the most vulnerable citizens. Access to inclusive education \uf0b7 The Commission should develop actions to support Member States in improving education systems for children with disabilities through the Open Method of Coordination or peer review while respecting their general competence for matters 75 ",
