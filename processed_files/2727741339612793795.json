        "H. whereas the EU-Central America Association Agreement was concluded in 2012, with the trade pillar having been provisionally applied since 1 August 2013; I. whereas in 2013, Honduras became the first Latin American country to start negotiations with the EU on a FLEGT VPA, resulting in the initialling of a draft agreement in 2018; J. whereas the objective of the VPA is to ensure that all shipments of timber and timber products from Honduras destined for the EU market will comply with a Honduran Timber Legality Assurance System (TLAS) and thereby qualify for FLEGT licence; whereas domestic timber and timber destined for other export markets will also need to comply with TLAS and will be subject to the issuance of an H-Legal Certificate; K. whereas the TLAS is based on a legality definition, supply chain controls, verification of compliance, FLEGT licensing and an independent audit; L. whereas the agreement covers the five obligatory timber products under the FLEGT Regulation \u2014 logs, sawn timber, railway sleepers, plywood and veneer \u2014 and a number of other timber products; M. whereas the purpose and expected benefits of FLEGT VPAs go beyond the facilitation of trade in legal timber, as they are also designed to bring about systemic changes in forest governance, law enforcement, including labour law and indigenous peoples\u2019 rights, transparency and the inclusion of various stakeholders in the political decision-making process, in particular civil society organisations (CSOs) and indigenous communities, as well as support for economic integration and respect for international sustainable development goals; whereas the negotiations leading to the conclusion of this VPA have created a space for cooperation among different stakeholders to discuss environmental, human rights, social and economic issues; whereas Honduras shall ensure that the implementation and monitoring of the VPA involves the relevant stakeholders, irrespective of their gender, age, location, religion or beliefs, ethnic origin, race, language or disability and the participation of the private sector, civil society, local communities, indigenous and Afro-descendant peoples of Honduras and others dependent on forests ( 9 ); N. whereas the VPA provides for a Joint Implementation Committee which is responsible for its implementation and monitoring; O. whereas the EU provided support for the negotiation process via three bilateral programmes under its development assistance; P. whereas general elections will take place in Honduras by the end of 2021; Q. whereas Honduras has ratified the International Labour Organization (ILO) Convention No 169 on Indigenous and Tribal Peoples, but has not fully implemented it and has not introduced in its legislation the key principle of free, prior and informed consent stemming from the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples; 1. Welcomes the conclusion of negotiations on the VPA between the EU and Honduras, which will ensure that only legally logged timber is imported into the EU from Honduras, promote sustainable forest management practices and sustainable trade in legally produced timber, and improve forest governance, law enforcement (including labour and occupational, health and safety obligations), human rights, transparency, accountability and institutional resilience in Honduras, bearing in mind that forests are important to the Honduran economy and that the problem of deforestation in the country should be addressed more effectively; calls for the swift ratification of the VPA by both sides so it can enter into force in 2021 and pave the way for the subsequent important steps in terms of implementation, including the setting up of licensing; 2. Expresses its solidarity with Honduras, which recently suffered two hurricanes that brought severe consequences in addition to the COVID-19 pandemic, which has also hit the country very hard; stresses the need to tackle urgently and on a global scale the root causes of such extreme weather phenomena and zoonosis, which are linked to climate change, deforestation and biodiversity loss; 15.12.2021 EN Official Journal of the European Union C 506/147 Tuesday 27 April 2021 ( 9 ) Pursuant to Article 16 of the VPA.

        "3. Greatly appreciates the fact that Honduras managed to ensure the involvement of its government institutions, civil society, private sector, indigenous and Afro-descendant peoples, academia and communities in the VPA drafting process, who accepted this offer and provided their contributions; welcomes the fact that all of these sectors of society agreed to sit around the same negotiating table, thereby ensuring a feeling of inclusiveness and the possibility to contribute; 4. Recognises that the full implementation of the VPA will be a long-term process which will require the adoption of a whole set of legislation and adequate administrative capacity and expertise for its implementation and enforcement; recalls that FLEGT licencing can only begin once Honduras has demonstrated the readiness of its TLAS; 5. Stresses that the implementation stage requires genuine and continued consultations and substantial multistakeholder involvement, including the meaningful participation of CSOs and local and indigenous communities in decision-making so as to guarantee the principle of free, prior and informed consent; recalls the need to enhance transparency and ensure the effective public disclosure of information and the timely sharing of documents with local and indigenous peoples; calls on the Commission, the EU Delegation to Honduras and the Member States to ensure and provide substantial capacity-building and logistical and technical support in the framework of present and future development cooperation instruments in order to enable Honduras to fulfil the commitments for the implementation of the TLAS and related measures; 6. Welcomes the recent adoption of the Honduran VPA implementation action plan and calls on the Government of Honduras to follow a concrete, time-bound and measurable approach; 7. Is alarmed at the fact that more than 20 activists for environmental protection and the rights of indigenous peoples have been killed since the initialling of the VPA in July 2018; believes that the success of the VPA will depend to a large extent on the creation of a safe and enabling environment for the protection of environmental activists and human right defenders and whistleblowers, ensuring effective remedies for human rights violations and combating impunity; stresses, in this respect, that the ratification of the Escaz\u00fa Agreement would be a significant step in the right direction; urges the Government of Honduras to take steps to this end; 8. Believes that the fight against corruption needs to be constant; welcomes the fact that transparency has proven useful in the process to concluding the VPA and should be fully ensured in the forthcoming implementation process; stresses that the success of the FLEGT also depends on tackling fraud and corruption throughout the timber supply chain; calls, to this effect, for the EU to strengthen the scope and enforcement of the EU Timber Regulation in order to tackle corruption risks in the EU\u2019s timber supply chain, including through more regular and systematic controls and investigations at EU ports; notes Honduras\u2019 efforts hitherto in making advances towards greater transparency and urges the Government of Honduras to provide incentives in the various stages of the forest value chain so as to increase transparency and ensure inclusion of the most vulnerable operators, such as young people and women from indigenous communities, people of African descent and small farmers; urges the Government of Honduras, furthermore, to work to stop widespread corruption and address other factors fuelling illegal logging and forest degradation, with particular regard to customs, the Honduras Forest Authority and the ministries dealing with forests and land rights, and other authorities that will play a pivotal role in the implementation and enforcement of the VPA; stresses the need to end impunity in the forest sector by ensuring that infractions are prosecuted; 9. Urges the Government of Honduras to renew the mandate for the Mission to Support the Fight against Corruption and Impunity in Honduras (MACCIH), which ended in January 2020; 10. Welcomes the fact that Honduras is the first VPA country that had indigenous peoples as a separate interest group at the negotiating table, and the brave participation of indigenous peoples\u2019 groups, with their particular insights and contributions; calls for the rapid inclusion of free, prior and informed consent in the legality definition and for the adoption of the relevant laws in Honduras; 11. Recognises that the process of negotiating a VPA can allow sectors to identify shared goals and priorities to work towards sustainable forest management, as well as offer an important opportunity for societies to allow for participative management of their forests at local, community and regional levels and even up to national or federal level; C 506/148 EN Official Journal of the European Union 15.12.2021 Tuesday 27 April 2021 ",
        "12.

Emphasises the importance of land use in forest governance and that a strategic vision in forest governance linked to climate change issues is needed; calls on the Government of Honduras to ensure close coordination between the existing different initiatives in the forest sector, such as Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation in Developing Countries (REDD+), the FLEGT VPA and NDCs; 14. Calls on the Government of Honduras to strengthen vigilance and forest fire protection zones on privately owned lands; calls for supply chain management to be rolled out in the animal husbandry, coffee and palm oil sectors, as this is essential to address the root causes of deforestation; 15.

Stresses the importance of forest jobs and rural employment in the economy of Honduras, which should be taken into account for the implementation of the VPA; sees the VPA as a tool to promote decent work; calls on the Commission and the Honduran authorities to conduct an exhaustive impact assessment of the VPA on the workers and small producers of the sector who could be affected by increased logging controls; calls on the Commission to promote and support programmes for the workers and producers affected to enable them to remain competitive in the sector; 19.

Stresses that countries all over the world which either have or aim to have regulated import markets for legal timber would benefit from cooperating and, where possible, endorsing each other\u2019s rules and systems, such as the EU\u2019s FLEGT and VPAs; emphasises that international standards would be more effective and promote long-term legal security for business and consumers; 22. Underlines that VPAs provide an important legal framework for both the EU and its partner countries, made possible by the good cooperation and engagement of the countries concerned; supports the Commission in finding additional potential partners for future VPAs under FLEGT; 23. Believes that the EU has a very important and responsible role to play and obligation to abide by in improving both the supply and the demand side of timber in order to reject illegally produced timber and assist exporting countries in their efforts to combat illegal logging and corruption, which results in the destruction of their forests, climate change and human 15.12.2021 EN Official Journal of the European Union C 506/149 Tuesday 27 April 2021 ",
