Introduction to Portugal and its political and administrative system Portugal is the westernmost country of mainland Europe, located in the Iberian peninsula. To the north and east, Portugal borders Spain. The western and southern coastline totals 1240 km in length and is bathed by the Atlantic Ocean. Portugal\u2019s territory also comprises the Atlantic archipelagos of the Azores and Madeira. Northern Portugal is mountainous, while southern Portugal is an area of gently rolling hills and plains. The highest peak of Portugal is Mount Pico in the Azores, while the highest point in mainland Portugal is part of the Serra da Estrela. Portugal has a warm and moderate climate. Mainland Portugal and Madeira are in the Western European time zone, which means that when in Brussels it is noon, in Portugal it is 11 a.m. (as in the United Kingdom). As the Azores are further to the west, at noon Brussels time it is 10 a.m. in the archipelago. Map 1: Mainland Portugal Source: European Parliament. BRIEFING Requested by the REGI committee ",
        "Economic, social and territorial situation of Portugal 2 Portugal has the twelfth biggest population (10.2 million inhabitants) and the thirteenth largest territory (92 211.9 km 2 ) in the European Union. Portugal has been a member of the European Union since 1986. In 1999, it was among the fonder members of the euro area. Portugal is a member of both NATO and the OECD. The official language is Portuguese. Also in use in north-eastern Portugal (in the area of Miranda do Douro) is Mirandese, which is recognised officially as a minority language. The Portuguese language is widely diffused across the world. The Community of Portuguese Language Countries ( Comunidade dos Pa\u00edses de L\u00edngua Portuguesa ) has nine member states on four continents 1 , including Brazil (with around 210 million inhabitants) and Angola (around 25 million inhabitants).

Portugal is a semi-presidential republic and a parliamentary democracy. The president is the head of state. He or she is directly elected for a maximum two consecutive terms of five years each. Since 2016 the president is Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa (former leader of Social Democratic Party, member of EPP). The next presidential elections are expected in January 2021. The Portuguese government is formed in the light of the results of the legislative elections and is responsible to the parliament. It is headed by a prime minister. The current prime minister is Ant\u00f3nio Costa from the Socialist Party (member of S&D). The Socialist Party forms a minority government. It received the support of the Left Bloc, the Portuguese Communist Party and the Green Party. The government is responsible for the country\u2019s general policy and directs the public administration, which implements government policy. The Assembly of the Republic ( Assembleia da Rep\u00fablica ) is Portugal\u2019s unicameral parliament. Its 230 members are elected for a four-year term, using a closed party list system with proportional representation based on the d\u2019Hondt method. The most recent elections took place in October 2015.

The Constitution enshrines the principle of administrative decentralisation (Article 237) and the financial autonomy of local authorities (Article 238). Portugal has two autonomous regions , namely the Azores and Madeira. By reason of their particular geographical, economic, social and cultural characteristics and the island populations\u2019 historic aspirations, they are granted a specific form of autonomous organisation. They enjoy extensive 2 In many sources, the authors refer to \u2018communes\u2019 or \u2018civil parishes\u2019.

Both autonomous regions have as their self-government organs a Legislative Assembly and a Regional Government. Their local authorities comprise parishes and municipalities. The Azores and Madeira are both classified as EU outermost regions. There are five administrative regions in mainland Portugal. They are in charge of decentralised administration services empowered with financial and administrative autonomy. However, administrative regions do not have elected councils. In 1998, in a national referendum, the Portuguese voters rejected a proposed regionalisation reform which would have created self-governing regions. Administration of regions is mainly performed by the Regional Coordination and Development Committees (CCDRs), which are decentralised bodies of central government with financial and administrative autonomy. Administrative regions and autonomous regions are classified as NUTS 2 areas and are entitled to implement their own regional operational programmes (ROPs). Autonomous regions are also classified as NUTS 1 and NUTS 3 areas. There are 308 municipalities in Portugal. Nearly all municipalities are subdivided into multiple parishes. The representative organs of a municipality are the municipal assembly ( assembleia municipal ) and the municipal council ( c\u00e2mara municipal ). The municipal assembly is a deliberative and decision-making organ. It is composed of members directly elected for four years, as well as of the chairs of all the parish councils located in each municipality\u2019s jurisdiction. The number of directly elected members has to be greater than that of the chairs of the parish councils. The municipal council is the municipality\u2019s collegial executive organ. Its members are elected by direct universal suffrage. It is headed by the mayor ( presidente ). Municipalities may form associations and federations in order to manage common interest activities. There are 3 092 parishes in Portugal. Their representative organs are the parish assembly ( assembleia de freguesia ) and the parish council ( junta de freguesia ). The parish assembly is the parish\u2019s deliberative body. Members of the parish assembly are elected for four year term. The parish council is the parish\u2019s collegial executive organ. Its chair ( presidente ) is a member of the municipal council within which the parish is located. Parishes may form associations in order to manage common interest activities. The tasks of municipalities and parishes are associated with the fulfilment of the needs of local communities, for example as regards socio-economic development, spatial planning, utilities, sewage collection, culture, the environment, etc. ",

Alongside the municipalities and parishes, Portuguese local self-government units include other types of authorities, such as 21 inter-municipal communities ( comunidades intermunicipais ), associations of municipalities and two metropolitan areas ( \u00e1reas metropolitanas ) (Lisbon and Porto), as well as urban communities. The function of these authorities is principally to coordinate municipal investments of intermunicipal interest. Their areas of competence also include strategic, economic, social and territorial management 3 .

        "Economic, social and territorial situation of Portugal 6 2. Socio-economic situation Portugal has over 10 million inhabitants. With 113.5 people per square kilometre, Portugal is close to the EU average (117.5 inhabitants per km 2 in the EU-28). The total fertility rate is 1.36 and is visibly lower than the EU average (1.6). Since 2010, the population of Portugal has slowly been declining - from 10.57 million inhabitants to 10.29 million in 2018. The level of education is systematically improving. In 2000, only 11 % of the population aged 30 to 34 had successfully completed tertiary education. In 2017, the equivalent figure was already 33.5 % (the average for the EU was 39.9 %) 4 . Lisbon is the capital of Portugal. With a population of over 550 000 inhabitants it is the biggest Portuguese municipality. Together with 17 other municipalities it forms the Lisbon Metropolitan Area, with a population of around 3 million. The second metropolitan area is formed by Porto together with 16 other municipalities. These two metropolitan areas concentrate nearly half of the Portuguese population. Portugal\u2019s economy was hard hit by the economic crisis. The country had difficulties with its rising public deficit and debt. In 2011 Portugal had to apply for financial assistance and obtained a bailout worth EUR 78 billion from the EU and the International Monetary Fund (IMF). Since then Portugal\u2019s economy has registered a gradual recovery. The structural reforms introduced with the help of the EU and the IMF have improved productivity and competitiveness. The present government has managed to effectively reduce the public deficit. In 2016, it stood at 2 % of GDP, the lowest level since Portugal joined the euro area in 1999. In 2017 real GDP growth reached 2.8 %, the highest rate since 2000. What is important is that this growth generates new jobs. The unemployment rate has dropped from 16.4 % in 2013 to 7.0 % in 2018 (from 38.1 % to 20.1 % for young people). However, the very high public debt (of around 120 %) is still an important vulnerability of the country\u2019s economy. Since its accession Portugal has been one of the EU\u2019s least developed Member States. In 2006, its GDP per capita expressed in Purchasing Power Standards (PPS) stood at 83 % of the EU average and was lower not only than that of Greece but also of new Member States Cyprus and Slovenia. Despite economic recovery, in 2017 Portugal\u2019s GDP per capita in PPS was on the level of 77 % of the EU average and was the ninth lowest in the EU.
