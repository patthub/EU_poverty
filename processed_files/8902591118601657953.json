        "73. Calls for the application of forest definitions based on an ecological forest classification such as the one proposed by the EEA in 2007, so as to be able to differentiate between carbon-rich old forests, intensively managed monocultures and other forest types, including Mediterranean shrub, according to biomes and stages of succession; 74. Stresses the importance of protecting the diversity of forests at all stages of succession within the EU, in order to ensure biodiversity of and within forests, as each stage of succession creates conditions for the following, and without concerted protection at all the various stages succession in the latter stages will be severely endangered; External dimension 75. Calls on the Commission and Member States to work internationally to establish a new UN defi\u00ad nition of forests which clarifies natural forest definitions on a biome basis and distinguishes between native forests and those dominated by tree monocultures and non-native species; notes, in this respect that \u2013 the EU being the biggest public aid donor to developing countries (with the forest sector receiving more than EUR 600 million in 2003) \u2013 this definition would greatly enhance policy coherence and \u2018value for money\u2019; regrets that the Green Paper fails to register progress on the need to coordinate EU actions within and outside the Union and to achieve a global legally binding agreement under the UN Forum on Forests; 76. Notes the importance of global cooperation, at both administrative and research level, on standard setting, best practices and transfers of technology and scientific know-how, especially in the context of the REDD (Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation) system; also points out that fair sharing of the benefits of the REDD system cannot be achieved without active cooperation and the exchange of best practices; stresses the importance of the GMES (Global Monitoring for Environment and Security) programme in the charting, surveillance and recording of forest areas at European and international level and the contribution that the information thus gathered can make to the UN negotiations on climate change; * * * 77.

        "\u2014 having regard to the above-mentioned Interinstitutional Agreement of 17 May 2006 between the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission on budgetary discipline and sound financial management, \u2014 having regard to its resolutions of 19 February 2009 ( 1 ) and 10 March 2010 ( 2 ) on the 2007 and 2008 CFSP annual reports respectively, \u2014 having regard to its position of 8 July 2010 ( 3 ) on the European External Action Service, \u2014 having regard to its resolution of 11 November 2010 on strengthening the OSCE: a role for the EU ( 4 ), \u2014 having regard to the declaration by the Vice-President of the Commission/High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy (VP/HR) on political accountability ( 5 ), \u2014 having regard to the statement made by the High Representative in the plenary of the European Parliament on the basic organisation of the EEAS central administration on 8 July 2010 ( 5 ), \u2014 having regard to the conclusions of the European Council of 16 September 2010 on the EU\u2019s external relations, \u2014 having regard to Rule 119(1) of its Rules of Procedure, \u2014 having regard to the report of the Committee on Foreign Affairs and the opinion of the Committee on Budgets (A7-0168/2011), A. whereas the EU should further develop its foreign policy objectives and advance its values and interests worldwide with the overall aim of contributing to peace, security, solidarity, conflict prevention, the promotion of democracy, the protection of human rights, gender equality, respect for international law, support for international institutions, effective multilateralism and mutual respect among nations, sustainable development, free and fair trade and the eradication of poverty, B. whereas the implementation of the Lisbon Treaty is bringing a new dimension to European external action and will be instrumental in enhancing the coherence, consistency and effectiveness of EU foreign policy and, more broadly, external actions, C. whereas the Lisbon Treaty is creating a new momentum in EU foreign policy, notably providing institutional and operational tools which could enable the Union to take on an international role compatible with its prominent economic status and its ambitions and to organise itself in such a way as to be an effective global player, able to share responsibility for global security and take the lead in defining common responses to common challenges, D. whereas the new momentum in European external action also requires the EU to act more strategically so as to bring its weight to bear internationally; whereas the EU\u2019s ability to influence the international order depends not only on coherence between its policies, actors and institutions, but also on a real strategic concept of EU foreign policy which must unite all Member States behind the same set of priorities and goals, so that they speak with a strong single voice in the international arena; whereas the EU foreign policy must be provided with the necessary means and instruments in order to enable the Union to act effectively and consistently on the world stage, EN C 377 E/36 Official Journal of the European Union 7.12.2012 ( 1 ) OJ C 76 E, 25.3.2010, p. 54.

        "E. whereas a substantial transformation of the current international order is taking place with the emergence of new challenges and the creation of new power structures, requiring the EU to engage more actively with present and emerging powers and non-state actors as well as with bilateral and multilateral partners and institutions in order to promote effective solutions to problems which are common to European citizens and the world at large, and that might have an impact on global security, F. whereas the new momentum also needs to lead to the definition of a new paradigm for the EU's strategic partnerships, both new and old, and whereas this should be based on shared universal values such as the drive for democracy, respect for human rights, basic freedoms, the rule of law and inter\u00ad national law, as well as on mutual benefits, interests and a common understanding of global security, G. whereas parliamentary scrutiny of EU foreign policy is essential if European external action is to be understood and supported by EU citizens; whereas the scrutiny enhances the legitimacy of this action; whereas the organisation and promotion of effective and regular inter-parliamentary cooperation within the EU must be jointly determined by the European Parliament and national parliaments, in accordance with Articles 9 and 10 of Protocol 1 to the Lisbon Treaty, The Council\u2019s 2009 annual report on the CFSP 1. Welcomes the Council's annual report and commends its transparent and theme-driven structure, which provides a clear overview of policies and actions in the field of the common foreign and security policy; welcomes also the Council's ambition to place further emphasis and a stronger focus on the regional context of conflicts and issues; regrets, however, the fact that no possible approaches to resolving those conflicts and issues are outlined in the report; 2. Calls on the Council not to limit the scope of the CFSP annual report to a mere description of CFSP activities but make it a policy- and solution-focused tool; takes the view that the report should provide more than a catalogue of country-based events and developments and should also address the question of the effectiveness of the EU foreign policy as well as of the means necessary to pursue the objectives of European external action; calls on the Council to also include in the report an evaluation of the coordination and coherence between the CFSP and other external policies of the Union as well as include strategic and organisational recommendations for the future on the basis of the assessment of CFSP actions; 3. Believes that the annual report on the CFSP should be based on the new institutional framework created by the Lisbon Treaty and serve as an instrument for enhanced interinstitutional dialogue, notably by discussing the implementation of an EU foreign policy strategy, evaluating its effectiveness and outlining its future direction; Enforcing the Lisbon Treaty 4. Reiterates its position in favour of developing a coherent EU foreign policy strategy, based on the objectives and principles established in Article 21 of the Treaty on European Union (TEU), which should clearly identify the common foreign and security policy interests of the EU; calls on the Vice-President/High Representative (VP/HR) to use to the full her powers to initiate, implement and ensure compliance with the CFSP, involving Parliament\u2019s relevant bodies fully in that endeavour; 5. Stresses the need to enhance coherence between the European External Action Service (EEAS), the Commission and the Member States under the leadership of the VP/HR; calls for improved synergies between the EU and the national level and that coordination be enhanced between the various institutional actors, with a view to better integrating all relevant instruments and policies and delivering a single EU message on key political issues; considers cooperation at all levels between the EEAS, the relevant bodies and committees in the European Parliament and the respective services in the Commission to be essential to enable the EU to develop a strategic approach to the EU\u2019s neighbourhood and to candidate, potential candidate and other partner countries, as well as to other policy areas such as human rights and democracy promotion, trade, development, energy security and justice and home affairs; EN 7.12.2012 Official Journal of the European Union C 377 E/37 Wednesday 11 May 2011 ",
        "6. Expects the EEAS, by promoting closer coordination between the CFSP and other external policies, to help strengthen the EU\u2019s role and influence on the global stage and enable it to project its interests and values more efficiently, in a manner commensurate with its existing international trade and economic status; calls on the VP/HR to set up the necessary coordination structures and mechanisms inside the EEAS; 7. Notes, however, that parallel to setting up the EEAS, the achievement of full coherence and efficiency of the EU common policy will require, first and foremost, the political will of the EU Member States to overcome their differing outlooks on key foreign policy issues; considers it essential, in this regard, that EU Member States not only agree on a common strategy for foreign and security policy, but also ensure that their national policies are supportive of EU positions; 8. Regrets that in several cases statements by individual or groups of EU Member States left the impression of disunity and made the work of the VP/HR particularly difficult; invites, therefore, the Member States to refrain from such individual and uncoordinated actions and statements and to contribute to an effective and visible CFSP; asks on the other hand the VP/HR to make the positions of the EU clearly heard, to react quickly and visibly, and to give the CFSP a clear and specific profile; 9. Stresses that the role of EU Special Representatives (EUSRs) should generally be to represent and coordinate EU policy towards regions with specific strategic or security interests for the EU which require a continuous EU presence and visibility; takes the view that close coordination must be established between the EUSRs and the relevant EEAS departments and that important thematic issues, previously covered by Personal Representatives, should be reconsidered and proposals put forward for this role to be taken over by high-ranking EEAS officials or EUSRs; considers it essential that defining the role and mandates of EUSRs be made subject to prior consultation of Parliament and that proposals be put forward, in accordance with Article 36(1) of the TEU, on the procedures and remit for the briefings and reports to be made available to Parliament by EUSRs; 10. Recalls its Treaty prerogative to be consulted in the CFSP and CSDP spheres, have its views duly taken into account and make recommendations; calls on the VP/HR to consolidate the consultation and reporting duties carried out to date by the Commission and the Council in the area of external action; asks the Council to adopt a constructive approach in the framework of the conciliation committee for the external assistance instruments, including the Instrument for Stability, by recognising the European Parlia\u00ad ment's right to democratic scrutiny of strategy papers and multiannual action plans, as established in Article 290 of the TFEU; 11. Stresses that the revised 2006 Interinstitutional Agreement on budgetary discipline and sound financial management must provide for more transparency in the CFSP budgetary procedure and properly address the information requirements of the budgetary authority in order for that authority to be fully and regularly informed on the background, context and financial implications of political decisions in this policy area; takes the view that the European Parliament should receive adequate information prior to the adoption of mandates and strategies in the CFSP sphere; welcomes the support expressed by the VP/HR for the proposal that all important CSDP missions should be identified in the budget; believes, in this regard, that full transparency and democratic scrutiny require separate budget lines for each and every mission; reiterates its position that, in order to enhance the democratic legitimacy of the CFSP, Parliament's competent bodies should be consulted prior to the launch of CSDP missions and should be able properly to monitor CSDP missions in particular; emphasises that in order to fulfil the criteria of credibility and self-definition in the Lisbon Treaty, adequate budgetary resources need to be allocated to CFSP objec\u00ad tives; 12. Considers that the regular joint consultation meetings on the CFSP should be complemented by additional meetings to be held should the need arise to provide ex ante information; suggests, in this regard, that the meetings should also be geared to learning key strategic and politico-military lessons in order to improve the planning and management of future missions and help develop a forward-looking approach to future needs; recalls, further, its right to be consulted and the need for it to be adequately informed about urgent financing arrangements for certain initiatives launched under the CFSP in line with Article 41(3) of the TEU; EN C 377 E/38 Official Journal of the European Union 7.12.2012 Wednesday 11 May 2011 ",
        "13. Supports, in line with the agreement reached by the quadrilogue in Madrid on the setting-up and functioning of the EEAS, and in line with the Financial Regulation as modified regarding the EEAS, the creation in the 2011 budget of budget items dedicated to the three major missions conducted under CFSP/CSDP; believes that this improved identification of missions will increase both the transparency and accountability of CFSP/CSDP and serve the interests of the EU; stresses that the identification of major CFSP/CSDP missions must not be detrimental to information and transparency concerning missions of smaller extent and lesser political visibility; 14. Considers, nevertheless, this new nomenclature as a minimum prerequisite and only a first step towards a fully detailed CFSP budget which would allow a complete overview and follow-up of the missions conducted under this policy; is of the opinion that such a new nomenclature will jeopardise neither the indispensable flexibility of the CFSP budget nor the continuity of action for missions already engaged; 15. Recalls the spirit of the TFEU, which aims to make codecision the general procedure and which, by analogy, leads to the lifting of specific clauses or procedures that had applied to some instruments or policies under the previous Treaty and the Interinstitutional Agreement; confirms hereby that the provisions restricting the flexibility of the financing of the CFSP are now groundless; underlines that, in line with the above and in order to enhance the efficiency and accountability of the CFSP, a new culture of dialogue, reciprocal trust and exchange of information should finally pervade interinstitutional relations, both in the defining phase and in the conducting and a posteriori assessment phases; 16. Underlines that, in the context of future reflections on the Multiannual Financial Framework 2014- 2020, a thorough analysis of the financial requirements of the CFSP in the long term needs to be conducted; 17. Reiterates its position that, in accordance with Article 218(6) of the TFEU, the opinion/consent of the European Parliament is required for all international agreements, including those related mainly to CFSP, with the sole exception of those related exclusively to CFSP: in accordance with Article 218(10) of the TFEU, full information must be provided to Parliament at the initial, negotiating and final stages of the procedure leading to the conclusion of international agreements; expects the VP/HR to provide all relevant information about the negotiations throughout the procedure, including negotiating directives and draft negotiating texts, and recalls that in the declaration on political accountability the VP/HR committed herself to applying the provisions of the Framework Agreement on international agreements with regard to confidential CFSP documents; calls for the establishment of an efficient modus operandi that combines respect for Parliament's prerogatives with the necessary degree of confidentiality; believes that a compre\u00ad hensive agreement involving all the institutions and covering all EU bodies is required in order to regulate access to confidential documents by Members of Parliament; 18. Notes its Treaty obligation to determine, together with national parliaments, the organisation and promotion of effective and regular interparliamentary cooperation, in particular in the field of the common foreign, security and defence policy; finds it regrettable that there is as yet no agreement on how to take this exercise forward; insists that its own representation in any new form of interparliamentary cooperation should be of a size which reflects the range and importance of its role in external affairs and, on this basis, reiterates its willingness to reach an agreement with national parliaments that will result in a real enhancement of the parliamentary dimension of the European Union as global actor; Main CFSP thematic issues 19. Emphasises that CSDP actions should be embedded in a comprehensive policy targeting countries and regions in crisis where the EU's values and strategic interests are at stake and where CSDP operations would provide a real added value in promoting peace, stability and the rule of law; stresses, further, the need for a lessons learnt process more accurate in assessing the successful implementation of each operation and its lasting impact on the ground; EN 7.12.2012 Official Journal of the European Union C 377 E/39 Wednesday 11 May 2011 ",
        "20. Calls on the VP/HR, the Council and the Member States to overcome the imbalance between civilian and military planning capabilities in the EEAS and to increase the number of staff in the fields of justice, civilian administration, customs and mediation so as to ensure that adequate and sufficient expertise can be provided for CSDP missions; 21. Emphasises the need for optimal coordination between EU disaster responses and other EU instruments \u2013 such as CSDP civilian and/or military missions \u2013 which are already being deployed on the ground or which could be set up in the aftermath of a crisis; takes the view that in many cases a too rigid distinction between military and civilian crisis-management operations reflects rather outdated institutional patterns and that civil-military interaction can better respond to the realities on the ground; emphasises, therefore, the need for a systematic case-by-case evaluation of the needs in order to ensure the most appropriate responses since certain crises may require a combination of military and civilian instruments, based on a comprehensive understanding of the links between security and development; 22. Considers it an EU strategic priority to strengthen international crisis-management partnerships and enhance dialogue with other major crisis-management actors \u2013 such as the UN, NATO, the African Union (AU), the OSCE and third countries such as the USA, Turkey, Norway and Canada \u2013 and to synchronise actions, share information and pool resources in the fields of peacekeeping and peace-building, including cooperation on crisis management and, in particular, maritime security, and the fight against terrorism under international law; 23. Emphasises that the establishment of the EEAS provides the EU with a unique opportunity to implement its commitments on conflict prevention and peace-building, with particular reference to the Gothenburg Programme, and to further expand the EU\u2019s capacity to prevent conflict as an alternative to crisis management; to this end, stresses the importance of putting the Directorate for Conflict Prevention and Security Policy on an equal footing with other directorates by resourcing it adequately for policy programming and by strengthening the links with the geographical departments and establishing formal relations with the relevant Council Working Groups; takes the view that the existing separation between the crisis management structure and the Directorate for Conflict Prevention and Security Policy should also be reconsidered; 24. Warns of the risk that the EU Member States become overly-dependent on third countries for their energy supplies, which could ultimately undermine the independence of EU foreign policy; stresses, in this regard, that the concept of energy security is fundamentally linked to the security of supply; recalls, therefore, the urgent need to address energy challenges by promoting both renewable and domestic sources of energy, completing an effective internal energy market and implementing a common European external energy policy, based on better coordination of Member States' policies in this field, the diversification of energy suppliers and the facilitation of strategic energy infrastructure projects such as Nabucco or other viable southern corridor alternatives; supports an integrated and inter-operable European energy grid; regrets that the Member States are actively engaged in supporting initiatives which in reality are in competition with efforts aimed at securing and diversifying sources of energy supply; 25. Welcomes the decision of the European Council to invite the Commission to submit by June 2011 a communication on security of supply and international cooperation aimed at further improving the consistency and coherence of the EU's external action in the field of energy; calls, in this regard, on the VP/HR to pursue with determination Parliament's recommendations for the development of a coherent and coordinated policy, in particular by promoting EU cohesion in constructive dialogue with energy suppliers, and especially with Russia as well as with transit countries; is of the view that energy security should also be fully reflected in the EU\u2019s enlargement and neighbourhood policy, including through political dialogue and practical cooperation with partners; 26. Draws attention to a new generation of security challenges and risks, e.g. cyber-attacks, social unrest, political insurgencies, global criminal networks and economic activities endangering the rule of law and the principles of democracy, and stresses the importance of formulating strategies appropriate to these devel\u00ad opments; EN C 377 E/40 Official Journal of the European Union 7.12.2012 Wednesday 11 May 2011 ",
        "27. Underlines the need to coordinate the preparation to counter unconventional threats, such as cyber threats; calls upon the Commission and the Council to conduct a thorough analysis of the threats and the needs in this field, resulting in a multidimensional and comprehensive European cyber security strategy which should include contingency plans in case of cyber attacks; 28. Points out that European foreign policy must take account of the external dimension of the European area of freedom, security and justice; reiterates the importance of orderly migration management; considers it essential to secure the cooperation of both the countries of origin and of transit, and to encourage an attitude of solid cooperation among those countries by applying a policy of positive conditionality; 29. Reiterates its position that the EU must strengthen its leadership in the area of global climate governance and further develop a dialogue with other key actors, such as the emerging powers (China, Brazil, India), Russia, the United States and developing countries, given that climate change has become a key element of international relations; 30. Takes the view that, in order to be consistent with the EU\u2019s own values, EU foreign policy and external action must give priority to promoting democracy and the rule of law, good governance and fair societies, given that a rule-based democratic society is the basis for upholding human rights as well as for enhancing stability; thus reiterates its position that human rights need to be firmly mainstreamed into EU foreign policy; believes that the new institutional structure of the EU, with particular reference to the EEAS and its dedicated department, offers an opportunity to enhance the EU's coherence and effectiveness in this area; urges the VP/HR to proactively pursue, through bilateral relations with third countries and active participation in international fora, the engagement of third countries in respecting human rights as well as to speak up against human rights abuses and not to refrain from taking adequate measures if they are violated; considering the growing grave violations of freedom of belief, calls upon the Commission to conduct a thorough evaluation and to mainstream freedom of belief into the EU human rights policy; 31. Considers the question of the freedom of religion and belief worldwide \u2013 notably of Christians, persecuted or endangered minorities and religious dissidents \u2013 and the inter-faith dialogue a new key issue for the CFSP; stresses that freedom of religion and belief is a core human right, and inter-faith dialogue an instrument to tackle religiously motivated discrimination and violence, thus contributing to political and societal stability; therefore calls on the VP/HR to develop, as a matter of urgency, an EU strategy on the enforcement of the human right to freedom of religion and belief; also invites her to establish a permanent capacity within the human rights directorate of the EEAS to monitor the situation of governmental and societal restrictions on the freedom of religion and belief and related rights; 32. Urges the VP/HR to ensure that CFSP policies and actions fully implement UNSCR 1325 (2000) on women, peace and security, which calls for the participation of women in all aspects and at all levels of conflict resolution; also calls for the CFSP policies to take into account UNSCR 1820 (2008) on sexual violence in conflict and post-conflict situations as well as the subsequent UNSCRs 1888 (2009), 1889 (2009) and 1960 (2010), which build upon the previously mentioned resolutions; calls on the VP/HR, EU Member States and Heads of CSDP Mission to make cooperation and consultation with local women's organisations a standard element of each CSDP mission; notes with regret that only one woman has so far been nominated to a senior post in the EEAS and that there is only one woman amongst the EU Special Representatives; Main CFSP geographical priorities Multilateral diplomacy, international organisations 33. Emphasises that effective multilateralism should be the overriding strategic concern of the Union and that, in this context, the EU should take a leading role in international cooperation, support international institutions, facilitate international consensus and advance global action; emphasises the urgent need to address global issues of common concern for EU citizens, such as fighting terrorism, organised crime, pandemics and climate change, cyber security, ensuring the achievement of the Millennium Development EN 7.12.2012 Official Journal of the European Union C 377 E/41 Wednesday 11 May 2011 ",

Welcomes the adoption of the UN General Assembly Resolution concerning the EU's participation in the work of the UN on 3 May 2011, which takes into account the institutional changes introduced by the Lisbon Treaty and enables EU representatives to present and promote the EU's positions in the UN in a timely and efficient manner; considers it essential to engage with the EU's strategic partners in order to find solutions to major regional and global problems; recommends, furthermore, that strategic partnerships be given a multilateral dimension by including global issues on the agendas for the EU's bilateral and multi\u00ad lateral summits; invites France and the United Kingdom, as permanent members of the UN Security Council (UNSC), and in accordance with Article 34(2) TEU, to request that the VP/HR be invited to present the Union's position whenever the EU has defined a position on a subject on the UNSC's agenda; takes the view that the European Union should be represented as such in multilateral financial organisations, in particular the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, without prejudice to Member State representation; 35. Takes the view that the EU should seize the opportunity of the adoption of NATO's new Strategic Concept in order to substantially strengthen its partnership with NATO, while at the same time developing the EU's foreign, security and defence policies; welcomes, as a positive step in this regard, the concrete set of proposals presented by the VP/HR to the NATO Secretary General, aiming at the adoption of an organi\u00ad sation-to-organisation relationship; emphasises that the EU shares most of the threats to security identified by NATO in its new Strategic Concept; points to the need to find pragmatic ways of solving outstanding difficulties; calls, in this respect, on the EU to exercise its influence for a successful conclusion of the ongoing process for a comprehensive settlement of the Cyprus problem to remove all the differences between Cyprus and Turkey which are hampering the development of closer cooperation between the EU and NATO; 36. Considers it important to ensure that existing forces and capabilities which are shared to a large extent by both organisations are used as efficiently as possible and that conditions are optimised for the security of European troops and civilian operators; invites NATO to refrain from developing a civilian crisis management capability which would duplicate EU structures and capabilities; calls for a coherent strategy of nuclear non-proliferation and disarmament in the framework of EU-NATO cooperation and in line with the action plan of the 2010 NPT Review Conference declaration; encourages both NATO and Russia to work towards a more stable relationship based on mutual trust; 37. Recognises that the OSCE needs to be strengthened and its values reaffirmed; firmly believes that the EU should engage effectively in the task of strengthening the OSCE, including by ensuring that the process does not result in the weakening of any of that organisation\u2019s three dimensions (politico-military, economic and environmental, and human); stresses that the EU should also draw attention to the importance of continuing the Corfu Process and of holding regular high-level meetings in order to give political backing to and enhance the visibility of OSCE activities; 38. Acknowledges the rising international status and importance of the Arctic and calls for a socially, environmentally and economically sustainable EU policy for the Arctic taking into account local and indigenous peoples' rights; regards the Arctic Council, the Northern Dimension Policy and the Barents Euro-Arctic Council as focal points for cooperation in the Arctic and supports the EU's aspiration to become a permanent observer in the Arctic Council; emphasises the need for an Arctic unit within the EEAS; Transatlantic relations 39. Reiterates its commitment to the transatlantic partnership as an important element and one of the main pillars of the EU's external action; calls on the EU, furthermore, to reconfirm its commitment to the transatlantic partnership with the US and the goal of a barrier-free transatlantic market, which should provide the basis for reinforced transatlantic partnership; urges the VP/HR to work for better coordination and increased cooperation between the EU and its closest ally, the US; calls on her to ensure that the EU acts as a coherent, active, equal and yet autonomous partner of the US in strengthening, inter alia, global security and stability, promoting peace and respect for human rights; urges, furthermore, that a united EN C 377 E/42 Official Journal of the European Union 7.12.2012 Wednesday 11 May 2011 ",

Urges the development of a comprehensive EU-US strategy for the improvement of the security situation throughout the greater Middle East, Iran, Afghanistan and Pakistan which involves cooperation with Turkey, Russia and China; Western Balkans 41. Confirms the EU membership perspective for all the Western Balkan countries and underlines the importance of a continuous commitment to the enlargement process from both the countries of the region and the EU; recalls that the prospect of EU enlargement is an important incentive for the continuation of political and economic reforms in the Western Balkan countries, contributing to the effective stability and development of the region; 42. Recognises progress achieved by all countries of the region on their path towards the EU; notes, however, that political instability and institutional weaknesses, together with unresolved bilateral issues, are hampering the further progress of some countries towards EU integration; stresses that the Union needs a clear and common vision towards the region; calls on the VP/HR and the Commission to actively engage in solving the persistent problems; 43. Notes the fact that the situation in Kosovo remains stable and peaceful but fragile; is concerned about the serious problems and breaches of electoral law which occurred in several municipalities during the recent elections and calls on the EU to closely monitor the situation of democracy in Kosovo; urges all those involved to take steps to improve democratic rights and living conditions for all people living in Kosovo and stresses the importance of electoral reform and fair elections as part of Kosovo's ongoing democratic transition; calls on Kosovo politicians to respect the Constitution; urges the new Kosovo government and parliament to improve future electoral processes in order to secure the democratic rights of all Kosovo citizens and to improve Kosovo's prospects of European integration; is aware that not all Member States have recognised the independence of Kosovo; 44.
