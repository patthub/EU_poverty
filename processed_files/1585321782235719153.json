        "Abstract The paper evaluates the impact of the Chinese minimum wage policy on consumption of low-wage households for the period 2002-2009. Using a representative household panel, we find that the consumption response to minimum wage income shock is increasing in the minimum wage share of household income and that poorer households fully consume their additional income. The large marginal propensity to consume is driven by households with at least one child, while childless poor households save two thirds of a minimum wage hike. The expenditure increase is concentrated in health care and education with potentially long-lasting benefits to household welfare.

        "1 Non Technical Summary In this paper we seek to understand how a rise in minimum wages influence household consumption behavior. China\u2019s minimum wage policy sets more than 2,000 county-level wage floors in the world\u2019s largest labor market of close to 800 million workers. Minimum wages affect at least one household member in approximately 18% of all urban households. For the period 2002-2009, we identify more than 13,874 minimum wage changes across China\u2019s 2,183 counties, and match them to the urban household survey (UHS) which covers 73,164 urban household-year observations. We summarize the four key findings as follows: 1. Minimum wage increases in China are a very effective policy tool for increasing income and consumption levels of households dependant on the minimum wage. Our estimates show that low-wage households spend the entire additional income stemming from a higher minimum wage. Our results yield a much stronger consumption responses to minimum wage hikes than commonly found in U.S. data. Only for the 6.5% of households without a child do we find an economically large saving effect. These households save two thirds of the income increase explained by the minimum wage hike. 2. More than 30% of the minimum wage income shock is consumed as health and educational expenditure. This is likely to improve the long-run income of the family since these categories of expenditures are akin to investments. Households earning more than half of their dispos- able income from minimum wages spend between 0.26-0.32% of the income increase on food consumption. 3. We find no evidence for economically significant dis-employment effects. While the weekly hours worked decrease by approximately 18.5 minutes for a 10% increase in the minimum wage, we cannot find any evidence for a loss in employment status even for most exposed category of migrant workers. Some aspects of China\u2019s economic situation deserve to be highlighted and can help the reader to better interpret our findings. Our results yield a much stronger consumption responses to minimum wage hikes than commonly found in U.S. data. In the 1990s, the real minimum wage in China was still close to the international poverty line of one U.S. dollar per day and remains comparatively low dur- ing our sample period 2002-2009. Urgent consumption needs imply a large consumption response and marginal propensities of consumption are in general larger at the lower end of the income distribution.

        "2 Introduction China\u2019s minimum wage policy sets more than 2,000 county-level wage floors in the world\u2019s largest labor market of close to 800 million workers. Minimum wages affect at least one household member in approximately 18% of all urban households. 1 We seek to understand how exogenous income vari- ation driven by minimum wage changes influence household consumption behavior. Our main focus is on household consumption since it provides a particularly relevant metric of welfare and is often better measured and less volatile than income, Deaton (1997), Deaton and Grosh (2000). Moreover, in the development economics literature, consumption is the standard metric used to assess the rel- ative poverty of households, Ravallion et al. (2009). Yet the existing literature on minimum wages in developing countries has not documented their effect on consumption. 2 Just like in Western soci- eties, minimum wage policies are controversial in emerging countries for fears of unemployment effects, threats to industrial competitiveness, and employment substitution into the informal labour market, Rama (2001), Comola and De Mello (2011), Fang and Lin (2015). These concerns also relate to skepticism about the positive consumption effect of minimum wage increases. First, higher minimum wages may simply substitute for other social transfers so that the effective disposable income increase is considerably attenuated; as shown for example in U.S. data by Dube (2017). Second, the dispos- able income effect of higher minimum wages may be perceived as transitory\u2014particularly in emerging countries with higher price inflation. Consumption smoothing may then result only in a modest con- sumption increase with limited welfare benefits. Third, higher minimum wages can increase household unemployment risk, trigger precautionary savings, and attenuate the consumption effect. Finally, a higher frequency of unemployment can potentially make some households much worse off than in the absence of a minimum wage. Our analysis seeks to address each of these concerns for the Chinese labour market. China provides a particularly rich and unique institutional setting for research on the consumption effect of minimum wages. The Chinese minimum wage is set at the county-level and is frequently adjusted to keep pace with price inflation and raising standards of living in a high growth environment. For the period 2002-2009, we identify more than 13,874 changes of minimum wages across China\u2019s 2,183 counties and match them to the Chinese Urban Household Survey (UHS). No other labour 1 Source: International Labour Organization, ILOSTAT database, using World Bank population estimates. Labor data retrieved in March 2017 https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SL.TLF.TOTL.IN?locations=CN . This means that an estimated 82.5 million households are concerned by minimum wage legislation or approximately 265 million household members; see for instance the National Bureau of Statistics NBS (2013), China Statistical Yearbook 2013, Beijing: China Statistics Press. Available at: http://www.stats.gov.cn/tjsj/ndsj/2013/indexeh.htm 2 The literature has focused more on the impact of minimum wages on income distribution. Using labor survey data from Indonesia, Rama (2001) finds that wages above the minimum wage increased between 5-15%. Bosch and Manacorda (2010) find that inequality of income earnings in Mexico is associated with the decline of the minimum wage. Engbom and Moser (2016) conclude that minimum wages help reduce earnings inequality in formal sectors of the Brazilian economy. ECB Working Paper Series No 2333 / December 2019 4 ",
        "market in the world can rival China\u2019s in the frequency, heterogeneity, and magnitude of minimum wage variation. The UHS gives a detailed breakdown of household income and consumption along several household characteristics and it reports all household transfers stemming from income relief and other social policies. This allows us to disentangle the confounding effect of social transfer policies from the impact of the minimum wages and study the interactions between the two. Importantly, the UHS provides additional data on the employment status of each household member and the monthly average hours worked. This enables us to study dis-employment effects. 3 We perform two-stage least square estimations (2SLS), which use the minimum wage increase as an instrument for household income shocks. 4 We estimate the consumption responses to income changes without conditioning on employment status; i.e. we retain all workers in the sample independently of whether they keep or lose their job after a minimum wage hike. We summarize the four key findings as follows: 1. Minimum wage increases in China are a very effective policy tool for increasing income and consumption levels of households dependant on the minimum wage. Our estimates show a marginal propensity to consume out of a minimum wage income shock of one. In other words, low-wage households spend the entire additional income stemming from a higher minimum wage. Only for the 6.5% of households without a child do we find an economically large saving effect. These households save two thirds of the income increase explained by the minimum wage hike. 2. More than 30% of the minimum wage income shock is consumed as health and educational expenditure. This is likely to improve the long-run income of the family since these categories of expenditures are akin to investments as shown by Attanasio et al. (2007) and Blundell et al. (2008). Households earning more than half of their disposable income from minimum wages spend between 0.26-0.32% of the income increase on food consumption. 3. Some of the evidence suggests that liquidity constraints contribute to the strong consumption response as in Zeldes (1989) and Jappelli and Pistaferri (2010). For example, financially less constrained low-wage households with property income show a marginal propensity to consume which is 36% lower than for households without property income. Yet, the marginal propen- sity of consumption remains high even for these households in light of China\u2019s low aggregate 3 A shortcoming of the UHS is that household consumption is not broken down by household member, which implies that we cannot infer an individual\u2019s marginal propensity to consume, but instead rely on aggregate household estimates. 4 Previous work on consumption responses to income shocks in developing countries has relied on weather induced shocks to income. Wolpin (1982) uses weather shocks in India to estimate an income elasticity of consumption in the range 0.91-1.02 depending on the definition of consumption. Related work by Paxson (1992) studies weather shocks in Thailand to estimate the saving propensity to weather related income shocks greater than zero, but small. Kan et al. (2017) exploit variation in the 2009 Taiwan Shopping Voucher Program to find a marginal propensity to consume of one quarter. ECB Working Paper Series No 2333 / December 2019 5 ",
        "consumption to income ratio. 4. We find no evidence for economically significant dis-employment effects. While the weekly hours worked decrease by approximately 18.5 minutes for a 10% increase in the minimum wage, we cannot find any evidence for a loss in employment status even for most exposed category of migrant workers. Some aspects of China\u2019s economic situation deserve to be highlighted and can help the reader to better interpret our findings. Our results yield a much stronger consumption responses to minimum wage hikes than commonly found in U.S. data. 5 In the 1990s, the real minimum wage in China was still close to the international poverty line of one U.S. dollar per day and remains comparatively low during our sample period 2002-2009. Urgent consumption needs imply a large consumption response and marginal propensities of consumption are in general larger at the lower end of the income distribution. This is further accentuated by a high propensity to consume on health and education expenditures\u2014 probably a consequence of a relatively underdeveloped health and costly education systems in China as suggested by Chamon and Prasad (2010). Health insurance coverage in China was only 29.7% in 2003, Meng et al. (2012). At the same time in the U.S., an estimated 84.8% of the population had health insurance coverage according to the U.S. Current Population Survey, Mills and Bhandari (2003). We can rationalize the absence of dis-employment effects by the low levels of minimum wages relative to the median wage\u2014unlike minimum wages in developed countries. This might explain why we do not find any economically and statistically significant dis-employment effect of minimum wages even for the least protected individuals such as urban migrants. Low unemployment risk strengthens the marginal propensity of consumption and reduces the motive for precautionary savings. 6 We find a positive relationship between minimum wages and transfer income: a RMB 1 increase in minimum wages comes on average with a simultaneous increase in transfer income by RMB 0.49 per household member. This contrasts with the U.S. where eligibility thresholds for transfers imply that the latter decrease when minimum wages go up. 7 The positive correlation between China\u2019s minimum wage increases and upward revision in social transfers is consistent with the evidence on social transfer 5 Aaronson et al. (2012) estimate a positive expenditure effect for minimum wage dependent U.S. households with an elasticity lower than one, and conclude that most of the consumption effect can be traced to durable expenditures such as debt financed vehicle purchases. Alonso (2016) employs aggregate county-level U.S. sales data to find that a 10% increase in minimum wages increases non-durable consumption by 1% in the aggregate, and finds that this aggregate effect is larger in poorer counties. 6 For the effects of minimum wages on employment in the U.S. see for example the contributions of Krueger and Card (1995) and Card and Krueger (2000) juxtaposed to Neumark and Wascher (1992) and the recent evidence of Dube et al. (2010), Allegretto et al. (2011), Neumark et al. (2014a), Neumark et al. (2014b), Allegretto et al. (2016). 7 For the U.S., Dube (2017) documents that a reduction in public assistance partly offsets minimum wage income gains. The latter are on average 25% lower when accompanied with tax credits and non-cash transfers. ECB Working Paper Series No 2333 / December 2019 6 ",
        "policies for disadvantaged households, Leung (2006), Hao et al. (2009), Meng (2012) and Qu and Zhao (2017). After 2000, the Chinese central and local (province, city or county level) governments implemented various social (transfer) programs for urban households. Their implementation often coincided with minimum wage increases during our sample period. Fortunately, the UHS reports all transfer payments so that we can correctly estimate the consumption propensity of both marginal minimum wage income and marginal transfer income. The paper is organized as follows. Section 3 presents the China\u2019s minimum wage regulation and the urban household survey. Section 4 discusses the research design. Section 5 presents the main results on the impact of the minimum wage level on total household consumption. Here we also highlight the role of minimum wages in affecting household\u2019s health and education expenditure, and present estimates for non-durable and durable consumption propensities. The role of household heterogeneity for consumption behavior is discussed in Section 6 with a focus on financial constraints and household structure. Section 7 investigates dis-employment effects of minimum wage increases. In Section 8, we explore robustness issues and Section 9 concludes. 3 Household Consumption and Minimum Wages in China 3.1 China\u2019s Urban Household Survey China\u2019s Urban Households Survey (UHS) represents a comprehensive and representative survey of urban workers and households managed by the Chinese National Bureau of Statistics (NBS). The UHS is conducted via stratified randomization sampling. It records a wide range of demographic and socioeconomic conditions of Chinese urban households, including detailed information on different income sources, wages and granular consumption items for households on an annual basis. In this paper, we restrict the analysis to eight consecutive years of the UHS from 2002 to 2009. Prior to 2002, the survey does not provide a panel structure and we exclude the earlier years from the econometric analysis. We merge the urban household survey with the minimum wage data for China\u2019s 2,183 counties and 285 cities. In Section 3.2.1 we provides a discussion of the minimum wage data with detailed descriptive statistics of the combined UHS and minimum wage data reported in Appendix B. To analyze the impact of minimum wages on household consumption, we distinguish household groups in terms of their reliance on wage income near the county minimum wage. Following Aaronson et al. (2012), we define by S the share of total non-property income earned by the two best-paid household members from wages near the minimum wage. Labor income of any household member is considered to be near the county minimum wage and counted towards the nominator of S if it falls ECB Working Paper Series No 2333 / December 2019 7 ",
        "within the range 50%-150% of the county minimum wage. 8 Formally, let E m,h,c denote the annual labor income and w m,h,c the wage of the two best paid household members m = 1 , 2 in household h in county c. For a dummy variable D [ . ] = 1 indicating a wage in the range 50%-150% of county minimum wage MW c , we define minimum wage income share as S h,c = 1 T otal Income h,c (cid:88) m =1 , 2 E m,h,c \u00d7 D [0 . 5 MW c \u2264 w m,h,c \u2264 1 . 5 MW c ] (1) where T otal Income h,c in the denominator represents the sum of the total disposable income of the two top earners in the household. 9 By definition, the minimum wage income share S hc is between 0 and 1. A higher share implies that the household tends to be poorer and her income more subject to any variation in the minimum wage policy. In the case where both the household head and spouse work at the minimum wage, the share S approaches one. 10 Figure I plots the distribution of the share S across the sample: the majority of households do not earn any wage from the minimum wage, for the minimum wage dependent households the distribution is bimodal with the highest peak being households with S > 0 . 9. Throughout the analysis, we consider households without any minimum wage income ( S = 0), the complementary set of households with at least some income related to the minimum wage ( S > 0), households with at least half of their income from wages near the minimum wage ( S > 0 . 5), and households very dependent on the minimum wage for their subsistence ( S > 0 . 75). The last two groups are the main focus of interest and we can expect the consumption response to minimum wage changes to be most pronounced for this group. To address endogeneity concerns related to self-selection, we calculate the share S for the first year a household enters the survey and keep the initial S constant for all consecutive years a household features in the survey. For example, if a minimum wage hikes generate job losses and a household\u2019s minimum wage income drops, we still track this household by its original S. In other words, we track a constant sample of households without conditioning on their (potentially endogenous) wage evolution. 11 In addition, from the regression sample we exclude the first year a household is sampled, 8 The upper bound of 150% is consistent with the findings of spillover/ripple effects of minimum wages on the wage distribution whereby workers earning just above the minimum wage tend to have an upgrade when the minimum wage is increased, Krueger and Card (1995). The lower bound of 50% is applied to include workers in firms that do not comply fully with the minimum wage policy. The results are robust to other thresholds for minimum wage ripple effect (we experimented with 0.5-1.2 and 0.5-1.3). 9 Disposable income is composed by the sum of labor income, property income, operating income and transfer income. We observe all of these sub-categories of income in the household survey. 10 If all members of the household are unemployed in the first year the household enters the panel, the sum of the best two earners results in a zero labor income and consequently S = 0. We eliminate these households from the data set (i.e. only 166 observations or 0.2% of the overall sample) to avoid any confounding effects with households earning labor income above the minimum wage. 11 The results are nevertheless robust to an alternative definitions of treatment exposure. Table B-III shows that the proportion of households within different categories of S does not change significantly if S is measured with alternative definitions of treated worker.

        "and for which S is determined, to eliminate the mechanical correlation between S and wages which may bias the results. All our estimates of consumption are unconditional on employment status, i.e. we keep in the sample both workers who retain their jobs and workers who lose their jobs. It is instructive to compare household characteristics across the four different household groups ( S = 0 , S > 0 , S > 0 . 5 and S > 0 . 75) with increasing dependence on minimum wage income. In Appendix B, Table B-I, we report differences in the structure of household income and spending, and in Table B-II we illustrates the differences in demographic structure. Households with S > 0 . 5 ( S > 0 . 75) account for 6% (5%) of all observations, but earn only 2.6% (2.4%) of all labor income, whereas households without minimum wage income represent 72% of the sample and earn 81.9% of all labor income. In terms of demographic characteristics, minimum wage households tend to be only slightly larger with 3.3 members compared to 3.1 for the household S = 0. This suggests that the one child policy was implemented consistently across income groups. Unsurprisingly, minimum wage household show lower house ownership rates and their migration to the urban area is typically more recent. We also highlight that minimum wage dependent households are much less likely to work for state-owned enterprise (SOE). The latter tend to pay higher wages than the private sector. Finally, the educational level and work experience of the head of household tends to be lower for minimum wage dependent families. An distinct advantage of the China\u2019s urban household survey data is that it records all transfer income and sub-components of transfer income such as social assistance income, unemployment benefit, dismissal compensation, indemnity insurance income, subsistence allowance, etc. As expected, poorer households (with S > 0 . 5 or S > 0 . 75) feature a lower share of disposable income earned from labor income and rely more on social transfer income from the authorities. Almost 20% of their disposable income comes from social transfers. Moreover, minimum wage dependent households tend to consume 82% of their disposable income compared to only 70% for households with S = 0. 12 3.2 The Minimum Wage in China Chinese minimum wage legislation was first promulgated in 1994 following a wave of economic liber- alization policies and the transition from predominantly state-owned production to a mixed economy with a growing private sector. However, the first implementation was ineffective since it lacked provi- sions and rules for the adjustment to price inflation and county economic conditions. It also suffered from lax enforcement and extensive non-compliance. Rawski (2003), Du and Wang (2008), Sun and 12 In Table B-I and throughout the analysis, consumption is defined as expenditure on: food, clothes, household services, medical care, education, transportation and living. This is consumption net of purchasing property, transfer expendi- tures, social contributions and personal social expenditure. It is also net of investments; the latter is be confounded with savings.

        "Shu (2011), Ye et al. (2015). China\u2019s access to the World Trade Organization and the related boom of the manufacturing sector generated political pressure for a more efficient minimum wage regulation. In December 2003, the central government opted for a reform of minimum wage regulation, and in March 2004, the Ministry of Labor and Social Security introduced the new Minimum Wage Regulations (MWR) into Chinese Labor Law. The most significant provisions required indexation of the minimum wage to the cost of living and a minimum wage level sufficient to support basic daily needs of employees. County and provincial authorities were required to review the minimum wage at least every two year in light of changed economic conditions and propose a revised minimum wage to the provincial authorities. Moreover, implementation of the new MWR was strengthened by increased control at the county administrative level and firm level in pursuit of better compliance. Penalties for non-compliance increased from 20-100% of the statutory minimum wage to 100-500%. China\u2019s administrative and political process of setting minimum wages is not subject to an open public debate. The law only stipulates the requirement of regular review of the minimum wage level, not a mandatory change or wage level. When the decision of a higher nominal minimum wage is taken upon proposal by the county government and approval by the provincial authorities, implementation follows swiftly with a delay of only two months after a county government announcement. Following the public announcement, the information is spread via local government websites, radio and TV channels. This decision process implies that little public information is generated that would allow households to anticipate well in advance minimum wage changes and modify their consumption behavior accordingly, Du and Jia (2016). Figure II illustrates the proportion of counties that increase their nominal annual minimum wage between 1996 and 2012. In line with the reformation of the MWR, trade liberalization and the large productivity growth of the booming manufacturing sector, real minimum wage growth in China was higher after the reform. Real minimum wage grew at 5.08% in the period 1996-2003 and accelerated to 8.57% in the period 2004-2012. In monetary terms, the average annual real minimum wage was only RMB 1,259 ($441 under PPP) in 1996, but increased to RMB 4,610 ($1,309 under PPP) in 2012. 13 In other terms, China\u2019s average real minimum wage started slightly above the international poverty line set at $1 per day in 1996, and increased to $3.55 per day over the next 16 years. Minimum wage regulation is only effective under general compliance, which we document based 13 Effective annual nominal minimum wage increased from RMB 2,628 ($921 under PPP) in 1996 to RMB 13,224 ($3,756 under PPP) in 2012. In the same period, the annual real growth rate of Chinese labor productivity was 8.9%, while real GDP oscillated around 9.7%. Purchasing power parity conversion factors are from the World Bank\u2019s International Comparison Program Database; data on growth are from the World Bank World Development Indicators; productivity data are from the OECD Productivity Archives, see http://stats.oecd.org/Index.aspx?DataSetCode=PDB_LV .

        "on two different measures. First, we determine the share of workers with a wage below the minimum wage in their county. Second, we calculate an average deviation of non-compliant wages from the county minimum wage for all worker paid below the minimum wage. 14 Figure III shows both measure for each sample year. An average 5% of workers are paid a wage below the minimum wage throughout the sample period. This proportion is comparable with the European average as documented in Goraus-Ta\u00b4 nska and Lewandowski (2016). In addition, it is considerably lower than the 15% violation headcount in Chile, the 50% non-compliance in Argentina and other Latin American countries, or a 70% non-compliance rate in higher skilled occupations in urban areas in Kenya, see Lemos (2009) and Bhorat et al. (2019). The annual average percentage deviation of non-compliant wage from the statutory minimum wage is around 19%, which is lower than the corresponding number for Central and East European countries at 32.3%, see Goraus-Ta\u00b4 nska and Lewandowski (2016), and also lower than the 23.2% reported for Chile, see Bhorat et al. (2019). 3.2.1 Minimum Wage Data The minimum wage data used in this study are collected by the Chinese Ministry of Human Resources and report the hourly county minimum wage in 2,183 counties representing 285 cities for the period 1994-2012. 15 The workers are subject to heterogeneous minimum wage changes across counties: in a given year, those working in counties with a minimum wage hike constitute the treatment group and those working in counties with no change in minimum wages the control group. 16 We aggregate the observed hourly minimum wages to a yearly minimum wage in order to match it to the annual reporting of the household survey data. The UHS reports separately income stemming from bonuses or overtime working hours. This means that a worker\u2019s basic labor income is not confounded by extra working hours which is observed separately as income arising from bonuses. In line with Chinese labor law, we assume a 40 hours working week for each full-time worker. Note that this aggregation rule is consistent with Article 36 of the labor code establishing that \u201dThe State shall practise a working hour system wherein labourers shall work for no more than eight hours a day and no more than 44 hours a week on average\u201d. 17 To check whether the assumption of a 40 hour work week (or 160 hours per month) is innocuous for 14 The second measure corresponds to the violation index from the minimum wage literature, see Foster et al. (1984) and Bhorat et al. (2013) 15 The province is the highest administrative division in China, followed by cities and counties. There are 34 provinces in the Chinese administrative subdivision as of April 2015, 333 prefecture-level cities and a total of 2,862 county-level divisions in China. 16 For their uncertain treatment and control group status, and as described in Appendix B, we ignore self-employed individuals; retired household members; retired and then re-employed household members, incapacitated persons, home- workers, soldiers, social volunteers, students and other household members undergoing training. 17 Details on Chinese Labor Law can be consulted at: Labour Law of the People\u2019s Republic of China ECB Working Paper Series No 2333 / December 2019 11 ",
        "our inference, we compare in Table I the reported monthly hours worked by full-time workers (available for a subset of workers in the period 2002-2006) to the benchmark number of 160 monthly hours for both counties with and without a minimum wage hike. The reported average monthly working hours tend to be slightly above 160 working hours for the sample of full-time workers as shown in Panels A for all households and in Panel B for minimum wage household with S > 0. Generally, there is no statistically significant difference in hours worked across treated and non treated counties. Only the year 2002 records a statistical weak difference in the labor supply among minimum wage households between counties with and without a minimum wage increase. Table I, Panel C, reports the evolution of the minimum wage bite (i.e., the ratio of the Chinese minimum wage relative to the county median income) in our sample. Chinese minimum wages are generally set at a very low level relative to the median wage. The average ratio of the minimum wage relative to the median wage fluctuates around 20% in the period 2002-2006 and then declines to 17.6% in 2009. The minimum wage bite never approaches the much higher levels observed in most developed countries, where the minimum wage bite ranges from around 30% in the U.S. to 60% in France and Sweden, Dickens (2015). Therefore, the labor income conditions of minimum wage workers in China are much worse in relative terms compared to minimum wage workers in high income economies. In absolute terms, the Chinese real minimum wage income is close to the international poverty line (see Section 3.2). It follows that any policy measure that increases the consumption level of these extremely poor households represents a reduction of extreme poverty. At the same time, the low bite of the minimum wage suggests that adverse labor demand effects might not be a very salient concern. Section 7 explores the impact of the minimum wage on employment in more detail. For the benefit of our inference, minimum wages in China are set at county level with extensive geographical and intertemporal variation. Our empirical analysis focuses on the years 2002-2009 for which the UHS data is available as a stratified panel and can be matched with county-level minimum wage data. During this period, 79.5% of all county-year events increased their minimum wage in a given year, which translates into a total of 13,874 minimum wage increases. Figure II presents a diagram with the annual share of counties that change the nominal minimum wage in the range of 0-10% or 10-20% or more than 20%. During the period almost one quarter of China\u2019s 2,183 counties in the sample raises the nominal minimum wage by more than 20%. While none of the counties featured a decrease in the nominal wage, inflation combined with a constant minimum wage can decrease the real wage if the nominal wage stays constant. From 2002 to 2009, an average of 20.5% (3590) county- year events show a constant nominal minimum wage\u2014implying a worsening of purchasing power for a worker employed at the minimum wage. Yet, most county authorities appear attentive to the erosion ECB Working Paper Series No 2333 / December 2019 12 ",
        "of the minimum wage by inflation and tend to adjust the minimum wage by more than the rise in consumer prices: of the 13,874 county-year events with a minimum wage increase, only 1,235 had minimum wage increases below the inflation rate in the county. In real terms, approximately half of county-year observation feature a real minimum wage change in the range 0-10%, one-third in the range 10-20%, and only a tenth above 20%. 4 Research Design We design a difference-in-difference specification which compares household consumption across coun- ties subject to minimum wage hikes (treatment group) and not (control group). The household sample is segmented into groups according to their share S of total income received from minimum wage labor as defined in Equation 1. Households without any minimum wage related income ( S = 0) represent a placebo or control group relative to those household with S > 0 . 5 ( S > 0 . 75) which earn more than 50% (75%) of their total income from minimum wages. The absence of consumption effects for the control group would confirm that consumption and minimum wages do not share any spurious relationship conditional on a set of control variables. A structural approach relates household consumption to household income by using the minimum wage change as an instrument to explain variation in household income. The advantage of the 2SLS approach, besides its greater robustness to measurement error and omitted variable bias, is that it accounts explicitly for the channel through which minimum wages affect consumption. In order for the 2SLS to have a clear causal interpretation, two assumptions need to be satisfied. Firstly, the instrument should be correlated with the instrumented variable. China\u2019s frequent and large minimum wage changes guarantees that the explanatory power of the first-stage regression is sufficient as shown in Section 5.1. Second, the minimum wage change needs to be uncorrelated with other determinants of the dependent variable, see Angrist and Pischke (2008). A particular concern is that minimum wage hikes may result from good economic performance in a county which simultaneously influences low- wage consumption. Appendix A shows that minimum wage changes are not predicted by standard county-level macroeconomic determinants. Tables A-I, A-II and A-III confirm for a wide range of regression specifications that minimum wage hikes are not predicted by standard county-level socio- economic or political determinants. This also implies households cannot easily predict whether in a particular year the minimum wage changes in their county or not. Formally, we explains household labor income in a first-stage regression: Income h,c,t = \u03b1 + \u03b2 FS MW c,t + X m,h,t \u039b + X h,t \u0398 + X city,t \u039e + \u03c6 c \u00b7 t + \u03b7 h + \u03b4 p,t + \u03b5 h,c,t , (2) ECB Working Paper Series No 2333 / December 2019 13 ",
        "where Income h,c,t is household labor income for household h in county c in year t . The second stage relates the predicted income (cid:92) Income h,c,t induced by minimum wage variation to household consumption, therefore C h,c,t = \u03b1 + \u03b2 2 SLS (cid:92) Income h,c,t + X m,h,t \u039b + X h,t \u0398 + X city,t \u039e + \u03c6 c \u00b7 t + \u03b7 h + \u03b4 p,t + \u03b5 h,c,t . (3) The household survey data provide a rich set of demographic and socio-economic characteristics ( X m,h,t ) for the two main labor income earners ( m = 1 , 2) in the households. For the purpose of the analysis, we use as controls their age and age squared, gender, years of work experience, and work experience squared, years since migration to the city and its squared value. Additional categorical covariates include marital status, level of education, occupation and industry of occupation. The observed household characteristics ( X h,t ) include household size measured by the number of household members, and a house ownership dummy. One of the advantages of China\u2019s urban household survey is that we observe directly transfer income to households and its sub-components. We exploit this data richness to identify the consumption response to minimum wage changes by controlling for transfer income and studying interrelations between the two. In addition to transfer income, we also observe and control for household net operating income from business, household income from lending activity and income from property. At the city-level, we dispose of a variety of macroeconomic variables that we use as controls in some specifications ( X city,t ): population size, city real GDP, city real average wage and city unemployment rate. These variables are not available at the more granular county-level. To overcome this restriction, we allow for different growth trends at the county-level by including the interaction of a county dummy and a time trend \u03c6 c \u00b7 t in the regression. The inclusion of county-level time trends is important also to control for diverging county level consumption trends in a difference-in-difference setting. Unless we allow for such heterogeneous consumption trend growth, the real minimum wage level MW c,t becomes the only county-level regressor, and could subsume county-level heterogeneity and bias the inference. Our specification also includes household fixed effects \u03b7 h and province-year fixed effects \u03b4 p,t to control for macroeconomic time-variant factors. All monetary variables, including the minimum wage, are defined in real terms using the province-level consumer price index as the deflator. Before proceeding with the exposition of main results of the paper, it is straightforward to illustrate this specification issue by comparing first-stage income regressions with and without county-level time trends and province-year fixed effects; the results are shown in the Appendix C. In the standard two-way specification with only time fixed effects, but without county time trends and interacted province-year fixed effects, the regression coefficient in Equation 2 of the real minimum wage is highly ECB Working Paper Series No 2333 / December 2019 14 ",
        "significant even for the placebo household group not earning any minimum wage income ( S = 0), see Table C-I, Column (1). By contrast, after including county trends and province-year fixed effects in Columns (5)-(8), which capture unobserved heterogeneity across counties and provinces, any spurious consumption response of high income households is eliminated. Hence, we include both linear county trends and province-time fixed effects in all of our consecutive specifications. 5 Main Results 5.1 First-Stage Income Regressions Table II presents first-stage regression estimates for different definitions of household income. We distinguish among labor income in Columns (1)-(3), transfer income in Columns (4)-(6), and the sum of labor and transfer income in Columns (7)-(9) as the dependent variables. Households are grouped into those that receive at least 25% ( S > 0 . 25), at least 50% ( S > 0 . 5), or at least 75% ( S > 0 . 75) of their total income from minimum wages, respectively. All specifications include county trends and province-year fixed effects to account for unobserved heterogeneity. Standard errors are clustered at the county level, i.e. the level of the policy change. 18 Columns (1)-(3) documents the positive effect of minimum wages on labor income for households with significant minimum wage dependency, i.e. S > 0 . 5 and S > 0 . 75; but not for households earning higher wages than the minimum wage ( S > 0). The coefficient of 1 . 529 in Column (3) suggests a labor income response larger than one for minimum wage dependent households. However, we have to highlight the frequent presence of multiple minimum wage earners in the same household as shown in Figure I. For a standard error of 0 . 692, this implies statistical significance at the conventional 5% level. 19 As the UHS collects wage information at the worker level, we also run the labor income regression at the individual worker level (conditional on employment status) rather than at the household level. The results reported in Table F-I of the Appendix are quantitatively very similar. For the S > 0 . 75 group, Table F-I, Column (8), reports an estimate of 0.645 for individual household members. This corresponds to the point estimate of 1.529 in Table II, Column (3), for the household income, where we note that for the S > 0 . 75 household we have an average of 3.35 family members (see Appendix Table B-II) and 84.4% of them are minimum wage workers. 18 All our estimates are robust to two-way clustered standard errors at county and city-year level and two-way clustered standard errors at county and province-year level, see Appendix H. 19 Note further that a single instrument 2SLS is median-unbiased and hence less prone to weak instrument critique, Angrist and Pischke (2008). A more formal test of the validity and relevance of first stage instruments is from Kleibergen and Paap (2006) and is provided in the 2SLS regressions in Table IV ECB Working Paper Series No 2333 / December 2019 15 ",
        "Minimum wage increases can crowd-out transfer income if the latter is subject to eligibility re- quirements that depend on the labor income, as shown by Dube (2017) for U.S. households. The literature on Chinese social policies suggest a very different relationship due to the particular nature of the policy process, Leung (2006), Hao et al. (2009), Meng (2012) and Qu and Zhao (2017). Political decisions on minimum wage increases and on the upward revision of social transfer payments (i.e. income relief programs, unemployment benefits, minimum living standard subsidies etc.) are often taken jointly as part of a more comprehensive social security policy, Qu and Zhao (2017). This im- plies that minimum wage increases generally coincide with more generous social transfer payments. 20 The complementarity of labor and transfer income shocks helps us in better identifying the combined household consumption response. Table II, Columns (4)-(6), document the positive relationship between county minimum wages and the household transfer income. 21 A positive coefficient of 0 . 984 in Column (6) for households with more than 75% of their disposable income stemming from minimum wages implies that each additional RMB in annual minimum wages comes with an equally large social transfers to this group of households. It follows that the total household income effect of minimum wages is roughly 2.25 times the increase in the annual minimum wage for households with S > 0 . 75. For a county clustered standard error of 0 . 823, the t-statistic approaches the value of 3 and the F-statistics is close to 10. This further implies that we dispose of a better instrument if we focus on the sum of labor and transfer incomes. Accordingly, the consumption response is more precisely estimated as shown for the respective 2SLS estimates in Section 5.3. Again, we see that there is no corresponding overall income effect for households without minimum wage income as shown in Column (7). The increasing generosity of social transfers benefits almost exclusively minimum wage earning households residing in counties with a minimum wage change. Table B-IV of the Appendix shows that S > 0 . 75 households also face a relatively high risk of unemployment of 19% among the two best earners in the household. Accordingly, improved basic income assistance and unemployment benefits tend to improve the income of those households significantly. 5.2 Reduced Form Regressions In this section we present the reduced form estimates for the relationship between the real minimum wage and consumption. The reduced form estimates are not associated with any particular channel of 20 In our sample this simultaneous increase translates in higher levels of social transfers is 23.5% (i.e. RMB 690) higher for S > 0 . 5 households living in minimum wage treated counties with respect to the same category of households living in counties where minimum wage was not increased. This corresponds to 4.3% of overall disposable income of the households in the control group. 21 Transfers are measured net of pension or retirement benefits, but include social assistance income, dismissal com- pensation, income insurance, income from donations and other transfer income. ECB Working Paper Series No 2333 / December 2019 16 ",
        "transmission - unlike the 2SLS estimates discussed in the next section, which capture only consumption changes responding to variation of household labor income induced by a hike of the county minimum wage. Comparing the respective magnitudes is insightful and a check on the conjectured transmission channel. The reduced form regression for household consumption takes on the following form: C h,c,t = \u03b1 + \u03b2 RF MW c,t + X m,h,t \u039b + X h,t \u0398 + X city,t \u039e + \u03c6 c \u00b7 t + \u03b7 h + \u03b4 p,t + \u03b5 h,c,t , (4) where the controls X m,h,t , X h,t , and X city,t represent the household member, household, and city-level characteristics discussed in Section 4. We also includes county-specific time trends \u03c6 c \u00b7 t , household fixed effects \u03b7 h , and interacted province-time fixed effects \u03b4 p,t . Table III presents the results with two different variations. First, Columns (1)-(4) use a spec- ification adopted in the minimum wage literature which controls for all non-labor income sources, used for example in Aaronson et al. (2012), Allegretto et al. (2011) and Neumark et al. (2014a). Second, Columns (5)-(8) exclude transfer income from the list of covariates and therefore allow the effect of transfer income on consumption to be captured by the minimum wage change itself. Here the estimated coefficient is inflated since the minimum wage estimate captures the additional effect of (correlated) net transfers. Again, the point estimates in Columns (5)-(8) increase noticeably only for households with S > 0 . 5 because net transfers significantly contribute to income and consumption only for higher minimum wage dependent households in treated counties. This is consistent with the descriptive statistics shown in Table B-I of the Appendix B: for highly minimum wage depen- dent households, the relative incidence of net transfers on consumption is substantial given that net transfers (net of pensions) constitute around 20% (8%) of household disposable income Both specifications of Table III show higher real minimum wage effects on household consumption as we consider a higher minimum wage share S of household income. For the households most dependent on minimum wage income ( S > 0 . 75), if we control separately for transfer income in Column (4) the coefficient of interest becomes 1 . 91 (with a standard error of 0.91); the point estimate increases to 2 . 32 (with a standard error of 1.02) in Column (8) if we allow minimum wages to simultaneously capture transfer income and its consumption effect. Forming sub-samples conditional on the initial minimum wage dependence of household implies that fixed effect and controls are fitted relative to each sub-sample. Alternatively, we can preserve the sample size interacting the minimum wage with dummy variables for each specific household group. Table G-I in Appendix G, reports estimates based on group-specific interaction terms. The specification controls for transfer income similar to Table III, Columns (1)-(4). The point estimates ECB Working Paper Series No 2333 / December 2019 17 ",
        "on the interaction terms are qualitatively similar to the estimates in Table III, albeit slightly lower. We note that the point estimate of the reference group with S = 0 tends to be negative in a range of -0.66 to -0.91, but is statistically insignificant because of its large standard error. This suggests that the consumption effect for the reference group S = 0, i.e. households without minimum wage income, is not precisely estimated; which is not surprising in the absence of any systematic income effect arising from minimum wage changes. We do not report the pooled specification with interaction terms throughout the paper because of three reasons. First, using sub-samples of household is rather intuitive and simpler to present than a table with many interaction terms. Second, the control variables and fixed effects in sub- sample regressions are estimated specifically for that sub-sample rather than the entire household sample, which is useful under heterogeneity of the respective effects. Third, the point estimate for the minimum wage effect in group S = 0 is very imprecise because the null hypothesis that there is no minimum wage effect in high income households is presumably correct. However, interaction terms estimate marginal economic effect relative to this (imprecisely estimated) reference value, which influences the estimate of the marginal effects for household groups with S > 0. 5.3 Two-Stage Least Square Estimates The 2SLS estimator uses the variation in household labor income induced by the minimum wage to infer the marginal propensity to consume. As in the previous sections, we operate with different definitions of household minimum wage dependency. Note that in the 2SLS specifications we measure both labor income and consumption at the household level and no adjustment or scaling for the number of household members is needed. Table IV presents the 2SLS estimates of household consumption as a function of real labor income in Columns (1)-(4) and as a function of the sum of labor and transfer income in Columns (5)-(8). Standard errors are clustered at the county level. The Appendix H reports additional results for two-way clustered at county and city-year level and two-way clustered at county and province-year level in Table H-I. 22 We note that the marginal propensity to consume is more precisely estimated as the minimum wage share S increases, this is a consequence of the improved quality of the instrument as S increases. For households earning more than 75% of their disposable income from minimum wages a RMB 1000 rise in income increases consumption by RMB 1301 as shown in Column (4). Estimating the consumption response as a function of the sum of labor and transfer incomes in Columns (7) and (8) yields marginal propensities of consumption closer to unity and considerably smaller standard errors. For minimum 22 All estimates presented in the paper are robust to alternative clustering and results are available from the authors. ECB Working Paper Series No 2333 / December 2019 18 ",
        "wage dependent households with S > 0 . 75 in Column (8), the point estimate is 1 . 065 with a robust standard error of 0 . 409. The lower standard errors in Columns (5)-(8) result from higher explanatory power of the minimum wage instrument if we use a more comprehensive definition of income which includes social transfers. In both sets of specifications, we reject the null hypothesis of irrelevant or weak instrument using the Kleibergen and Paap (2006) test for households earning more than half of their disposable income from minimum wage labor. Moreover, p-values of the weak instrument test are generally lower in Columns (5)-(8) of Table IV when the minimum wage instrument is used to fit labor and transfer income simultaneously. This confirms that the minimum wage is a stronger instrument when both labor and transfer income are fitted in the first stage. Because the minimum wage is a very weak instrument for households with S < 0 . 5, we need to interpret coefficient estimates in Columns (1)- (2) and (5)-(6) with great caution. For these households, minimum wages represent a zero or small proportion of disposable income, and no economically significant consumption effects is expected. It is also instructive to compare the 2SLS estimates of the marginal propensity of consumption to minimum wage with the corresponding OLS estimates of the marginal propensity of consumption from labor income. The OLS estimates reported in Table D-I in the Appendix D show considerably smaller correlations between labor income and consumption: they fall within a range between 0 . 33 and 0 . 44. What can explain this large difference between the 2SLS and OLS estimates? First, labor income changes that do not originate from minimum wage variation could be more transitory and therefore subject to more consumption smoothing. Second, reporting and measurement errors with respect to household income itself can attenuate the OLS estimate. At the same time, such measurement errors are likely to be orthogonal to the minimum wage variation, making the 2SLS estimate asymptotically consistent. Overall, we infer from the 2SLS estimates that minimum wage dependent households in China fully spend the labor and transfer income changes related to exogenous minimum wage increase. Since the minimum wage income increases show unanticipated and persistent behavior (see Table A-II and Appendix A), we can also interpret these results as consistent with the permanent income hypothesis, Jappelli and Pistaferri (2010). 5.4 Health and Education, Non-Durable and Durable Expenditures An extensive economic literature has documented a positive relationship between health and educa- tion on the one hand and productivity and long-run income on the other, Mincer (1958), Bloom and Canning (2000). The household survey data allow us to examine these consumption items separately ECB Working Paper Series No 2333 / December 2019 19 ",
        "and document their relationship to the minimum wage level. From a public policy perspective, higher consumption of both health and educational expenditure of low-wage households in China is particu- larly desirable given the relative weakness of China\u2019s public health system and often costly access to quality education as documented for instance by Chamon and Prasad (2010). As shown by Attanasio et al. (2007) and Blundell et al. (2008), education and health expendi- tures are characterize by a more durable nature and their positive feedback effect on future income assimilates them to investment and saving activities. Decomposing health and education expendi- tures into durable and non-durable items is not a straight forward exercise. In principle, both types of expenditure have the vocation of improving long-run utility, but may also fall short of achieving this goal. For simplicity, we retain health and education as a separate expenditure item and examine its relationship with minimum wage changes in Table V, Columns (1)-(3), along with non-durables in Columns (4)-(6), and (other) durables in Columns (7)-(9). The Appendix E provides a still more granular analysis at the level of each reporting items. For households with the highest minimum wage dependence ( S > 0 . 75), we find that a RMB 1,000 higher annual minimum wage is associated with a higher health and education expenditure of RMB 313, suggesting that more than 30% of any minimum wage increase is spent either on health or education. The standard error is only 0.159 and the point estimate is statistically significant at the 5% level. Interestingly, the 30% expenditure share for a marginal minimum wage income hike is twice as large as the 15% average expenditure share of health and educational spending combined, see Table B-I in Appendix B. Moreover, as shown in a more detailed breakdown in Appendix E, the majority of the expenditures in these two categories stems from drugs and medicines (44.4% of the overall health and education increase), see Table E-I. Educational courses, computer and software expenditures, books and textbooks also show relatively large coefficients albeit not always significant in Table E-II. In Table V, Columns (4)-(6), we report the consumption propensity estimates for the aggregated non-durables category. Minimum wage dependent households with S > 0 . 5 ( S > 0 . 75) spend 0.41% (0.34%) of their marginal minimum wage income on non-durables; both estimates are statistically significant at the 5% level. Appendix Table E-III documents a still more detailed breakdown for non- durables. For example, the consumption propensity for food is only 0.32% (0.26%). This makes the food consumption propensity a relatively a poor proxy for the overall marginal propensity to consume. The marginal propensities to consume durable goods reported in Table V, Columns (8)-(9), are at 0 . 32% (0 . 34%) similar to those for non-durables among household with S > 0 . 5 ( S > 0 . 75), but feature a higher standard error indicating greater (idiosyncratic) variation across households. Interestingly, ECB Working Paper Series No 2333 / December 2019 20 ",
        "approximately 10% of the minimum wage increase is spent on television sets as revealed in Appendix Table E-IV. The evidence on durables expenditure contrasts the finding for the U.S., where Aaronson et al. (2012) estimate that low-wage households spend almost the entire marginal minimum wage increase on durables and incur debt to finance vehicle purchases. Our evidence on the high consumption propensities of Chinese household for health and education expenditure is consistent with work by Chamon and Prasad (2010) which relates costly education and poor public health provisioning with the high saving rates of Chinese households. Both are indicative of a strong inter-generational bequest motive and an appreciation of human capital. Educational spending is regarded as an investment into a higher future household income by the next generation. In the context of the one-child-policy, parental aspirations typically focus on a single child and educational investment in this child also serves as a retirement insurance for parents, see Cai et al. (2006). 6 Household Heterogeneity 6.1 Liquidity Constraints The large consumption effects of incremental disposable income documented in Section 5 could be the result of borrowing constraints, Zeldes (1989), Jappelli and Pistaferri (2010). In a high income growth environment like China, households may expect a life-time income which justifies a desired consumption level larger than current disposable income. A higher minimum wage alleviates these expenditure constraints and this may explain the high consumption propensity. Indeed, minimum wage households could be liquidity constrained due to their low proceeds from labor and a lack of collateral to pledge against a loan. It is therefore possible that the findings in the previous section are driven by the inability to smooth consumption over time. If financial constraints contribute to higher consumption propensities, we expect financially uncon- strained households to feature lower consumption propensities of minimum wage income. We identify three variables as proxies for financially unconstrained households. First, we define a dummy indicat- ing that the household has property income. Property serves as collateral in credit relationships and may be used to guarantee a loan. In the sample, roughly 14% of households with S > 0 . 5 dispose of property income and may therefore be less likely to face borrowing constraints. Among households with some income from property, the mean income from property is RMB 2,957 per year, and the median is RMB 630. We define a property dummy as equal to one if household income from property is above the median of RMB 630 per year and zero otherwise. Second, we identify households with interest, dividend or insurance income. The respective dummy variable takes on the value one for ECB Working Paper Series No 2333 / December 2019 21 ",
        "7% of all households with S > 0 . 5. Third, we define outright home ownership households as those who own a house and do not have to make mortgage payments. Contrary to non-owners or owners with mortgage debt, outright home owners can pledge their property as collateral to obtain loans and smooth consumption behavior over the life-cycle. Yet, ownership rates are extremely high at 76% even among relatively poor minimum wage households ( S > 0 . 5) but the house value may often be very low so that even outright ownership does not necessarily imply access to credit. Table VI reports how the three proxies for credit access interact with the consumption propensity in the 2SLS setting. When interacted with the property income dummy in Columns (1)-(3), the consumption response to minimum wage changes is generally lower than in the baseline 2SLS coefficient of Table IV. Minimum wage households ( S > 0 . 5 or S > 075) with property income above the median consume roughly 30% less of any minimum wage related income variation compared to households without property income, which represents both an economically and statistically significant difference. The two other proxies for the absence of financial constraints also produce evidence for a more moderate consumption response, although the measured differential effects are more modest. Ownership of financial assets in Columns (6) shows a 11% lower consumption response and so does outright home ownership in examined in Columns (9) for the most minimum wage dependent households S > 0 . 75. But statistical significance is weak in both cases. Overall, we find some empirical support for the hypothesis that liquidity constraints contribute to the high consumption propensities found in Section 5. But marginal propensity to consume out of a higher minimum wage remains large even among less liquidity constrained households. 6.2 Household Structure The large household propensity to spend a higher minimum wage income on education suggests that household structure matters for the consumption behavior. The one-child policy implies a predomi- nance of single child households: the majority of households in the UHS sample have one child (77%), households with two children represent 14.5%, childless households are 6.5%, and only 2% of household have more than two children. 23 China\u2019s one-child policy is often blamed for an unbalanced gender ratio between girls and boys because abortions are practiced more frequently if the fetus is female. Some authors claim that this gender imbalance has consequences for the marriage market in which competition for brides requires young unmarried men to demonstrate wealth and real estate ownership. The marriage motive predicts 23 Besides simple non-compliance, a series of exceptions to the one-child policy can be highlighted and are documented for China. For instance a time distance of four to six years between two births may provide a justification for two children, rural families can have two children if the first baby is a girl, and further exemptions exist based on ethnic and economic considerations, Gu et al. (2007). ECB Working Paper Series No 2333 / December 2019 22 ",
        "higher savings rates among households with a male child and in particular with a male child of adult age, Wei and Zhang (2011), Rosenzweig and Zhang (2014). Alternatively, male children could also motivate larger educational expenditure with a negative effect on household savings. Table VII reports the marginal propensity to consume when the fitted labor and transfer income is interacted with a dummy for households with children, in Column (1)-(3); with a dummy for a male child in Columns (4)-(6); and with a dummy identifying households with an adult male child of at least 24 years of age in Columns (7)-(9) . Childless families with a high minimum wage dependency ( S > 0 . 75) show a low point estimate of only 35% for the marginal propensity to consume in Column (3), Row (1). Only the interaction term ( Labor and transfer income \u00d7 children dummy ) in Row (2) captures a large 80% incremental propensity of consumption for households with children. This means that the high consumption propensity of Chinese households for minimum wage increases is contingent on children in the household. 24 Furthermore, the male gender of the child relates to a slightly larger - although statistically insignificant - effect on household consumption. The same finding applies to male children above the age of 24 when a boy\u2019s education is usually terminated and a specific male bequest motive should be detectable in the data. But the positive interaction terms in Columns (8)-(9), Row (4), do not support such a gender specific bequest motive related to marriage\u2014at least among relatively poor minimum wage household. 25 Our identification strategy does not allow us to generalize these finding to non minimum wage dependent households for which minimum wages do not matter. As aggregate saving rates depend mostly on the saving behavior of middle and high income families, we need to be careful not to extrapolate the findings for low-wage families to the Chinese aggregate macroeconomic saving behavior as a whole. 7 Minimum Wages and Employment The UHS collects consumption information only at the household level. However, hours worked by household members, their employment status, occupation, and industry of employment is reported at the individual level. We exploit this more granular data structure to estimate the impact of minimum wages on the intensive margin of employment in Section 6.1 and on worker\u2019s employment status in Section 6.2. 24 Replacing the generic dummy for children in the household with a more specific one-child dummy shows similar results. Moreover, we also compare the one-child households with households of multiple children; yet we do not find significantly different consumption responses across these two household groups. 25 Other dimensions of household heterogeneity do not yield economically or statistically significant difference either: for example interaction terms marking urban immigrant households, household with one or two members working for a state-owned enterprise (SOE), households with above median debt, female headed households or measures for the educational level of the head of the household. ECB Working Paper Series No 2333 / December 2019 23 ",
        "7.1 Hours Worked by Household Members Higher minimum wages can affect the intensive margin labor demand and supply at the worker level multiple ways: employers may demand more or less hours from their employees or workers may wish to switch from full-time to part-time employment or vice versa. In order to estimate the impact of the minimum wage on labor supply we regress the monthly hours worked on the natural logarithm of the minimum wage using a linear model similar to Equation 4. As before, we retain in the sample both employed and unemployed individuals since labor supply may be affected by minimum wage induced employment loss. Switching in and out of employment is a case of (extreme) variation in hours worked. Table VIII reports the estimates for the full sample of employed and unemployed individuals. Columns (1)-(4) consider only the two best earners in each household, while Columns (5)-(8) provide estimates for the labor supply of all household members. We find no evidence for any statistically significant adjustment in labor supply around minimum wage hikes. At the same time we observe an economically small decrease in hours worked by workers in minimum wage households. For example, a 10% increase in the minimum wage reduces weekly work by approximately 0.309 (= -12.349 x 0.095/4) hours (or 18.5 minutes) for workers in households with S > 0.5 considered in Column (3). 26 By contrast, households without minimum wage income slightly increase their labor supply albeit the effect is not significant. Income effects related to minimum wage changes or a reduced labor supply may account for the observed pattern between minimum wage and non-minimum wage households. 7.2 Employment Status Loss of employment has plausibly more dramatic welfare consequences for households than any (mod- est) labor supply adjustment at the intensive margin. While the average income and consumption of minimum wage dependent households clearly increases under the Chinese minimum wage policy as shown in the previous sections, concerns about households suffering unemployment spells are never- theless pertinent. 27 Table IX reports regressions for which the dependent variable is an employment dummy equal to one for employed household members, whereas a zero dummy value identifies workers within the labor force declaring to be unemployed at the time of the survey. A zero dummy value marks all 26 From the linear-log model transformation: \u2212 12 . 349 \u00d7 log (110 / 100) = \u2212 12 . 349 \u00d7 . 095 = \u2212 1 . 17 per month. In order to put this estimate further into Chinese labor market perspective it should be recalled that the average annual increase of real minimum wages is approximately 7.35% (see Table I). 27 Previous research on China has related higher minimum wages to more instances of lay-off based on firm survey data, Huang et al. (2014). But unlike our household survey data, firm based surveys do not track individual workers and therefore cannot address the questions if workers just switched employers or suffer from a prolonged unemployment spells. Welfare implications are very different in the two cases. ECB Working Paper Series No 2333 / December 2019 24 ",
        "adult household members who do not earn any income, but excludes those in training (for example university students) and homeworkers. The independent variable is the logarithm of a county\u2019s real minimum wage. Column (1) considers members from households not depending on minimum wage income (placebo group), while Columns (2)-(4) focus on members living in households with various degrees of minimum wage dependency. Columns (5)-(8) focus on the population of migrant workers. The latter groups can be described as more vulnerable, and exposed to minimum wage increases, Orrenius and Zavodny (2008). All specifications include worker and province-year fixed effects and we add additional county-level trends and city-level macroeconomic controls. Column (1) shows a statistically and economically weak positive relationship between the mini- mum wage level and employment for households not earning a minimum wage. However, the economic magnitude is modest: for a 10% increase in minimum wages employment increases by 0 . 25 percentage points. 28 Columns (2)-(4) show increasingly negative point estimates for the real minimum wage for more minimum wage dependent households. Households with the highest minimum wage dependency in Column (4) feature a coefficient of -0.016: a 10% real minimum wage hike decreases the likelihood of employment by only 0.15 percentage points. The coefficient is economically and statistically in- significant. The standard error on the coefficient is nevertheless precisely estimated at 0.037, which implies that we can exclude large adverse effects of minimum wages on the unemployment risk of a worker. The employment regressions for migrant workers in Columns (5)-(8) yield a more negative point estimate for the minimum wage variable\u2014albeit still statistically insignificant. For minimum wage dependent migrant households with S > 0 . 75 in Column (8), a 10% larger minimum wage hike increases the risk of unemployment by 0 . 26 percentage points. However, we still cannot reject the null hypothesis that the total unemployment effect is zero. 29 One interpretation of these findings is that the level of minimum wages in China, set at around 20% of the median wage, is low by international standards and has little bite. The low bite of the minimum wage coupled with the evidence on the absence of unemployment effects suggests that the minimum wage level in China does generally not exceed the marginal productivity even of the least qualified workers. The absence of unemployment effects may also reinforce the propensity to consume since precautionary savings motive due to unemployment risk are less salient. 28 In the linear-log model this is obtained by multiplying the coefficient with the log(1.1), i.e. 0.027 \u00d7 log(1.1) \u00d7 100. 29 We note that binary dependent variable models are problematic in our application because of a large number of fixed effects applied. Their goodness of fit (with either county or household-level fixed effects) is considerably lower while the point estimates have similar magnitudes. We also experiment with county-level aggregate regressions using sample based unemployment rates and obtain a point estimate of \u2212 0 . 064 with a standard error of 0 . 087 for the household group with S > 0 . 75. We also test for statistically significant unemployment effects in a younger population of teenagers, namely teenagers with age greater than fifteen but lower than twenty, or alternatively up to twenty-four years of age. All those regression do not yield negative employment effect significant at conventional confidence levels of 5%. ECB Working Paper Series No 2333 / December 2019 25 ",
        "8 Robustness 8.1 Policy Anticipation Anticipation of minimum wage changes or a delayed household response can compromise the quality our inference. In China, the secretive nature of policy process that determines minimum wage changes leaves limited scope for the anticipation of such measures. Implementation follows the announcement with a very short time lag of generally less than three months. Notwithstanding this favorable institutional setting, we also propose a statistical test of the research design. In particular, we nest the household consumption response in a more general specification, which allows for asynchronous consumption effects in a two year window around the implementation of the minimum wage change. Formally, we estimate the augmented reduced form C h,c,t = \u03b1 + +2 (cid:88) k = \u2212 2 \u03b2 RF k MW c,t + k + X m,h,t \u039b + X h,t \u0398 + X city,t \u039e + \u03c6 c \u00b7 t + \u03b7 h + \u03b4 p,t + \u03b5 h,c,t , (5) where the parameter of interest \u03b2 RF k takes on different time subscripts to capture a persistent or anticipated consumption response relative to the date of minimum wage changes. Time lags of k = \u2212 1 , \u2212 2 years or time leads of k = +1 , +2 years correspond to a placebo events for which we expect \u03b2 RF k = 0 for k (cid:54) = 0. The lead coefficients are robustness tests for the parallel trend assumption and should show a zero consumption response. The lag terms estimate persistent effects on consumption. By including county linear time trends in the regression, \u03c6 c \u00b7 t , our specification accommodates different consumption growth trends across households in different counties. Table X reports the augmented reduced form specification by household group. The consump- tion response to the contemporaneous minimum wage is positive and statistically significant for all minimum wage dependent households (i.e. S > 0 . 25 , S > 0 . 5 , S > 0 . 75). Its stronger consumption response for more minimum wage dependent households is quantitatively similar to the reduced form results in Section 5.2, Table III, Columns (1)-(4). By contrast, the first lag and lead of the minimum wage have a negative sign and are statistically insignificant; nor do the second lag or lead matter from a statistical point of view. Generally, we find no evidence for that minimum wage hikes are anticipated or that household adjust their consumption level with delays. Only the first lag for the household category S > 0 . 5 shows a marginally significant negative effect - suggestive of a (partial) reversal of the previous year consumption spike. However, this is not robust across different categories of S. ECB Working Paper Series No 2333 / December 2019 26 ",
        "8.2 Sampling Issues The Chinese national Bureau of Statistics conducts the UHS based on a multi-stage probabilistic sample with a stratified design. Generally, a third of all household in the sample are replace by randomly selected households. 30 Household know that they are supposed to participate for three consecutive years, but may fail to comply with the reporting requirements. Such early attrition from the sample can bias the estimation if non-participation is related to the policy shocks. For example, workers might more often cease to participate in the survey if they are better off after a minimum wage increase. To examine such concerns, we define a dummy variable for attrition, i.e. early sample exit, if a worker is sampled for only one or two years. As our panel starts in 2002 and terminates in 2009, we cannot establish three-year participation for household that exit in 2002 or 2003, and therefore drop those households. The same applies for new vintages of household entering the UHS in the 2008 and 2009. The resulting subsample then allows us to mark all households characterized by early sample exit. Table XI relates the attrition dummy (as dependent variable) to the natural logarithm of the minimum wage using the previous control variables. We find not evidence that the attrition characteristics correlates with the minimum wage level. This finding is confirmed for all groups of minimum wage dependency, and holds in both the sample of household composed only by the best two earners in Columns (1)-(4) and the full sample of household members in Columns (5)-(8). 9 Conclusions This study provides evidence on the income effect and consumption response of Chinese households to the large cross-sectional and intertemporal variation of China\u2019s minimum wage. For the period 2002- 2009, we identify more than 13,874 minimum wage changes across China\u2019s 2,183 counties, and match them to the urban household survey (UHS) which covers 73,164 urban household-year observations. Our analysis shows that higher household incomes due to a minimum wage hike are fully spent by minimum wage dependent households. The magnitude of the estimates is consistent with the estimates in the literature on income shocks in developing countries, see Wolpin (1982) and Paxson (1992). We also highlight a number of new insights. We find that the propensity to consume is largest in households with two minimum wage earners and the effect is driven by households with children, whereas households without children feature higher saving rates. Our study also finds that more than 30 As pointed out by Feng et al. (2017) and Ding and He (2018), the triannual rotation design has not always been strictly maintained resulting in a lower rotation ratio than was originally planned. For instance, some provinces have delayed replacing the first-stage sample at the end of the three-year period for funding reasons. ECB Working Paper Series No 2333 / December 2019 27 ",
        "30% of additional minimum wage income is invested in health care and educational spending with potential long-term benefits for household welfare. We test if the high consumption propensity associated with minimum wage hikes is driven by borrowing constraints. In fact, any excess sensitivity of consumption to incremental disposable income could be the result of the inability to smooth consumption over the life cycle. We find some evidence that household owning property feature a lower consumption propensity; although the point estimate remains large at around 0.72% of the minimum wage increase. An important feature of the Chinese policy setting is the simultaneity of minimum wages changes and the revision of other social transfers. Minimum wage increases in China are generally part of a more comprehensive social policy towards low-wage households. Any inference on Chinese household behavior has to account for this to arrive at unbiased estimates for the consumption effects of income shocks. The large consumption propensity is indicative of substantial welfare effects for poor households. We also find not evidence of economically significant dis-employment effects\u2014possibly due to very low levels at which minimum wages are set in China. Our overall assessment of China\u2019s minimum wage policy is unambiguously positive. ECB Working Paper Series No 2333 / December 2019 28 ",

        "A Predicting Minimum Wage Change In this section we show that the timing of minimum wage changes is unpredictable conditional on rich information sets of socio-economic and political data typically beyond the reach of individual households. First, we use county-level socio-economic data to explore the predictability of minimum wage changes. Second, we aggregate the Urban Household Survey (UHS) data and examine whether these alternative county-level aggregates show any predictability for the minimum wage change. Third, we use biographical data on the two most important political decision makers in Chinese counties, namely the mayor and party secretary, to predict minimum wage changes. Throughout this exercise, we code any nominal minimum wage change in a county as a binary (0/1) decision. Nevertheless, all the results are robust if the (level) change of the minimum wage becomes the dependent variable or if we use the natural logarithm of the new to the old minimum wage. 31 A.1 Predictability Based on County-Level Data Table A-I presents OLS regression based on county-level socio-economic data to examine the pre- dictability of minimum wage changes codes as binary outcomes (0/1). The socio-economic data are sourced from the Prefecture Statistical Annual Yearbooks, the Fiscal Statistics for Prefectures, Mu- nicipalities and Counties and the National Demographic Yearbook. We note that these county-level data have an imperfect overlap with the sample of counties in our main data and so we do not use them in the analysis on household consumption. Yet they are still a useful data source for a test of predictability of the minimum wage change. Columns (1)-(3) include the listed covariates as contemporaneous changes and Columns (4)-(6) as lagged changes. All variables are expressed in real terms using a province-level consumer price deflator. We find that none of the county variables robustly predicts (either as contemporaneous or lagged changes) minimum wage across specifications. In Column (3) only the average salary in the county shows weak negative relation with the decision to change the minimum wage. But this marginal significance disappears when we use two-way clustering at the county and province-year levels (not shown). Overall, we conclude that the results indicate no systematic relationship between county-level socio-economic variables and minimum wage changes. A.2 Predictability Based on Aggregates of Household Survey Data Table A-II explores the predictability of minimum wage changes based on county-level aggregates of the Urban Household Survey (UHS) used throughout the paper. The set of counties covered differs from Table A-I and the time span is restricted to the period 2002-2009. The county-level aggregates of the UHS data are complimented by city-level variables drawn from the China City Statistical Yearbooks in the Chinese Statistical Yearbook Database (CNKI). Again, no statistically significant relationship appears between the various covariates and the minimum wage change. The results also hold if we consider level change in minimum wages as an alternative dependent variable. A.3 Predictability Based on Biographical Data of Local Political Leaders In democratic societies, important political decisions like minimum wage changes are subject to open political debate and depend on the parliamentary strength of competing political parties.

        "politics represents an entirely different political setting, important policy issues can be contingent on the preferences of the key local decision makers, Yao and Zhang (2015). Minimum wage changes in China originate in an administrative and political process that is not subject to an open debate that involves the public at large. This implies that little public information is generated that would allow households to anticipate minimum wage changes. Moreover, the law only stipulates the requirement of regular review, not a mandatory change. While individual policy preferences are hard to observe, such preferences and policy outcomes could nevertheless be related to personal political career paths and curricula or to demographic characteristics of local leaders. The two main political actors in Chinese local politics are the mayor, appointed by the city communist party assembly, and the city party secretary, appointed by personal office of the central party administration. Their biographical data are available in the Chinese Bureaucracies and Lead- ers Database, which is constructed and maintained by the National Chengchi University. 32 We use biographical information about their respective tenure, their first year in office, the their year of pro- motion and retirement, as well as their age and experience. Table A-III presents the regression results with seven biographical variables for the city party secretary and an equal number for the city mayor. Yet none of these biographical variables has any predictive value for minimum wage change. Similar results are obtained if we define the dependent variable as first difference in minimum wage levels. Overall, we conclude from Tables A-I, A-II and A-III that minimum wage changes in China are not predictable based on county-level socio-economic data or even biographical data on the two most powerful city politicians. 32 See http://ics.nccu.edu.tw/chinaleaders/.

        "A.4 Persistence of the Minimum Wage Hike Another issue concerns the intertemporal persistence of real minimum wage changes. Even if nominal minimum wage change are not likely to be reversed, price inflation can induce the mean reversion of the real minimum wage. If, on the other hand, real minimum wages feature a high degree of persistence, then the increase can be perceived as a non transitory income shock by the households. To explore the intertemporal persistence of real minimum wage increases, we run the regression \u2206 MW c,t = \u03b1 0 + \u03c1MW c,t \u2212 1 + a 1 t + \u03b4 p,t + \u03b3 c + \u03b5 c,t , (6) where a coefficient \u03c1 < 0 captures mean reversion to a time trend t of the real minimum wage MW; \u03b4 pt denotes a province-year fixed effect and \u03b3 c a county fixed effect. Table A-IV reports the regression results for the period 1992-2012 and for the shorter sample period 2002-2009 corresponding to the time frame of our analysis. We progressively augment the specification with county fixed effects and county trends to mitigate the impact of cross-sectional dependence. The coefficient of interest \u03c1 is negative in most specifications and statistically significant. Yet, the magnitude of the mean reversion is economically weak. For instance, the coefficient in Column (4) implies a half-life of 5.47 years for the real minimum wage. 33 We also use a unit root test (adapted to panel data) to test for real minimum wage persistence in a narrow statistical sense, Harris and Tzavalis (1999). Under the null hypothesis of a unit root (i.e. the real minimum wage increase is persistent) such tests provide a critical value for \u03c1 below which the unit root cannot be rejected. The H-T test confirms the persistence of the minimum wage when we do not demean the real minimum wage to take into account cross-county dependence. However, when we compute in each time period the mean of the minimum wage across counties and subtract this mean from the series, the test rejects the null. 34 33 Half-life is computed adjusting the standard formula to take into account that we are using the first difference of the minimum wage as dependent variable: ln (0 . 5) /ln ( \u2212 0 . 119 + 1) = 5 . 471. Using the coefficient in Column (8) implies a half-life of 2.31 years. 34 To corroborate these findings, we also undertake the Im et al. (2003) test, which relaxes the assumption about the common autoregressive coefficient and runs the test for each cross-section under the null that all panels have unit roots, against the alternative that some panels are stationary. This test fails to reject the null hypothesis except when we include a time trend and demean the series to reduce the influence of cross-section dependence.

        "B Sample Construction B.1 Household Data Selection China\u2019s Urban Household Survey (UHS) has two components. At the household level, we dispose of data on various consumption items and household income. At the level of household members, additional data captures household member income, income type, employment status, years of edu- cation, years of work experience, etc. We merge the household survey data with the minimum wage data at county and city-level from the Chinese Ministry of Human Resources and add additional macroeconomic variables at the county and city-level. All monetary variables are converted in real terms using the province-level urban CPI index with the base year 2002. The raw data constitutes a panel of 201,795 household-year observations and 773,330 household-member-year cells for the period 2002-2009. The following data filters are applied to the household data: 1. We only retain households that are observed at least twice in the panel (i.e. we drop 68,779 household-year observations). 2. We retain only households reporting in their first year of sampling at least two wage earning household members (i.e. we drop 59,624 household-year observations). Wage-earning household members are those who are potentially affected by minimum wage changes. 3. We eliminate households that provide contradictory information about the household head and for which we cannot compute the share S (228 household-year observations). The final data set comprises 73,164 household-year observations. Descriptive statistics of the main variables and household demographics are shown in Tables B-I and B-II respectively. B.2 Identifying the Two Highest Wage Earners within the Household For minimum wages changes to matter for household income, a household needs to earn a positive share of its total household income from labor income near or at the minimum wage. Within each household, we identify the two highest wage earners conditioning on the first year the individual is observed in the panel. The selection of wage earners within each household follows these principles: 1. We ignore self-employed individuals (30,971 member-year observations); retired household mem- bers (124,901); retired and then re-employed household members (11,396), incapacitated per- sons (8,396), homeworkers (61,343), soldiers, social volunteers or part-time employed workers (17,879), students (56,737) and other household members undergoing training (251). 2. We ignore household members outside the labor force: below 16 years of age (75,317) and above 59 for males (2,566) and above 54 for females (2,363). 3. We ignore household members with inconsistent records where they are reported as unemployed and nevertheless receive a positive labor income (6363). 4. We ignore members with incomplete reporting on labor income (6,694) and workers with an annual real wage lower than 50% of the annual real minimum wage (12,293). 5. We ignore workers with abnormally high increases in their real wage (above 1000%) between the first and last year of observation in the panel (187). ECB Working Paper Series No 2333 / December 2019 54 ",
        "6. We ignore household members with inconsistent age records that increase by more than one from one year to another or decrease (6,553) and household members who are not relatives (210). The two highest wage earners within the household are in most cases (80.5%) the head of the household and the spouse. We retain for the household-level regressions their wage income, age, gender, level of education and years of work experience, years since migration to the city, marital status, industry and occupation. B.3 Minimum Wage Dependency of a Household Finally, we define the share S of household income coming from the wage income (of the two highest wage earners) at or near the minimum wage. We consider a wage earner to earn a minimum wage if her salary ranges between 50% and 150% of the real minimum wage of their county of residence in the first year the individual is observed in the panel. Conditioning on the first year of household observation assures that the treated household group remains unchanged over time. Among the two highest wage earners of all retained households, we identify 32,580 (18.72%) treated (minimum wage) and 141,442 (81.3%) non-treated worker-year observations. We also undertake ex- tensive robustness checks with respect to a narrower salary range from 50% to 120% of the county minimum wage, which results in 18,721 (10.76%) and 155,301 (89.24%) non-treated worker-year ob- servations, respectively. Table B-I reports summary statistics on the households income and expenditure components for household groups sorted by their minimum wage income share S. Column (1) includes all households, Column (2) with S = 0 all households without wage income at or near the minimum wage, whereas Columns (3)-(5) show household groups of increasing minimum wage dependency.

        "H Robustness to Two-Way Clustering Table H-I: Household Consumption under Labor Income Shocks with Two-Way Clustering We replicate the 2SLS regressions in in Table IV in which real annual household consumption is alterna- tively regressed on the household\u2019s fitted annual real labor income level in Columns (1)-(4), or the fitted annual real labor income plus transfers level in Columns (5)-(8). To allow for arbitrary correlation of residuals due to city/province-wide shocks we cluster the standard errors at the county and province-year level [in squared brackets], and alternatively at the county and city-year levels { in curly brackets } . The samples consist of all households for which the labor income share S from wages is zero ( S = 0), more than 50% ( S > 0 . 5), or more than 75% ( S > 0 . 75) of household labor income. All regressions include city-level controls, household fixed effects, interacted province-year fixed effects, and county time-trends as specified, control variables are as specified in Equation 3. Standard errors clustered at county-level in parentheses. *, **, *** denotes statistical significance at the 10%, 5%, 1% level, respectively. The p -values in the last line refer to a test under the null hypothesis of weak instruments (Kleibergen and Paap, 2006).
