        "EUROPEAN COMMISSION 5 ABSTRACT The analysis of all the 28 Partnership Agreements and of 292 operational and co- operation programmes for the 2014-2020 period financed by the European Regional Development Fund, the Cohesion Fund and the European Social Fund, completed with a survey of managing authorities and interviews at European, national and regional levels, revealed that the new regulatory framework has significantly altered the Member States\u2019 approach to programming. The new provisions required programmers to link strategic thinking and result-based management, and relate strategic thinking with the objectives and the means of the Europe 2020 strategy. The new programming approach succeeded to make the strategy behind the allocation of resources, the links between means and results more specific and transparent than before. However, the presentation of programmes became rather complicated. The wide range of needs addressed suggests an apparent demand for integrated territorial approach. At the same time, the scope for applying the integrated instruments in all sectors and types of areas has not yet been exhausted. Implementation-related new provisions were among the less controversial elements of the nineteen new provisions analyzed, and in general, Member States did comply with new requirements in this area. This provides a good basis for further developing implementation capacity. ",

        "10 E XECUTIVE S UMMARY The Task This report summarises the results of a study undertaken, between October 2014 and February 2016, for the European Commission\u2019s services (Directorate General for Regional and Urban Policy - DG REGIO, also involving DG EMPL and DG AGRI). Its mission was to examine the integration of a set of 19 new provisions of the reformed legal framework for Cohesion Policy in the programming phase for 2014-2020. The study follows up on the outcomes of the comprehensive reform debate on Cohesion Policy conducted since 2008. As a result of the debate, while keeping the policy\u2019s original treaty mandate \u2013 to strengthen the EU\u2019s economic, social and territorial cohesion , as well as reducing disparities between regions, and the backwardness of the least favoured territories \u2013 Cohesion Policy has been established as the EU's main investment policy to support the achievement of European objectives, as described in the Europe 2020 strategy for smart, sustainable and inclusive growth. The new provisions, the uptake of which has been assessed, can be grouped into three categories: \uf0b7 Provisions related to the contents of the programming documents and their result-orientation , including links to Europe 2020 strategy, thematic concentration, building priority axes in programmes, the intervention logic and results, planned use of financial instruments, co-financing rates and major projects, as well as horizontal principles. \uf0b7 New, integrated approaches to territorial development including the use of new Cohesion Policy instruments of integrated territorial investments (ITIs), community-led local development (CLLD) and sustainable urban development (SUD). In addition, the study analysed the priorities of European territorial co- operation and macro-regional strategies, as well as specific approaches towards regions affected by poverty and with permanent geographic or demographic handicaps; \uf0b7 New rules regarding the efficiency of programme management : co-ordination of ESI Funds with other European and national funding instruments; e strengthening of capacities of programme authorities and beneficiaries, reduction of the administrative burden, and the use of electronic government solutions in cohesion policy. The study covered the analysis of all 28 Partnership Agreements and 292 Programmes , financed by the ERDF and the Cohesion Fund, including 75 European territorial co-operation programmes as well as 92 multi-fund operational programmes co- financed by the European Social Fund. Of these, 245 were adopted by the study\u2019s cut-off date, the remaining ones were processed in their latest available version. Beyond documentary analysis, the work has also covered the assessment of the ",
        "T HE U SE OF N EW P ROVISIONS DURING THE P ROGRAMMING P HASE OF THE E UROPEAN S TRUCTURAL AND I NVESTMENT F UNDS 11 programming process (through a web-survey involving a representative number of Managing Authorities and interviews at European, national and/or regional levels). 1 The study has been monitored by a steering group composed of members from different Commission services. The draft final report has been shared with Member States and takes account of comments made in this context. The findings will feed into the Commission's assessment of the outcome of programming negotiations and into further reflections on the future of the policy. General observations The study shows that the new provisions have significantly altered the approach to programming . Most prominently, the focus on results has required programmers to link strategic thinking, result-based management and place-based policy making. Programmers were encouraged to think in terms of a hierarchy of objectives and measuring results. The new regulations relate strategic thinking with the objectives and the means (i.e. the Country-Specific Recommendations - CSRs) of the Europe 2020 strategy in line with territorial needs. Elements of result-based management appear in the compulsory definition of the specific objectives as results to which the investment priorities contribute, and they are also present in the consistent requirements of defining and using indicators and the performance framework. Place-based policy is apparent \u2013 inter alia 2 \u2013 in the provisions of the integrated approach to territorial development. In view of the above, the structure of programming documents has also been substantially changed for 2014-2020. The new programming approach makes the strategy behind the allocation of resources more specific, more transparent and provides a consistent structure. The links between means (priority axes, investment categories and actions) on the one hand, and results on the other, are more specific than before. Priority axes and investment priorities play a parallel role here, but it is only the priority axes that have clearly identified financial allocations. On the other hand, the presentation of programmes became rather complicated , due to multi-priority and multi-region axes. It remains to be seen whether in practice this makes the contribution of Cohesion Policy to Union priorities more evident and better measureable. 1 \u2013 Provisions related to the contents of programming documents and the focus on results Strategic programming and link with Europe 2020 strategy. The study found considerable alignment between the priorities of Partnership Agreements and Cohesion Policy programmes on the one hand, and the priorities of the Europe 2020 strategy on the other. Explicit references to Europe 2020 strategy headline targets or 1 For this purpose, 292 survey questionnaires were sent out to Managing Authorities, of which 51% were returned in a completed form. Overall, authorities from 26 MS responded, EE and LT authorities did not (See also Annex 4.20). Also, 41 interviews were conducted, covering all MS except HU and CY where no partners were available 2 The place-based approach also results from the overall intervention logic of the programmes, which are not only designed to reflect EU strategies but also territorial needs. ",
        "12 country-specific recommendations were included in 43% of programmes representing 58% of Cohesion Policy budget. The highest number of explicit references to Europe 2020 was found in the programmes the field of research and innovation and low carbon economy. In Partnership Agreements, the number of references to Europe 2020 is higher than the number of references to other strategic documents, Operational and co-operation programmes are more policy-oriented and include references both to Europe 2020 strategy and to other European and national policy documents, national reform programmes, national and regional strategies. Regional strategies were the most frequent starting points for programming, followed by national strategies and European policies. Thematic concentration. The results of the study show a substantial degree of concentration of ERDF and the Cohesion Fund on thematic objectives. Altogether, 56% of ERDF budget was allocated to three thematic objectives which received the highest funding: \uf0b7 TO 1 strengthening research, technological development and innovation (22%); \uf0b7 TO 3 enhancing the competitiveness of SMEs (17%); \uf0b7 TO 4 supporting the shift towards a low-carbon economy (17%). In line with its Treaty objectives, Cohesion Fund allocations are strongly concentrated on TO 7 (transport and network infrastructures) and TO 6 (environment). The allocations of more developed regions are focused, first of all, on research and innovation, followed by SME support and low carbon economy. Less developed regions allocated the highest amounts of their ERDF and CF funding to four thematic objectives: research and innovation, network infrastructure, SME support and low carbon economy. Overall, the \u201cmenu approach\u201d of thematic objectives and investment priorities made allocation and programming more transparent and programmes more apt to analysis and scrutiny. Thematic concentration received more attention during programming, concentration requirements were several times exceeded, channelling more funds to investment fields central to the Europe 2020 strategy. Result orientation . The definitions of results and specific objectives used in the programmes were mostly consistent with investment priorities. The results were also rather well defined in terms of methodology: only 1% of the references can be considered as problematic (i.e. not reflecting genuine results or specific objectives). On the other hand, the definitions of actions and selection criteria were in many cases too broadly defined. OPs used a broad range (several hundred types) of specific objectives, expected results, actions and selection principles. However, they used these types in a rather concentrated manner : one quarter of them account for three quarters of the references. Interestingly, as survey results show, the dialogue with partners appears to have focussed on the definition of actions. Conversely, the dialogue with the EC was, apparently centred on improving the overall level of the intervention logic (objectives and results). Overall, the transition from action-based programming to a result-based one seems to have proved challenging for Member States; the major challenge was, in particular, the identification of result indicators. Building of priority axes. Half of the ERDF budget, 41% of ESF funding (in programmes jointly financed with ERDF) and 21% of the Cohesion Fund are disbursed through combined priority axes . Under the Investment for Growth and Jobs goal, ",
        "T HE U SE OF N EW P ROVISIONS DURING THE P ROGRAMMING P HASE OF THE E UROPEAN S TRUCTURAL AND I NVESTMENT F UNDS 13 complex priority axes represent 29% of the total number of 1.283 priority axes representing 43% of its budget. Among them, only fifteen priority axes combine ESF and ERDF funding, giving a prevailing picture of mono-fund approach at priority axes level in the new programming period. 3 More frequently, combined priority axes covered different categories of regions (8% of priority axes) or multiple thematic objectives (14%). Under the ETC goal, combined options only represent 11% of the priority axes. In many cases, the Commission considered that further justification for the combination axes was needed as this risked undermining the clarity of the intervention logic. Still, the alternative of using integrated territorial instruments instead of such axes was \u2013 as survey results show \u2013 in general not considered by Member States as an appropriate substitution. Financial instruments. The new regulatory framework supports the use of financial instruments (FI) in multiple policy areas. As programme data show, financial instruments are indeed planned to be used under at least nine, and possibly under all eleven thematic objectives. With the exception of only four Member States, all EU countries stated their intention to make use of such instruments. According to the OPs, financial instruments will account for 9.5% of the ERDF, 2.7% of the Cohesion Fund and 1.3% of the ESF allocations included in multifund programmes covered by the study. The average allocation to FIs is 7.2% 4 . This compares to 5% of ERDF allocation to FI in the previous period. More than half of support through financial instruments is to be provided in the form of loans and equivalent instruments, and one quarter through support to venture capital and equity. The most frequent justification for using financial instruments, according to the relevant programmes and ex-ante evaluations, was to support potentially profitable projects with financing needs not met by the market, and to complement the funds available for grants. Speeding up the deployment of EU assistance, and increasing the number of enterprises (or other project beneficiaries) benefitting from refundable assistance, were also the reasons behind the use of financial instruments. Overall, the new provisions on financial instruments enjoyed a cautious reception by Member States \u2013 despite the possibility of reaching higher leverage of EU funds. Major projects. They are planned across almost all thematic objectives, but their use is fairly concentrated on one or two investment priorities for each thematic objective, except for promoting sustainable transport and removing bottlenecks in key network infrastructures that relies heavily on major projects in most investment priorities. 13% of the planned projects are phased ones, continuations of those having successfully implemented their first phase in the previous programming period. The phasing of major projects should contribute to the launch of operational programmes for 2014-2020. Use of co-financing rates. Data show that there is variation in the co-financing rates especially in more developed regions, transition regions, EU-15 Member States and co- operation programmes. At the same time, the Cohesion Fund and EU-13 programmes mostly apply maximum rates. Altogether, one third of the programmes foresee to use 3 Only 8% of the total of ERDF+ESF+CF allocations of the programmes analysed correspond to multifund priority axes. The share of ESF allocations in ESF multifund priority axes is only 6,5% of the total ESF allocations to these programmes. 4 These figures reflect the intentions of use of financial instruments, based on the the contents of the programmes. The actual uptake of FI will depend, inter alia, on the results of mandatory ex ante assessments. ",
        "14 modulation. In almost two-thirds of these cases the reason is the importance of the priority axis for the delivery of the Europe 2020 strategy. Horizontal principles . They received lot of attention in the programming documents. In particular, horizontal principles of sustainable development, social inclusion and non- discrimination principles have been included in the highest number of programmes (in 80-90% of programmes), while accessibility, climate change and demography seem to receive comparatively less attention. Mainstreaming is the most popular method to promote horizontal principles, mentioned in about 2/3 of PAs and programmes. 2 \u2013 Integrated approach to territorial development Integrated approaches enable the combination of resources from different funds and can reinforce the territorial dimension of Cohesion Policy. As data show, the territorial approach has received considerable attention in programmes. Every Member State has identified territories where integrated territorial approaches needed to be applied, as well as specific challenges and development needs that are to be addressed by territorial instruments. Sixty percent of the managing authorities reported that their programme was primarily responding to regional and local needs, and only 11% said that it did not consider them. Purely sectoral OPs are therefore rare. In over 70% of the cases the territorial analysis was also prepared at the local level, reflecting a strong bottom-up element. In financial terms: \uf0b7 Altogether 20 MS (94 programmes, including 2 ETC programmes) are using integrated territorial investments (ITI) . The amount allocated to ITI is \u20ac 14.77 billion, with 68% going to urban ITIs, and 87% coming from the ERDF. \uf0b7 The total amount allocated to sustainable urban development (SUD) is \u20ac 15.47 billion. 14,2 billion (92,5%) of the total amount for SUD is to be financed by the ERDF and 1,27 billion (7,5%) by the ESF (in multi-fund programmes). About half of that amount is delivered through ITIs. \uf0b7 The allocations to community-led local development ( CLLD) \u2013 from the Cohesion Policy funds, not counting EAFRD or EMFF, is \u20ac 1.496 billion. The share of ERDF and ESF from this amount is 81% and 19%, respectively. This corresponds to around 0.6% of the ERDF budget and only 0.43% of the total Cohesion Policy budget for the 28 Member States. This means that, at EU level, SUD is responsible for ca. 8% of the ERDF, which is almost 50% more than the regulatory requirement , and \u20ac 6.2 billion of ERDF and ESF (included in multi-fund programmes) are invested into integrated instruments on a voluntary basis, irrespective of any regulatory obligation. Given that ITI was not compulsory, and there was no additional financial incentive \u2013 e.g. for using a specific priority axis - the amount invested into it is also considerable. Compared to the other two new territorial instruments, the investment in CLLD seems rather low \u2013 even though CLLD had a precursor and there also was an extra financial incentive to use CLLD \u2013 if a specific priority axis was designed. Its use is also rather concentrated: the top 3 countries are responsible for almost half of the funds for CLLD. The 13 priority axes entirely dedicated to CLLD account for 65% of the allocated resources. Both facts suggest that the expansion of CLLD stays rather limited in cohesion ",

(At the same time ca. \u20ac 4 bn were allocated to CLLD from EAFRD, which is not included in the numbers above.) The arguments motivating Member States for or against the use of territorial instruments were explored both through the survey and interviews. On the positive side the most frequently mentioned aspects were their ability to address complex, cross- sectoral challenges and needs in a territorial context, and the possibility to involve stakeholders from the sub-national level. Those who decided against them claimed that they were not appropriate to their programmes \u2013 e.g. because they targeted objectives that were served by predominantly sectoral policies (especially TOs on R&D, ITC and SME development). Some respondents also perceived the new tools as being complicated. 5 Further reservations, in case of Member States with limited EU allocations were related to a perceived danger of \u201cdispersing\u201d scarce resources into smaller programmes. As regards the integrated nature of interventions under these instruments programme data reflect that: \uf0b7 ITIs and SUD are focused mainly on urban areas , followed by urban- rural and rural areas. CLLD in turn is most present in rural areas , and fisheries areas. At the same time, in almost 50% of programmes where CLLD has been selected it will be available to urban areas as well. Areas with permanent natural handicaps, or those affected by poverty or with sizeable vulnerable groups, are less emphasised. \uf0b7 In terms of needs to be addressed and actions planned, both integrated instruments in general, as well as CLLD in particular, focus on SME development, employment, social inclusion and the environment . For ITI and SUD, the list of priority investment areas includes also connectivity, research & development, and education. For CLLD, natural and cultural heritage, education and urban-rural linkages are also important 6 . The above suggests that under all three territorially integrated instruments there is a wide range of needs to be addressed, which suggests a demand for integrated approach . At the same time, the scope for applying the integrated instruments in all sectors and types of areas has not yet been exhausted. In addition, the study found that: \uf0b7 Areas for European territorial co-operation have been identified in programming documents, with environmental protection, transport, SME as well as research and development selected most frequently as priorities. Programmes contain also many references to macro-regional and sea- basin strategies \u2013 among them mainly to the Strategy for the Baltic Sea Region and the Danube Strategy. Nevertheless, due to procedural differences 7 , synergies between mainstream OPs and ETC, as well as ESIF 5 Note: Opinions on this point are divided in Member States. Around half of the managing authorities of those programmes where the territorial instruments are used, did not report any major difficulty in deploying them. 6 For details, please refer to sections 3.8.4 and 3.9.2 of the study 7 The programming schedules for the \u201cmainstream\u201d OPs and those for territorial co-operation differed. Macro- regional and sea-basin strategies are drafted in a process separate from cohesion policy programming. A co- financing by ESIF to such strategies is not a priori guaranteed by regulatory provisions (see also Chapter 3.12). ",
        "16 programmes and macro-regional and sea-basin strategies proved difficult to achieve in the programming process. There are question marks reported by interview partners to what extent \"mainstream programmes\" will in practice be able to contribute to transnational co-operation and macro- regional strategies. In this area therefore, good co-ordination during implementation will be of particular importance. \uf0b7 Specific integrated approaches towards poor regions and vulnerable groups appear in slightly more than half of the Member States. The most frequent types of territories among poor regions are those with socially marginalised communities, urban-rural areas, and areas with permanent geographical or demographic handicaps. The social groups to be most frequently targeted in ERDF/ CF programmes (including multi-fund OPs) are the unemployed, the young, disabled people and minorities. The range of planned actions reflects a rather sectoral approach. Human services, such as employment, education and social and antidiscrimination policy are at the top of Member States\u2019 intervention lists, other policy areas necessary for a more integrated approach (e.g.: SME promotion) are less present. During the negotiations, DG Employment was pushing for a target-group-based approach when addressing the needs of the poor. On this point though, there was resistance from some Member States preferring a territorially based approach. 8 \uf0b7 The regions with permanent geographical handicaps are generally identified in PAs and OPs, although the number of OPs addressing those regions is rather low. On the other hand, there is coherence between needs identified and actions planned, and planned actions cover a wide range of policy areas, which suggests an integrated approach. Overall, there were very few difficulties mentioned by Member States in the application of the provisions targeted at regions with permanent handicaps. This is most likely thanks to the considerable experience countries concerned have already accumulated. The main issue which hinders implementation according to MAs is apparently the lack of accurate data and indicators specific to these areas. Overall, with respect to the above three points, it appears that in certain cases not all relevant objectives, regions and target groups are addressed by Member States, and, even where these specific territorial aspects appear, programmes do not contain specific (financial) commitments. This may be related to methodological problems (e.g. in programming ETC), the scarcity of resources \u2013 e.g. in more developed Member States, where funding has to be concentrated on an even more limited number of areas \u2013 or the perception that a problem \u2013 e.g. poverty \u2013 is not territorially defined. In any case, the implementation of programme elements related to territorial co-operation and macro- regional strategies, regions affected by poverty, vulnerable groups and areas with permanent handicaps, should be closely monitored. Another important aspect in relation to integrated territorial approaches is the sharing of tasks between the programme authorities and beneficiaries of assistance at regional and local levels. For all instruments, it appears that the willingness of programme 8 See section 3.13.6 of the study ",
        "T HE U SE OF N EW P ROVISIONS DURING THE P ROGRAMMING P HASE OF THE E UROPEAN S TRUCTURAL AND I NVESTMENT F UNDS 17 authorities to delegate functions \u2013 unless it\u2019s compulsory, as in the case of SUD \u2013 is limited. The key challenges (difficulties) related to territorial instruments are, apparently, related to programming : establishing a coherent framework for addressing different kinds of territorial challenges, reconciling with each other territorial approaches and sectoral policies, and the preparation of good quality territorial development strategies. Difficulties with understanding and applying the regulation \u2013 although they did appear in interviews \u2013 seem to be secondary. 3 \u2013 Expected effectiveness of programme management New provisions related to management \u2013 funds co-ordination; capacity building, the reduction of the burden, horizontal principles or electronic administration \u2013 are, again, not entirely \u201cnew\u201d. They have been the subject of continuous discussion between the Commission and Member States in recent years. Nevertheless, the programming templates required Member States to provide substantially more specific details on these aspects than in previous periods. In general, Member States did comply with these requirements, which provides a good basis for developing implementation capacity. Implementation-related new provisions were among the less controversial elements of the negotiations between the Commission and Member States. Coordination between the ESI Funds, other funding and EIB: At the level of programming documents, Member States paid considerable attention to the co-ordination of funds and policies. Co-ordination was the strongest among the ESI Funds themselves, followed by other EU instruments like Horizon 2020, LIFE, COSME and CEF, and then national funds and the EIB. As regards methods of co-ordination, the efforts are focused on programming, in particular through a synergetic use of funds via joint strategies, multi-fund programmes etc., as well as on institutional arrangements, such as the use of the co-ordination body in the sense of Art. 123(8). Co-ordination during implementation was mentioned less often, which may indicate some weaknesses. Surveys and interviews confirmed the view that overall co-ordination improved, especially in the programming phase. Administrative capacity building . New provisions in this field include the requirements to assess gaps in administrative capacities of authorities and beneficiaries and to describe main actions to reinforce administrative capacities. Member States fulfilled these requirements, but the quality of the action plans was assessed in the study as rather weak. The areas in which programme authorities had the most urgent capacity building needs included project selection, monitoring and evaluation (including results-oriented management), as well as financial control, public procurement and state aid. As regards capacity building of beneficiaries, Member States\u2019 needs were fairly evenly spread between project generation, public procurement, financial management and monitoring. As regards possible difficulties in capacity building, interviewed authorities cited the complexity and exceedingly technical nature of management rules, especially with respect to state aids and public procurement, followed by financial instruments. Reducing administrative burden on beneficiaries. Programming documents contain a lot of information regarding the administrative burden on beneficiaries, and planned actions to reduce it. In about half of the cases, this information is based on a detailed ",
        "18 needs assessments. The most important actions to reduce the administrative burden include the increased use of simplified cost options and e-cohesion, as well as simplification of application, procurement and payment procedures and a reduction of archiving requirements. E-cohesion . New provisions in this area include a requirement for electronic exchange of information between programme authorities and beneficiaries. An analysis of data from Partnership Agreements indicates clear progress in all Member States and with respect to all stages of the programme cycle. Full electronic administration and electronic access for beneficiaries to the IT management systems is envisaged all over the EU. Steps towards the integration of other national IT systems and the elimination of the paper trail \u2013 as suggested by the EC\u2019s relevant e-cohesion guidelines \u2013 are also envisaged. Overall, Member States are optimistic about prospects to improve funds\u2019 management in the new period. Still, the level of detail regarding planned actions in programmes could be deeper. Plans to reduce the administrative burden, for instance, were, in many cases, not based on thorough needs assessments. The implementation of the management-related new provisions will be key for the overall success of the new regulatory framework. It is too early to judge, to what extent Member States\u2019 capacity building plans in the PAs and programmes shall be realised. Continued attention \u2013 and co-operation between the Commission and programme authorities, and among programme authorities \u2013 will be required especially in the areas of funds co-ordination, and results-oriented management, as synergetic programming alone may not be sufficient to ensure a close co-operation among ESI and other EU funds and may lead to working in silos with losing out on real synergy effects by combined or coordinated investments. 9 4 - The Negotiation Process The negotiation process was examined through the survey and the interviews with national EU funds coordinating bodies, managing authorities and the Commission officials. In about two-thirds of the cases, the Partnership Agreement and the operational programmes were prepared in parallel. More frequently it was the Partnership Agreement that provided the strategic framework which programmes followed. In the ESF \u2013 in some contrast to the ERDF and CF \u2013 it was rather the operational programmes where strategic issues were settled. According to interviews, co-ordination on the side of Member States differed according to governance traditions, prevailing policy, as well as administrative capacity. There is no dominant method or approach that could be said to be \u201ctypical\u201d. On the Commission\u2019s side, negotiations are reported to have been more strongly co-ordinated than in previous planning periods. There was a new matrix structure established between functional and geographical units, which co-operated and discussed the status of programming several times during the negotiations. In general, 9 In this respect, mention should be made of a parallel study commissioned by DG REGIO with regard to the implementation of new provisions on ex ante conditionalities. Such conditionalities are important to ensure that the use of ESIF funds takes place in an appropriate policy, strategic, regulatory and institutional environment. ",
        "T HE U SE OF N EW P ROVISIONS DURING THE P ROGRAMMING P HASE OF THE E UROPEAN S TRUCTURAL AND I NVESTMENT F UNDS 19 Commission officials assessed the process as resource intensive, but useful. Reinforced co-ordination within the Commission has also resulted in a more unified approach towards the Member States. These factors have apparently helped the Commission to negotiate effectively, as survey data have demonstrated. The most frequently mentioned factor that influenced the negotiations overall \u2013 as Managing Authorities reported \u2013 was the informal dialogue with the European Commission. Specifically, it was reported to have had the biggest impact on the definition of specific objectives, the selection of actions and the use of indicators. It was also cited as the most important element of the negotiations and with regard to the co-ordination of funds. The feedback from MAs also underscores the importance of partnership with domestic stakeholders, especially in the areas of selecting objectives and actions, the use of Integrated Territorial Investments and Community-led Local Development, as well as efforts to reduce the administrative burden on beneficiaries. On average, for about half of the issues that were addressed during programming, managing authorities did not report major differences of opinion. Where there was disagreement, in almost two thirds of the cases (29% overall), a compromise solution was found, somewhere \u201chalf way\u201d between the negotiating positions of the EU and the Member State. For the remaining open questions, it seems to have been the Commission that has carried the day, twice as often as the Member State. Overall, this would indicate both a general tendency towards flexibility and seeking consensus, as well as a relatively strong position of the EC during the negotiations. Areas with apparently the largest initial differences are the use of indicators, the selection of actions to be supported and the definition of specific objectives, but also the use of combination axes. The areas with the highest degree of consensus from the beginning include co-ordination with transnational actions and ETC, and the co-ordination among funds and with EU policies. The Commission seems to have been the most flexible towards Member State\u2019s proposals with respect to the use of combination axes; as well as the use of Integrated Territorial Instruments and Community-led Local Development. Conversely, Member States needed to adjust their positions above all in relation to the use of indicators, the definition of objectives, and the selection of thematic objectives. Overall, perhaps most importantly , on the basis of the new regulatory framework, Member States made a significant step towards reinforcing the result-orientation of Cohesion Policy, on the basis of the Union\u2019s strategy for smart sustainable and inclusive growth. The actual achievement of results and any future progress into this direction will, of course, depend on the experience from implementation. The study attached contains more details and further specific conclusions with respect to each of the 19 new provisions addressed. ",
        "20 1 B ACKGROUND As a result of a wide-ranging debate lasting several years, the EU\u2019s cohesion policy has undergone a major reform for the period 2014-2020. \uf0b7 On the one hand, it has retained its original treaty mandate to strengthen the EU\u2019s economic, social and territorial cohesion, as well as reducing disparities between regions, and the backwardness of the least favoured territories. (European Union, 2009, p. Art. 174) \uf0b7 On the other hand, it has been established as the EU's main investment policy to support the achievement of European objectives, as described in the Europe 2020 strategy for smart, sustainable and inclusive growth. In other words, cohesion policy\u2019s twin objectives of solidarity and development have found a new, sustainable balance . The reform debate addressed all aspects of policy, and all stages of programme design and delivery. Some of its key outcomes that found their way into the new regulatory framework are: \uf0b7 The identification of eleven thematic objectives on the basis of Europe 2020 in order to maximise the impact of ESI investments, and to provide a basis for the concentration of funds on a limited number of priorities in all Member States (Member States) and regions; \uf0b7 An increased focus on measureable results , in all programmes, from the initial design stage on. Each programme is required to establish a clear intervention logic, a set specific objectives, and to determine clearly the results expected \u2013 in line with needs identified in the area addressed; \uf0b7 An increased use of financial instruments in SME promotion, to provide better access to funding and reduce aid dependency; but also in other areas, such as energy efficiency, information and communication technology, transport and R&D support ; \uf0b7 The introduction \u2013 or further development \u2013 of new ways of implementing the policy to tackle territorial challenges including integrated territorial investments, community-led local development and multi-fund programmes combining ERDF, ESF and the Cohesion Fund; \uf0b7 Improved co-ordination of the ESI funds through common regulatory provisions and a Common Strategic Framework to provide strategic direction \u2013 in order to achieve synergies and avoid overlaps with each other as well as with EU and national instruments and policies; helping to promote horizontal principles; \uf0b7 Renewed efforts for an effective and efficient implementation of programmes on the ground , inter alia , through the reinforcement of administrative capacity, simplification and the reduction of the administrative burden on beneficiaries \u2013 including \u201ce-cohesion\u201d.

In October 2014 , the European Commission launched a series of studies examining the application of new regulatory provisions for 2014-2020. The overall purpose of the work was to develop an evidence-base on how these new provisions were used in the new Partnership Agreements and programmes financed by the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) and the Cohesion Fund (CF), including multi-fund programmes. This report covers the results of a detailed examination of 19 groups new provisions , related to: \uf0b7 1 - strategic programming \uf0b7 2 - thematic concentration \uf0b7 3 - the building of priority axes \uf0b7 4 - result-orientation ('Intervention logic') \uf0b7 5 - the planned use of financial instruments \uf0b7 6 - the planned use of major projects \uf0b7 7 - the use of co-financing rates \uf0b7 Integrated approaches to territorial development, including o 8 - the analysis of territorial challenges in programming documents; o 9 - community-led local development (CLLD); o 10 - integrated territorial investments \u2013 ITI; o 11 - actions for sustainable urban development; o 12 - macro-regional and sea-basin strategies; o 13 - the specific needs of geographical areas most affected by poverty; and with populations at the highest risk of discrimination and social exclusion; o 14 - regions which suffer from severe and permanent natural or demographic handicaps; \uf0b7 15 - the coordination between the ESI funds and other Union and national funding instruments and with the European Investment Bank \uf0b7 16 - administrative capacity building \uf0b7 17 - actions to reduce administrative burden on beneficiaries 10 Except for technical assistance and programmes dedicated to financial instruments in favour of SME as set out in Art. 39 of the CPR). 11 Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) N\u00b0204/2014 of 7 January 2014 on the European code of conduct on partnership in the framework of the European Structural and Investment Funds ",

The specific objectives of the analysis were to deliver: (1) A synthesis of how the new provisions are reflected in all Partnership Agreements, operational programmes financed by the ERDF and the CF, including multi-fund programmes, and ETC programmes financed by the ERDF; (2) An assessment of how the new provisions have been used during the programming phase ; (3) Conclusions on strengths and weaknesses with regard to the application of the new provisions during the programming phase, as well as first conclusions on their value . The 1 st objective was addressed through desk studies of \uf0b7 the 28 Partnership Agreements, \uf0b7 217 Operational Programmes financed by the ERDF and the CF, including the 92 multi-fund programmes co-financed by the ESF, as well as the 75 Co-operation Programmes financed by the ERDF 12 . \uf0b7 Desk studies also covered the relevant parts of the Commission\u2019s formal observations on all Partnership Agreements and relating programmes. The 2 nd and 3 rd objectives were examined using \uf0b7 the outcome of the desk studies; \uf0b7 the relevant parts of ex ante evaluations carried out for each programme 13 ; \uf0b7 an on-line survey covering all Managing Authorities 14 ; and \uf0b7 a total of 41 interviews of the main relevant actors at Union level (geographical desks in DG REGIO and DG EMPL and competence centres in DG REGIO etc.) and at national level (through a selection of coordinating ministries/services/bodies in the Member States and Managing authorities). 15 In addition, results from documentary analysis were also subjected to deeper statistical analysis. (See annex 4. for details) 12 At the time of conducting the analysis, 13 OPs and 33 ETC programmes were not yet finally adopted. Therefore, the last available versions at that time ( July 30 th , 2015) were examined. 13 in accordance with Article 55 of the CPR (Regulation of the EP and the Council No. 1303/2013). 14 Overall, 292 survey questionnaires were sent out to Managing Authorities, of which 51% were returned in a completed form.

        "24 2 T HE N EGOTIATION P ROCESS The negotiation process was examined through the survey and the interviews . Research questions addressed both horizontal and provision-specific angles. In this Chapter, we concentrate on horizontal lessons. In Chapter 3, we will review findings specific to each policy area. The overall process In about two-thirds of the cases, the Partnership Agreement and the operational programmes were prepared in parallel . More frequently it was the partnership agreement that provided the strategic framework which programmes followed. It was only in about 10% of the cases where the preparation of programmes was done bottom- up and PAs were therefore an aggregation of programmes data and orientations. (See also Chapter 3.1 on Strategic Programming). At the same time, officials from DG Employment pointed out that in the case of the ESF \u2013 in some contrast to the ERDF and CF \u2013 it was rather the operational programmes where strategic issues were settled . To them, the real policy questions came onto the table only with the selection of investment priorities, and that is where the DG has focussed their efforts. According to interviews, co-ordination on the side of Member States differed according to governance traditions, prevailing policy, as well as administrative capacity. There is no dominant method or approach that could be said to be \u201ctypical\u201d. In some cases it was one ministry \u2013 or the office of the prime minister \u2013 that dominated the discussions, while sector ministries and regions were following the lead. Elsewhere, despite a centralised government tradition, co-ordination between PA and OP writers proved weak, due to limits in administrative capacity. In federal systems, like Belgium or Germany, as well as in France, it was the regions that took the lead. In Belgium, this even led to the preparation of a bi-lingual Partnership Agreement. Conversely, in Italy, the government wished to co-ordinate more strongly despite the large weight of regional OPs. Accordingly, the Italian Partnership Agreement is a rather more detailed document. On the Commission\u2019s side, negotiations are reported to have been more strongly co- ordinated than in previous planning periods. There was a new matrix structure established between functional and geographical units, which co-operated and discussed the status of programming several times during the negotiations. In general, Commission officials assessed the process as resource intensive, but useful. At the same time, there were complaints about excessive bureaucracy, and delays. Reinforced co-ordination within the Commission has also resulted in a more unified approach towards the Member States . These factors have apparently helped the Commission to negotiate effectively (as survey data will demonstrate further below). At the same time, at least one Country Unit remarked that this centralised approval resulted in quite rigid negotiating mandates, which in some cases did not allow finding solutions that would have been tailored to national needs. ",
        "T HE U SE OF N EW P ROVISIONS DURING THE P ROGRAMMING P HASE OF THE E UROPEAN S TRUCTURAL AND I NVESTMENT F UNDS 25 Factors influencing the content of programmes In order to assess the overall impact of the negotiation process on the content of programmes, the survey asked Managing Authorities where and why the content of the final programming documents was significantly different from the initial position (intentions) of the Member States. Where such changes have occurred, these were deemed to be the effect of negotiations. Conversely, where the outcome of programming was the same as the Member State\u2019s starting position, the negotiations, apparently, have not made a major impact. The list of factors that survey respondents could choose from, in order to explain the reasons and motivations behind an eventual change of Member State positions, included: \uf0b7 The text of the regulations \uf0b7 Commission guidance materials \uf0b7 Informal dialogue with the Commission \uf0b7 The EC position paper issued at the beginning of the negotiations \uf0b7 Formal observations by the Commission on draft programming documents \uf0b7 Opinion of the (domestic) partners \uf0b7 Domestic legal, institutional or methodological context \uf0b7 Ex ante evaluations. For each of the 19 policy areas that the survey addressed, MAs could select up to 3 factors, or choose none, if they considered that the negotiations did not make a significant impact on their choices in that particular policy area. According to results, the most important factors that influenced the outcome of the negotiations were the informal dialogue with the Commission, and the provisions of the new regulations on the one hand, and the national legal-institutional context and the opinion of partners consulted during programming, on the other.

        "26 The significance of the individual factors was , of course, different according to area (provision): \uf0b7 The informal dialogue \u2013 taking place during 2013 between the European Commission and each Member State, following the handover of the official positions from the European Commission for the programming negotiations at the end of 2012, and providing an additional forum to discuss programming priorities \u2013 was the most frequently mentioned negotiation factor overall. Specifically, it was reported to have had the biggest impact on the definition of specific objectives, the selection of actions and the use of indicators. It was also cited as the most important element of the negotiations with regard to the co-ordination of funds \uf0b7 The text of regulations was the most important point of reference for Member States with regard to 8 out of the 19 aspects listed. Among them, those most frequently mentioned were strategic programming (Europe 2020); the selection of thematic objectives; results and actions, as well as the use of indicators. \uf0b7 The Commission\u2019s guidance materials were most often consulted with regard to the use of indicators, as well as the definition of objectives and results. \uf0b7 The EC\u2019s initial position paper impacted above all on the references to Europe 2020, and the selection of thematic objectives. \uf0b7 Formal EC Observations had a major influence \u2013 just like the informal dialogue \u2013 on the identification of specific objectives, actions and indicators. \uf0b7 The domestic legal, institutional and methodological context was reported to have been key for the co-ordination among funds, the approach to sustainable urban development, combating poverty, as well as measures to ease the administrative burden on beneficiaries. \uf0b7 Ex-ante evaluations were mentioned as influential with respect to indicators, the definition of objectives, as well the selection of thematic objectives. \uf0b7 The opinion of partners in programming was most important with regard to selecting objectives, actions, the use of integrated territorial investments and community-led local development, as well as efforts to reduce the administrative burden on beneficiaries. These results are graphically presented in Figure 2 overleaf. ",

        "28 Still using the same data, it is interesting also to compare the influence of the informal dialogue with the EC on the one hand, and the exchanges with domestic partners on the other. As Figure 3 demonstrates, both types of discussions focussed predominantly on the content of programmes (rather than, say, technical management issues). Thereby, the talks with the Commission had a relatively larger impact with respect to the choice of objectives and results, while in exchanges with domestic partners the selection of actions was emphasised. To put it differently, the Commission apparently showed interest towards policy aspects, while domestic partners concentrated somewhat more on what could be financed out of the programmes. Also, the opinion of the domestic partners weighed significantly with respect to the administrative burden on beneficiaries. Figure 3 - Significance of the informal dialogue with the EC vs. the opinion of domestic partners Impact of Exchanges with the Commission Another survey question was posed to managing authorities in order to identify how the exchanges with the Commission, specifically, have influenced Member States\u2019 choices. For each policy area, respondents could indicate, whether the positions of the Member States and the EC coincided from the beginning, or whether the Member States or the EC have changed their initial views, reaching an intermediate arrangement, or resulting in a totally new approach.

Where there was disagreement, in almost two thirds of the cases (29% overall), a compromise solution was found, somewhere \u201chalf way\u201d between the negotiating positions of the EU and the Member State. For the remaining open issues, it seems to have been the Commission that has carried the day , twice as often as the Member State. Overall, this would indicate both a general tendency towards flexibility and seeking consensus, as well as a relatively strong position of the EC during the negotiations. Figure 4 - Impact of exchanges with the Commission 16 As regards individual areas, based on the survey responses by MA, \uf0b7 The Commission seems to have been most flexible towards Member State\u2019s proposals with respect to the use of combination axes ; as well as the use of Integrated Territorial Instruments and community-led local development. \uf0b7 Conversely, Member States needed to adjust their positions above all in relation to the use of indicators , the definition of objectives , and the selection of thematic objectives . \uf0b7 Areas with apparently the largest initial differences are the use of indicators , the selection of actions to be supported and the definition of specific objectives , but also the use of combination axes . 16 For a more detailed explanation of the graph pls. see the first two paragraphs of this subchapter. 0% 10% 20% 30% 40% 50% 60% 70% 80% 90% 100% Horizontal principles Administrative Burden Capacity Development Co-ordination with EU policies Co-ordination of Funds Poverty Transnational & ETC SUD CLLD ITI Result indicators Selection of actions Specific objectives Cobmiantion axes Financial instruments Flexibilities Results Thematic objectives EU 2020 AVERAGE EC accepted MS position Compromise EC changed position No disagreement ",

Overall, results are coherent with the results from the other horizontal question discussed above (regarding factors of change). They confirm that negotiations concentrated on the substance of programmes, with the most debated points related to the choice of objectives. The apparent intensity of the debate in relation to indicators shows significant attention paid to results-orientation and enhancing the methodology of programming towards a more developed performance framework, although it also involved considerable technical work On the other hand, there seemed to be a mutual openness towards using ESI Funds in a co-ordinated and strategic manner, in synergy with different available policy instruments.

In this context cohesion policy has been positioned as a key investment policy to support smart, sustainable and inclusive growth, while promoting harmonious development of the Union and reducing regional disparities, in accordance with Article 174 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). ESI Funds are to play a significant role in this. (CPR, p. Recital 3). Therefore, legislative changes have been introduced into the cohesion policy regulations to ensure that the policy \u2013 commanding one third of the EU budget \u2013 provides European added value , and produces measureable results contributing to the EU\u2019s overall policy objectives. For the period 2014-2020, cohesion policy\u2019s objectives have been brought into line with the Europe 2020 strategy. The strategy and the related Country-Specific Recommendations (CSR) of the Council are systematically being taken into account when planning investments (6th Cohesion Report, pp. xx, xxvi). Under the study, experts collected and analysed how the sectoral needs and growth potentials to be addressed through the ESI Funds have been identified in Partnership Agreements and through cohesion policy funds in Operational Programmes, looking especially at explicit references to the Europe 2020 strategy and the Country Specific Recommendations for each Member State \u2013 checking the uptake of Article 15(1)(a)(i) of the CPR and its direct impact on programming. 17 Furthermore, we have assessed the use of the flexibilities provided by the regulations to transfer funds between categories of region and from the European Territorial Cooperation goal to the Investment for Growth and Jobs goal. Last but not least, we examined what types of strategic and policy documents \u2013 from European, national and regional level \u2013 were taken as a basis for planning and programming. 3.1.2 What was the strategic background of programming documents? a) Results of the data analysis Distribution of references at the level of thematic objectives shows a quite different picture by types of documents (Figure 5). In the Partnership Agreements, explicit references to Europe 2020 headline targets are the most frequent, while Country-Specific Recommendations constitute one quarter of all the other references and other strategies the other quarter. All Partnership Agreements referred to Europe 2020 headline 17 In order to avoid problems due to differences in interpretation, implicit references (without a clear indication of a connection to an Europe 2020 target or CSR) were not taken into account.

        "32 targets and other types of strategic documents, while most Partnership Agreements referred to Country-Specific Recommendations 18 as well. Overall, at PA level , the number of explicit references to Europe 2020 headline targets and CSRs is substantially higher than the number of explicit references to other strategic documents (from either national or EU level). Altogether, references to CSRs and other strategic documents account each for about \u00bc of all references.In the programmes , Europe 2020 headline targets are much less referenced than in the PAs (though still representing 1/3 of the references), while references to Country-Specific Recommendations account for only 15% of the other references. Almost half of the strategic references in programmes refer to other policies and strategies. Co-operation programmes do not refer to CSRs, explicit references evenly distribute across Europe 2020 and other strategies. Figure 5 - Explicit references to types of strategic documents in programming documents 19 (Share of thematic objectives selected on the basis of explicit references to Europe 2020, CSR or other strategies \u2013 as opposed to the overall number of TOs chosen in programme documents) Behind the heading \"other strategies\", European policies, followed by national and regional strategies are overall evenly mentioned in Partnership Agreements and 18 Portugal made no references to Country-Specific Recommendations in her Partnership Agreement, while Cyprus and Greece had no Country-Specific Recommendation in effect at the time of the adoption of PAs. 19 References in Partnership Agreements and programmes have been counted and consolidated to avoid duplications. This consolidation exercise was done at different levels: - at PA or programme level, all references to a specific type of document (CSRs, Europe 2020 headline targets, other strategies) were only counted as a single reference - at thematic objective level, several references to a specific type of document in relation with one thematic objective were only counted once. However, references to the same type of document made in relation to different thematic objectives were counted as different references. Analyses included in this chapter have been based on this ground. - in the programmes, references were also counted at investment priority level 22.40% 38.30% 21.10% 15.90% 39.80% 53.70% Europe 2020 CSR Other strategies PA Programs ",

First, one can examine, which thematic objectives mentioned in PAs and OPs had been underpinned by direct reference to Europe 2020 headline targets and CSRs. Results are as follows: \uf0b7 At Partnership Agreement level (i.e. covering all ESI Funds), the thematic objectives with the highest frequency of references to Country-Specific Recommendations and Europe 2020 headline targets are education and training, employment and innovation ; and the less frequent ones are information and communication technologies, transport and small- and medium enterprises. At programme level (i.e. focusing on ERDF/CF interventions, including ESF multi-fund OPs), the most frequent references to headline targets and Country-Specific Recommendations apply to innovation and low-carbon economy ; references are less frequent for climate change mitigation and environment. \uf0b7 On average for all thematic objectives in Partnership Agreements , the choice of thematic objectives was underpinned by a direct Europe 2020 or CSR reference in about 40% of the cases, representing also about 40% of the overall allocations. \uf0b7 The same results apply at programme level, where 42,9% of the thematic objective directly (representing 57,7% of the financial allocation) refer to Europe 2020 headline targets and CSRs. \uf0b7 As to co-operation programmes, only one-third of the investments are directly related to Europe 2020 headline targets and Country-Specific 0% 5% 10% 15% 20% 25% Third level education Early school leaving Poverty and social exclusion Employment Renewables Greenhouse Energy efficiency R&D Investment PA Programs ",
        "36 Recommendations, both in terms of the number of selected thematic objectives and in terms of ERDF funding. As to the funds (see Annex 4.2): \uf0b7 For the ERDF, thematic objectives have been underpinned in 43% of the cases by direct references to Europe 2020 headline targets or CSRs, and almost 60% in money terms in the programmes. Most frequent references to European targets correspond in PA to employment and education objectives, while in programmes to innovation and the shift to the low carbon economy. \uf0b7 For the CF, European references are less frequent in programmes and Partnership Agreements than for the ERDF; 28% of the thematic objectives in the programmes (representing 54% of the budget) are supported by explicit EU references. However, the selection of thematic objective 4 relating to the shift towards a low-carbon economy (TO4) was in more than 70% of the cases supported by references to Europe 2020 headline targets and CSRs. \uf0b7 For the ESF, thematic objectives supported by explicit references to EU headline targets and CSRs are overall more frequent than for the ERDF and the CF: they concern half of the cases covering about 2/3 of ESF allocations in ERDF/CF programmes. At Partnership Agreement level education is the thematic objective supported by the most frequent EU references, while in the OP covered by the study education and social inclusion appear at the same level. References to EU targets for TO 11 (institutional and administrative capacity) are twice bigger in the Partnership Agreements than the OPs covered by the study. Finding out the reason for these differences would require though a complementary analysis of OPs solely financed from ESF, which falls, however, out of the scope of the present assignment. \uf0b7 For the EAFRD, patterns are more (in number of cases) or less (in money terms) similar as for the ERDF. The only prominent difference relates to promoting sustainable transport and removing bottlenecks in key network infrastructures (TO7) where all Member States explicitly referred to Europe 2020 headline targets and CSRs. \uf0b7 Partnership Agreements show a similar pattern regarding EMFF (but EMFF is planned to be used only for TO3 \u2013 Support to SMEs, TO4 \u2013 shift to a low carbon economy, TO6 \u2013 environment- and TO 8 - employment). 3.1.4 The use of flexibilities 13 transfers between different categories of regions were registered in the Partnership Agreements, amounting to EUR 3,6 bn (some 1% of the total allocations). These transfers did not reduce the funding originally allocated to the different types of regions considerably (3% on average, respecting the overall limit laid down in Art. 93 CPR). ",

The reason given by the Member States concerned 20 is that they were done where intra-regional differences could not be treated otherwise because of the statistical effects of the more developed capital city in capital areas also comprising of poor and less developed sub-regions 21 . Reverse transfers from transition or more developed regions were also made in other Member States. Figure 10 - Transfers between categories of regions Transfers to...

Details about the reasons have not been provided. 3.1.5 Establishing Priorities \u2013 the Negotiation Process As mentioned during interviews, the co-ordination mechanisms employed during the programming process were, naturally, adjusted to the national legal and institutional context. In general terms, the process has been led by (a varying combination of) political level committees, with the highest level decisions coming from the government; high-level committees between the national government and the regions (in federal states, programming at programme level was led by the regional authorities); inter- ministerial expert and working groups, of the programme authorities as well as line ministries in charge of public investment policies; the Ministry in charge of co-ordinating the use of EU funds; committees comprising of representatives of social partners and civil society; external experts recruited for the task. 20 in all EU-13 Member States (except for one) where the capital region is more developed than the rest of the country 21 E.g. transfer of 3% the Bratislava self-governing region. At the NUTS 2 level, the Bratislava self- governing region is the only of the four regions of Slovakia where GDP per capita exceeds 90 % of the EU average in PPS. The region\u2019s high performance is mainly a result of the presence of the capital city, nevertheless, unlike other metropolitan regions in the EU, the Bratislava self-governing region also includes three further districts which have a 31 % share in the region\u2019s population and an area more than 4 times larger than that of the city of Bratislava. The requirement for a balanced polycentric development needs to be ensured, in particular, in the context of eliminating the disproportionate growth of internal flows and internal migration of people for work and services, which could lead to crisis situations if the spatial growth is unorganised. A systematic approach to managing the development of the Bratislava self-governing region requires that the existing natural centres be respected and promoted and the emerging sub-centres, which must be assigned a role in the urban system, have to be regulated.

        "38 As to the \u201corder\u201d or \u201cdirection\u201d of programming, all three options (top-down; bottom-up and parallel preparation of the Partnership Agreement and programme) were used. Interview responses reflect a relative majority of countries using a parallel programming approach . In two-thirds of the cases, the Partnership Agreement and programmes were prepared in parallel. In one quarter of cases the Partnership Agreement was established first, with programmes following. These two together account for 90% of the programmes. Figure 11 - Survey Q 1.2 Programme was prepared \u2026 The factors perceived as most important catalysts of change in the position of Member States were the regulations, the EC\u2019s negotiating positions and the informal dialogue. All of these were perceived as more important than the national factors.

Even so, in cases of disagreement, the position of the EC was four times more likely to prevail than that of the Member State.

References to Europe 2020 headline targets and to Country-Specific Recommendations are explicit for 40% of thematic objectives (chosen in the Partnership Agreements). References are especially frequent in areas such as strengthening research, technological development and innovation, as well as education and training, and employment in PAs, and low-carbon economy in programmes; they are rare in other areas such as promoting climate change adaptation, risk prevention and management.

ESF will be concentrated on up to five investment priorities . This will ensure a clearer link with the European Employment Strategy and the Integrated Guidelines on Employment, and support the consolidation of outputs and results at European level. At least 20% of the ESF budget will be ring-fenced for supporting social inclusion and combating poverty and discrimination (6th Cohesion Report, p. xxi). In cross-border and transnational co-operation programmes , at least 80% of the ERDF resources under the ETC goal shall be concentrated to a maximum of four of the thematic objectives set out in (CPR, Art. 9). Regions and Member States have to make clear choices about their objectives, and ensure that the amount of resources allocated to each key objective reaches the necessary critical mass . This guarantees a meaningful impact and that investments are made in those areas that have a direct and immediate impact on growth and jobs (6th Cohesion Report, p. xxi). The study has analysed, on the basis of the programming documents, what thematic objectives \u2013 and with what budgets \u2013 and investment priorities Member States had selected. The analysis was differentiated by Funds, and by categories of regions. Furthermore, we have reviewed, by thematic objective, what main results were being sought for each fund, especially in relation to Europe 2020 and the relevant Country- Specific Recommendations. The survey and interviews were used to review the process of establishing priorities as well as the negotiations. 3.2.2 Selection of Thematic Objectives and Investment Priorities Selection of TOs Based on the data of all programmes examined under the study, it can be demonstrated that \uf0b7 Regional policy funds (ERDF, Cohesion Fund) concentrate on thematic objectives 22 \u2012 TO 1 - Strengthening research , technological development and innovation, \u2012 TO 3 - Enhancing the competitiveness of SMEs , \u2012 TO 4 - Supporting the shift towards a low-carbon economy in all sectors (ERDF), 22 For the ERDF, thematic concentration has been laid down by Art.4 ERDF Regulation.

Concentration requirements The concentration requirements were , as far as we could check, overall respected by Member States\u2019 programmes . Also, there were some countries and regions substantially exceeding the floors set in Art. 4(1) of the ERDF Regulation: \uf0b7 The obligation to allocate at least 80% of the total ERDF resources in more developed regions, at least 60% in transition regions and at least 50% in less developed regions, at national level, to two or more of TOs 1-4 was substantially exceeded by the less developed regions of Portugal and Slovenia and the transition regions of Austria and Denmark . \uf0b7 The requirement to concentrate at least 20% of the total ERDF resources in more developed regions, at least 15% in transition regions and at least 12% in less developed regions, at national level, to thematic objective 4 was substantially exceeded in Luxembourg and Romania , in the less developed regions of Bulgaria and the transition regions of France . It is notable that here concentration beyond the regulatory requirement was used for reasons other than those set out in Art. 4 (2) 25 . According to the ETC regulation 26 , at least 80% of the ERDF allocation to each cross- border cooperation and transnational programme shall be concentrated on a maximum of four of the thematic objectives. Out of the 68 Co-operation Programmes that could be checked in this context 27 , 65 respected the floor limit set by the regulation, and the others missed it only by a small margin. Also, there were several programmes 24 cf. Art. 12 (1) of the ERDF Regulation (TO12 in Figure 11) 25 According to Art. 4(2), it is possible for a Member State to fall behind region-specific concentration requirements in a certain type of region in case this is compensated by exceeding the conentration requirements in another type of region. 27 Some of the Co-operation Programmes not yet accepted did not lend themselves for analysis, due to the lack of essential details.

In the interviews, national authorities were asked which thematic objective \u2013 in their view \u2013 would have received more funding , had there not been for the thematic concentration requirements. Answers widely differed across countries, so that ultimately, the question cannot be answered. In the end, every TO received some \u201cvotes\u201d, but none could be singled out as the \u201cfavourite choice\u201d.

Hence, it is possible to establish a direct correspondence between ESF allocations and strategic references in the OPs to the Europe 2020 headline targets and the CSRs. Overall, 65% of the ESF allocations to jointly financed programmes (i.e. multi- fund programmes financed by the ERDF and the CF) were made with an explicit reference to headline targets and Country-Specific Recommendations (see in Annex 4.3). 3.2.3 Main Results sought According to Article 15.1(a)(iii), Partnership Agreements should contain, for each of the selected thematic objectives , a summary of the main results expected for each of the ESI Funds (see also Annex 4.3). In theory at least, each main result should always be mentioned in relation to one thematic objective , and no other. In the majority of the cases, this was confirmed in practice. However, our frequency analysis of the main results referenced in the Partnership Agreements detected several inconsistencies.

The factors influencing negotiations regarding the selection of thematic objectives were, above all, the regulation and the informal dialogue. Partners\u2019 opinion was also taken into account. On this provision, there were relatively many debates, and in those debates, the Commission had a quite strong position (See Annex 4.3). Challenges identified by interviewees: EU Member States already had experience with strategy-based programming and concentration of funds from the previous programming period. Nevertheless, the new approach based on thematic objectives did pose difficulties in some Member States . On the one hand, difficulties of understanding what thematic objective meant what. On the other hand, the thematic objectives were perceived as a limitation to programming, or even as a cause for an artificial fragmentation of funds and measures. The consultation process with partners and stakeholders , in particular, led to a proliferation of needs and expectations, which conflicted with the Commission\u2019s push for concentration. In many cases, national framework documents on development policy and strategy were drafted before the regulation was drafted and approved. This made a reconciliation of positions even more difficult. Quite often, especially in the more developed countries, resources available were insufficient to cover all needs. 3.2.5 Specific Conclusions The main conclusions from the analysis of programme data, the surveys and interviews are as follows: \uf0b7 Overall, a limited number of main results have been identified per thematic objective in Partnership Agreements. However, there were main results expected by the Member States that could not be directly related to thematic objectives, i.e. macro-economic and territorial results. ",
        "50 \uf0b7 As regards the allocation of the ESI Funds to thematic objectives , ERDF concentrates on strengthening research, technological development and innovation and the competitiveness of SMEs, Cohesion Fund mainly invests in supporting the shift towards a low-carbon economy in all sectors and promoting sustainable transport and key network infrastructures. The European Social Fund allocations distribute evenly in jointly financed programmes across thematic objectives related to jobs, education and combating poverty. \uf0b7 Thematic objectives, however, are not defined in an exclusive manner. Almost one third of R&I (TO1) main results could have been programmed to TO2, TO3 and even TO4 thematic objectives. Environmental, climate change and network-related main results (TO4 to TO7) do show limited overlap; and the same applies to employment, inclusion and education (TO8 to TO10). \uf0b7 As regards the investment priorities selected, references in the Operational and Co-operation Programmes concentrate in 30% of the investment priorities that account for 70% of the references. \uf0b7 65% of ESF allocations to jointly financed programmes refer directly to headline targets and Country-Specific Recommendations. \uf0b7 As regards the negotiation process , survey results show that the main factors influencing Member States\u2019 positions regarding thematic concentration were the Regulation and the informal dialogue with the Commission. As to domestic factors, the exchanges with partners were the most important. \uf0b7 Thematic concentration received more attention during programming, and was also more controversial than other new provisions. The Commission seems to have held a strong position in these parts of the negotiation. \uf0b7 Interview partners from Member States said that the provisions on thematic objectives did pose some difficulty , even though Member States already had experience with strategic programming. The reconciliation of Member States\u2019 positions \u2013 which were often based on strategy documents drafted before the new regulations \u2013 with the Thematic Objective structure was a challenge in some Member States.

In the 2014-2020 programming period, priority axes of Operational Programmes concern, as a general rule , one Fund and, for the Structural Funds (ERDF, ESF) one category of region . Furthermore, they correspond to one thematic objective, comprising one or more of the investment priorities of that thematic objective, in accordance with the Fund-specific rules (CPR, p. 96.1). In duly justified cases, this \u201cnormal\u201d setup can be adjusted to specific intervention needs under specific arrangements ( combination of more than one category of region, of more than one Fund and/or more than one thematic objective). In ETC programmes, \"normal\" priority axes shall correspond to one thematic objective but may be adjusted, in duly justified cases, to cover more than one Thematic Objective. (ETC Regulation, p. 8.1) Priority axes may also represent groups of operations dedicated solely to financial instruments , community-led local developments and, in the case of programmes co-funded by ESF, social innovation and trans-nationality . For such priorities the maximum co-financing rate for a priority axis may be increased. Special rules apply also to priority axes applying the Youth Employment Initiative (YEI) and to those dedicated to Sustainable Urban Development (SUD). Based on the programmes, the study has analysed , which types of priority axes are used in the programmes, and to what extent complex priorities have been used. Furthermore, it was assessed, to which extent priority axes were dedicated to financial instruments, community-led local developments, social innovation and trans-nationality. In parallel, the survey and interviews examined, how these Member States\u2019 choices regarding the structure of priorities had been established, and negotiated with the Commission. ",
        "52 3.3.2 The use of simple vs. combination priority axes In the 278 operational and co-operation programmes which had been analysed under this chapter (210 OP and 68 ETC programmes) 32 , there are 1543 priority axes, ranging from 1 to 14 priority axes per programme. The average is around 5,5 priority axes per programme . ESF-co-financed programmes have an average just below 8. (From a different angle: programmes with more priority axes tend to use also the ESF). Co- operation programmes usually have less priority axes, with an average below 4. As mentioned above, Art. 96.1 of the CPR sets out that priority axes should as a general rule cover one Fund, one category of region and one thematic objective. However, derogations are foreseen and could lead to the combination of several Funds, several categories of region, several thematic objectives or all combinations as the same time under one priority axis. \uf0b7 Out of the 1283 priority axes of 210 Investment for growth and jobs programmes, 29% (included in 159 programmes and accounting for 43% of Cohesion policy funds , EUR 117,4 bn) have a complex structure in the meaning of the CPR Art. 96.1. 60% of the combined axes (accounting for 42% of the funds in combined axes) are multiobjective; 16% (20%) are multifund; and 33% (50%) are multiregion priority axes 33 . \uf0b7 Similar rules also apply for ETC programmes (Art. 8.1 ETC Regulation). Among the 68 co-operation programmes that could be analysed, there are only 11% combination priority axes (included in 19 co-operation programmes) with 15% of European Regional Development Fund funding dedicated to the European Territorial Cooperation goal. 32 Technical assistance programmes (2014FR16M2TA001, 2014PL16CFTA001, 2014SK16RFTA001, 2014GR16M3TA001, 2014PT16RFTA001, 2014RO16RFTA001, 2014CZ16CFTA001) and priorities have been excluded from the analysis. Some programmes not yet adopted at the cut-off date of the report (2014TC16M4TN002, 2014TC16RFCB013, 2014TC16RFCB027, 2014TC16RFCB040, 2014TC16RFCB051, 2014TC16RFPC001, 2014TC16RFTN010) have not presented their programming details regarding the composition of the priority axes. 33 Percentages of options add up to more than 100% because of axes combining options.

        "54 Overall, half of the ERDF allocated to Investment for Growth and Jobs and 21% of the Cohesion Fund is disbursed in combined priority axes of operational programmes , while 41% of ESF funding (in programmes jointly financed with ERDF) is also dealt with through combined axes. There are no specific patterns related to the spatial or programming structure relevant to the choice of using combined axis. However, combined priority axes tend to have significantly larger 35 funding than simple ones . Thematic objectives contributing most to the financing of complex priority axes are: \uf0b7 TO 4 - Supporting the shift towards a low-carbon economy in all sectors (15%) \uf0b7 TO 6 - Protecting the environment and promoting resource efficiency and (27%) \uf0b7 TO 3 - Enhancing the competitiveness of SMEs (13%) These three thematic objectives account for more than half of the allocations in complex priority axes. (Figure 20) Figure 20 \u2013 Thematic objectives contributed to in complex priorities 36 35 To see if combined priority axes of the IGJ goal are significantly bigger than simple priority axes, the null hypothesis that both combined and simple priority axes have a distribution of the same mean (average) was tested. The (one-sided) Wilcoxon\u2013Matt-Whitney test showed that the difference in the allocations to combined vs. simple priority axes is too high on any level of significance for the null hypothesis to be valid. Thus, the alternative hypothesis that combined priority axes have a higher mean has to be accepted. 36 Including both IfGJ and ETC goals. \u201cTO12\u201d is a shorthand notation for special allocations to outermost regions (Article 12 of the ERDF Regulation) 37 A combined priority axis might have more than one type of justification.

Justifications were as shown on Figure 21. Figure 21 - Justifications of complex priority axes 37 Explaining the table: \uf0b7 \u201cIntegrated projects\u201d are complex interventions combining several types of operations or inter-related actions to achieve the maximum result. \u201c Uni- versal projects\u201d (e.g. national measures) cover several types of regions. If an OP uses combination axes for such integrated and universal projects, it is likely that these have already been identified, and the programming of the OP follows the logic of an already defined (or at least, developing) project portfolio. This is the most frequent case. \uf0b7 A \u201c holistic approach to project selection\u201d \u2013 such as place-based approaches (like CLLD) \u2013 allow for several types of operations to be selected during implementation. In these \u2013 also frequent \u2013 cases, combination axes are introduced without having decided about concrete projects, in a policy-driven manner. The (compulsory) \u201c use of matching funds\u201d (e.g. on-site training for investments) and \u201c one-stop-shop approach are rather based on implementation considerations. The justification given for programming multiobjective axes (that accounts for the majority of the combinations) shows no major differences across funds. 37 A combined priority axis might have more than one type of justification. E.g. having integrated projects does not exclude a holistic approach. 0 50 100 150 200 250 300 Integrated projects Holistic approach Universal projects Place-based policies Common implementation bodies Use of matching funds One-stop-shop Social innovation Socio-economic similarities between sub-regions Disproportionate implementing costs Smart developement of cross border region ",

This provision had created an incentive to programme additional, dedicated priority axes. \uf0b7 10 priority axes of seven Operational Programmes and one Co- operation Programme will be implemented solely through financial instruments . The sum of the cohesion policy funds allocated to these six priority axes amounts to EUR 3,4 bn, i.e. 17% of all ESI funds disbursed via financial instruments (see Chapter 3.5). Eleven priority axes 38 of four Operational and one Co-operation Programmes will be implemented solely through financial instruments set up at Union level, with the amount of EUR 1 bn. \uf0b7 19 priority axes of nine Operational Programmes and three Co- Operation Programmes will be implemented solely through community- led local development . The sum of cohesion policy funds allocated to these priority axes amount to EUR 1,2 bn (75% of the resources allocated to CLLD \u2013 see section 3.9.1.1). Furthermore, Art. 120 (3) determines that \u201cThe maximum co-financing rate [\u2026] shall be increased for each priority axis [\u2026] where a priority axis is dedicated to social innovation or to transnational cooperation , or a combination of both\u201d. \uf0b7 2 priority axes of two Operational Programmes are dedicated to social innovation and trans-nationality .

In the others, it was the structure of thematic objectives and the regulatory concentration requirements together that defined \u2013 at least in broad terms \u2013 the programmes and their structure. About half of the Member States wanted priority axes combining several TOs. However, Commission services \u2013 although to differing extents \u2013 were rather against complex axes. One-third of the respondents stated that this led to a fragmentation of programme structure. One alternative to using multi-thematic axes \u2013 if the objective is to use different funds or thematic objectives together \u2013 would have been the use of integrated territorial instruments . In our survey, however, Member States authorities indicated that they in fact did not see territorial instruments as an alternative to combination axes \u2013 not even in cases where the authorities had otherwise considered ITIs, CLLDs and Joint Action Plans . Figure 23 - Survey Q 3.2 When considering the use of complex priorities, have the options of using ITIs, CLLDs, JAPs been considered? Member States\u2019 positions during the negotiations on programming \u2013 with respect to the definition of main results \u2013 were influenced most by the new regulatory framework and the informal dialogue with the Commission. Exchanges with the Commission \u2013 with the exception of the EC\u2019s initial negotiating position \u2013 were considered by the responding MAs as more important than any national factors. 64.44% 20.00% 15.56% 0 Not 1 Considered and adopted 2 Considered and abandoned ",
        "58 Figure 24 - Factors influencing negotiations \u2013 The main results sought for each ESI Fund As compared to similar data on other provisions, the definition of priority axes was the 2 nd most debated from all provisions, as shown in Figure 25. In almost half of the cases, the initial negotiation positions changed, with both the Member States and the European Commission apparently ready to compromise. Figure 25 - Impact of exchanges with the Commission - use of combination axes 3.3.5 Specific Conclusions The key conclusions from this provision can be summarised as follows: \uf0b7 In the Operational Programmes, the number of priority axes averages around 5,5 per programme. ESF-co-financed programmes have an average just below 8. (From a different angle: programmes with more priority axes tend to use also the ESF). Co-operation programmes usually have less priority axes, with an average below 4. \uf0b7 Under Investment for Growth and Jobs programmes, combined axes represent 29% of the overall number of priority axes. Under ETC, the same ratio is only 11%.

Multi-thematic priority axes represent 17% of all axes and encompass 18% of the programme allocations covered by the study. \uf0b7 Despite the special incentives to create priority axes dedicated to certain delivery mechanisms, the number of dedicated axes is small . 10 priority axes will be implemented solely through financial instruments, 2 priority axes are dedicated to social innovation and trans-nationality. The only notable exception are the 13 priority axes implemented solely through community-led local development , amounting to 65% of the overall Cohesion policy resources allocated to CLLD (in the programmes analysed by the study). \uf0b7 The general position of the European Commission was rather negative vis-\u00e0-vis the use of multi-thematic priority axes. The issue was intensively discussed during the negotiations. Respondents stated that this led to a fragmentation of programme structure, while the Commission considered that the use of these axes undermined result orientation. The average size (budget) of simple axes is significantly smaller than those of combination axes. The alternative of using territorial instruments was rarely considered by Member States . ",
        "60 3.4 R ESULT O RIENTATION 3.4.1 Background The Conceptual framework and provisions related to intervention logic (actions, results, selection principles) have long been part of Cohesion policy (at least since the Maastricht Treaty). Based on this, programmes have (since then) been required to spell out their strategy (objectives and instruments). Nevertheless, there were major differences among programme documents as to how they have complied with these requirements, and to what extent they provided clear and unambiguous targets and indicators. (Casavola, 2009, page: 7). The focus on results and delivering measureable added value was one of the main trends of the reform debate preceding reform of cohesion policy regulations for 2014- 2020. Accordingly, the new provisions put a lot of emphasis on making specific objectives, as well as results and impacts explicit, following a standardised, uniform presentation method , with clear baselines and targets to measure progress (6th Cohesion Report, p. xxii). The analysis of programme documents 39 has focused on assessing the way in which Member States have defined specific objectives linked to investment priorities for each thematic objective chosen and results (i.e. changes) sought in view of the specific objective that Member States seek to achieve with Union support. Furthermore, it was examined how actions to be supported by the ERDF, the CF and the ESF (in multi-fund programmes) were presented, and what principles would guide the selection of operations. Interviews and the survey were used to explore how Member States have shifted the emphasis of programming towards results, and whether they encountered challenges in defining specific objectives and result indicators. 39 Out of the 292 programmes covered by the study, 18 programmes could not be covered by the analysis of results, specific objectives, actions and selection principles. Technical assistance programmes (2014FR16M2TA001, 2014PL16CFTA001, 2014SK16RFTA001, 2014GR16M3TA001, 2014PT16RFTA001, 2014RO16RFTA001, 2014CZ16CFTA001) and priorities have been excluded from the analysis. Some programmes not yet adopted at the cut-off date of the report (2014TC16M4TN002, 2014TC16RFCB013, 2014TC16RFCB027, 2014TC16RFCB040, 2014TC16RFCB051, 2014TC16RFPC001, 2014TC16RFTN010) have not presented their programming details regarding the selection of results, specific objectives, actions and selection principles to cut-off date. The same refers to SME Initiative programmes (2014ES16RFSM001, 2014MT16RFSM001, 2015BG16RFSM001). The 207 operational and 67 co-operation programmes contained 1505 non-technical assistance priority axes. ",

In line with the Regulation, actions were defined only in terms of investment priorities.Thus, unfortunately, a 1 to 1 correspondence between specific objectives and types of actions could not be reconstructed from the programming documents. This limited the scope of our analysis of the intervention logic. Members of the expert team implementing the research were asked to score the quality of the definition of actions. The picture was mixed: 32% of the actions have been assessed as clear and precise, but 50% were considered as too broad and 17% ambiguous or non-existent . The assessment of actions by thematic objectives is summarised in Figure 29 below. Problems with the quality of the definition of actions were not limited to any specific thematic objective, each TO (except for TO11, development of public administration) lacked precision and specificity in defining actions to some extent. Thus, problems in defining the action are not rooted in the nature of the interventions themselves, they rather relate to other causes. One hypothesis is that loose action definition could have been done to preserve some degree of freedom in implementation.

As to the \u201cMember State\u201d factors, partners\u2019 opinions were considered overwhelmingly more during the definition of actions . This could reflect that the focus of the dialogue with partners was rather \u201cdown- to-earth\u201d, focussing on what EU funds could actually be used for. Conversely, the dialogue with the EC apparently focused on the definition of objectives and results , i.e. the higher levels of the intervention logic. As to the particular challenges related to this new provision, almost 40% of managing authorities indicated in the survey problems related to the definition of result indicators. 25% reported difficulties with understanding the related methodologies (concepts). Compared to that, difficulties to forge an agreement on objectives, actions, or selection principles were mentioned much less frequently (7-12%). Specific challenges faced by programmers in defining specific objectives and result indicators were also addressed by the interviews with Member States authorities. Their answers indicated a general problem of changing action-based approaches to a result- based one, while this problem manifested itself in the form of a search for specific result indicators monitoring the change. This conceptual problem interacted with two-level programming in some Member States and \u2013 as they perceived \u2013 the not fully harmonized approach of country desks of different Commission services. 3.4.5 Specific Conclusions The main conclusions from the analysis of programme data, the surveys and interviews are as follows: \uf0b7 Overall, programmes used a broad range (several hundred) of types of specific objectives, results, actions and selection principles . However, they used these types rather concentrated , as about one quarter of them account for the majority of the references. \uf0b7 Their definitions were rather consistent , both with the breakdown of TOs and IPs (with only a few \u201cmisplaced\u201d references) and the relevant methodologies (with very few irrelevant/faulty definitions). \uf0b7 2/3 of the definitions of actions and 80% of the definitions of selection criteria were assessed as problematic : considered either as too broad or ambiguous or non-existent. Such problems were not limited to any specific thematic objective, each TO (except for TO11, development of public administration) lacked precision and specificity in defining actions to some extent. Thus, problems in defining the action are not rooted in the nature of the interventions themselves, they rather relate to other causes. One hypothesis is that loose action definition could have been done to preserve some degree of freedom in implementation. \uf0b7 Comparing the quality of actions and guiding principles of selecting actions , the conclusion is that clear and precise definitions account for one third of references to actions and one quarter of guiding principles; but half of the definitions are too broad. \uf0b7 As feedback from managing authorities indicates: the choice of objectives, actions and result indicators were at the heart of the negotiations during the planning process. There were major debates, and the positions ",
        "72 of Member States have changed substantially in more than two thirds of the cases. And, while finding a compromise solution was the most frequent solution, clearly it seems to be the Commission that managed to convince the Member State to modify their position, rather than the other way around. \uf0b7 Overall, according to interviews, the transition from action-based programming to a result-based one seems to have proved difficult for Member States. The identification of result indicators was the major challenge in establishing the intervention logic, as almost 40% of the MAs indicated. ",

Nevertheless, financial instruments have been used for delivering investments for Structural Funds since the 1994-1999 programming period. Their relative importance has increased during the programming period 2007-2013 and they now represent around 5% of total European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) resources 41 . Financial instruments are expected to play an even stronger role in cohesion policy in the 2014-2020 programming period. (Financial instruments factsheet, p. 2). The new regulatory framework contains substantially more detailed provisions regarding financial instruments, aimed at increasing their use and widening their scope of application. Key changes relating to use of financial instruments under the ERDF and ESF for 2014-2020 are summarised in the table below. Figure 36 \u2013 Financial instruments 2007-2013 vs. 2014-2020 2007-2013 2014-2020 Scope Support for enterprises, urban develop- ment, energy efficiency and renewable energies in building sector.

",
        "74 This part of the analysis focussed on the ex-ante evaluations of programmes, examining the justifications for using financial instruments. The survey and interviews examined the expectations from Member States/regions towards using financial instruments, as well as why the majority of Member States did not take up the SME initiative, i.e. the financial instrument for the support of small and medium-sized enterprises. 3.5.2 The Use of Financial Instruments Most Member States intend to use financial instruments (with the exception of four Member States). Five Member States plan to deploy around or over 15% of their allocations through financial instruments. FIs are mentioned in 141 operational programmes 42 . The total EU funding to be dedicated to these instruments reaches EUR 20.887 billion. By the cut-off date of end July 2015, three Member States 43 had joined the SME Initiative with the amount of EUR 1 bn, and two regional and two sectoral operational programmes have priority axes dedicated solely to financial instruments. More than half of cohesion policy funding through financial instruments will be extended through loans and equivalent instruments , while one quarter will be used to generate venture and equity capital. Figure 37 - Support through financial instruments Financial instruments will account for 9,5% of the ERDF, 2,7% of the Cohesion Fund and 1,3% of the ESF allocations.

Correlation analyses have shown that multi- objective programmes use interest rate subsidy, guarantee fee subsidy, technical support or equivalent measures relatively more frequently, while multi-regional programmes use them more rarely than other types of programmes. Financial instruments are going to be used for at least 9 thematic objectives 44 . In any case, the use of financial instruments is substantially more widespread (in terms of policy areas covered) than in the previous period. 3.5.3 Justifications and expectations towards using financial instruments The justification for using financial instruments is scattered and often missing . It was not a requirement towards the programmers to give such a justification in the programme document. Support of financial instruments shall be based on specific ex ante assessments (which have to establish evidence of market failures or suboptimal investment situations, and the estimated level and scope of public investment needs, including types of financial instruments to be supported). Such ex ante assessments may be completed later on, during the course of programme implementation. Although it was a general requirement to ex ante evaluators to appraise the rationale for the form of support proposed in the programme (CPR, Article 55(3)(h)), it is only 80 programmes \u2013 58% of those planning to use FI \u2013 where either the ex ante evaluations or the programme document offer a justification for their use. These are summarised in the table below.

Comments made by the Commission regarding the justification for using FI reflect a different approach . As the EC sees it, a lack of ample assistance for grants should not be seen as a valid argument for the use of FI, as it is the MA that decides how funding is 44 For TO 5 and TO 11, there is no conclusive information. There are financial instruments planned contributing to multi-thematic priority axes, where TO 5 and TO 11 are also covered. However, programmes do not specify whether the FI will also contribute to these two thematic objectives. ",

Furthermore, the financing of non-profitable projects is in conflict with Art. 37 CPR. 45 Member States\u2019 expectations (collected in response to a specific survey question) towards the use of financial instruments distribute rather evenly between the intentions of increasing the number of assisted projects, improving financial market conditions indirectly widening financing possibilities and absorption (in the sense that more funds can be quickly disbursed). One quarter of the respondents, however, have diverse expectations. Figure 39 - Survey Q 5.1 - What are expectations to use financial instruments? 46 It is interesting to contrast the justification given by the programmers and the ex- ante evaluators as to why they plan to use financial instruments with the goals they want to obtain. As statistical analysis revealed, there is a definite correspondence between the two: \uf0b7 Those viewing financial instruments as extra assistance to top-up existing grant schemes aim at quick absorption . \uf0b7 Those choosing them as closer-to-market means \u2013 stating that even profitable projects have financing needs uncovered on the market \u2013 aim at a growing number of projects getting assistance, without aiming at a general decrease of uncovered financing needs. \uf0b7 Still others wish to employ financial instruments, acting also in line with recommendations by international institutions , in order to provide affordable funds to projects which would otherwise be not profitable under prevailing market conditions. During the negotiations , Member States\u2019 positions regarding the use (or non-use) of financial instruments were shaped, above all, through the informal dialogue , and EC formal comments on the one hand, and the national legal and institutional context, as 45 \u201c\u2026Financial instruments shall be implemented to support investments which are expected to be financially viable and do not give rise to sufficient funding from market sources.\u201d (CPR, Article 37(1)) 46 \u201eNumber of debtors grows\u201d = the number of enterprises using (benefitting from) financial instruments grows. 29.79% 24.47% 17.02% 2.13% 26.60% Project financing increases Uncovered financing needs decrease Assistance quickly deployed Number of debtors grows Other answers ",

The text of the regulations \u2013 substantially extended as regards financial instruments \u2013 was also important. As regards the impact of exchanges with the Commission, the issue of financial instruments was slightly more controversial than average . In cases where there was debate, the outcome seems to reflect a middle way between the national and EC positions. (The Commission\u2019s line was to encourage the use of financial instruments). Figure 40 \u2013 Impact of exchanges with EC on the use of financial instruments The low uptake of the SME Initiative was discussed in interviews with both Member State representatives and focus groups with the Commission. Many Member States did not decide to join the SME Initiative because similar financial instruments already existed on the national market; or because the regulatory initiative came too late , when decisions about the distribution of ESIF funding \u2013 e.g. the decentralisation of funding to regions \u2013 was already decided. Member States considered the instrument too complicated and expensive to manage, or available funding was considered too small to justify the costs and the rules were perceived as unclear. Some Member States perceived the EIB as less flexible in negotiations than a domestic development bank and considered that governments would have a stronger negotiating position in case of the latter. There were fears that using the EIB would preclude the strengthening of national expertise and capacity and create unwanted dependence on an external player . There was also scepticism about the initiatives\u2019 potential to exert a discernible influence on the access to finance to SMEs, as it was expected to be relatively expensive, and limited in size . The countries that in the end did or may adopt the instrument may have decided in favour of the initiative because their earlier domestic attempts did not bring sufficient results. 3.5.4 Specific Conclusions The regulatory provisions regarding the use of financial instruments were substantially extended for the period 2014-2020, with the intention of providing better, more detailed guidance to Member States. The Commission\u2019s intention was to support the spread of FIs in different policy areas. 12% 30% 12% 46% The dialogue led the Commission to accept the MS\u2019s position The dialogue led to a compromise solution The dialogue led to a significant change in MS position There was no major difference in opinion ",
        "78 As programme data show (based on OPs at the time of their adoption or at the other cut- off date of end July 2015 for the ones not yet adopted by then), financial instruments are indeed planned to be used under at least 9 thematic objectives , and possibly all eleven. With the exception of Cyprus, Denmark, Ireland and Luxembourg, all Member States stated their intention to implement such schemes. The Netherlands, Portugal, Slovenia, Sweden and the United Kingdom plan to use around or over 15% of their ERDF allocations within the objective for investments for growth and employment through financial instruments. At the same time (as of end July 2015), the SME initiative was only taken up by three Member States \u2013 Bulgaria, Malta and Spain. ETC programmes do not plan to use FIs. Judged by the relevant programmes and ex-ante evaluations, the principal motivation of Member States to employ financial instruments was to increase available funding on the market , and to complement the funds available for grants, which are inherently limited. Speeding up the deployment of EU assistance, and increasing the number of enterprises (or other project owners) benefitting from refundable assistance, were also well represented among the motivations of authorities planning with FIs. The apparent reluctance of Member States to take up the SME initiative could be explained with several arguments. Several Member States considered that their own financial sectors were well capable of providing similar financial products without EIB assistance. Others considered the scheme too small and too expensive. The wish to avoid dependence on a foreign bank was also cited among the reasons for abstaining. Overall, financial instruments are planned to take up around EUR 20,887 billion, or 7,2% of the budget of the programmes under examination. More than half of that amount will be dedicated to loans , with venture and equity financing taking up 22%, and guarantees 16,9%. One expectation \u2013 namely that the use of financial instruments would spread well beyond the remit of enterprise support , definitely seems to be coming true . FIs should operate at least under nine, possibly all eleven thematic objectives. ",

Experience and benchmark data have been accumulated for decades and related problems \u2013 especially those related to project preparation and appraisal \u2013 are known to be a critical area of responsibility for public agencies (RGL Forensys, Faber Maunsell/Aecom and Frontier Economics, 2009, p. 70). Regulations regarding major projects have regularly been adjusted, and several changes to the earlier provisions were introduced for the 2014-2020 programming period as well, including: \uf0b7 streamlined approval procedure and stronger role of independent experts (such as JASPERS); \uf0b7 simplified approval for phased projects under certain conditions (CPR, p. 103), i.e. phasing; \uf0b7 higher thresholds and based on total eligible cost after taking account of Article 61; \uf0b7 stronger focus on timely realisation of major projects: all Commission decisions are conditional; stricter check of administrative capacity of beneficiaries; no N+3 deductions due to major projects; \uf0b7 certification of expenditure possible only when the project is submitted to the Commission; \uf0b7 compulsory list of major projects in the operational programmes, and better linking them to intervention logic; \uf0b7 no financing of completed projects (this is a horizontal principle but applies to major projects as well). For this study, we have examined which Member States are planning to use major projects, under what funds , types of programmes , thematic objectives and investment priorities . We also looked at the use of phasing . The issue of major projects was included neither in the survey nor in the interviews questionnaires. 3.6.2 The use of major projects Altogether, 289 major projects were planned in 202 investment priorities selected in 54 programmes (one sixth of the programmes) at the time of their adoption (or at the cut- off date of 31 July 2015 for the programmes not yet adopted by then). 83% of the major projects are programmed in nine Member States 47 . 47 Croatia, Czech Republic, France, Greece, Hungary, Italy, Poland, Romania, Slovakia ",
        "80 Figure 41 - Planned use of major projects by country Major projects are planned across all thematic objectives \u2013 except TO 8 (employment). Multi-objective and ESF programmes (practically) do not use major projects. Other patterns (clusters) across Member States, or types of programmes were not identified. As to the IPs level, the use of major projects is fairly concentrated on one or two investment priorities for each thematic objective, with the notable exception of network areas (transport and energy) where more investment priorities are tackled. Thematic objective 07, Promoting sustainable transport and removing bottlenecks in key network infrastructures, relies heavily on major projects. Major projects are also frequently (more than 10 projects) used in the following investment priorities: \u25cf Enhancing research and innovation (R&I) infrastructure and capacities to develop R&I excellence, and promoting centres of competence, in particular those of European interest (1a), \u25cf Promoting low-carbon strategies for all types of territories, in particular for urban areas, including the promotion of sustainable multimodal urban mobility and mitigation-relevant adaptation measures (4e), \u25cf Investing in the waste sector (6i) and the water sector (6ii) to meet the requirements of the Union's environmental acquis and to address needs, identified by the Member States, for investment that goes beyond those requirements, and \u25cf Investing in health and social infrastructure which contributes to national, regional and local development, reducing inequalities in terms of health status, promoting social inclusion through improved access to social, cultural and recreational services and the transition from institutional to community-based services (9a). 2 2 4 4 6 6 10 10 14 18 20 20 24 28 28 28 30 42 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 45 Latvia Malta Ireland Lithuania Slovenia United Kingdom Bulgaria Spain Portugal Czech Republic Croatia Slovakia Greece France Italy Romania Hungary Poland ",

Where a priority axis concerns more than one category of regions, more than one Fund and/or combines investment priorities from different thematic objectives, the Commission decision, where necessary, fixes the co-financing rate by category of region, Fund and thematic objective \u2013 respecting the provisions of the regulations. The co-financing rate from the Funds to a priority axis may be modulated to take account of: \uf0b7 the importance of the priority axis for the delivery of the Europe 2020 strategy, having regard to the specific gaps to be addressed; \uf0b7 the protection and improvement of the environment, principally through the application of the precautionary principle, the principle of preventive action and the polluter pays principle; \uf0b7 the rate of mobilisation of private financing; \uf0b7 the coverage of areas with severe and permanent natural or demographic handicaps. While the provisions are essentially similar to those in the previous programming periods, the application of the provisions is different due to changes in the programming context of financial planning: \uf0b7 Maximum co-financing rates are defined in a new programming context: rates set by funds and types of regions (CPR, p. 120(3)) are increased for priority axes dedicated to CLLDs, financial instruments, social innovation or to transnational cooperation; or implementing YEI. \uf0b7 Part of the modulation \u2013 i.e. modulation by thematic objectives \u2013 is defined in the programming phase. \uf0b7 Focusing more on results \u2013 as opposed to spending \u2013 means that a higher co-financing rate reflects more European added value, rather than less national funding (and importance). Analysing the programmes, we have examined, how co-financing rates vary over Member States, Funds and types of programmes, in relation to applicable maximum rates. The study also sought to identify where modulation was to be applied, and with what justifications and methods. The issue of co-financing rates was included neither in the survey nor in the interviews questionnaires. 3.7.2 Modulation and justification Co-financing rates \u2013 as calculated on the priority axis and fund level \u2013 do show variations over Member States, funds and types of programmes. (See table below Figure 44). Median co-financing rates for ERDF, ESF and CF are 75%, 80% and 85% (the applicable maximum co-financing rates) respectively. ",
        "84 There is substantial variation in priority axes financed by ERDF and ESF. This variation of ERDF co-financing is mainly due to differences in co-financing between different types of regions. In more developed and transition regions , as well as in EU-15 Member States, lower-than-average co-financing rates are more frequent 48 . The opposite is true for less developed regions and EU-13: here, priorities with low co-financing rates comparatively are rare. 49 The same divide could be observed regarding variance (i.e. degree of dispersion of the sample): EU-13 and less developed regions show small variance in co-financing rates, the opposite is true in more developed and transition regions and in EU-15 Member States. There are, however, extreme ly high and low co-financing rates as well. The 0% co- financing rate of the Baltic Sea ENI finance and the 100% percent rate of a French regional programme are clearly extremities, but 18-30% rates characterize 25 priority axes in ten programmes, while 17 priority axes in another dozen programmes feature 90% and higher rates. It seems that maximum applicable rates are generally used in the Cohesion Fund, EU-13 Member States and less developed regions. Priority axes of co-operation programmes. The EU-15 and more developed regions tend to differ much more.

        "86 3.8 T ERRITORIAL C HALLENGES IN P ROGRAMMING 3.8.1 Background Territorial cohesion has been added to the goals of economic and social cohesion by the TFEU, and it is necessary to address the role of cities, functional geographies and sub-regional areas facing specific geographical or demographic problems. Member States and regions increasingly face challenges that relate to the impact of globalisation, environmental and energy concerns, population ageing and demographic shifts, technological transformation and innovation demands, and social inequality. Due to the complex and interrelated nature of such challenges, the solutions supported by the ESI Funds should be of an integrated nature, multi- sectoral and multi-dimensional. The overall approach to promoting smart, sustainable and inclusive growth will therefore have to reflect the role of cities, rural areas, fisheries and coastal areas, areas facing specific geographical or demographic handicaps . It will also have to take account of the specific challenges of the outermost regions, the northernmost regions with a very low population density and of island, cross- border or mountain regions , as explicitly recognized by the Lisbon Treaty. Territorial cohesion also means addressing urban-rural linkages , in terms of access to affordable, quality infrastructures and services, and problems in regions with a high concentration of socially marginalised communities. \u201cAn integrated approach to sustainable urban and territorial development has been on the agenda of EU Regional Policy for over two decades. The European Pilot Projects, the URBAN I and II Community Initiatives and the URBACT programme are examples of the importance of integrated urban and territorial development at the EU level. These initiatives came into existence because the complexity of interlinked challenges (unemployment, transport, water, energy etc.) required a shift from sectorial, isolated interventions, to cross-sectorial, integrated approaches to economic and social development. This was also confirmed by the work undertaken in the context of the intergovernmental process (e.g. Leipzig Charter 2007, Toledo Declaration 2010, and Territorial Agenda 2011). All this work manifested in the 2014-2020 programming period , in the development of a clearer narrative accompanied by dedicated instruments to support more integrated investments.\u201d The analysis under this study focused on: \uf0b7 the types of territory being considered by Member States in the context of a territorial approach, \uf0b7 the types of external challenges (threats) to sustainable socio-economic development identified, \uf0b7 the territorial needs (weaknesses or internal characteristics) to be addressed in an integrated manner, \uf0b7 the methods for the coordination (integration) of instruments, and finally \uf0b7 the difficulties encountered in identifying territorial challenges and applying them in programmes.

According to the data, Member States plan to apply integrated approaches above all in an urban context (mentioned in more than 70% of the PAs and around 45% of the programmes). This may be partly explained by the fact that sustainable urban development is compulsory for all Member States. Next in line are rural areas, which also appear in 70% of the PAs (and to a less extent in programmes \u2013 around 33%), and then territories characterised by urban-rural linkages (in the programmes) and by geographical and demographic problems (in the PAs). The figures at PA vs. programme level show the same overall trends, but there are some divergences. Overall, programme-level figures are lower, since on the one hand that PAs are wider in their scope (covering all ESI Funds), and OP/ETC programmes financed by the ERDF/CF focus on a narrower set of issues, and that analyses are deeper in PAs than in the programmes, on the other. Differences in the relative frequency of types of territories analysed in PA vs. programmes show that the share of fisheries and coastal regions and of rural areas is relatively lower at programme level. (The assignment only targets cohesion policy programmes and these types of territories rely considerably on the EARDF and the EMFF.) Conversely, cross-border areas are more often referred to in (mainly ETC) programmes than in the PAs.

Outermost regions paid relatively high attention to the effects of globalisation, the recent crisis, and demographic changes in their programmes. 3.8.4 Territorial development needs As data show (Figure 50), the main territorial needs that Member States have singled out for an integrated approach include economic competitiveness and growth (SMEs, employment, R&D, ICT), sustainability (environment, climate, CO2) and social inclusion .

Further frequently used arrangements are the co-ordination body in the meaning of Art. 123 (8), as well as co-ordination committees at strategic-political and technical levels. At the other end of the scale, it is noteworthy that fund co- ordination during project selection (e.g. through selection criteria rewarding synergies ) is relatively rare ly applied.

As shown in Figure 57, these are linked especially to ensuring consistency between territorial challenges identified . Matching territorial challenges with the sectoral approach of the policies represents another challenge. Figure 57 - Survey Q 8.1 Difficulties in identifying territorial challenges (% of MAs having responded) According to the MAs that responded, programmes with purely sectoral approach are rather rare. The vast majority (90%) of programmes reflects territorial approach. 60% has a predominantly territorial approach, while one third integrates territorial aspects into sectoral policies.

The programme mainly follows a sectoral logic with little consideration for regional and local needs, challenges and assets. ",
        "98 MAs also provided information regarding the preparation of the territorial analysis. As stated by the MAs, territorial analyses were performed starting from the local level, either on the basis of some national level guidance, or according to a general bottom-up approach. These two ways cover more than 70% of cases. According to the MAs having responded, it was in less than 10% of all OPs that territorial analyses were not performed. Figure 59 \u2013 Survey Q 8.3 Ways to perform specific territorial analyses (% of the answers of MAs having responded) As regards territorial challenges, interviews were also passed among Managing Authorities. According to more than half of the interviewees there was no change in the approach to programming. Reasons for not using the new tools are generally the following: they are felt to be too complicated; not well explained by the EC; too strict and regulated programming and implementing environment; give too much power and responsibility to actors having no experience in the management of Funds; Member States use their national territorial approach, used in the previous periods; prefer using priority axes with several TOs; not (really) adequate to the (ETC) programme. Those Member States who do use the new instruments , do so because: of former, positive (national) experience with such instruments; they achieve a real devolution of implementation functions to institutionalised forms of partnerships; they better suit specific territorial situations. Practices for the promotion of territorial approach in programming and implementation most mentioned by interviewees are: the existence of a characteristic national regional development policy/strategy ; the institutional involvement of regional actors in programming; and specific methods during the implementation phase: application of selection criteria giving priority to projects contributing to ITI programs; necessity to justify a project by diagnosis of the local situation and analysis of territorial impact ; harmonisation of timing of calls for proposals. 41% 32% 18% 9% Territorial analyses were prepared at regional / local level on the basis of national guidance (centrally managed bottom-up process) Bottom-up: the national-level analysis was based on territorial analyses (e.g. at regional level) Top-bottom: The territorial analyses were prepared in the context of pre- existing national / sectoral analyses Specific territorial analyses were not prepared.

Every member state has identified territories where integrated territorial approaches needed to be applied , as well as specific challenges and development needs that were to be addressed by territorial instruments. However, there are 45 OPs and 12 ETC programmes which do not have territorial analysis (contain neither information on the type of the territory covered nor on external (territorial) challenges and even not on territorial needs. All countries have also defined methods for a co-ordination of interventions at regional and local levels. Survey results confirm the above: sixty percent of MAs reported that their programme was primarily responding to regional and local needs , and only 11% said that it did not consider them. Purely sectoral OPs are therefore rare. In over 70% of the cases the territorial analysis was also prepared at the local level, reflecting a strong bottom-up element . Purely sectoral OPs are rare \u2013 while the reconciliation of sectoral and territorial aspects is felt to represent a challenge. Data regarding the identification of territories indicate a focus on urban and rural areas \u2013 at least judged by the territorial analyses chapters of Pas and OPs. When asked about the reasons for using / not using territorial instruments, in terms of positive arguments, Member States mentioned previous positive experiences with similar measures, and the ability to better respond to needs on the ground, coupled with an element of decentralisation. As arguments against, respondents cited the complicated nature of territorial instruments, or that they may give too much responsibility to regional and local players lacking experience and capacity. Based on the survey results, though, this critique was not the majority standpoint. As visible from survey results, the main challenge that Member States saw with regard to territorial challenges was ensuring a consistency between territorial challenges identified , and matching territorial challenges with sectoral policy approaches. At the same time, understanding the new territorial tools did not cause a significant problem in the application of territorial challenges into programmes . ",
        "100 3.9 C OMMUNITY - LED LOCAL DEVELOPMENT (CLLD) 3.9.1 Background The application of the principles behind CLLD have spread over the last twenty years building on the experience gained from LEADER approach which has been widely used in rural areas. Total public and private investment supported by these partnerships has grown significantly. This experience has shown both when and where CLLD approaches work well, and how they can add value to national and regional programmes. In this context, there is a major opportunity for extending the CLLD approach to other area types and intervention fields, and thereby to using it to develop local responses to some of the most pressing social and environmental problems facing European citizens today. 58 Community-led local development initiatives are characterised by the following: they are \uf0b7 focused on specific sub-regional areas; \uf0b7 led by local action groups composed of representatives of public and private local socio-economic interests; \uf0b7 carried out through integrated and multi-sectoral area-based local development strategies 59 . \uf0b7 designed taking into consideration local needs and potential, and \uf0b7 include innovative features in the local context, networking and, where appropriate, cooperation. Partnership Agreements set out: the main challenges that the Member State intends to tackle with the help of the CLLD approach; the main objectives for CLLD in the Member State; the types of territories (not a list of territories) where CLLD is envisaged to be implemented; how the integrated approach will be achieved at the local level; coordination of and administrative set-up for CLLD ; where appropriate, whether the Member State will apply the possibility to designate a lead Fund in the context of integrated multi-fund local development strategies. Operational Programmes set out the principles for the definition of the areas covered by the community-led local development strategies, in accordance with the Fund-specific rules; and the approach to the use of CLLD in the particular OP (principles for the selection, approval and funding of CLLD strategies and local action groups). CLLD may combine several forms of EU funding and shall be carried out under one or more priorities of a relevant programme or programmes. The analysis under this study focussed on: \uf0b7 the needs that the Member States intend to tackle with CLLD; \uf0b7 the types of territories , where CLLD is to be used; 58 Guidance on CLLD for local actors, 2014, European Commission 59 Also referred to under the term \u2018Community-led local development strategies\u2019 meaning a coherent set of operations, the purpose of which is to meet local objectives and needs, contributing to the Union strategy for smart, sustainable and inclusive growth, designed and implemented by a local action group .

        "T HE U SE OF N EW P ROVISIONS DURING THE P ROGRAMMING P HASE OF THE E UROPEAN S TRUCTURAL AND I NVESTMENT F UNDS 107 According to interviewed national authorities, main factors to divert Member States from using CLLD ( cons ) were: less appropriate for TOs of more developed areas; it is complicated, burdensome , generates loss of efficiency, needs extra administrative capacity - in some cases existence of national instruments easier to handle; too much responsibility/power to local actors , majority of whom must be non-public; difficulties linked to the identification of areas and selection, approval and funding of LAGs and CLLD strategies. In the negotiations , in about 60% of the cases \u2013 according to survey results \u2013 there was agreement from the outset about the use / non-use of CLLD. The Commission seemed to be relatively flexible in this respect. (See Annex 4.9) The main factor influencing Member States\u2019 position was the opinion of partners. The informal dialogue with the Commission did not have a major importance. (See Annex 4.9) 3.9.7 Specific conclusions Only 33 of the programmes under review have mentioned the intention to use CLLD. These cover 17 Member States and have indicated financial allocations to CLLD, from ERDF and ESF resources, with a total value of EUR 1,496 billion . The share of ERDF and ESF from this amount is 81% and 19%, respectively. In relative terms the average allocation to CLLD at EU-level (EU average) is around 0.6% of the ERDF budget . 13 priority axes of 10 operational programmes implemented solely through community- led local development stand for 65% of the overall allocation to CLLD \u2013 what shows that the use of CLLD is rather concentrated , the majority of OPs and priority axes are not concerned by it. 66 The needs that the Member States intend to tackle with CLLD do go beyond rural development, and also relate to SME development , followed by the generation of employment and social inclusion . Main arguments of Member States pro CLLD include that it is appropriate tool to handle complex local problems ; that it motivates for partnership and involvement ; as well as former experience gained through LEADER . However, challenges and difficulties were also reported, e.g. with regard to the identification of intervention areas ; selection, approval and funding of LAGs and CLLD strategies; setting-up LAGs with necessary capacities . Main factors to eventually divert Member States from using CLLD ( cons ) were that it was felt to be more appropriate for rural development and EAFRD (compulsory); that it was perceived as complicated, burdensome , generated loss of efficiency, and needed extra administrative capacity. Some cases Member States felt that existing national 66 At the same time, in the particular context of CLLD, it should be underscored that the study only covers \u201ccohesion policy\u201d, and it only analyses programmes financed by the ERDF (including 92 ESF co-financed multifund programmes) and the CF. Partnership Agreements, of course, refer to all funds (ESF, EAFRD \u2013 for which EAFRD is compulsory - and EMFF included). ",

As delivery mechanism, ITI allows Member States to implement programmes in a cross-cutting way , drawing on funding from at least two different priority axes in the same or different programmes to ensure the implementation of an integrated strategy for a specific territory. The key elements of an ITI are: \uf0b7 a designated territory with an integrated (multi-sectoral) territorial development strategy \uf0b7 that it draws on funds from at least two different priority axes of one or more programmes. ITIs can be mono-fund , however they can also combine ERDF, ESF and the Cohesion Fund, and be complemented by financial support from the EARDF and EMFF where complementarities exist. The support under an ITI must be used towards the objectives outlined in these programmes and actions supported must contribute to the objectives of each of the programmes from which funding is drawn. In Partnership Agreements , Member States describe their approach to the use of ITIs, including: the territories or types of territories where it will be used and through which Funds; and the envisaged implementation arrangements including coordination arrangements between ESI Funds and managing authorities and arrangements for the delegation of management and implementation tasks of an ITI. Operational Programmes describe the OPs/priority axes where MSs have identified ITI as a possible implementation mechanism; the indicative (overall) financial allocation to ITIs from each priority axis; the types of areas where ITIs will be used, if known; how and by when the areas covered by ITIs will be decided; and the arrangements for the management and implementation of the ITI including the coordination between the managing authorities and the possible delegation of tasks and responsibilities. ITIs can be used within a ETC Programme , allowing to draw on resources from several priority axes to allow for the implementation of integrated actions based on a joint strategy. The analysis under this study focussed on: \uf0b7 the types of territories where ITI is used; \uf0b7 the resources dedicated to ITI as identified in the OPs broken down as SUD and non-SUD; \uf0b7 the implementation of ITI and the management functions that are delegated to the local level; and finally \uf0b7 the arguments for and against the use of ITI, including any difficulties that it might entail.

        "110 3.10.2 Types of territories Figure 69 shows for what types of territories / territorial challenges ITI is to be used, according to the PAs and OPs. According to PA and OP data, ITI is to be applied most frequently in urban areas . This figure, however, is influenced by the fact that sustainable urban development measures \u2013 part of them ITI \u2013 are compulsory under the ERDF regulation. Next in line are urban- rural linkages and fisheries and coastal areas. Figure 69 - Types of territories where ITI is to be used (PA, OP/ETC) (frequency, expressed as % of the total number of programmes with relevant data) Over almost 90% of the ITIs so far indicated by Member States are already identified , 4 are due in 2015 and the remaining 2 \u2018later\u2019. The methods for selecting ITI was also examined. Competitive selection is rather rare as type of selection, even more the selection on the basis of a framework strategy (See Annex 4.10). It could be deducted that ITIs are selected according to a predetermined political/technical (territorial) approach, where it is more important to develop and prepare potential ITI subjects in in order to join and profit from the initiative. As concerns competent institutions to decide, the most frequent is to delegate the decision to regional level \u2013 but that number is slightly diverged by the high number of OPs with ITI selected at regional level of Poland. Other Member States\u2019 practice is distributed evenly between selection by government and region. MAs play a lesser role in this respect.

For the remainder of functions, the spread is relatively even. All in all, figures would indicate that programme authorities (MA and IB) would, in most cases, retain most of their functions even in ITI measures. The delegation of implementing tasks to the local level is rather limited - even though ITI would give the possibility to delegate.

In about one quarter of cases MAs pointed to national legal requirements related to partnership and multi-level governance. 71 Note: the two tasks for local stakeholders most frequently mentioned by programming documents were programming and project generation.

Multiple choice question, figures do not add up to 100%) These arguments were completed during the interviews passed among managing authorities by the fact that it represents an effective bottom-up approach, an opportunity to develop cooperation models, based on partnership . Managing authorities were also asked by the survey about the difficulties they had encountered when applying ITI. Half of the responding MAs (47%) did not find any difficulty. The main challenges identified are linked especially to: the definition of principles for the selection, approval and funding of ITIs; the elaboration of high quality ITI strategies and the definition of the role and objectives of ITIs. (See Annex 4.10) Based on feedback by the survey from MAs the programmes of which are not ITI, arguments against using integrated instruments are, most frequently, those (See Annex 4.10): \uf0b7 the mechanism is not relevant to the TOs targeted by the given programme; \uf0b7 too complicated use of the tool; \uf0b7 insufficient guidance available; \uf0b7 worries about the lack of sufficient management capacities (whereby in the survey, this element was significantly less often (13% vs. 21% of MAs). These counterarguments were reflected by the interviews, where those who cited the disadvantages of the tool, mentioned above all that: the tool was complex , not flexible, difficult to implement, that it caused additional administrative burden; and that too much uncertainty was linked to it. Further reasons included a perceived lack of competence within responsible units of cities and territories, which would not be able to implement ITI. Additional counterarguments cited by interview partners were the existence of similar national instrument s and decentralised implementation structures, more familiar and less complicated to implement; and that the national pocket of ESI funds was too small to be cut it to even smaller allocation. MAs also provided information through the survey regarding preparatory support for ITIs. According to these, the main types of support measures to be applied are most frequently provision of information and guidance , followed by trainings and contribution to the preparation of their strategic documents . (See Annex 4.10) During the negotiations , ITI were significantly more debated than the use of CLLD .

The Commission did show a similar level of flexibility, though. Again, the most important factor to influence Member States\u2019 positions was the opinion of partners, while the informal dialogue was relatively less important. (See Annex 4.10) Feedback from Commission counterparts \u2013 from focus groups \u2013 indicated that there was genuine interest from a number of Member States to use integrated instruments. At the same time, in a number of cases, they also reported about considerable resistance from the side of not only national governments, but also regions (which did not want to share \u201cpower\u201d with cities and local stakeholders). EC officials also confirmed survey results stating that there were problems with understanding the detail of the regulations on ITI. One interesting observation \u2013 regarding a more developed member state \u2013 a conflict between the provisions thematic concentration and those on ITI : the non-availability of funds for certain TOs acted against the use of an integrated instrument. 3.10.6 Specific conclusions In OPs analysed, 20 Member States ( involving around one third (94) of the programmes , including 2 ETC programmes) have indicated their intention to start ITI. The total budgets reach almost EUR 15 billion, which represents around 4,2% of the cohesion policy allocation . Overall, ITI is being used in the majority of countries with a considerable budget \u2013 while the positive correlation with ITI-type sustainable urban development certainly influences the figures. The apparent strong link to SUD also suggests that ITI could still be adapted to areas other than urban development . Where used, the identification of ITI's , though, is well advanced . Overall, MAs did not see institutional readiness for ITI as a major issue. Nevertheless, the delegation of functions to the local level \u2013 outside SUD \u2013 is limited . This is more due to the insistence of programme authorities to retain the right to select operations, rather than reservations on local implementation capacity. The arguments pro and contra the use of ITI are very similar to those registered for CLLD. The importance of national legal requirements for choosing ITI, as reflected by the survey, reflects the role of multi-level governance in a number of countries. ",
        "116 3.11 S USTAINABLE U RBAN D EVELOPMENT (SUD) 3.11.1 Background According to Article 7 ERDF Regulation, sustainable urban development shall support integrated actions to tackle the economic, environmental, climate, demographic and social challenges affecting urban areas, including functional urban areas, while taking into account the need to promote urban-rural linkages . Under the new regulations, in SUD operations, projects to be financed are to be selected on a compulsory basis \u2013 which is a novelty \u2013 by the cities concerned , in line with pre-defined integrated urban development strategies, developed by them. The strategies are to be implemented in an integrated way, i.e. drawing on funding from different thematic objectives for a specific territory. Different delivery mechanisms can be used in view of this: integrated territorial investment ( ITI ), a specific operational programme , or a specific priority axis involving at least two thematic objectives. At least 5% of European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) must be invested in integrated sustainable urban development at national level. Partnership Agreements contain the approach to sustainable urban development , including the principles for identifying the urban areas where integrated actions for sustainable urban development are to be implemented; and the indicative allocation at national level to integrated actions for sustainable urban development per Fund. Programmes describe whether SUDs will be undertaken through ITI , a de dicated OP or a multi-thematic priority axis ; the indicative amount of support from Funds for integrated actions for sustainable urban development; the extent of the involvement of urban authorities in the management of these actions (including in the selection of operations). The analysis under this study focussed on: \uf0b7 The identification of SUD areas and strategies \uf0b7 the allocation to SUD : the indicative amount from Funds for integrated actions for sustainable urban development, as well as the approach foreseen for programming the integrated actions for SUD; \uf0b7 the delegation of managing authority functions under SUD to local stakeholders. In addition, the survey and the interviews were used to explore the process of determining and negotiating national choices on SUD, and the eventual challenges tied to the use of the new instrument. 3.11.2 Identification of SUD areas and strategies The preparation of sustainable urban development operations is quite advanced . Based on the programmes processed, in 80% of the cases, planned SUD areas had already been identified in 2014 (by the time of the programme drafting). Another 9% ",

About 10% of planned SUDs areas will be identified only at a later stage 73 . SUD territories cover predominantly entire cities . SUDs at district, neighbourhood or city-region levels can be expected to be less frequent. (See Annex 4.11) According to survey data, as of Summer 2015, ca. two thirds of the required urban development strategies were elaborated, of that, 20% were already under implementation. (See Annex 4.11) As to the method of selecting SUD, results below summarise findings for the Partnership Agreements and programmes processed (where such information was available \u2013 (see Figure 75).

EUR 14,2 billion (92,5%) of the total amount for SUD is to be financed by the ERDF and EUR 1,27 billion (7,5%) by the ESF 77 . As regards SUD allocations per Member State , the largest allocations in absolute terms are planned by Poland (EUR 3,76 bn), Italy (EUR 1,38 bn) and Romania (EUR 1,18 bn).

According to this table, EUR 19,1 bn should be allocated to SUD (in this broader sense), among which 86,7% should be financed by the ERDF (EUR 16,57 bn), 7,% by the ESF (EUR 1,37 bn) and 6,% by the CF (EUR 1,16 bn). Under this framework, 5,5% of cohesion policy funding (ERDF, CF, ESF) should be allocated to urban development. Attention must be also paid to the fact that the difference between allocations appearing in Table 10 and Table 20 of the OPs is not only due to the scope of cohesion policy funds taken into account (including CF or not), but also to the fact that allocation data on Structural Funds (ERDF and ESF) are not identical. 78 Because of the limitation of the study (covers only programmes financed by the ERDF and the CF as well as multi-fund operational programmes co-financed by the European Social Fund), investments in SUDs from ESF programmes are not captured by the methodology. 0% 1% 2% 3% 4% 5% 6% 7% 8% 9% 10% Luxemburg Denmark Malta Austria Finland Ireland Netherlands Sweden Cyprus Estonia Slovenia Belgium Lithuania Latvia Croatia United Kingdom Slovakia Greece Bulgaria Portugal France Germany Spain Hungary Czech Republic Romania Italy Poland ERDF ESF ",

However, Table 10 of the OPs (Table 9 of ETC programmes) indicates the allocations to SUD under different priority axes. The allocations under each priority axis to each different thematic objective are also known. One only needs to work on estimations in the cases of multi-thematic priority axes.

(This is, of course, not necessarily true.) The results of that calculation are shown in the figure below. Thereby, the ESTIMATED column refers to the total SUD allocation. The figure shows that overall the thematic objectives on which SUD can be expected to concentrate are mainly: \uf0b7 TO 4 \u2013 low-carbon economy \uf0b7 TO 9 \u2013 social inclusion and combating povertry and discrimination \uf0b7 TO 6 - environment and resource efficiency.

MAs were also asked, in interviews, about eventual difficulties linked to the setting-up of SUD. The most frequents answers \u2013 of those arguing against SUD \u2013 included complaints about the perceived complexity of the tool and that it represented too much administrative burden. In addition, MAs mentioned uncertainties linked to the status of intermediate body , and showed reluctance to delegate certain implementation responsibilities to cities due to their perceived lack of capacities of cities in strategy making, programming, and implementation. Conversely, interviewees arguing for SUD \u2013 eventually going beyond the regulatory requirement of 5% (ERDF) \u2013 praised the instrument for its ability to support complex, integrated projects addressing specific needs ; and pointed to previous positive experience with similar instruments. Last but not least, they saw it as a cooperation model based on partnership of different administrative levels and a good instrument to animate local stakeholders and building their capacities. According to survey results, in 60% of the cases, the relevant MA was considering targeted institution building support to cities implementing SUD. The main types of support measures to be applied included most frequently trainings; the provision of information and guidance; contribution to the preparation of their strategic documents; provision/financing of advisory services, technical assistance; and covering administrative costs of organisation. (See Annex 4.11) As regards the negotiation process, in the survey, managing authorities also indicated that the content of programming documents regarding the use of SUD was shaped \uf0b7 by the informal dialogue with the EC \uf0b7 by the opinion and proposals of partners ; and \uf0b7 by the national legal and institutional context .

The Member States investing the largest proportion of their ERDF allocations are Cyprus (around 20,6%) and Bulgaria (around 20%). The EU average level is around 7,7%. Delivery is planned mainly through ITI (52,3%) and specific priority axis (43,7%), a minor part of it covered by SUD-specific OPs (Cf. Article 7 (2) of ERDF Regulation). 83 SUD allocations should mainly concentrate TO 4 \u2013 low-carbon economy, TO 9 \u2013 social inclusion and combating povertry and discrimination, and TO 6 - environment and resource efficiency 84 . The delegation of project selection in SUDs is compulsory. Programme authorities (MA and IB) retain most of their functions, as a consequence the delegation of further implementing tasks to the local level is rather limited \u2013 just like under ITI, despite the fact that it is only 16% of survey respondents reported difficulties in finding territorial players with the skills and capacities necessary for SUD. Overall, the SUD instrument is apparently popular among Member States in terms of financial allocation exceeds expectations . At the same time, although 60% of MAs did not report on specific difficulties, SUD is not without its challenges. Difficulties most frequently mentioned are : the specification of geographical areas; quality of strategies; the perceived complicated nature of the tool; uncertainties regarding the status of intermediate body; and reservations about the availability of local capacities. The delegation of implementing tasks from programme authorities to the local level above the compulsory project selection is rather limited, even if frequently capacity building measures are taken in order to remedy any possible lack of experience on the part of the local authorities. 83 Distribution by delivery mode can only be calculated from Table 10 of OPs (and Table 9 for ETC programmes). 84 Also based on data and estimations established based on Table 10 of OPs (and Table 9 for ETC programmes) ",

To that end, Member States are to make use of the possibility of carrying out interregional and transnational actions with beneficiaries located in at least one other member state within the framework of the operational programmes under the Investment for growth and jobs goal. In addition, Member States should, where appropriate, ensure that the objectives of macro-regional and sea-basin strategies form part of the overall strategic planning , in Partnership Agreements, and in programmes in the regions and Member States concerned. For that, Member States need also to establish mechanisms to coordinate joint actions with beneficiaries from different Member States financed by the ERDF and the ESF with investments supported by the programmes under the Investment for growth and jobs goal. European Territorial Cooperation (ETC) is one of the two goals of cohesion policy and provides a framework for the implementation of joint actions and policy exchanges between national, regional and local actors from different Member States. Interreg is built around three strands of cooperation: cross-border (Interreg A), transnational (Interreg B) and interregional (Interreg C). Partnership Agreements describe the main priority areas for European Territorial Cooperation, indicating how a complementary use of Funds from the ETC programmes and the programmes under the Investment for Growth and Jobs goal could contribute to addressing challenges identified; how macro-regional and sea-basin strategies have been taken into account in strategic programming; and whether joint actions with beneficiaries from different Member States will be financed through the ERDF and the ESF. Operational Programmes detail the circumstances where actions with beneficiaries located in at least one other Member State are planned under the operational programme in question, the expected contribution of such actions to the achievement of the programme\u2019s objectives and the expected benefit of such actions for the programme area ; and where appropriate, a description of how the macro regional and sea basin strategies have been taken into account. Cooperation Programmes, as well as OPs, are to include the coordination mechanisms established to link up to the implementation of macro-regional and sea-basin strategies; and how the macro regional and sea basin strategies have been taken into account. The analysis of the PAs and programmes under the study focussed on: \uf0b7 the main priority areas of cooperation, \uf0b7 the links to macro-regional and sea-basin strategies \uf0b7 the use of the possibility to finance inter-regional and transnational actions with beneficiaries located in at least one other Member State, \uf0b7 the co-ordination mechanisms regarding transnational action as well as macro- regional strategies, and finally ",

Four strategies have been mentioned in the OPs: the EU Strategy for the Baltic Sea Region (EUSBSR- endorsed in 2009 by the European Council), the EU Strategy for the Danube Region (EUSDR \u2013 endorsed in 2011), the EU Strategy for the Adriatic and Ionian Region (EUSAIR \u2013 endorsed in 2014) and the EU Strategy for the Alpine Region (EUSALP \u2013 adopted in 2015).

According to programme data, the most frequently used for the co-ordination of transnational co-operation, and macro-regional strategies are a co-ordinated (joined) programming of different funds, and political-level co-ordination committees. Technical-level co-ordination committees and a clear demarcation of programmes and intervention areas are following in the list. Overall, this reflects that co-ordination efforts rather focus on the programming phase. Similar results were obtained with regard to ITI (cf. Chapter 3.10), but also with regard to funds co-ordination (Chapter 3.15) overall.

        "130 that were made within the Commission. This has had some systemic causes mentioned by interviewees. First, the programming of co-operation programmes came 6 months after that of the OPs, by which time most of the funds were already allocated. Second, the priorities of macro-regional strategies proved often difficult to align with the thematic objectives. Last but not least, ETC programmes are also more complicated from a financial management point of view, which reduces enthusiasm for them. Overall, there seems to be a need and room for further improvement in this area. According to interviews with Member States main difficulties experienced in identifying main priority areas for cooperation under ESI Funds are that: \uf0b7 ETC programmes were lagging behind PA and OP programming process , which hampered effective and timely cooperation in programming \uf0b7 more actors (authorities) covered by several programmes need higher level of coordination \uf0b7 OPs\u2019 needs analysis did not take account of wider ETC issues as this was not seen as a major need at regional, local or even national level \uf0b7 identification of synergies between OPs and ETC programmes or macro- regional and sea-basin strategies is difficult \uf0b7 it is difficult to find a place for the allocation of macro-regional and sea- basin strategies, especially for bigger projects \uf0b7 OPs are limited in scope , so ETC projects can access only those ETC priorities reflected in their own (national) OPs \uf0b7 Commission officials \u2013 in focus group interviews \u2013 confirmed the still existing mismatch between the directions chosen by national OPs and those of ETC programmes, and the macro-regional and sea-basin strategies (which can be very wide). On the other hand, both national OPs and ETC programmes are used to provide funding for macro regional strategies . This is of course important because as Macro-regional strategies do not have their own budgets. At the same time, OPs and ETC programmes \u2013 in most cases \u2013 do not have specifically earmarked (ring-fenced) budgets for macro- regional strategies either. Therefore, the cooperation of partner countries during implementation is of high importance. As interview partners reported, macro strategies\u2019 contact points are involved in the work of the Monitoring Committees of ESIF, which should help that cause. Also, when selecting operations, several countries reported that they would give priority to projects directly contributing to Macro-regional strategies. The use of ring-fenced allocations for macro-regional strategies was mentioned in the interview with one Member State. Managing authorities indicated in the survey that the content of programming documents regarding the territorial cooperation and macro-regional strategies was shaped \uf0b7 by the national legal and institutional context on the one hand; and \uf0b7 by the regulations on the other. (See Annex 4.12) In the negotiation process itself, the area of territorial co-operation and sea-basin strategies was the least controversial . In almost three quarters of the cases managing authorities reported that there had been agreement with the EC from the very beginning of the process. (See Annex 4.12) ",

Interregional and transnational actions with beneficiaries located in at least one other Member State were also identified across the board, mainly focused on research and innovation, and support to SMEs thematic objectives. Nevertheless, due to systemic causes (e.g.: differences in programming schedules, some difficulty to reconcile the priorities of pre-existing MRS with the new thematic objectives), synergies between mainstream OPs and ETC, as well as ESIF programmes and macro- regional and sea-basin strategies are quite difficult to achieve .

        "132 3.13 P OVERTY , S OCIAL EXCLUSION 3.13.1 Background New efforts made within the new regulations for simplifying and enhancing the integrated use of ESI Funds is particularly important in addressing the territorial dimension of poverty . The integration of marginalised communities requires coherent and multi- dimensional approaches supported from the various ESI Funds, complementing national resources and implemented coherently with reforms. This multi-dimensional integrated approach combining actions from various ESI Funds (multi-fund approach), or even from different OPs or CPs, is particularly relevant for the Roma community, whose effective integration requires investments in employment, education, healthcare, housing and social integration. In deprived urban areas, the physical and economic regeneration activities supported by the ERDF should go hand in hand with ESF actions aimed at promoting the social inclusion of marginalised groups. In rural areas , EARDF support may also be used to promote social inclusion, particularly through community-led local development (\u2018 LEADER\u2019 ), which will continue to be a compulsory element of rural development programmes. It is also essential to exploit the synergies between the ESI Funds in order to reduce inequalities in terms of access to services. To increase the effectiveness of ESF actions aimed at enhancing access to affordable, sustainable and high-quality services , the ERDF and EARDF should be used in a complementary way to invest in social and health infrastructure in less developed regions and in rural areas. Partnership Agreements contain information on the geographical areas most affected by poverty or an identification of the target groups at highest risk of discrimination or social exclusion and a description of their specific needs; the integrated approach to address their specific needs and the concrete change aimed at; and the role and the contribution of the ESI Funds in the implementation of the strategy. Operational Programmes describe the geographical areas most affected by poverty or an identification of the target groups at highest risk of discrimination or social exclusion and a description of their specific needs; a strategy and funding compatible with the overall strategy to address these specific needs, a description of how the operational programme in the implementation of the programme's strategy will contribute to addressing these specific needs; and an indicative amount of support from Funds for interventions on specific territories or groups, with indication of priority axis, intervention area and main type of actions. Considering the above, the analysis under this study focussed on: \uf0b7 the identification of geographical areas most affected by poverty or the target groups at highest risk of discrimination or social exclusion; \uf0b7 the specific needs of these areas and target groups; \uf0b7 the actions planned as part of the integrated approach; and \uf0b7 the particular difficulties encountered when applying integrated approaches to poor regions and vulnerable groups, and envisaged support measures .

The distribution of ESF funding is as follows: Figure 91 \u2013 Distribution of ESF funding on relevant IPs (OP) On the basis of comparing the above two figures, it can be concluded that there is some inconsistency. While it should be stressed that Figure 90 refers to references in the text, and Figure 91 reflects financial allocations \u2013 i.e. we are comparing to substantially different categories \u2013 it may be conclude that \uf0b7 The share of ESF money to be spent on activation services is comparatively higher than the share of relevant references to needs; \uf0b7 In the case of employment as well as health and social services, the situation is the opposite.

Actions are most often envisaged in framework of the \u201csocial\u201d TOs, while the others (e.g.: SME) are less emphasised. 3.13.5 Particular difficulties and support measures According to survey results, Managing Authorities did not perceive the issue of poor regions and target groups at highest risk of discrimination as particularly contested during the negotiations. In two thirds of the cases there were no major differences in approach between the Member States and the Commission. Where there were initial differences, compromise solutions were found. (See Annex 4.13). The content of programming documents regarding poor regions and vulnerable groups was shaped mainly by the national legal and institutional context . The informal dialogue with the EC and the opinion and proposals of partners were also considered important by the MAs. (See Annex 4.13) Managing authorities were also asked about any difficulties they had encountered when applying integrated approaches to poor regions and vulnerable groups. More than 40% of the responding MAs did not find any difficulty in applying the new rules. Challenges that were reported were linked especially to the apparent lack of data related to poor regions and vulnerable groups, which makes the design of policies and the targeting of interventions difficult. (See Annex 4.13) Survey data also indicate significant efforts to provide support to beneficiaries / stakeholders concerned, 60% of responding MAs considered institution building measures, or other support to beneficiaries/ stakeholders . 75% are planning to issue specific information and guidance materials, and almost 60% are preparing trainings, half of them animation and exchange measures. (See Annex 4.13) MAs were also asked by means of interviews on difficulties encountered.

Also, data were considered to be often outdated data , as assessments dated back to the years 2000. Last but not least, interview partners said that \u2013 in their view \u2013 there were too many conflicting definitions, criteria as well as aspects and dimensions of poverty currently used. 3.13.6 Specific conclusions Overall, specific integrated approaches towards poor regions and vulnerable groups appear in slightly more than in half of the Member States . Nevertheless, an assessment of needs of vulnerable groups figure in only 28 OPs (from 12 Member States) , and less than half of the Partnership Agreements comprise concrete actions for poor regions or vulnerable groups . The most frequent types of territories among poor regions are those with socially marginalised communities, urban, rural and urban-rural areas, and areas with permanent geographical or demographic handicaps. The social groups to be most frequently targeted are the unemployed, the young, disabled people and ethnic minorities. The range of planned actions reflects a rather sectoral approach. \u201c Human services \u201d, such as employment, education and social and antidiscrimination policy are at the top Member States\u2019 intervention lists, other policy areas necessary for a more integrated approach (e.g.: SME promotion) are less present . Partly for this reason, during the negotiations, DG Employment was pushing for a target-group-based approach when addressing the needs of the poor. On this point, though there was resistance from some Member States, which complained about difficulties in national legislation as regards the identification of such groups, and the consequent lack of appropriate data, as mentioned above.

Under the new regulations, there is new scope for the ESI Funds to address demographic challenges or specific development needs of regions with severe and permanent natural or demographic handicaps in an integrated manner. Among the regions concerned, particular attention is to be paid to rural areas, areas affected by industrial transition, and regions which suffer from severe and permanent natural or demographic handicaps such as the northernmost regions with very low population density, island, cross-border and mountain regions. In Partnership Agreements , where the Member States has highlighted specific needs in regions suffering from severe and permanent natural or demographic handicap, the PA shall contain a brief summary of how the ESI Funds will be used to tackle those specific needs. Operational Programmes are to describe how the OP addresses demographic challenges of regions and the specific development needs of certain regions with severe and permanent natural or demographic handicaps. The analysis under this study focussed on: \uf0b7 the identification of regions which suffer from severe and permanent natural or demographic handicaps; \uf0b7 the identification of needs of these regions ; \uf0b7 the identification of actions planned as part of the integrated approach; and finally on \uf0b7 the particular difficulties in implementing integrated approaches to territorial development in regions with permanent handicaps, and envisaged support measures . 3.14.2 Types of regions with permanent handicaps Altogether, 15 Member States made a reference to regions with permanent handicaps in their programming documents. Island and Mountain territories were identified by referrals to them found in Partnership Agreements. For the identification of Outermost regions and Northern sparsely populated regions OP/ETC financial allocation tables were used. By way of comparison with EUROSTAT data on regions with permanent handicaps 88 , as shown in the table below, it is evident that not all relevant regions had been singled out in PAs as target territories for the ESI funds.

The main types of support measures to be applied are trainings; the provision of information and guidance, capacity building; generation of partnership; contribution to the preparation of their strategic documents; provision/financing of advisory services, technical assistance; coverage of administrative costs of organisations; operating small pilot projects/fund. As already indicated under the survey, Member States reported in interviews very few difficulties, if not at all \u2013 which is most probably thanks to the experience MSs concerned had gained previously in programming for those areas. 3.14.6 Specific conclusions Overall, there were very few difficulties mentioned by Member States in the application of the provisions on regions with permanent handicaps. This is most likely thanks to the considerable experience the countries concerned have already accumulated in this area. The main issue which hinders implementation according to MAs is apparently the lack of accurate data and indicators specific to these areas. The regions with permanent geographical handicaps are generally identified in PAs and OPs, although they do not directly address all of them as such. The number of OPs addressing regions with permanent handicaps is rather low . On the other hand, there is coherence between needs identified and actions planned , and planned actions cover a wide range of policy areas, which suggests an integrated approach. ",
        "144 3.15 C OORDINATION BETWEEN THE ESI F UNDS AND OTHER U NION AND NATIONAL FUNDING INSTRUMENTS AND WITH THE EIB 3.15.1 Background In different planning periods , different rules have applied to the joint or parallel use of the structural and cohesion funds at programme, measure, or operation level. The desire to \u201cdeliver European added value\u201d led the Commission to propose, in the draft regulations for the programming period 2014-2020 provisions to reinforce the co- ordination of funds with each other, as well as with other Union policies and financial instruments. As one particular aspect, Article 123 (3) of the CPR mentions the option to set up \u2013 at an initiative of the Member State \u2013 an authority responsible for the co- ordination of EU funds. In the PA and the programmes 89 , Member States were due to describe the policy areas where a co-ordinated use of funds, and a co-ordination with other union and national policies was deemed necessary. They also were asked to provide details of the mechanisms to be used for co-ordination, and any arrangements planned to help beneficiaries to access different funds in a complementary manner. The analysis under this study focussed on clarifying \uf0b7 In what areas a co-ordinated use of funding was planned? \uf0b7 What the mechanisms to ensure co-ordination are? \uf0b7 How were co-ordination arrangements determined, and did they contribute to a more synergetic use of funds and instruments? 3.15.2 Areas Where a Co-ordinated use of Funds & Instruments is Planned Member States have established in their Partnership Agreements and programmes (cf. Annex 4.14) which cohesion policy funds (ERDF, ESF, CF) they wish to use together, - in a co-ordinated manner \u2013 with other resources (ESI Funds, other EU resources, National Funds, or the EIB). At the level of the partnership agreements, \uf0b7 All Member States made references to co-ordination among the ESI Funds \uf0b7 With the exception of 3 Member States, the co-ordination with other EU instruments was also specifically mentioned. \uf0b7 The co-ordination needs indicated at national level (PA) were also taken over into the OPs. 89 PA section 2.1; OP section 8; CP section 6 ",

The next most prominent co-ordination effort relates to other EU policies and programmes , followed by national instruments and \u2013 last but not least \u2013 the EIB \u2019s activities. One observes similar patterns for the ERDF, the CF and the ESF. Results are also similar at programme level (cf. Annex 4.14) 91 . Overall, coordination efforts planned in the programming documents are consistent with the coordination needs identified in the programmes (Figure 97) Figure 97 - Co-ordination needs by fund (measured at Programme level) (% of all the indicated co-ordination needs for each fund ) Further analysis shows which instruments should be mainly used in a combined way with cohesion policy funds. Figure 98 below shows how often a given fund or instrument (listed on the vertical axis) has been mentioned as a resource to be co-ordinated with the ERDF, ESF, or CF. 92 At PA level, the EAFRD, the EMFF, ETC programmes, Horizon 2020, and the ERDF, followed by the national budget, and then LIFE and the ESF are the most frequently mentioned instruments. The list is very similar at the level of Programmes: EAFRD, ESF, Horizon 2020, ERDF, LIFE, COSME and ETC are at the top of the list. 90 based on the text of the PA and OPs, recording references to the co-ordinated use of funds 91 Coordination efforts are most often mentioned with respect to other ESI Funds, then other EU instruments, followed by national funds, and the EIB being mentioned almost exclusively with respect to the ERDF. 92 Co-ordination needs among the same funds (e.g. ERDF-ERDF) indicates the need to co-ordinate between different programmes and measures financed by the same fund.

        "146 Co-ordination priorities for the each of the cohesion policy funds are as follows (measured by the number of Member States mentioning the need to co-ordinate in their Partnership Agreements): \uf0b7 For the ERDF: with the EAFRD (24 Member States); Horizon 2020 and LIFE (22 Member States); the ESF (21 Member States) and the EMFF (21 Member States), and COSME (20 Member States); \uf0b7 For the Cohesion Fund: with the ERDF (11 Member States); the Connecting Europe Facility (11 Member States); and the EIB and the EAFRD (10 Member States); \uf0b7 For the ESF: with the EAFRD (20 Member States); Erasmus + and the ERDF (17 Member States); Horizon 2020 (14 Member States) and the EMFF.

Accordingly, information as to co-ordination needs associated with different policy areas can only be derived indirectly, and to a limited extent.

These findings would mostly correspond to expectations, and indicate \u2013 especially with respect to rural development and fisheries \u2013 an intention by Member States to reinforce funds co-ordination. In addition, we have tested whether there was a statistically significant correlation between the thematic objectives used in particular programmes and the needs for co-ordination, or the arrangements used for such co-ordination. The outcome is negative. It is only in a handful of cases that correlations \u2013 with sufficient probability and occurrence \u2013 were detected. 3.15.3 Arrangements for the Co-ordination of Funds and Instruments Methods of co-ordination can be examined from the perspective of the authorities and that of the beneficiaries. As to the authorities side , based on the Partnership Agreements, Member States\u2019 co- ordination efforts seem to be concentrate d more on the planning phase than on implementation. Within that, the emphasis is on programming \u2013 aiming at a synergetic use of funds through joint strategies, multi-fund programmes, and groups of measures covering different sources \u2013 is topping the list. The clear separation \u2013 or \u201cdemarcation\u201d \u2013 of interventions by different funds is also mentioned often: by two thirds of Member States. Next most frequently referred to are institutional solutions : the optional co-ordination body in the sense of Art. 123(8), followed by different types of co-ordination bodies \u2013 at political level or at administrative level. Less than half of Member States mention, though, the intention of co-ordination between managing authorities during implementation , e.g. in the form of \u201ccross-participation\u201d in project selection, or co-operation in monitoring, evaluation or control (Annex 4.14). The possibility to establish selection criteria that reward operations using different funds or instruments in a synergetic manner is mentioned only rarely (Figure 99). A failure to ensure synergies between he different EU funds in the course of their implementation may jeopardise the positive effects of the complementarity enshrined in the programming phase and result in a silo effect between the funds. ",
        "148 Figure 99 - Use of co-ordination arrangements by Member States (Number of Member States referring to a given co-ordination arrangement, in PAs) The above pattern is largely applicable for all three funds. Nevertheless, there are some statistically significant differences . According to the data: \uf0b7 ERDF programmes are more likely than others to use \u201ccross-participation of MAs in decision-making \u2013 i.e. involve other MAs in project selection; and to co-operate with other programmes in monitoring, evaluations, control and audit. \uf0b7 In Cohesion Fund programmes, the co-ordination body in the sense of Art. 123 (8) is seen to play an important role, and the need for cross- border consultations is also more frequently mentioned. \uf0b7 For the ESF , the importance of coordination in programming is relatively high, higher than for other funds. (See also Annex 4.14.) As regards co-ordination arrangements helping beneficiaries to access different funds in a synergetic manner, Member States, quite uniformly, plan to provide help to beneficiaries mainly through specific guidance documents for beneficiaries, dedicated contact points and one-stop-shop information services to beneficiaries as well as e- government solutions (web-pages, etc.). 21 Member States have provided specific measures in view of this (on average 2) (See also Annex 4.14.) 3.15.4 Establishing Co-ordination Arrangements - the Negotiation Process Survey data indicate that the co-ordination of funds and instruments was among the least controversial of all new provisions. In three quarters of cases the there was no major difference between the approaches of the Member States and those of the EU.

(See also Annex 4.14.) As to the quality of co-ordination 43% of survey respondents considered that the co- ordination among funds would improve for the new period, and another 41% expected it to remain as it was. It was only 16% of managing authorities that feared a worsening of the situation. (Figure 100) Figure 100 - Did co-ordination mechanisms improve vis-\u00e0-vis the previous programming period? In general terms, most Member States did not regard the co-ordination of funds as a particular challenge , which might however also be an indication for them not taking the issue very seriously and continue to work in silos between the different administrations in charge of different funds. Many authorities interviewed pointed to long years of experience, and well established structures for co-ordination from earlier periods. These structures and relationships have proved to work effectively under the new regulatory framework. The list of potential problems \u2013 mentioned during interviews with the authorities \u2013included: \uf0b7 A difficulty to get the role of the central co-ordination authority accepted by line ministries \uf0b7 The classic problems of demarcation between different programmes and beneficiaries \uf0b7 The multitude of organisations and the complexity of negotiations with the EIB; \uf0b7 The complexity of negotiations with stakeholders which, in many cases, did not have the appropriate capacity to participate; \uf0b7 The co-ordination between research institutions and SME under TO 1; \uf0b7 The reconciliation of different approaches to SME support under the ERDF and the EAFRD, which seems to create difficulties for rural SMEs to access finance.

(For the ERDF, co-operation among MAs is more frequent, according to statistical analysis). This is indicative of a weakness, as synergetic programming alone may not be sufficient to ensure a close co-operation among funds and may lead to working in silos with loosing out on real synergy effects by combined or coordinated investments. \uf0b7 Overall, according to the survey, the area of funds co-ordination was one of the least controversial. The objective of enhanced funds co-ordination was shared by both the Member States and the EU . Where there were differences in opinion, compromise solutions were found. \uf0b7 Surveys and interviews confirm the general opinion by stakeholders that co-ordination did overall improve in the programming phase .

Gaps in the administrative capacities of those authorities, which should be targeted by institution building actions, may include problems related to \uf0b7 Structure \u2013 the clear assignment of responsibilities and tasks to institutions, and departments or units within these institutions \u2013 including management, programming, implementation, monitoring, evaluation as well as financial management & control. Structure also relates to supervisory and ancillary bodies, such as Monitoring Committees, auditing tasks, partnership, etc. \uf0b7 Human resources \u2013 the ability to detail tasks and responsibilities at the level of job descriptions, to estimate the number and qualifications of staff required, and to fulfil recruitment needs. \uf0b7 Systems and tools \u2013 the availability of instruments, methods, guidelines, manuals, systems, procedures, forms, etc. In brief, these are all job-aids that can enhance the effectiveness of the functioning of the system. Effective management of the Structural Funds requires that all 3 dimensions are taken into account. In addition, if cohesion policy assistance is to be used effectively and efficiently \u2013 the administrative capacities of the beneficiaries should receive similar attention by the programme authorities. This is not always the case. Gaps in administrative capacities of beneficiaries may include functional gaps in project development and monitoring, procurement, and financial management . These also require attention, and should be addressed. In previous programming periods, National Strategic Reference Frameworks (NSRFs) and OPs had to contain the description of implementation systems. The following requirements are, in that perspective, a novelty, i.e. the need to: \uf0b7 assess gaps in administrative capacities of authorities and beneficiaries, (in line with the logic described above, taking into account lessons learnt from previous programme period/ex ante evaluations); \uf0b7 describe main actions planned \u2013 referring to the conclusions under Heading 2.5 of the PA, translating them to operational measures financed by TA \u2013 for reinforcing administrative capacities of authorities and beneficiaries. In the Partnership Agreements and programmes 93 Member States were requested (recommended) to do their analysis following the \u201cstructures \uf0e0 human resources \uf0e0 systems and tools\u201d logic as described above. The analysis was to conclude with a list of bottlenecks and challenges for the new programme period, which should be translated into operational measures in the OPs (to be supported by TA). 93 Section 2.5 of the PA; Section 2.A.10 of operational programmes; Section 2.A.5 of co-operation programmes ",

        "154 Results above show a fairly uniform spread of needs , with organisational and personal capacity development leading the way. Training \u2013 a cornerstone of HR development \u2013 appears at the very top of the list. It is also interesting to note that the need to hire more staff figures quite high on the \u201cwish lists\u201d of Member States (64% mentioning it in their PAs), despite the fact that \u2013 as expressed by Commission officials during focus group interviews \u2013 there are close to 24 000 employees working on the implementation of the ERDF and Cohesion Fund programmes all over Europe. In the Commission\u2019s view, the emphasis should rather be on modern methods of HR management (such as career development and staff retention), which however, is placed towards the end of the list, even if more than half of Member States do mention it. Needs identified in the PAs are overall consistent with the needs mentioned by interviewees. Most Member States mentioned in this context trainings and the exchange of experiences as the key tools for the strengthening of administrative capacities. The importance of human resources was alo stressed by several counterparts. Thereby, the continuity of staff was emphasised partly as a requirement or as existing practice that has a major positive effect on the quality of administration. Exchanges \u2013 internships \u2013 of experts among authorities in different Member States (and the Commission) were also mentioned by one counterpart. In addition, interview partners also underlined the importance of a continuity of the legal framework , so that experience from previous periods can be most effectively used. Some authorities saw difficulties related to the very limited availability of funds for capacity building (due to overall budget). As regards the actions that Member States are planning in order to respond to needs identified, there is consistency in the sense that it is the same areas that are at the top of both lists. The perhaps most interesting point is again the already mentioned modest focus on HR management methods.

Examining planned capacity building of the authorities by stages of the programme cycle , the analysis of partnership agreements also show an emphasis on the selection of operations, programme monitoring and evaluation . This would indicate increasing attention paid to results-oriented management .

        "156 Overall, in the eyes of interviewed Commission officials , capacity development should happen in the context of overall public administration reform efforts under TO 11. DG Employment staff, however, were not satisfied with the extent to which programmes addressed this challenge. TA funds in the OPs substantially exceed the amounts planned under TO 11, and most of those funds go towards staff and training costs. As the Commission sees it, organisations focus on ad hoc and/or stand-alone actions (training, procedures). Member States should move away from using TA as a lump sum for administrative capacity building , and should programme it like any other priority axis in an OP (needs analysis, focus on areas in most need, clear targets). Furthermore, REGIO officials pointed out \uf0b7 the existence of a new PEER 2 PEER exchange instrument for authorities managing the ERDF and Cohesion Fund; \uf0b7 the existence of fi-compass - a unique platform for advisory services on financial instruments provided by the Commission in partnership with EIB; \uf0b7 a common action plan on state aid with DG COMP which includes seminars and trainings in Member States and Brussels; \uf0b7 a Public Procurement Action Plan with 14 actions, which has been set up between DG GROW and ESIF DG's and EIB: implementation is on-going since beginning of 2014. As regards possible difficulties of capacity building , interview partners cited the complexity and exceedingly technical nature of management rules, above all \u2013 again \u2013 with respect to state aids and public procurements, followed by financial instruments; e-cohesion, equal opportunities legislation; ITI and results orientation. The lack of sufficient and skilled human resources is a further frequently mentioned problem also from the perspective of capacity building. One member state said that the rigidity of rules applicable to the structure, size, and HR management of public administration institutions did not allow implementing necessary changes, capacity increases, and performance-oriented HR management practices. 3.16.3 Capacities of the Beneficiaries As regards beneficiaries, only half of Member States made specific statements on capacity building measures. They were of the opinion that the biggest needs were related to project generation, public procurement, financial management and monitoring , if expressed in terms of stages of the programme cycle. On the same scale, planned actions would be fairly evenly spread among different areas, with planning, project generation, procurement and financial management leading the way.

Most interview partners mentioned knowledge regarding project preparation and management as the most pressing needs as regards the capacity of beneficiaries. Within that, the importance of result orientation was emphasised, so that beneficiaries do \u201c not develop projects for the projects' sake but to actually conceive of sustainable projects \u201d. Further issues where training and capacity building is said to be important are: \uf0b7 public procurement \uf0b7 state aids \uf0b7 simplified costs \uf0b7 the use of new information systems \uf0b7 Territorial instruments As regards tools and mechanisms for capacity building for beneficiaries, planned actions in the PA to help beneficiaries increase their capacities mainly focus on trainings , and the provision of guidelines and methodologies (Figure 106).

        "158 In parallel, main tools mentioned by interview partners from Member States were: \uf0b7 Trainings , \uf0b7 guidance materials, \uf0b7 information events and publications (about rules, techniques, as well as successful practices); \uf0b7 networks of contact points for beneficiaries (emphasised by transnational programme authorities); \uf0b7 as well as the use of TA \u2013 (up to the level of specific priority axes for strengthening beneficiaries capacity) As to who should implement capacity building for beneficiaries, apart from managing authorities, again in interviews , \uf0b7 counterparts mentioned the role of regional authorities ; \uf0b7 one OP under the SME Initiative mentioned the responsibility of financial intermediaries in setting up a \u201cfast and agile\u201d procedures, and preparing their clients for using them. Last but not least, the importance of practical experience \u2013 and therefore the stability of staff at beneficiary level \u2013 was also highlighted. Interview partners also said that the practical application of the partnership principle \u2013 e.g. the active participation of beneficiaries in Monitoring Committees, for instance, had also a positive influence, e.g. by allowing the partners to develop relevant guidance materials for their members. 3.16.4 Establishing Needs and Actions \u2013 the Negotiation Process As regards the negotiation process, according to survey results, the area of capacity building was relatively uncontroversial . Almost 2/3 of survey respondents said there had been agreement from the outset, and compromise solutions had been found in most cases. Where there was debate, the Commission seems to have been able to convince Member States of the Union\u2019s position, rather than the other way round (13% vs. 4% of survey responses). (See also Annex 4.15) The most important factor shaping Member States positions was the opinion of domestic partners \u2013 who are, of course, the among the main \u201cclients\u201d of the MAs and IBs. According to the survey\u2019s results, it was the opinion of social partners and civil society organisations that shaped the programmes above all else. The low score registered for the Regulation (8%) suggests that \u2013 in this respect \u2013 Member States did not perceive the regulation as particularly novel. (See also Annex 4.15) The survey also asked respondents to assess the expected effect of plans to build capacities of authorities and beneficiaries: will these be addressed adequately \u2013 with ",
        "T HE U SE OF N EW P ROVISIONS DURING THE P ROGRAMMING P HASE OF THE E UROPEAN S TRUCTURAL AND I NVESTMENT F UNDS 159 clear and credible actions, responsibilities, targets and milestones? 94 Expectations by managing authorities are fairly optimistic in both cases, as shown in Figure . Figure 107 \u2013 Quality of capacity building plans according to MAs This fairly optimistic feedback is in some contrast with the results of the analysis of the Partnership Agreements. The quality of Member States\u2019 action plans for strengthening authorities was assessed by the country experts of the consortium. The criteria of the examination were, whether Member States have ensured: \uf0b7 A clear structuring, and itemisation (breakdown to concrete, verifiable actions) of their plans; \uf0b7 The determination of clear responsibilities and deadlines; \uf0b7 Measureable targets, indicators, milestones; \uf0b7 Monitoring and reporting arrangements for implementing planned actions; \uf0b7 A clear specification of the funds needed to implement plans; \uf0b7 Actions being based on specific needs assessments; Scores given by country experts ranged from 1 to 4 (from \u2018no\u2019 \u2013 to \u2018yes, fully\u2019 ). Average marks \u2013 assessing the specificity of the PAs in this respect \u2013 are rather weak . Converting the scale to percentages (1=0; 4=100%), scores would rank from ca. 30% to 56%. (See Figure 108) 94 This question was referring to any type of action plan (either formal or informal) not about TO 11. 7% 25% 51% 17% Authorities 1 = No 2 = [partially] 3 = [mostly] 4 = Fully 7% 22% 61% 10% Beneficiaries 1 = No 2 = [partially] 3 = [mostly] 4 = Fully ",
        "160 Figure 108 - Quality of capacity building action plans 3.16.5 Specific conclusions The templates of the Partnership Agreements required Member States to address capacity building in a fair amount of detail. All Member States provided specifics as regards either the needs or planned actions with respect to the authorities in charge of EU funds. (Four Member States did not provide specifics on the actions planned). The capacities of beneficiaries were addressed in detail only by about half of them. Action plans devised by Member States seem rather unspecific. (Figure 1087). Notwithstanding that, managing authorities , for their part, were fairly upbeat about the perspectives of strengthening capacities of both the authorities and beneficiaries. (Figure ). The emphasis among planned capacity building actions on project selection, monitoring and evaluation does signify attention to some of the key elements of the new regulations, e.g. results-oriented management . At the same time, the \u201cevergreen\u201d topics of financial control, public procurement and state aid are also being considered. As regards capacity building of beneficiaries , Member States see needs fairly evenly spread among the areas of project generation, public procurement, financial management and monitoring. In terms of thematic areas, it was state aids, the use of simplified costs options and new information systems,as well as territorial instruments that were added to the list of topics where national authorities plan to offer trainings and guidelines to assist beneficiaries. Capacity building does not seem to have stood in the foreground of negotiations. Nevertheless, recent initiatives for the exchange of experiences \u2013 such as the PEER 2 PEER exchange instrument, and joint capacity building measures with DGs COMP and DG GROW \u2013 are directly relevant for the main concerns of the Member States as well as the Commission. Substantial TA funds continue to be available \u2013 at least in most countries \u2013 to managing authorities. Not forgetting immediate technical concerns of programme implementation, a more strategically planned use of these TA funds \u2013 in conjunction with overall public administration reform and TO 11 \u2013 should be at the core of capacity building efforts for cohesion policy. 1.96 2.04 2.07 2.07 2.43 2.70 1.00 1.25 1.50 1.75 2.00 2.25 2.50 2.75 3.00 3.25 3.50 3.75 4.00 Monitoring and reporting Funds Measureable targets Responsibilities and deadlines Structure and itemisation Needs assessments ",

More recently, it has also become a general requirement for many EU policies, e.g. in the context of the Small Business. It is also a recurring element of the recitals of the CPR 95 . Furthermore, Article 4 (5) of the CPR reiterates the principle of proportionality \u2013 keeping the administrative burden at bay with respect to entire programme cycle: the preparation and implementation of programmes, monitoring, reporting, evaluation, management and control. According to Article 4 (10) \u201c The Commission and the Member States shall carry out their respective roles in relation to the ESI Funds with the aim of reducing the administrative burden on beneficiaries \u201d. Accordingly, Section 2.6. of the template for Partnership Agreements explicitly requires Member States to \uf0b7 Assess the administrative burden in the 2007-13 period; \uf0b7 Identify its main sources in the 2007-13 period; \uf0b7 Describe potential scope for reduction for the 2014-20 period (referring to data and studies where possible); \uf0b7 Describe main actions already taken for reduction for the 2014-20 period; \uf0b7 Describe main actions planned for further reduction for the 2014-20 period, including the introduction and use of simplified cost options, where appropriate (it is optional), with an indicative timeframe; \uf0b7 Describe the use of technical assistance for implementing main actions for reduction for the 2014-20 period. Similar requirements are defined in Section 10 of the OPs and Section 7 of the CPs. The detailed analysis of the administrative burden on beneficiaries of cohesion policy, and its presentation of the programming documents is a novelty as compared to the previous period, where administrative burden was described at a more general level. 3.17.2 Sources of the Administrative Burden In programming documents, Member States identified the application process, payment and reporting as the main sources of the administrative burden, with audits and controls and project preparation following closely. The analysis of Partnership Agreements and Programmes has produced very similar results in this respect, but no real surprises. Perhaps, the relatively low frequency of procurement being mentioned may seem a bit odd, given that this area is among the most frequent sources of irregularities. Additional issues mentioned as sources of administrative burden included differences in eligibility rules and language problems in ETC programmes, or the lengthy 95 See recitals No. 10; 29; 43; 48; 50; 95; 107; 117; 122 ",
        "162 selection procedures. (Due to their small numbers, these do not appear in the graph separately). Figure 109 - Sources of the administrative burden in PAs and Programmes (frequency: sources of burden mentioned as % of total number of sources identified) In terms of patterns across Member States , statistical analysis of data from Operational Programmes reveals that \uf0b7 OPs from the EU-13 countries , as well as those using the Cohesion Fund , are comparatively more likely to cite project preparation and public procurement among the sources of the administrative burden. At the same time, they \u201ccomplain\u201d less about audits and control. \uf0b7 Significant patterns according to other discerning criteria \u2013 e.g. ETC vs. OPs; ESF or not \u2013 were not detected. 3.17.3 Actions to reduce the Administrative Burden The results regarding the planned actions were also very similar at PA and OP level. All Member States are mentioning the \uf0b7 simplification of application, procurement and payment procedures, \uf0b7 extended use of electronic administration, \uf0b7 use of simplified cost options, and \uf0b7 reduction of archiving requirements as priority actions to reduce the burden. About half of Member States mention measures such as \uf0b7 simplifying regulatory requirements (in general), \uf0b7 specific information measures for beneficiaries, \uf0b7 simplifying monitoring, reporting and control, and \uf0b7 capacity building at the programme management authorities. 0% 10% 20% 30% 40% 50% 60% 70% Communication Archiving Overregulation Procurement Proj. preparation Reporting Audit / control Payment proc.

        "T HE U SE OF N EW P ROVISIONS DURING THE P ROGRAMMING P HASE OF THE E UROPEAN S TRUCTURAL AND I NVESTMENT F UNDS 163 The spread of actions among different areas appears to be quite even in both the PAs and OPs, and the two levels of programming documents confirm each other in this respect. Also, planned actions respond well to the identified main causes of the administrative burden. As to patterns across Member States, statistical analysis (clustering) did not reveal any discernible variations in terms of the nature of the actions planned for the reduction of the burden. Apparently, there are no significant differences in the approaches to reducing the burden among OPs from the EU-15 vs. EU-13, or ESF co-financed OPs vs. ERDF/CF financed ones, etc. On the latter point, it should be noted that the analysis did not cover ESF-lead OPs \u2013 where a difference in approach would have been more likely to emerge. In interviews , the methods mentioned as most promising to achieve a reduction of the burden were, most frequently (almost uniformly), \uf0b7 simplified cost options, \uf0b7 e-cohesion , up to the full elimination of the paper trail. (Interestingly, one country-specific counterparts called the introduction of e-cohesion as a \u201csolution to a problem that did not exist\u201d, as Irish authorities already had their IT systems in place. They foresee some difficulties in relation to the integration of these IT applications.) Other preferred methods mentioned by Member States include \uf0b7 the standardisation of rules, procedures and documents used; \uf0b7 \u201c once only \u201d registration \u2013 avoiding asking beneficiaries for information that the member state already has (see also linking up national databases); \uf0b7 reducing the burden caused by monitoring, reporting and controls (see also: elimination of duplicated controls). The integrated management of funds is also seen as a tool for reducing the burden \u2013 e.g. through reducing the number of funding sources a beneficiary needs to apply to, in order to get funding for complex projects. Integrated territorial instruments were mentioned as a tool for reducing the burden in one Member State, along with an increased decentralisation of funding to regional and local levels. Another Member State plans to further expand \u201cone-stop-shop\u201d information services for applicants. Managers from ETC programmes spoke out in favour of harmonised eligibility rules, and reliable advice regarding the clear interpretation of rules (looking also at the EU Commission). Last but not least it should be mentioned that, in some Member States, the complicated nature of ESIF management was even said to deter applicants from requesting EU funds, and orientating them to other schemes where the EU does not participate. As to potential problems in reducing the burden, a number of counterparts did not see any overly difficult areas. At the same time, several interview partners saw the new legal framework as at least or even more complicated than the previous one, which would increase the administrative burden on beneficiaries. Frequently mentioned areas of difficulty were ",
        "164 \uf0b7 public procurement , \uf0b7 state aids (including the specific area of research and development), \uf0b7 monitoring indicators (where the regulations are introducing new requirements), \uf0b7 e-cohesion , the further development of IT systems. 3.17.4 Use of TA As regards the use of TA both PAs and OPs show largely the same results, which is positive in the sense that apparently there is a match between overall intentions and the allocation of TA resources . According to the analysis, the areas where Member States specifically indicated the use of TA funds most frequently are \u2013 again \u2013 application and payment procedures , as well as the introduction of simplified cost options . E-administration leads the way this time, which is logical, given that IT management systems are quite cost intensive. It should be noted that data regarding an exact financial breakdown of funds for such actions are not available in the programmes. Figure 110 \u2013 Using TA to reduce the administrative burden (Percentage of programming documents using TA in a given area of capacity building) Again, statistical analysis did not reveal significant variations across Member States or funds.

Overall, there appears to be an intention to front-load actions reducing administration. Figure 111 - Timing of actions to reduce the administrative burden Statistical analysis did not reveal patterns across (groups of) Member States in this respect either. However, Cohesion Fund and TA programmes did more often than others indicate that actions related to the reduction of the administrative burden were already done. 3.17.6 Targeting of measures When asked about the eventual targeting of anti-burden measures at specific groups of fund users, respondents gave fairly general answers. More than half of them said that measures would be horizontal, for all beneficiaries \u2013 despite the fact that their projects and needs are quite different.

Those who did report about an in-depth assessment were also asked about the method . Within the group, 39% of respondents pointed to internal studies by the responsible authorities. Almost as many reported about specific consultations with programme target groups and beneficiaries (19+14%). 8% had employed quantitative modelling methods, while 7% based their plans on programme evaluations. Other answers referred to a combination of these methods. (Figure 113) Figure 113 - The method of assessing the administrative burden During negotiations, the main factor that influenced Member States in determining the needs and actions related to the reduction of the administrative burden was the national institutional context and the opinion of partners. The dialogue with the EC seems to have played a secondary role. 70% of survey respondents said that there was consensus from the very beginning, and less than 3% reported that their initial position needed to be significantly changed due to the EU\u2019s intervention. (See also Annex 4.15) In the survey, when asked about the expected success of the planned measures, 56% thought that measures were comprehensive enough, and were likely to fully or mostly solve problems. 44% answered rather negatively. This reflects indecision.

The lack of legal security in itself could lead to an increased administrative burden. In one interview, the introduction of simplified costs was reported to be difficult to get accepted by national ministries. In another Member State authorities warned specifically that any reduction of the administrative burden on beneficiaries should not lead to an increase of administration work on the part of the authorities. 3.17.8 Specific conclusions Programming documents contain substantial information regarding the administrative burden on beneficiaries, and planned actions to reduce it. However, it is only about half of the cases that this information is based on recent, detailed needs assessments . Survey respondents were quite undecided whether planned measures could be expected to reduce the burden. The feeling of a major new departure does not seem to be present. The issue of the administrative burden was rather non-controversial during the negotiations. About 70% of survey responses indicated no major difference in opinion between the Commission and the Member States. This may also indicate that the topic did not attract a high level of attention during programming. At the same time, key new regulatory provisions \u2013 e.g. the increased use of simplified cost options and e-cohesion \u2013 figure prominently among Member States plans to reduce the burden. The introduction of integrated instruments could also help to address one of the most important sources of bureaucracy: application procedures.

ESI-supported projects primarily aim at one of the 11 thematic objectives in the Regulations. But, they may have additional effects on horizontal policy objectives. A general principle of the regulation (Article 4 (2)) determines that \u201c the Commission and the Member States shall ensure, taking account of the specific context of each Member State, that support from the ESI Funds is consistent with the relevant policies, horizontal principles referred to in Articles 5, 7 and 8 and priorities of the Union, and that it is complementary to other instruments of the Union. \u201d Articles 5, 7 and 8 of the CPR, as well as the Common strategic framework, list the horizontal principles (although in slightly different breakdowns): \uf0b7 Partnership and multi-level governance, including strengthening the institutional capacity of partners\u2013 which is dealt with under a parallel assignment ; \uf0b7 Sustainable development , including optimising impacts by avoiding options with negative impact, favouring most sustainable options, comparing life-time costs of alternative options, favouring green public procurement; and paying special attention to climate change mitigation and water management; \uf0b7 Equality between men and women and non-discrimination including optimising impacts by preventing discrimination, supporting specific actions; providing expertise; paying special attention to employment; \uf0b7 Accessibility , especially for persons with disabilities, and especially regarding physical environment, transport, ICT; \uf0b7 Addressing demographic change , especially in regions most affected by demographic change, and especially regarding education, research and innovation, ICT, employment, social inclusion and health care; \uf0b7 Climate change mitigation and adaptation . The analysis under this study focussed on how Member States planned to ensure the promotion of horizontal principles, and to what extent they are envisaging a \u201cmainstreaming\u201d of these objectives into the general processes of implementation, management and evaluations. For this, we have reviewed references to horizontal principles, and methods, specific actions addressing them.

These are well rooted in the logic of intervention and day-to-day practices of managing authorities, while accessibility, climate change and demography seem to receive comparatively less attention (especially in the programmes). Nevertheless, results from PA and Programme level are consistent with each-other. Figure 115 \u2013 Horizontal priorities to be promoted \u2013 PA and programmes 96 (% of programme documents referring to each ) The coding system used for compiling and categorising references to horizontal principles in the programmes was as follows: Figure 116 - Types of horizontal priorities Code Narrative Accessibility Steps to prevent any discrimination based on disability. All products, public goods, services and infrastructures co- financed by the ESI Funds are accessible to all citizens. Barrier-free environment for persons with disabilities and the elderly. In particular, accessibility of the physical environment, transport, ICT etc. Climate Climate change mitigation and adaptation Demography Use of the ESI Funds to tackle demographic problems and to create growth linked to an ageing society. Facilitate inclusion of all age groups, including access to education and social support structures. Ensuring a long and healthy working life for all. Equality Ensuring equality between men and women and the integration of gender perspective throughout programmes, including monitoring, reporting and evaluation. 96 At the OP level, references to horizontal principles were only recorded in cases the reference directly pointed to a specific action. Therefore, the figures reflect the specificity of the references.. 0% 10% 20% 30% 40% 50% 60% 70% 80% 90% 100% Demography Climate Accessibility Non-discrimination Equality Sustainability PA% PRG% ",

Sustainability Full mainstreaming of sustainable development into the all stages of using ESI Funds (sustainable development, environmental protection, polluter pays principle) Avoid or reduce environmentally harmful effects of interventions and ensure results in net social, environmental and climate benefits. Statistical analysis did not show differences between gropus of Member States (EU-15 vs. EU-13) or types of programmes (ETC vs. OPs) regarding references to horizontal principles. However, some correlations were detected: \uf0b7 TA operational programmes (as well as Cohesion fund OPs) were shown to include \u201cnon-discrimination\u201d more frequently than others ; \uf0b7 Programmes with combination axes more often than others referred to sustainabiliy as a horizontal principle; \uf0b7 Outermost regions focused more often on sustainability, while climate and accessibility (for the disabled) were less emphasised by them. As to the breakdown of the category \u201cnon-discrimination\u201d , the social group most frequently referred to in programmes as a potential target group for non-discrimination action are women, followed by the disabled, young and old people and the long-term unemployed people. Again, data from PA and programme levels are consistent. Given recent events, the apparently low level of focus on migrants may indicate a need to revisit this aspect in programmes.

The main options considered under this aspect were \uf0b7 Minimum guarantees \u2013 establishing mechanisms to ensure that discriminatory practices and projects are excluded during selection and implementation. \uf0b7 Prioritising actions or beneficiaries \u2013 when during the selection of operations projects that positively contribute to a horizontal principle are preferred (e.g. giving higher scores) \uf0b7 Specific actions \u2013 involving specific allocations are reserved to actions promoting horizontal principles, e.g. through a specific call for proposals. \uf0b7 Mainstreaming \u2013 Ensuring the presence of horizontal objectives, through a complex set of measures, throughout the programming cycle As the analysis of programme documents indicates, from these main categories of methods, Member States have a clear preference towards mainstreaming .

Recruitment promoting equal opportunities during recruitment of staff, The results from PA and programme level are again similar. Within the programme cycle, Member States plan to concentrate their mainstreaming efforts on measure design and indicator use , followed by partnership . This indicates a positive trend, namely that horizontal principal are indeed being incorporated into the logic of the policy intervention across the board.

As the figure below shows, patterns are similar. (Demography is somewhat different, but it has a very small number of cases, as shown on the right hand side axis of the graph). The conclusion is that mainstreaming plans mainly concern the measure design stage, followed by partnership, and indicator use. The use of mainstreaming overall is most frequent under the sustainability and equality principles. Figure 121 \u2013 The use of mainstreaming in the context of horizontal principles Specific actions The category \u201cspecific actions\u201d was also further analysed \u2013 according to thematic objectives and investment priorities in connection to which Member States indicated specific actions in the programmes. 98 At the level of thematic objectives, sustainable development, employment, as well as the fight against poverty and discrimination are most often referred to. 98 Data reflect the numbers of references in programming documents to planned specific ations aimed to promote horizontal principles, grouped according to the area of intervention (TO) they relate to.

The high scores allocated to the regulation as well as EC guidance materials suggests that the application of horizontal policy principles still seems to be a challenge \u2013 which was partially confirmed by the interviews (see below). The strong involvement of domestic partners is both to be expected, and to be registered positively. (See also Annex 4.17) As regards the negotiation process itself, horizontal priorities seem to have been among the less controversial ones. In over two thirds of the cases, member state authorities did not register a major difference in opinion. Where there were differences, the final result was, in most cases, a balanced compromise. For the remaining issues though, it was much rather the Member States that changed their initial positions than the Commission (9% vs. 3%). This suggests that the Commission managed to \u201cenforce\u201d a uniform, methodological approach across the Member States and programmes. (See also Annex 4.17) Going further into details, one survey question enquired in which area the new regulatory framework is expected to strengthen the practical application of horizontal principles. Responses were quite clear: the implementation of climate change and sustainable development principles is being seen as substantially improved. 18% saw no substantial change. (See Figure 123) 99 Member States interview responses coincided with the results of the survey. 99 Note to Figure 123 and Figure 124: multiple choice, therefore, numbers do not add up to 100%.)

        "176 Second, \u2013 as illustrated by Figure 124 \u2013 the survey explored, at what stage of the programme cycle Member States (managing authorities) intended to strengthen the promotion of horizontal objectives. Votes for planning, the selection of operations as well as monitoring & evaluation were quite evenly spread . Overall, it was only 16% of authorities that had no such plans. This indicates that Member States are indeed paying attention to this aspect of the regulations. Finally, the survey also asked whether the mechanisms to promote horizontal objectives had improved , overall, in comparison to the previous programming period. The outcome is rather undecided . On the four-degree scale used, 48 percent of respondents said that the application of horizontal principles had rather improved, but only 2 percent \u2013 3 respondents out of 149 \u2013 were fully satisfied. 13% saw no improvement at all, while 39% registered partial progress. (Figure 125) Similar was the outcome of the interviews. Several partners indicated that the ability of ESI Funds to address horizontal priorities had not improved, or that it had not had a discernible added value above that achieved through national legislation. Others did see a clear general improvement, as the legislative framework had become clearer, allowing national authorities to elaborate better guidelines, and devise specific mechanisms to better bring them to reality. In one Member State authorities mentioned in particular the introduction of the ex-ante conditionalities as helpful to raise awareness. As mentioned above, some survey results suggested that the application of horizontal principles may have been a challenge to some managing authorities. Nevertheless, Member States with a longer tradition working with cohesion policy indicated otherwise, and pointed to already existing practices for mainstreaming horizontal priorities into working processes. Several others criticised that horizontal requirements were more stringent in EU co-funded schemes. These did not always bear fruit, and may even have had a deterrent effect on beneficiaries, away from cohesion policy to nationally funded schemes. They also warned against the danger of increasing the administrative burden on beneficiaries through the emphasis on horizontal priorities. Some authorities from Member States also criticised that there was no sufficient guidance available from EU level, and that there was an insufficient level of understanding in national authorities on the meaning, significance and methods conducive for horizontal priorities.

On a more positive note, regarding opportunities to further improve the application of horizontal principles \u2013 again confirming survey results \u2013 several interview partners emphasised the pivotal role of partnership and consultations with agencies and NGOs active in the relevant policy area. Counterparts from other Member States considered that clear and instructive regulations had a major role to play. Financial incentives and the criteria for selecting projects were mentioned by several partners, too. The already established instruments of Strategic Environmental Assessments and Environmental Impact Assessments were not forgotten either. Guidelines for applicants and awareness-raising were considered important by a few authorities. 3.18.5 Specific conclusions Overall, t here seems to be an agreement between the EC and the Member States on the promotion of horizontal principles, and negotiations overall seem to have proceeded rather smoothly. Sustainable development, social inclusion and non-discrimination equally seem to receive attention, each being present in about 80% of programmes . These are well rooted in the logic of intervention and day-to-day practices of managing authorities, while such issue as accessibility, climate change and demography seem to receive comparatively less attention. About 2/3 of Member States intend to promote horizontal priorities through mainstreaming , integrating the attention to such priorities in the general programme planning, implementation and follow-up processes. In the survey, 84% of respondents indicated their intention to strengthen the management of horizontal principles. Ultimately, though, member state representatives were rather undecided whether or not the promotion of horizontal principles would improve in the new programming period, or not. There were also warnings that the pursuit of horizontal priorities was still a challenge, and that it should not lead to excessive administration, or an unwarranted complication of interventions, or programme monitoring.

        "178 3.19 E-C OHESION 3.19.1 Background The electronic exchange of data between the Commission and the Member States was already compulsory during the 2007-2013 programming period . For this purpose, a central information system was established by the Commission. The system was used to collect and transmit information regarding a number of key transactions, such as financial allocations, financing plans, statements of expenditure, annual forecasts of payments, as well as the financial sections of annual reports. Exchanges of data bore an electronic signature. 100 At the same time, the General Regulation on the Funds (1083/2006) for the period 2007-2013 did not contain provisions regarding the electronic exchange of information between programme authorities and beneficiaries . This has fundamentally changed for the new programming period . Article 74 (4) of the CPR upholds the principle of electronic data exchange between the EC and the Member States . But in addition, Art. 122 (3) lays down that Member States shall ensure that no later than 31 December 2015, all exchanges of information between beneficiaries and a managing authority , a certifying authority, an audit authority and intermediate bodies can be carried out by means of electronic data exchange systems . The relevant Implementation Guidelines on e-Cohesion (European Commission , 2014) lists a number of checkpoints on the basis of which compliance with the CPR needs to be tested: \uf0b7 The information system should cover all beneficiaries \uf0b7 The system should cover (as a minimum) transactions related to \u2012 Progress reporting \u2012 Expenditure declarations \u2012 Exchange of information related to management \u2012 Verifications \u2012 Audits \uf0b7 All information should be registered \u2018only once\u2019 \uf0b7 The information system should cover all authorities / bodies involved in the implementation of programmes \uf0b7 Beneficiaries should have the option to choose fully electronic communications, without a parallel paper trail \uf0b7 Specifically, the system should ensure \u2012 Data integrity and confidentiality \u2012 Authentication of the sender \u2012 Storage in compliance with retention rules \u2012 Secure transfer of data \u2012 Availability outside office hours \u2012 Data connection to relevant national IT systems (synchronisation, data recording) 100 Commission Implementing Regulation 1088/2006, Art. 39-42 ",

The study has assessed \u2013 based on Partnership Agreements \u2013 the information available regarding the current status of electronic information and management systems in Member States, as well as the expected future levels of e-services towards beneficiaries. Interviews were used to explore the pros and cons \u2013 potential benefits and difficulties of introducing a fully electronic data management and exchange. 3.19.2 Current and planned e-government service levels Specific data on e-service levels were found in 22 Partnership Agreements. For the remaining Member States, data were missing, unspecific, or incomplete. The analysis of both the current and planned e-service levels was made on the basis of allocating a score, for each stage of the programme cycle, to each member state based on their PAs (Figure 127): Figure 127 \u2013 Scale for assessing E-service levels Score / level Narrative 0 No e-government functions available 1 Information: online info about public services 2 Possibility to download of forms 3 Possibility to download and fill in forms, incl. authentication 4 Possibility of full electronic case handling; decision and delivery (payment) The stages of the programme cycle \u2013 as taken for the basis of the analysis \u2013 were defined as shown in Figure 128: Figure 128 - Code IT Stages CODE ITSTAGES Narrative INFORMATION Comprehensive, official, and up-to-date publication of programming documents, rules, guidance, and other useful materials CALLS Official; and \"real time\" publication of calls for proposals APPLICATIONS Option of official electronic submission of applications by beneficiaries without paper trail SELECTION Full computerisation of project assessment CONTRACTS Contracts with beneficiaries: electronic preparation / signature electronically EXCHANGES Information exchange (letters, notifications, statements) on different management issues PROGRESS Progress reporting without paper trail DECLARATION Declarations of expenditure via IT tools VERIFICATIONS Information exchange on verifications of costs CONTROL Information exchange on controls, audits Figure 129 calculates an average results for all Member States, at each stage of the project cycle from the data of all Partnership Agreements (i.e. those PAs that do contain ",

Figure 129 - E-cohesion according to current and planned e-services As the graph shows, the average levels for e-cohesion can be expected to improve , within the regulatory deadline, by almost an entire point (25%) on the 4 point e- service scale. Using the same scale, average results can also be calculated by Member State . Again, figures indicate that almost every member state is making progress. (See Annex 4.18). 3.19.3 Actions envisaged to boost e-service levels In addition, several actions are planned by Member States to upgrade of their e-cohesion IT systems in order to address the regulatory requirement in Art. 122(3): Figure 130 - Categorisation of actions for e-cohesion EGOVACT EGOVACT_Narrative Availability Availability of e-services outside office hours (24/7) Benef.

In line with the regulations, all of these countries envisage to provide beneficiaries with the option to choose full e-administration. Furthermore, about half of them also indicate the intention to eliminate the paper trail, to connect national databases, and to ensure that systems cover all national authorities. (See Annex 4.18) 3.19.4 The perception of E-cohesion rules During interviews, Member States showed themselves generally happy about the move towards fully electronic administration. Most saw the IT tools as a good way to introduce transparent, one-channel communication, reducing error rates, reducing administration and needs for archiving and optimising the work of the institutions involved. In several countries, already existing systems mean that the transition to full e- administration should not be a problem. Others, reported problems in the ability of the administration to work on a fully electronic basis . Counterparts in one Member State said that their national authorities already used electronic administration, which however were different, and not connected with each-other. In that sense, the new requirements are seen rather as a burden in their perspective. As counterparts in another Member State said: designing an easy-to-use system for beneficiaries is not an easy task at all. Further obstacles indicated included the lack of full broadband coverage , the inappropriateness of electronic administration in certain social cohesion projects , the need to redesign working processes in certain institutions, the low penetration of electronic signatures , or the costs of setting up the system, and training for the administration officials involved. As regards the architecture and location of the e-cohesion IT systems, Member States are planning to establish centralised systems , which are accessible to users \u2013 including those in regions \u2013 through internet portals . Where needed, the new systems will integrate already existing systems of other institutions. One Member State indicated that their system for the beneficiaries would be introduced step-by-step: first applications, then payments and reporting. Some are planning to reach IT targets by adding new functionalities to their existing systems, while others envisage a completely new system. Trainings for users were also mentioned as important preparatory steps. 3.19.5 Specific Conclusions Partnership Agreements were not designed to allow a fully detailed and specific assessment of systems functionalities either now, or at the expiry of the regulatory deadline of December 2015. Nevertheless, data from Partnership Agreements advocate clear progress in all Member States and with respect to all stages of the programme cycle . Data on actions to promote e-cohesion are particularly scarce in PAs. Still, interviews demonstrated that full electronic administration and electronic access for beneficiaries ",

(In money terms, the investment into Europe 2020-referenced TOs covers 58% of the programmes). NP 2 Thematic concentration \uf0b7 ERDF concentrates on strengthening research, technological development and innovation and the competitiveness of SMEs. \uf0b7 Cohesion Fund mainly invests in TO 4, and 7 \uf0b7 European Social Fund allocations distribute evenly in jointly financed programmes, mainly across thematic objectives 8-9-10. \uf0b7 Thematic objectives are not always exclusive . Almost one third of R&I (TO1) main results could have been programmed to TO2, TO3 and even TO4 thematic objectives. Environmental, climate change and network-related main results (TO4 to TO7) do show some overlap; and the same applies to employment, inclusion and education (TO8 to TO10). \uf0b7 As regards the investment priorities selected, references in the Operational and Co-operation Programmes concentrate in 30% of the investment priorities that account for 70% of the references. \uf0b7 Overall, a limited number of main results have been identified per thematic objective in Partnership Agreements. However, there were main results expected by the Member States that could not be directly related to thematic objectives, i.e. macro-economic and territorial results. \uf0b7 Thematic concentration received more attention during programming, and was also more controversial than other new provisions NP 3 Building of priority axes \uf0b7 29% of IGJ priority axes, but only 11% of ETC priority axes are combined. \uf0b7 As regards combining thematic objectives , environment-related objectives are favourite targets of complex priorities, while RTD, ICT and transport (and public administration) are rather addressed in simple axes. \uf0b7 Where the use of complex priority axes was considered \u2013 Member States did not see territorial instruments as an alternative. ",
        "184 NP Provision Title Key findings underlying the conclusion NP 4 Result-orientation ('Intervention logic') \uf0b7 OPs used a broad range (several hundred) of types of specific objectives, expected results, actions and selection principles. However, they used these types rather concentrated , as one quarter of them account for three quarters of the references. \uf0b7 Results and specific objectives have been defined mostly in line with the regulations and the Commission intents, rather consistently (with few methodological mistakes). \uf0b7 Actions and guiding principles of project selection , on the other hand, were subject to heavy debates and hard reconciliation processes with the domestic partners and (possibly as a consequence) have been too broadly defined . \uf0b7 As the survey shows, the dialogue with partners appears to have focussed on the definition of actions. Conversely, the dialogue with the EC was, apparently centred on improving the overall level of the intervention logic (objectives and results). \uf0b7 The transition from action-based programming to a result- based one seems to have proved difficult for Member States NP 5 Planned use of financial instruments \uf0b7 As regards the use of financial instruments in different Member States , 24 Member States intend to use such instruments,. \uf0b7 As regards the use of financial instruments in different policy tools , ERDF relies rather heavily on the use of financial instruments, while Cohesion Fund and ESF make much less use of them. European Territorial Co-operation programmes do not apply financial instruments. \uf0b7 The apparent reluctance of Member States to take up the SME initiative could be explained with several arguments. Several Member States considered that their own financial sectors were well capable of providing similar financial products without EIB assistance. Others considered the scheme too small and too expensive. NP 6 Planned use of major projects \uf0b7 The use of major projects is planned in at least 18 Member States (by the time of programme adoption). \uf0b7 Major projects are planned to be used under all TOs , except TO 8 and 11. \uf0b7 Phasing is widespread in all relevant TO and IPs. NP 7 Use of co-financing rates \uf0b7 There is variation in the co-financing rates , above all in more developed regions, transition regions, EU-15 Member States and co- operation programmes. At the same time, the Cohesion Fund and EU- 13 programmes mostly apply maximum rates. \uf0b7 As regards types of modulation , one third of the programmes foresee modulation . Almost two-thirds of indicated modulations address the importance of the priority axis for the delivery of the Europe 2020 strategy, having regard to the specific gaps to be addressed. NP 8 Territorial challenges in programming documents \uf0b7 Each Member State has identified territories for integrated territorial approaches. \uf0b7 Territorial challenges and needs are identified also by all of the Member States. \uf0b7 Survey responses indicated that programmes with purely sectoral approach are rather rare . \uf0b7 Ensuring a consistent approach with regard to territorial challenges identified and matching territorial challenges with the sectoral approach of the policies represented a challenge to Member States, according to the survey. \uf0b7 Every Member State has included in the programming documents provisions for coordination .

The overall take up of the instrument is, however, at less than around 0,8% of the total ERDF budget. \uf0b7 Main arguments of Member States pro CLLD are: appropriate tool to handle complex local problems ; motivation for partnership and involvement ; former experience gained through LEADER . \uf0b7 Main factors to eventually divert Member States from using CLLD were that it was felt to be more appropriate for rural development and EAFRD (compulsory); that it was perceived as complicated, burdensome , generated loss of efficiency, and needed extra administrative capacity. Some cases Member States felt that existing national instruments for similar purposes were easier to handle; or that too much responsibility/power would be delegated to local actors , majority of whom must be non-public. NP10 Integrated territorial investments \uf0b7 In OPs analysed, 20 Member States ( involving around one third (94) of the programmes , including 2 ETC programmes) have indicated their intention to start ITI. The total budgets reach almost 15 billion EUR, which represents around 4,2% of the cohesion policy allocation . \uf0b7 The majority of the countries use ITI for sustainable urban development . Slovakia, Spain, Portugal, Romania and Belgium use the bigger part of their allocation for other (non-urban) purposes. \uf0b7 Almost 90% of the ITIs analysed \u2013 in 16 Member States \u2013 are already identified . \uf0b7 Challenges, difficulties encountered by MAs during the preparation of ITIs, were: the definition of principles for the selection , approval and funding of ITIs; the elaboration o f high quality ITI strategies ; the definition of the role of ITIs ; and the identification of areas and/or challenges to be tackled with the help of ITI. \uf0b7 As data show, the delegation of functions to the sub-national level is rather limited. NP11 Sustainable urban development \uf0b7 Each Member State allocated at least 5% of its ERDF allocation (under the IJG goal) to integrated sustainable urban development, some of them significantly more (11 Member States), and 3 MSs much more, almost 20% of their national allocation. The EU average level is around 7,7% \uf0b7 80% of the SUD areas have already been identified . The elaboration of integrated urban development strategies is well under way. \uf0b7 It is only 16% of survey respondents reported difficulties. Difficulties most frequently mentioned are : the specification of geographical areas; quality of strategies; the perceived complicatedd nature of the tool; uncertainties regarding the status of intermediate body; and reservations about the availability of local capacities. \uf0b7 Around 60% of respondents envisaged capacity building actions for local authorities. \uf0b7 The delegation of implementing tasks from programme authorities to the local level above the compulsory project selection is rather limited.

Transnational actions with beneficiaries located in at least one other Member State were also identified. \uf0b7 Effective and timely cooperation in programming between IGJ and ETC was hampered by the fact that ETC programmes were lagging behind PA and OP programming proces s . \uf0b7 With respect to thematic coherence and operational realisation, coordination and cooperation the implementation phase will be crucial . NP 13 Specific needs of geographical areas most affected by poverty or target groups at highest risk of discrimination or social exclusion \uf0b7 16 PAs (thus Member States) and OPs from 19 Member States contain territories affected by poverty . The most frequent types of territories among poor regions are those with socially marginalised communities, urban-rural areas, and areas with permanent geographical or demographic handicaps. \uf0b7 Nevertheless, 17 PAs and only 28 OPs (from 12 Member States) contain an assessment of needs of vulnerable groups , and less than half of the Partnership Agreements comprise concrete actions for poor regions or vulnerable groups . \uf0b7 It is the unemployed, the young, disabled people and minorities that are most frequently identified by PAs and OPs as social groups most at risk of social exclusion. \uf0b7 OPs using ESF address all categories of vulnerable groups \u2013 while ERDF and CF OPs comparatively less to women, unemployed, poor people and young people. Actions envisaged concentrate heavily on human services, while other policy areas are less present. NP 14 Specific needs of geographical areas which suffer from severe and permanent natural or demographic handicaps \uf0b7 Around 30 programmes contain references to needs and actions of handicapped regions . PAs and OPs do not directly address all regions with permanent geographical handicaps as such, especially mountainous regions were not always mentioned as an issue to address through the ESI Funds. \uf0b7 The list of identified needs , priorities and objectives to be pursued for handicapped regions is dominated by employment, economy (SME) and connectivity , which reflects well the nature of handicaps in these territories. \uf0b7 The main difficulty which hinders implementation \u2013 according to MAs \u2013 was the lack of accurate statistical data and indicators specific to these areas. \uf0b7 No major difficulties with the use of this instrument.

Co- ordination during implementation is mentioned less often, which carries the danger that authorities may still work \u201cin silos\u201d, and synergy effects of combined and co-ordinated investments may not be realised after all. (For the ERDF, co-operation among MAs is more frequent, according to statistical analysis). \uf0b7 Objective of enhanced funds co-ordination was shared by both the Member States and the EU . During negotiations, co-ordination was uncontroversial . \uf0b7 Data from Task 3 confirm the general opinion by stakeholders that co-ordination did overall improve . Again, it remains to be seen whether practice will prove that expectation. NP 16 Administrative capacity building \uf0b7 Information about the capacity building needs and / or plans of authorities and beneficiaries in programming documents are there. However, plans appear to be little differentiated . \uf0b7 On the positive side, action plans at the level of authorities show a concentration on results-oriented management. \uf0b7 As regards capacity building actions beneficiaries , Member States plan to organise trainings and issue guidelines. Areas they focus on include project preparation, procurement, financial management, state aids, the use of simplified costs, as well as integrated territorial instruments. \uf0b7 The quality of action plans for capacity building does not seem to be very high. Overall, it is perhaps experience, rather than a new, clear- cut strategy that seems to drive the process of institution building. NP 17 Administrative burden \uf0b7 About half of countries performed a specific assessment of the administrative burden. \uf0b7 All Member States are reporting about plans to reduce the burden, and their plans are also similar, which suggests a coherent approach across the EU. On the other hand, their plans do not appear to be very differentiated . \uf0b7 The most important tools to reduce the burden seem to be e- cohesion and the introduction of simplified cost options , which are both a result of the new regulations. NP 18 Horizontal principles and policy objectives \uf0b7 Member states are paying considerable attention to the issue of horizontal principles. 84% of survey respondents reported intentions to strengthen horizontal principles at some stage of the programme cycle. \uf0b7 Sustainable development, social inclusion and non- discrimination are well integrated into Member States\u2019 practices. Accessibility, climate change and demography seem to receive comparatively less attention. \uf0b7 About 2/3 of Member States intend to promote horizontal principles through mainstreaming \uf0b7 More than half of programmes also referred to specific actions in one or more policy area(s). The list of these areas spreads across all thematic objectives . \uf0b7 Horizontal principles are an integral part of programme design. ",

Direct links to Europe 2020 allow monitoring strategic alignment in programming and during implementation. \uf0b7 Strategic programming was an area where there was a relatively high level of consensus between the two sides. \uf0b7 Flexibilities to transfer funds have been used in most cases to fight intra-regional imbalances and offset unwanted regulatory distortions in fund allocation \uf0b7 Linking operational programmes with a timeframe of ten years to a strategy of half of it may hinder strategic re- alignment. NP 2 Thematic concentration \uf0b7 The menu approach of thematic objectives and investment priorities made allocation and programming more transparent and programmes more apt to analysis and scrutiny. \uf0b7 A limited number of main results have been identified per thematic objective in Partnership Agreements. \uf0b7 Thematic concentration received more attention during programming, concentration requirements were respected, several times exceeded, channelling more funds to investment fields more important for the Europe 2020 strategy. \uf0b7 Thematic concentration was achieved on the level of the Community, making European added value more visible, both on the level of thematic objectives and regarding investment priorities. \uf0b7 Macro-economic and territorial goals identified by the Member States could not be directly related to thematic objectives and thus did not fit into the system. \uf0b7 Thematic objectives are not defined in an exclusive way, many main results were programmed to more than one thematic objectives. \uf0b7 The biggest allocation of ESI funds goes for promoting sustainable transport and removing bottlenecks in key network infrastructures, a thematic objective that is compatible but not in the heart of the Europe 2020 strategy. ",
        "190 NP Provision Title Strengths Weaknesses NP 3 Building of priority axes \uf0b7 The regulatory framework of the ERDF and CF allow for programming priority axes along strategic goals, drawing freely from the available pool of interventions, making holistic approaches and place-based policies easier to program and to adjust during implementation. \uf0b7 ESF-funded priority axes are easy to monitor and control to finance strategic goals defined in the Europe 2020 strategy and especially in the Country-Specific Recommendations. \uf0b7 Priority axes implemented solely through community-led local development amount for two-thirds the overall Cohesion policy resources allocated to CLLDs. \uf0b7 In priority axes financed by regional policy funds (ERDF /CF), there is no breakdown of the financial allocations behind investment priorities, actions and specific objectives. (For the ESF there is a tentative breakdown for fields of action, which directly relate to IPs) \uf0b7 Simple priority axes tend to be smaller and more numerous than combined ones. This problem is relatively more pronounced in the case of programmes jointly financed with the ESF. \uf0b7 Justifications provided for the use of combined axes were often missing or poor. \uf0b7 Despite the special incentives to create priority axes dedicated to certain delivery mechanisms, the number of dedicated axes is small. NP 4 Result-orientation ('Intervention logic') \uf0b7 Basic elements of the intervention logic had to be specifically defined, easing monitoring and ensuring assessment. \uf0b7 Concentration is apparent, one quarter of the specific objectives, expected results, actions and guiding principles of selection account for three quarters of the total references. \uf0b7 Definition of investment priorities is well-detailed yielding misplaced results and actions below 2%. \uf0b7 The choice of specific objectives, actions and result indicators were at the heart of the negotiations during the planning process and usually compromise solutions were achieved. \uf0b7 The logical link between actions and specific objectives cannot be reproduced based on programming data, since actions are not established at the level of investment priorities. \uf0b7 The process to move from action-based programming to a result-based one, especially defining indicators, has been very demanding, and often difficult for Member States. \uf0b7 The definitions of actions and guiding principles for the selection of operations is not clear and precise in about two-thirds of the cases (i.e. too broad, or missing). \uf0b7 Domestic partners are interested in the actions and selection rules, rather than in objectives and measurable results creating a solid base for result orientation and accountability. NP 5 Planned use of financial instruments \uf0b7 Justification why to use financial instruments correspond to the goals they want to obtain. \uf0b7 The use of financial instruments were substantially extended in width (planned to be used under at least 9 thematic objectives) and depth (24 Member States stated their intention to implement such schemes). \uf0b7 The SME initiative uptake is low, it is considered complicated and expensive. Some Member States also consider that it came too late and might create unwanted dependence on an external player instead of contributing to developing a well-functioning domestic microcredit system.

Survey shows also that programmes with pure sectoral approach are rather rare, the vast majority of programmes reflect territorial approach, most of them entirely, and one third by integrating it into sectoral policies. \uf0b7 Practices for the promotion of territorial approach in programming and implementation most mentioned by interviewees are: the existence of a characteristic national regional development policy/strategy; the institutional involvement of regional actors in programming; and specific methods during the implementation phase: application of selection criteria giving priority to projects contributing to ITI programs; necessity to justify a project by diagnosis of the local situation and analysis of territorial impact; harmonisation of timing of calls for proposals. \uf0b7 Every Member State has included in the programming documents provisions for coordination. \uf0b7 However, there are 45 OPs and 12 ETC programmes which do not have territorial analysis (contain neither information on the type of the territory covered nor on external (territorial) challenges and even not on territorial needs. \uf0b7 Ensuring consistent approach with regard to territorial challenges identified and matching territorial challenges with the sectoral approach of the policies represented a challenge to Member States, according to the survey. \uf0b7 Reasons given for opposing the use new territorial instruments above the compulsory extent included furthermore, e.g., that they were \u201ctoo complicated and inflexible\u201d, the wish not to give too much power and responsibility to local actors (who were not sufficiently experienced), and the inappropriateness of the tool to programmes specific challenges/intentions.

In relative terms the average allocation to CLLD at EU-level (EU average) is around 0,8% of the ERDF budget. \uf0b7 13 priority axes of 10 operational programmes implemented solely through community-led local development stand for 65% of the overall allocation to CLLD \u2013 what shows that the use of CLLD is rather concentrated, the majority of OPs and priority axes are not concerned by it. \uf0b7 Main factors to divert Member States from using CLLD (cons) were: more appropriate for rural development and EAFRD (compulsory), less for TOs of more developed areas; it is complicated, burdensome, generates loss of efficiency, needs extra administrative capacity - in some cases existence of national instruments easier to handle; too much responsibility/power to local actors, majority of whom must be non-public; difficulties linked to the identification of areas and selection, approval and funding of LAGs and CLLD strategies.

The delegation of project selection is compulsory under SUD (which influences results on ITI, too). Otherwise, it is mostly planning and monitoring where \u2013 based on partnership \u2013 the local level will have a major role to play. NP11 Sustainable urban development \uf0b7 According to Table 10 of the OPs (and Table 9 of ETC programmes) all Member States have complied to Art. 7 ERDF requirement. Some of them allocated significantly more (11 Member States), and 3 MSs much more, 15- 20% of their national allocation. \uf0b7 Main arguments of Member States pro SUD are: previous experience of similar instrument; possibility for local capacity building and partnership; partnership also between different administrative levels; appropriate tool for complex, integrated projects addressing specific needs. \uf0b7 80% of the SUD Areas have already been identified and a further 10% are planned to be identified by the end of 2016 \u2013 with only 10% left to for \u2018later\u2019. The elaboration of integrated urban development strategies is under way, one third of them is under consultation (approval), 30% are already approved or under implementation. \uf0b7 As a response to the survey, around 60% of respondents envisaged capacity building actions for local authorities. \uf0b7 Inconsistent encoding practices in some Member States between Tables 10 (categories of expenditure) and 20 (SUD allocations) of the OPs. \uf0b7 The delegation of project selection in SUDs is compulsory. Delegation of further implementing tasks to the local level (on top of project selection) is rather limited. \uf0b7 Several kinds of challenges, difficulties occurred during the implementation of SUDs, such as: difficulties related to the status of intermediate body; reluctance of managing authority to delegate certain implementation responsibilities to cities; the specification of geographical area, the selection criteria to be used for the designation of cities; the complicated and burdensome nature of the tool; the lack of knowledge of the tool by the programmers; the elaboration of high quality territorial development strategies; lack of capacities of cities in strategy making, programming, and implementation.

The greatest numbers of referrals point to the Strategy for the Baltic Sea Region and the Danube Strategy. \uf0b7 Interregional and transnational actions with beneficiaries located in at least one other Member State were also identified. \uf0b7 Effective and timely cooperation in programming was hampered by the fact that ETC programmes were lagging behind PA and OP programming process. \uf0b7 Since no specific funding or projects have been earmarked in the \u201cmainstream\u201d programmes, MAs consider of high importance cooperation during the implementation phase.

Vulnerable groups have been identified in 17 PAs (Member States) and OPs from 16 Member States. \uf0b7 Although territories affected by poverty and vulnerable groups have been identified in part of the programming document, not all them in fact contain an assessment of needs of vulnerable groups (only 28 OPs in 12 Member States) and less than half of the Partnership Agreements comprise concrete actions for poor regions or vulnerable groups. \uf0b7 Planned actions concern most of all \u201chuman services\u201d, such as employment, education and social and antidiscrimination policy, other fields of policy necessary for an integrated approach (e.g.: SME) are much less present. \uf0b7 There is a lack of systematic and reliable data, especially at local level.

Planned actions cover a wide range of areas, which suggests an integrated approach. \uf0b7 There were very few difficulties mentioned by Member States in the application of the provisions on handicapped regions. This is most likely thanks to the considerable experience the countries concerned have already accumulated with these types of instruments. \uf0b7 PAs and OPs do not directly address all regions with permanent geographical handicaps as such. Especially mountainous regions were not always mentioned as an issue to address through the ESI Funds (out of the 17 possible countries only 9 mentioned). \uf0b7 Among the programmes where permanent geographical handicaps had been identified, a few of them only contains reference to needs and actions of handicapped regions (around 30). \uf0b7 The main difficulty which hinders implementation according to MAs is the lack of accurate data and indicators specific to these areas.

The general methods to do statistical analysis are: a.) Correspondence analysis \u2013 determining whether or not the behaviour of two codes showed a statistically significant correspondence; or b.) Cluster analysis \u2013 determining whether or not coding results for a given cluster of programmes \u2013 grouped according to a set of 10 criteria used uniformly across all provisions \u2013 could be statistically differentiated. The preconditions to mentioning such correlations in the report are that \uf0b7 computer-based statistical analysis finds a significant correlation or differentiation of results, with a sufficiently high degree of probability. \uf0b7 the detected correlation refers to a number of cases (programme documents) that can be seen as representative for the entire policy, rather than just a small number of elements in the overall database. The determination of whether or not this is the case, was the responsibility of a dedicated sectoral expert in charge of analysis in relation to the given provision. For Contingency Analysis we have used Pearson\u2019s \u03c7 2 (chi-squared) test .

        "200 For example, in the case of arrangements for co-ordinating, the analysis has found that the combination of instruments was indeed slightly different for individual ESI funds: ERDF programmes were more likely to invite representatives of managing authorities from other programmes for joint decision making; Cohesion Fund programmes were more likely to perform cross-border consultations, while for the ESF a coordinated programming approach (\u201cthe synergetic use of funds\u201d) seems especially important.

(see cells highlighted in red). The existence of borderline cases and inconsistencies shows that in the negotiation process, there was some flexibility when defining main results expected by TO. Nevertheless, as demonstrated in the Figure, in the majority of the cases, main results were generally associated with one thematic objective (cf. green cells). Considering the frequency of \"borderline cases per TO\" \u2013 i.e. the frequency numbers in red and yellow cells pertaining to the rows or columns associated with a TO \u2013 one can conclude that \uf0b7 the definitions of thematic objectives 01 related to RDI; 05 related to climate change adaptation and risk prevention; and 06 related to environment protection may have been insufficiently clear . \uf0b7 There is also some overlap between ESF-related thematic objectives , as inclusive education and lifelong learning may be associated with combating poverty and improving education as well. \uf0b7 a number of cross-cutting territorial challenges \u2013 (the bottom four rows of the table) that had been identified in PAs with no clear correspondence to any thematic objective, therefore illustrating the fact that the reformed policy does not only address sectoral needs but also macroeconomic and territorial needs.

        "264 A statistical analysis of programme level data showed that while patterns are similar for all three funds \u2013 e.g. as regards the generally high importance of programming, or the use of a co-ordination body, etc. \u2013 statistical analysis reveals some differences (significant correlations) with respect to the approaches to co-ordination. According to the data: \uf0b7 ERDF programmes are more likely than others to \u2012 use \u201ccross-participation of MAs in decision-making \u2013 i.e. involve other MAs in project selection; \u2012 co-operate with other programmes in monitoring, evaluations, control and audit. \uf0b7 Cohesion Fund programmes, \u2012 the co-ordination body in the sense of Art. 123 (8) is seen to play an important role. \u2012 Regular cross-border consultations are also frequently mentioned. \uf0b7 For the ESF, the importance of coordination in programming is relatively high, even higher than for other funds. Co-ordination arrangements by Member State The use of different co-ordination methods by Member State is shown in Figure 188 below. As it can be seen from the table, most Member States indicate that programming has a key role in the co-ordination of funds, either \u201cactively\u201d, through a synergetic use of funds, or \u201cpassively\u201d i.e. through clear demarcations, minimising the need for co- ordination. The other type of most frequently used co-ordination arrangements are, again, committees \u2013 at strategic-political levels (including committees between the government and regions \u2013 as well as technical level (e.g. between MAs).

One way to do that would be to assume that e- service levels of \uf0b7 (3) - Two-way interaction: processing of forms, incl. authentication \uf0b7 (4) \u2013 Transaction: case handling are those that allow for a full electronic exchange of information and e-administration between authorities and beneficiaries (at the relevant stages of the programme cycle). Based on this logic, and the data from the Partnership Agreements, Belgium, Finland, Italy, Slovenia and Spain would already have e-service levels that comply with regulatory requirements. As to future planned levels, Croatia, Cyprus, Denmark, Hungary, Lithuania, Luxembourg and Slovakia could also be added to the list. Poland and Sweden seem very close to the objective.
