        "In January 2002 the EU Institute for Security Studies (EUISS) became an autonomous Paris-based agency of the European Union. Following an EU Council Joint Action of 20 July 2001, it is now an integral part of the new structures that will support the further develop- ment of the CFSP/ESDP. The Institute\u2019s core mission is to provide analyses and recommendations that can be of use and relevance to the formulation of the European security and defence policy. In carrying out that mission, it also acts as an interface between European experts and decision-makers at all levels. Chaillot Papers are monographs on topical questions written either by a member of the EUISS research team or by outside authors chosen and commissioned by the Institute. Early drafts are normally discussed at a semi- nar or study group of experts convened by the Institute and publication indicates that the paper is considered by the EUISS as a useful and authoritative contribution to the debate on CFSP/ESDP.

En moins de deux d\u00e9cennies, la R\u00e9publique populaire s\u2019est en effet affirm\u00e9e comme un acteur majeur de la mondialisation \u00e9conomique (elle g\u00e9n\u00e8re aujourd\u2019hui 5% de la richesse mondiale) ; comme une pi\u00e8ce ma\u00eetresse pour l\u2019\u00e9volution du march\u00e9 de l\u2019\u00e9nergie (12% de la demande mondiale) ; comme la premi\u00e8re puissance d\u00e9mographique du monde (20% de la population mondiale, soit l\u2019\u00e9quivalent de ce que repr\u00e9sentaient les puissances europ\u00e9ennes au XIX e si\u00e8cle, au plus fort de leur domination) ; enfin, comme un partenaire difficile mais indispensable pour la solution des crises majeures, s\u2019agissant notamment de la lutte contre la prolif\u00e9ration nucl\u00e9aire nord-cor\u00e9enne ou iranienne. A tous \u00e9gards, les \u00e9volutions que suivront, ou ne suivront pas, les politiques chinoises risquent d\u2019\u00eatre beau- coup plus d\u00e9terminantes pour la prosp\u00e9rit\u00e9 et la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 internationales que celles de n\u2019importe quelle autre puissance du vieil ensemble occidental. Une telle concentration de pouvoirs ne va pas sans soulever imm\u00e9diate- ment de multiples interrogations, qui sont parfois autant d\u2019inqui\u00e9tudes. Quels sont les objectifs de la puissance chinoise, la pr\u00e9servation du statu quo r\u00e9gional en Asie ou la contestation de ce qui reste de domination occidentale, et plus particuli\u00e8rement am\u00e9ricaine, sur le syst\u00e8me international?

        "Introduction Marcin Zaborowski With its booming economy, China is emerging as the key player in Asia-Pacific and possibly as the world\u2019s next superpower. So far, China has mainly developed as a \u2018trading power\u2019 \u2013 concentrating on the expansion of its economy and retaining a relatively restricted international role. However, there is no doubt that the dynamic rise of China\u2019s poses major challenges to the status quo in the region with consequences for its neighbours and other powers present there, such as the US and, increasingly, also the EU. Clearly, China has always been a power to be reckoned with, but over the last decade its influence and \u2018punch\u2019 at the global level have grown at an accelerated pace, changing the international sys- tem. There are three major areas in which \u2018China\u2019s rise\u2019 is begin- ning to have global implications: (cid:90) The economy \u2013 the impact of China\u2019s economic expansion has been affecting global markets since the 1990s. In the last few years, China\u2019s trade surplus as well as its stock of foreign cur- rency and bonds have grown to the point at which Beijing\u2019s poli- cies are key factors shaping the global economy. (cid:90) Energy \u2013 in the last five years China has become an energy importer; it is already the world\u2019s second biggest energy con- sumer (the first being the US). China\u2019s demand for energy has pushed prices up with implications for other consumers and for the geopolitics of energy-rich regions. (cid:90) Global governance \u2013 in response to its growing energy needs China has invested in some states in the Middle East and Africa, where its interests and relationships with local regimes are often in conflict with both the US and the EU. This raises the question as to whether China sees itself as a shareholder in global governance and international security or not. 9 Facing China\u2019s rise: Guidelines for an EU strategy cp94.qxp 09/01/2007 16:56 Page 9 ",
        "What are the implications of China\u2019s rise for the EU? The transatlantic dispute over the arms embargo highlighted the need for the EU to develop its own security perspective on China, which would address, among others, the issues of China\u2019s defence policy and the modernisation of its military, the security situation in East Asia and Pacific as well as China\u2019s energy policy. In response to these questions, this Chaillot Paper provides an analysis of some aspects of China\u2019s domestic transformation and its evolving inter- national relations with a view to providing guidelines towards the development of effective EU strategic thinking on China. Outline of this Chaillot Paper The Chaillot Paper is divided into three parts: the first one deals with various aspects of China\u2019s domestic transformation, the second focuses explicitly on foreign policy and the third addresses the EU\u2019s China policy. Part One, China\u2019s domestic transformation and the changing world order , includes chapters on trade and the economy, democ- ratisation and military modernisation. Duncan Freeman\u2019s chapter on trade and the economy discusses the impact of China\u2019s expand- ing trade on the EU and the wider world. The chapter also deals with the question of whether China\u2019s growing economic status is a threat or an opportunity for the EU. The chapter on democratisa- tion by Peter Ferdinand considers whether China is evolving towards a liberal democracy and whether the EU has a role to play in promoting an open society in China. In the last chapter in this section Eberhard Sandschneider discusses China\u2019s military mod- ernisation and the views and perspectives of the US and the EU on this matter. Part Two, China\u2019s Foreign Policy , consists of chapters dealing with China\u2019s regional role, its energy policy and Sino-American rela- tions. The contribution by Fran\u00e7ois Godement on China\u2019s role in East Asia deliberates whether Beijing\u2019s foreign policy behaviour is becoming hegemonic or benign and focused on exercising its influ- ence primarily through economic means. The chapter by Philip Andrews-Speed looks at China\u2019s energy policy and its broader international implications in the context of the energy market and 10 Introduction cp94.qxp 09/01/2007 16:56 Page 10 ",
        "global security. Marcin Zaborowski\u2019s chapter analyses China\u2019s rela- tions with its most important strategic partner \u2013 the US. This chap- ter argues that although dynamic and intense this relationship remains overall quite ambivalent. Part Three, Assembling an EU-China strategy , includes two con- tributions, both of which deal with EU-China relations. The chap- ter by Axel Berkofsky addresses the key developments in the rela- tionship between the EU and China, posing the question whether these relations are truly \u2018strategic\u2019 as argued in key EU documents. The final chapter by Antonio Tanca discusses the EU\u2019s developing China strategy. 11 Marcin Zaborowski cp94.qxp 09/01/2007 16:56 Page 11 ",

        "China\u2019s rise and the global economy: challenges for Europe Duncan Freeman Introduction In recent years both the general public and the political classes in Europe have come to realise that the economic transformation of China that began in the late 1970s has a direct impact on their interests. Today what happens in China is given as much attention as events in almost any other nation, and this is especially true in the economic field. \u2018Market moving\u2019 events today are just as likely to be occur in China as in any other part of the world. There are good reasons for this. Decisions made in China now can have an immediate as well as long-term economic impact throughout the world. Suddenly the influence of China is seen in everything from the price of raw materials and oil to the imbalances in world trade, and in economies from East Asia to Latin America. 1 Viewed from the perspective of history, China is far from being a new factor in the world economy. What is certainly new is the degree of its current impact in the modern world, and the speed with which it has achieved this from a position of marginality that followed a long historic decline and then period of isolation fol- lowing 1949. The Chinese economy has become increasingly inter- nationalised. Foreign trade and investment have been significant factors in the rapid growth of the economy, especially since the 1990s. China has been extremely successful in attracting foreign investment, which in recent years has been arriving at the rate of about US$50 billion a year, although in per capita terms the amounts are relatively small, and are only a small proportion of total investment in the Chinese economy. In trade, the change has been enormous. In 2004 China was the world\u2019s third largest exporter after Germany and the US, and accounted for 6.5% of world exports. 2 It was also the third largest importer, after the US and Germany, accounting for 5.9% of world 15 Facing China\u2019s rise: Guidelines for an EU strategy 1.

        "1 imports. In 2004, exports of goods and services were the equiva- lent of 34% of China\u2019s GDP, compared with 23% in 2000. In the other direction, imports in 2004 were equivalent to 31% of GDP, compared with 21% in 2000. 3 As its role in the international economy has grown, so too has China\u2019s economic relationship with Europe. The EU is now China\u2019s biggest trade partner, 4 having recently overtaken the US which for many years had occupied that position. However, the US is still China\u2019s largest export market, followed by the EU. From the European perspective, China is much less important as a trade partner than the US. Nevertheless, China\u2019s share of EU trade is growing rapidly. Both Chinese and European political leaders tend to express satisfaction with this developing economic rela- tionship, and it is true that the atmosphere is generally considered to be very positive. Nevertheless, there are voices of disquiet in Europe that pose the question of whether the relationship should be seen so positively, or whether China should be seen as some- thing other than an economic partner. China: a threat or an opportunity? The economic impact of China is often characterised in terms of threats and opportunities, or more neutrally as challenges. Of course, the perception of economic threats and opportunities depends very much on the position from which they are viewed. Nevertheless, it is clear that the challenges presented by China to Europe are many. In crude economic terms, the negative aspect of the relation- ship is often portrayed, especially in the media, as a flood of imports from China which threaten European companies and jobs, and by extension the wider economy and even the fabric of European society. At a general level, the facts appear obvious: the EU has a large and growing trade deficit with China and Europe imports ever-increasing amounts of cheap Chinese goods. Although in recent years EU exports to China have been rising, this has been far outpaced by imports from China. Over the past five years the EU trade deficit with China has more than doubled. 16 China\u2019s rise and the global economy: challenges for Europe 3. World Bank estimates.

        "1 Source : Eurostat. However, these simple figures do not tell the whole story. Focus on a single bilateral trade statistic fails to capture the complex trading relationships which exist in a world of globalisation. China is increasingly part of an integrated world economy where complex production arrangements are the norm. A large propor- tion of \u2018Chinese\u2019 exports to Europe are in fact goods that are often manufactured in several Asian countries, of which China is the last in the chain. There has been a rapid shift in patterns of trade from Asia in recent years, as China imports parts and materials from the region, and then exports finished products to markets in the US and EU. This has resulted in a sharp decline in the trade surpluses of most major Asian economies with Europe, most notably Japan. As a result, the EU trade deficit with East Asia (apart from China) 5 in 2005 was significantly less than its peak in 2000. China, on the other hand, now has substantial trade deficits with most major Asian economies. Indeed, the Chinese argue that since the value added in China in these processes is often low, it is the other Asian economies that are the real beneficiaries of these trading patterns. 17 Duncan Freeman 5.

        "1 Source : Eurostat. Arguably, if concerns are limited to trade itself, Europe is not just faced with a challenge from China, but from the fact of Asia\u2019s increasing economic integration. China may be a central pillar of this integration, but it is one part of a much broader phenomenon. Furthermore, this integration also increasingly directly involves European companies that operate in Asia. Foreign invest- ment enterprises accounted for 58% of all Chinese exports in 2005. 6 European companies have been significant investors in China, and many others have supply chains that include China. Very often, the ultimate beneficiaries of China\u2019s export boom are foreign companies, including those from Europe. This integration and competition creates conflicting interests. The most obvious examples of this are textiles and footwear, which have been the subject of disputes between the EU and China. According to the advocates of European domestic manu- facturers in these sectors, unrestrained Chinese exports will destroy businesses and jobs in Europe, and are the result of funda- mentally unfair trade practices on the part of China. This view is contested not just by China and its producers, but also by many European companies that import and sell Chinese products, as well as by those that have invested in production in China. As a wider economic question, the extent to which the trade deficit with China represents a problem for Europe is debatable. Taken as a whole, the EU does not suffer from significant trade or 18 China\u2019s rise and the global economy: challenges for Europe 6. PRC Ministry of Commerce sta- tistics.

On the contrary, in recent years, the EU has enjoyed small current account surpluses on several occa- sions. Although the problems might appear similar, it would be wrong to simply conflate the EU and US deficits with China, and ascribe them to the same causes. Source : International Monetary Fund. While Europe may have macro-economic grounds for not being too concerned by the bilateral trade balance with China, Chinese competition is seen as a threat by many business sectors in the EU. For those sectors that do face competition from Chinese exports, this is a serious problem, especially for those workers threatened with losing their jobs. To some, China\u2019s capacity for competition is a wider threat not just to specific European indus- trial sectors, but even to Europe\u2019s social and economic model. Whether this is the case remains to be proven. It is unclear that either imports from China, or delocalisation of jobs to China, have contributed significantly to the wider problems of economies in Europe. Many of the problems of the European social market eco- nomic model predate the emergence of China as a significant actor in the world economy, and there are many other external fac- tors as important as China. According to many of its defenders, 19 Duncan Freeman Current Account Balance 1995-2005 -1000 -800 -600 -400 -200 0 200 400 1995 1996 1997 1998 1999 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 US$ billion Euro area European Union China Japan United States cp94.qxp 09/01/2007 16:56 Page 19 ",
        "1 the main threat to this model appears to come from within the EU, from the UK and Eastern European members. Of course, whether social dumping and the Polish plumber are really the threats they have been made out to be is another question. On the other hand, the economic success of Scandinavian countries indicates that with the right policies it is possible to compete in the world economy and have a strong welfare state, although it is difficult to know how far the lessons can be gener- alised for the rest of Europe. As the success of the Scandinavian economies has shown, the failure of many European economies in job creation is a more fundamental problem than the threat of jobs being destroyed by external competition. Repercussions of the Chinese economy on the world economy In large part the Lisbon Agenda was intended to address some of these fundamental problems of the European economy, but progress in achieving its goals has been limited. Against the view that European industries need to be protected from Chinese com- petition, Trade Commissioner Peter Mandelson has argued that they should receive no protection for its own sake: they must com- pete in an open trading system, and at the same time the competi- tiveness agenda must be pushed forward. Whether this can solve the longer term problem remains to be seen. This argument sidesteps the question of what happens as the Chinese economy itself develops, since it too is seeking to develop new industries that have higher value added and are in high-tech- nology sectors. In the longer term, the threat to European compa- nies from these new industries in China may be as great as that from cheap textiles and footwear. For many years these low value added goods represented a declining proportion of China\u2019s exports. While these are vital industries that employ huge num- bers of people, China itself does not wish to remain at the bottom end of the technological ladder, but is increasingly focused on developing its own high-technology industries. In 2004 high-tech- nology exports accounted for 30% of China\u2019s manufactured exports, compared with only 19% in 2000. 7 Already in 2005 the Commission has highlighted the fact that R&D spending in China is growing much faster than it is in the EU. Furthermore, 20 China\u2019s rise and the global economy: challenges for Europe 7. World Bank statistics. See: http://devdata.worldbank.org/ data-query/. cp94.qxp 09/01/2007 16:56 Page 20 ",
        "1 there is a growing trend for Western companies to set up R&D cen- tres in China. Aside from these broader issues, the EU will have to continue managing the day-to-day problems of the relationship with China. Although the leaders of Europe and China may wish to emphasise the positive, there are many areas where problems occur. China remains the leading target for anti-dumping actions by the EU. These actions will continue, as European producers will attack what they see as unfair trade. In return, Chinese producers will attack what they consider to be an unfair form of trade pro- tectionism. On the other side of the coin, Market Economy Status (MES) remains an important issue for the Chinese government and producers who are caught in anti-dumping actions. Apart from its practical implications, the Chinese government attaches considerable symbolic importance to this issue. However, given the EU\u2019s insistence that it is a purely technical question whose res- olution will depend on a number of quite fundamental changes in the Chinese system, this issue is unlikely to disappear soon. Concerning trade in the other direction, the EU will continue to press for better access to markets in China. Although European companies recognise that China has made great progress in open- ing up its economy, they also believe that they face significant bar- riers. Despite the efforts made by China in implementing its World Trade Organisation (WTO) commitments, there are still restrictions on the activities of foreign companies in many sectors, especially in services, which are increasingly important to the European economy. At the same time, the problem of protection of intellectual property in China will remain a critical issue for European companies. European companies operating in China are increasingly urging the EU to press China on issues such as these. These issues are in large part the result of a rapidly developing economic relationship, and are by no means unique to the EU and China. Similar problems have been raised in the past by the emer- gence of other economies, and they can even occur in mature eco- nomic relationships such as that between the EU and the US. However China raises some broader problems that go beyond those associated with other economies. For instance, China\u2019s success in exporting, even if it is often only part of the production chain, and in attracting foreign invest- ment has allowed it to accumulate huge foreign exchange reserves, 21 Duncan Freeman cp94.qxp 09/01/2007 16:56 Page 21 ",
        "1 currently close to US$1 trillion, the largest in the world. These reserves have been mostly invested in US government debt. It is sometimes argued that China can use these holdings to exercise the apparent power they give by selling a part of its hold- ings, or simply by not purchasing as much US government debt as it has in the past. However, the challenge they present is not really the power that they are sometimes perceived as bestowing on China. Any action of this kind would be a two-edged sword, dam- aging China as much as the US. The real challenge is what happens if the current cycle can no longer be sustained. Until now the cycle of China exporting to the US and then lending it the proceeds has brought benefits to both sides. If it cannot be sustained, for instance when indebted US consumers can no longer continue increasing their purchases of Chinese goods, then the conse- quences will be serious, and will extend beyond their own bilateral relationship to affect the rest of the world. Even if it may have little influence over the outcome, Europe will not be a mere bystander, but will be directly affected by how this imbalance is resolved. The fundamental imbalance in China\u2019s relationship with the US may be a major problem facing the world economy, but the effects of China\u2019s economic rise are to be seen in many other ways. Most notably, more and more attention is being paid to China\u2019s growing demand for raw materials, and, more importantly, energy and its efforts to secure supplies abroad. China now imports about 12% of its total energy needs, 8 a significant increase on even a few years ago. Through its purchases of commodities and investments in production, China\u2019s role is growing in many parts of the world where previously its direct interests were limited. But as China plays an increasing role, it is not clear that it is playing by the same rules as the EU or other established actors such as the US. This challenge is not just economic, but also political. Most recently this has been seen in China\u2019s growing activities in Africa, Sudan being the most notable example, where it is often accused of being unconcerned with problems such as human rights or corruption in its search for sources of oil or other commodities. So far, these issues have not been a part of the many dialogues that take place between the EU and China, but as Chinese interests throughout the world expand, so will the policy challenges for Europe, and the need for them to be addressed. 22 China\u2019s rise and the global economy: challenges for Europe 8.

        "1 Policy challenges for the EU Emerging challenges such as those created by China\u2019s expanding role in Africa will require new approaches by the EU. However, the fact that from the EU perspective China does not play by the rules there does not mean that there is nothing that can be done. The economic history of China in the past 25 years is in large part a story of its integration into the world economy, and its increasing accept- ance of the established rules by which it operates. Most notably, entry into the WTO was a major step in bringing the actual role of China in the world economy under the established rules. However, an even greater challenge will arrive as China is increasingly required not just to obey the rules, but also to make them. Already, the EU as well as the US have been calling for China to play a more active role in the Doha Development Agenda. So far China has been reluctant to respond positively to these calls, but clearly its standing and influence in the major international insti- tutions such as the WTO, IMF and World Bank will only continue to strengthen. However, despite the reforms of the past decades, and the enormous changes that have occurred in virtually every aspect of China, it is clear that there are many differences between China and the major Western economies which have dominated the rule-making of the world economy for over 50 years. Further- more, China also has interests that do not necessarily coincide with those of the other major economies. Until now China has generally accepted the rules of the game, even if at times it has not fully played by them. A major challenge will come if China attempts to change the rules of the game, or more strongly assert its own interests within the current rules. The challenges that China is perceived to present are largely based on the assumption that its economy will continue develop- ing as it has since the late 1970s. An even greater challenge than all those resulting from the present trends continuing, would be if they were reversed and economic failure occurred in China. The possibility of the failure of China\u2019s economic reforms has been debated almost since their inception. This debate continues, as observers outside China, and even within the country, point to the many serious domestic problems that must be tackled. The Chi- nese government faces many difficulties in sustaining economic reforms and growth. The challenges faced by the Chinese govern- 23 Duncan Freeman cp94.qxp 09/01/2007 16:56 Page 23 ",
        "1 ment are well known, and range from reform of the banking sys- tem through to reversing the severe environmental degradation that has occurred. These challenges are internal, but their success- ful resolution will have an impact beyond China\u2019s borders. Even in Europe, there is a real interest in ensuring that the development of the Chinese economy does continue. Whether the problems are successfully dealt with will in large measure depend on the policies adopted by the Chinese govern- ment. Nevertheless, the EU can play a role in aiding the decision- making process, as it has been doing through the increasing con- tact it has with China in many policy areas. In reality much of the European response to China\u2019s economic growth has been driven by individual companies that have been trading and investing there. It is they, rather than policy-makers, that have established the business foundations of the economic relationship with China, and it is this economic foundation which remains the most substantial element in the EU-China relation- ship. To the extent that China is a threat to Europe, many of the solu- tions will depend on the policies adopted by the EU and its Mem- ber States. Europe\u2019s internal actions, for instance, advancement of the Lisbon Agenda, will have as much impact on meeting the Chi- nese challenge as any polices directed specifically at China. Euro- pean governments have responded to China\u2019s rise in the world col- lectively through the EU, as well as at the level of individual Member States. The pinnacle of this response has been the Strate- gic Partnership that the EU has entered into with China, although this deals with a broad range of questions without any focus on economic issues. Much of the substance of forming the economic response has been in the hands of the European Commission which has been responsible for the direction of the overall trade policy with China. At the same time each Member State has pursued its own com- mercial policy with China, often leading to claims that Europe lacks any real coherence, and that its members can easily be played off against each other as they seek advantage in the China market. The reality is that Member States have diverging views, that differ not just because of their commercial interests, but also due to the fundamental policy outlooks. The textile and footwear issues have 24 China\u2019s rise and the global economy: challenges for Europe cp94.qxp 09/01/2007 16:56 Page 24 ",
        "1 demonstrated that there is often no consensus on how to deal with China, even if all Member States subscribe to the same broad pol- icy aims. Ultimately the challenge for Europe will be to ensure that the economic foundation benefits both sides in the bilateral relation- ship and that this is generally perceived to be the case both in Europe and China. This will include both the purely bilateral issues as well as the many other challenges that China has raised. Here the EU will need to continue its efforts to ensure that China\u2019s integration into the international economy benefits China, and also all the other participants that are affected by its remarkable economic development. 25 Duncan Freeman cp94.qxp 09/01/2007 16:56 Page 25 ",

        "The challenge of democratisation Peter Ferdinand Introduction The EU has a clear interest in the democratisation of China. This is not just because the EU is a \u2018club\u2019 of democracies. A democratic China would be more transparent and predictable. It would also greatly reduce, if not remove, the potential source of a security con- frontation with Taiwan. The establishment of a democratic politi- cal system on the mainland would undercut Taiwanese justifica- tions for separatism. Neighbouring states would see the security benefits that would derive from this, and it would facilitate d\u00e9tente with the US. On the other hand, as is emphasised elsewhere in this Chaillot Paper , the EU also needs to maintain a mutually beneficial trading relationship and the trade deficit with China is expanding. Putting pressure on China to show greater respect for human rights and greater transparency will never be the only important concern. Like many Chinese, this author can imagine China being a democratic state in twenty years\u2019 time. But it is not at all clear how China will get from here to there. If it does so smoothly, it will be the first Communist regime to have achieved such a transforma- tion. That makes it a challenge worth attempting, but the outlook is very unclear. The leadership of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) cer- tainly do not intend to cede power. The last time that there was a major democratic challenge to the regime, in Tiananmen Square in June 1989, they responded with the utmost brutality. Protestors continue to be arrested. Reopening the question of what hap- pened then, and why it happened, remains taboo. However, since then the regime has overseen an economic transformation that has raised per capita income to US $1,300 per year. Thus there is no pressure for change stemming from economic failure. There has been an implicit bargain between the state and the people. The 27 Facing China\u2019s rise: Guidelines for an EU strategy 2 cp94.qxp 09/01/2007 16:56 Page 27 ",
        "2 state will deliver stability and rapid improvements in people\u2019s standards of living in exchange for political apathy or neutralism. In addition, China is simply too big for the outside world to impose change if the regime remains obdurate. All of this suggests that the prospects for democratisation are bleak. On the other hand, an established literature in political sci- ence suggests a positive connection between economic develop- ment and the process of political democratisation. That economic development has taken place there can be no doubt: since eco- nomic reforms began in 1978, the Chinese economy has grown by over 400 per cent. This could suggest that political change might take place too. Is China liberalising? The Chinese government periodically resorts to force, using the tactic of \u2018killing the chicken to frighten the monkeys\u2019 (to quote an old Chinese proverb), i.e. it imposes exemplary punishments to deter dissidence and deviation from the government line, basically because it does not feel in control. The problem is that it has not yet devised a system of laws and regulations that consensually main- tains stability. Yet today many groups of Chinese people undoubt- edly enjoy greater freedoms than under Mao. To take just some examples: people in China are no longer required to live in the same places for most, if not all, their lives. The household registration system, which used to be buttressed by the need for ration cards based upon place of residence in order to obtain basic foodstuffs, has been much eroded. This makes it easier for people to move around the country in search of work. Recent reports put the size of this \u2018floating population\u2019 at around 140 million, i.e. one tenth of the total, with 70 per cent of them aged between 15 and 35. However poor and exploited many of them are, these people are challenging authority, whether overtly or covertly. There is now a significant and growing, predomi- nantly urban middle class in China. McKinsey recently estimated that these people represented 20 per cent of the urban population, but that by the year 2025 they will grow to 90 per cent. 1 Entrepre- neurs flourish and contribute enormously to the growth of the economy. They are beginning to challenge authority by demand- ing greater observance of property rights. 2 Courageous lawyers, 28 The challenge of democratisation 1.

        "2 even members of the Communist Party, take up the cases of both the poor and the wealthy against the state, at considerable per- sonal risk. 3 Individuals now have the right to sue officials for mal- administration. In 2002, 45,332 suits were brought against state officials. In 2005 the figure was around 100,000. Almost all are directed against local officials. Only a tiny proportion begin by cit- ing central agencies, but individuals with grievances petition one level of government after another, in the hope of obtaining justice. Roughly one third of these cases ultimately result in judgements which find in favour of the plaintiffs, although even then officials find all sorts of ways to frustrate, circumvent, ignore or even sup- press these verdicts. The provinces of China, in general, enjoy greater autonomy than in the latter years of Mao\u2019s reign when ideological centralisa- tion was exercised ruthlessly over the whole country. Individual provinces now have greater freedom to pursue economic strate- gies that capitalise on their local comparative advantages. Party secretaries usually get promotion for significant contributions to China\u2019s economic development, although the demise of central planning means that they may also get more blame for economic failure. Success insulates them from pressure from Beijing. Thus in many ways regional party officials have greater freedom of manoeuvre. The exceptions are autonomous regions with contin- uing ethnic tensions, such as Tibet and Xinjiang. There, officials still repress ethnic dissidents, whilst at the same time offering eco- nomic inducements for cooperation. In the media there is far greater choice than was previously the case, partly because of the introduction of market forces. Even in terms of the old media there have been big changes. Twenty-five years ago there were only roughly one thousand newspapers and magazines in China. Now there are over ten thousand. And news- papers are now expected to make profits, or at any rate to avoid subsidies. This means that editors increasingly publish stories which will help to sell their newspapers. This can include inves- tigative journalism, e.g. investigative reports into official corrup- tion. TV stations, too, are under great pressure to make profits. Provincial ones have fewer resources than national channels. Some have turned abroad either for programmes or for formats for programmes that are particularly popular. All of this has increased choice for viewers. 29 Peter Ferdinand 3.

        "2 However, at least as important is the impact of new communi- cations technologies upon the lives of Chinese citizens, especially the young. One sign is the explosion in mobile phone usage. There are now around 390 million mobile phone users in China, and they send roughly 1 billion text messages per day \u2013 a figure grow- ing at an annual rate of around 40 percent. Now users can contact people throughout the country more or less simultaneously, for all sorts of reasons. It is worth noting that popular nationalist demonstrations in the last few years have often been organised through mobile phones. Coping with this volume of messages in a crisis in real time would be an enormous potential challenge. Text messaging played a big role in orchestrating demonstrations that brought about the downfall of President Estrada of the Philippines in 2001, and then the volume of text messages in the Philippines rose from a \u2018mere\u2019 50 to 80 million per day. Handling a crisis in China would be of a different order of magnitude. The Internet is another source of alternative information. There are now around 111 million regular users of the Net in China, second only to the US, with over 12 million able to access broadband. Equally significantly, The New York Times reported in May 2006 that there were now 4 million bloggers in China. This medium offers an unprecedented opportunity for people, espe- cially the young, to express themselves in public, even if they have to register with the authorities. The regime has devoted consider- able resources to building \u2018firewalls\u2019 between the Chinese Net and the rest of the world \u2013 the Falun Gong demonstration in central Beijing in April 1999 showed how dissenters could use the Internet to organise. Journalists have been prosecuted for sending infor- mation abroad via e-mail. Yet the Internet is porous. Internet caf\u00e9s and ISPs, who need to keep customers satisfied if they are to make profits, sometimes allow contentious material to be posted on bulletin boards, even though they know that censors will soon intervene. Word of mouth then takes over. Politically the state can prevent the use (or misuse) of the Inter- net for promoting fundamental long-term issues or serving \u2018sub- versive\u2019 purposes, e.g. support for Taiwan, alternative parties, accessing search engines abroad for political information, etc. Where the controls sometimes break down are over immediate, unexpected crises, where the official media and censors are slow to respond. The SARS crisis, examples of official corruption, biased 30 The challenge of democratisation cp94.qxp 09/01/2007 16:56 Page 30 ",
        "2 court verdicts, the real causes of major accidents and disasters \u2013 all of these have provoked passionate debate on the Internet. Experi- enced users employ Aesopic language, using homonym characters for banned phrases (e.g. Falun Gong) to outwit the censors. And in August 2005 the editor of the weekly supplement \u2018Freezing Point\u2019 in the China Youth Daily publicly criticised his chief editor through postings that spread within hours to bulletin boards around the country before the censors could respond. 4 The state does retain basic control. The CCP later closed \u2018Freez- ing Point\u2019. The name of the doctor who first revealed the scale of the SARS epidemic cannot be mentioned on bulletin boards. Yet courageous journalists continue to test the limits of government controls. Several retired senior party journalists, including Li Rui, one of Mao\u2019s former secretaries, publicised the fact that they had signed a petition criticising the closure of \u2018Freezing Point\u2019. The People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC), like other countries, is not immune to the activities of \u2018smart mobs\u2019 5 in crises. In fact it may be particularly vulnerable to them because of the lack of alter- native authoritative institutions through which alternative views might be expressed. China\u2019s opening to the outside world China is today more open to the outside world than at any time since 1949, and not just economically. It is more open to ideas, too, even if the regime attempts to filter them. Chinese journals and newspapers, especially those more inclined towards reform, now cite foreign \u2018case studies\u2019 for ideas on solving policy dilemmas that go beyond the economic realm. Lessons were drawn from the col- lapse of the Soviet Union and the downfall of President Suharto in Indonesia. European experiences are widely cited as a source for ideas on the reform of China\u2019s malfunctioning welfare system. Del- egations from the CCP have visited European political parties to discuss experiences in reforming political institutions, e.g. the Third Way in Britain, the achievements of the Swedish Social Democratic Party, etc. The recurring tug-of-war between the centre and the provinces over resources leads to comparisons of Chinese government practices with federalism in the US. And at the time of China\u2019s accession to the WTO, one concern among educated Chi- nese was China\u2019s possible \u2018Latin Americanisation\u2019 \u2013 Argentina was 31 Peter Ferdinand 4.

        "2 then going through a major economic crisis associated with the failure of neo-liberal reforms. In addition to economic flows, internationalisation is also spreading in the field of tourism. The number of Chinese going abroad (including Hong Kong, annually has gone up from 4.52 to 31 million in ten years, and it has been predicted that it may rise to 100 million by 2020. This will gradually make citizens of the PRC socially more cosmopolitan. More importantly, the number of Chinese students studying abroad is rising by over 100,000 per year and in 2006 the total number of students who have gone abroad since 1978 will have surpassed the million mark. Of these, around 232,000 have so far returned to China (many of the rest are still studying abroad). Not all of these students have positive expe- riences. Some return with a renewed sense of nationalism. Never- theless the returned students will gradually come to play as big a part in the Chinese leadership as their predecessors from earlier generations who studied in the ex-USSR, e.g. Jiang Zemin and Li Peng. Is China stable? With all its economic success, China is going through a huge social upheaval. Sources of discontent are increasing and so too are protests. Economic development is causing enormous damage to the environment. According to a recent study for the World Bank, China contains 16 of Asia\u2019s 20 most polluted cities. The problems are compounded by serious and worsening problems of polluted water supplies and water quality. A second source of discontent is increasing inequality. Accord- ing to the UNDP Human Development Report for 2005, the Gini coefficient for income in China in 2004 was 0.447. In around 1980 it was estimated as 0.28, which was only slightly higher than in the most equal states in the world, i.e. the Nordic countries. This means that China has moved in one generation from having among the lowest rates of inequality in the world to having the same level of inequality as in Bolivia. In that sense China is \u2018Latin- Americanising\u2019. And the figure for Bolivia is going down, whilst that for China is going up. This increasing inequality is due to a whole series of issues. There is the increasing disparity in incomes between urban and 32 The challenge of democratisation cp94.qxp 09/01/2007 16:56 Page 32 ",
        "2 rural areas. There are increasing gaps between different sectors of the economy, with some enjoying monopolistic benefits, whereas wages in others, such as light manufacturing, suffer from intense competition. There are increasing disparities between regions, with the eastern provinces benefiting most from the reforms and the western ones the least, although the Rust Belt of old heavy industries in north-eastern China has been badly hit. And there are the problems of the erosion or disappearance of state welfare ben- efits \u2013 which particularly hits the elderly, the infirm and the poor. This also increases the burden on women. All of this has meant widespread discontent which could be catalysed by a major politi- cal crisis. This problem is exacerbated by the increasing perception of corruption among officials. The 2005 Transparency International Corruption Index placed China joint 78 th in the world, its lowest ever position. This corruption is often felt most keenly in the countryside, where 60 per cent of the population still live. The most bitter disputes concern the rezoning of agricultural land for industrial or residential use, with farmers getting little compensa- tion, whilst officials are suspected of being bribed. This is one of the major reasons for the increased number of public demonstrations that have been taking place across the country in the last few years. According to official statistics, there were over 87,000 demonstrations across the country in 2005, up from over 8,700 in 1993. Quite what all these \u2018mass incidents\u2019 amounted to, and how many people took part, was not made clear, although the figures for 2004 mentioned 3.5 million participants in 74,000 \u2018incidents\u2019. Some are minor, but others involve thou- sands and whole communities, go on for months, become violent and attract nationwide attention on websites. At the very least, this suggests an escalating problem of public lack of trust, and the absence of effective institutions that can resolve the issues through normal channels. According to the Chinese expert Minxin Pei, this is evidence of a decentralised predatory state, where citizens are exploited by provincial and local officials. In his view, officials used to engage in corruption close to retirement age, when the risks of being found out were less. Now the phenomenon has spread to younger officials, either because they are more greedy, or because they have less confidence in the longevity of the regime since the dramatic collapse of the USSR. For Pei, this increased endemic corruption 33 Peter Ferdinand cp94.qxp 09/01/2007 16:56 Page 33 ",
        "2 makes a smooth transition to democracy both more necessary and less likely. 6 It is no surprise that CCP leaders regularly cite corrup- tion as the most important threat to the regime. Yet they cannot eradicate it. This is still a strong, but also a brittle, regime. Is democratisation on the agenda? Occasionally individual Chinese leaders have contemplated a more democratic course. Back in 1978 Deng Xiaoping flirted with the organisers of the \u2018Democracy Wall\u2019 \u2013 until, that is, he had defeated his rivals. In the second half of the 1980s Hu Yaobang and Zhao Ziyang envisaged the separation of state and party. In 1995 former Politburo member Tian Jiyuan called for direct elections for gov- ernment officials, essentially going all the way to the top. And the notion of democracy resonates with ordinary people. The China panel in the 2000 World Values Survey came out as 96 per cent believing that a democratic political system was either \u2018very good\u2019 or \u2018fairly good\u2019. 7 During the second half of the 1990s the regime introduced competitive village elections throughout most of China, to which the EU contributed a great deal of funding. Later this did lead some rural party organisations to introduce compet- itive elections for their secretary as well. However, this has never progressed any further. Attempts to register a new China Democ- ratic Party in 1998 led to the arrest of the leaders. In October 2005 the State Council produced a white paper entitled Building of Politi- cal Democracy in China , 8 which justified the continuing leading role of the party. CCP leaders adduce the fact that, as Deng put it, the party \u2018saved\u2019 China when it was threatened with disintegration in the first half of the 20th century. They cannot contemplate sharing power, let alone giving it away, for fear of a similar national catas- trophe. Now they are building the CCP \u2013 with roughly 70 million members \u2013 into a party of power that represents all \u2018advanced\u2019 strata of society. It has become the preserve of an educational and social elite \u2013 roughly one fifth of members now claim to have a col- lege degree, six times the national average. Symbolic of this change too was the decision in 2002 to admit entrepreneurs as members. In turn this raises another issue that is often associated with democratisation, namely the emergence of a middle class that is more inclined towards political change.

Although a middle class may be emerging, as mentioned at the beginning, it is certainly not a homogeneous grouping. Large sec- tions of it derive their livelihood from cooperation with the state. Many businesses depend upon state licences or approval. What- ever their private inclinations, these businessmen will be reluctant to put their financial interests at risk by invoking political change, unless they feel threatened by predatory and arbitrary officials. That might happen one day, but the CCP has now opened its doors to entrepreneurs and that will postpone potential political alien- ation. The same can be said for \u2018civil society\u2019. China expert Bruce Gilley points out that there were 135,000 registered \u2018social groups\u2019 at the end of 2002 9 \u2013 but the key point is that they had to be regis- tered. In that sense they were still controlled by the state. Protests are sometimes large, but usually relatively sponta- neous. The main protagonists campaigning for democracy still tend to be individuals rather than organised groups \u2013 journalists, students and workers. Conclusion: a role for the EU? How much can the EU actually contribute to this process of change? How much priority can be given to this? As mentioned at the beginning, the EU has conflicting commercial interests in China, too, with leverage more difficult since China\u2019s admission to the WTO. Others are also active, the US in particular. There is not much scope for the EU to do something acting alone. At the same time, whilst the EU and the US want the same general direction of change in China, they may not always prioritise the same things. Indeed it would be better if they did not, since it is important that China is presented with alternative versions of modern democratic states. The previous sections have suggested that the Chinese state is in difficulties, though not on the verge of collapse. What China needs is a modern, just, authoritative rather than authoritarian, more transparent state. Democracy would help. It would be as important for a successfully democratising China to have a respected and accepted state as for it to have elections and a multi- 35 Peter Ferdinand 9.

To demon- strate how these operate successfully in a democracy could be the focus of EU efforts. There is another important consideration. It has recently been suggested that an essential precondition for democracy promo- tion is that the providers of foreign aid should follow the lead of domestic political actors. 10 This would prevent money being wasted on projects which were not \u2018owned\u2019 by the people who need to make them work on the ground. If the Chinese regime is not committed to democratisation through multi-party elections, there is no point trying to force it upon them, but there are alter- natives. It is also important to find areas of cooperation that will counterbalance the inevitable frictions over trade that are likely to continue for years. Chinese leaders will be more likely to accept and work with this kind of advice. At least among the older generations of Chinese political lead- ers, it is an article of faith that continued communist rule is essen- tial for maintaining national unity. They argue that China is too big to allow for alternative parties which would only split the country, and there also remains a perceived threat of external interference \u2013 the foreign interventions in the 19 th century have not been forgotten. How democracies handle problems like social and economic inequality and corruption: all of this could and should be debated, so as to encourage the feeling that democracy brings benefits through facilitating smoother change, not social and political collapse. The experiences of Eastern and Central Europe could be adduced to show that former communists have been elected to the highest positions in the land \u2013 something that would have seemed inconceivable in the immediate aftermath of the \u2018velvet revolutions\u2019 in 1990. This could be a factor of reassur- ance in China. Former communists could demonstrate the change by representing the EU in its dealings with China. Another thing worth doing would be to publicise successes of European democracies in encouraging openness in handling social and economic challenges. There certainly ought to be an emphasis on media cooperation given the desire for change expe- rienced by many Chinese agencies, e.g. more training facilities or secondments for Chinese journalists with European media organ- isations and universities. There could also be online public 36 The challenge of democratisation 10.

        "2 debates between European and Chinese journalists and academics over the practical benefits and weaknesses of democracy. We need to adopt a long-term perspective and not expect quick results. A large-scale study led by Adam Przeworski suggests that where democracy replaces dictatorship, its chances of survival are much greater when per capita income has reached approximately $4,000. 11 This will take decades in China. There is one exception to this: Hong Kong. The question of democracy there is resurfacing with a lot of popular support. No final decision has yet been taken over the procedure for selecting the Chief Executive in 2007, or for expanding the franchise for the Legislative Council in 2008. Popular protests have already led to the resignation of the first Chief Executive, Tung Chee-Hwa. Bei- jing has consistently asserted its ultimate authority over the Hong Kong system, and the leaders have been afraid of allowing any- thing that might serve as a precedent for the regime on the main- land. Yet Hong Kong does have all the socio-economic precondi- tions for democracy \u2013 it is a prosperous liberal society, which is much less corrupt and genuinely subject to the rule of law. Before the return of the former British colony to China, the EU openly supported Britain\u2019s attempts to introduce greater democracy in Hong Kong. It would be consistent for the EU to maintain that long-term position now and encourage Beijing to view democracy in Hong Kong not as a precedent, but as an experiment, in the same way that the Special Economic Zones around Hong Kong served as experiments in economic reform in the 1980s. It would also reassure Taiwan about mainland respect for its democracy, if reunification took place. The EU can and does have an impact upon the evolution of the Chinese system. It has raised the level of consciousness about the need to observe human rights. It has obtained the release of some political prisoners. It has devoted a lot of resources to helping to establish village-level elections. But that example is also a reminder of the limits of what it can achieve. It has not yet been fol- lowed by similar reforms at higher levels of the state. The same can be seen in the Chinese legal system. Many agencies from around the world have contributed generously for years to improving jus- tice in China and they have certainly made a difference. Yet, as we have seen, there is still a very long way to go. We can influence China, we can expect China to abide by inter- nationally agreed standards of human rights, we should criticise it 37 Peter Ferdinand 11. Adam Przeworski, Michael E.

Perhaps we should seek advice from Indians about that \u2013 and about how democracy works in their country. There might be useful insights to be had. We should pursue a consistent, long-term policy, even when other more immediate considerations obtrude. It will require regular atten- tion and some humility \u2013 but no kowtowing. The relationship will have to be based, as Chinese diplomats regularly remind us, on the principle of equality and mutual benefit. But \u2013 as they do not say \u2013 it also needs to be open to scrutiny. 38 The challenge of democratisation cp94.qxp 09/01/2007 16:56 Page 38 ",
        "Is China\u2019s military modernisation a concern for the EU? Eberhard Sandschneider Introduction For many years, Western debates on China have been focused on China\u2019s enormous economic success. The West has been impressed and at the same time intrigued by the formidable economic progress of what is still \u2013 nominally at least \u2013 a Communist coun- try. And Western nations have been more than willing to compete with each other, both within Europe and across the Atlantic, when it comes to grabbing a share of China\u2019s huge market. In recent months, however, both in the US and in Europe a more sombre per- spective has overshadowed relations with China. European observers have started to realise that China not only constitutes a huge market, but also a challenging and highly successful competi- tor for western companies both in its domestic market and increas- ingly also in our own home markets. Additionally, the focus on China\u2019s economic performance has meant that Europe has not dwelt a great deal on the issue of China\u2019s military modernisation over the last ten to fifteen years. But Europe has certainly now come to realise that there is another debate about China going on in the US, a debate characterised by the dichotomy between containment and engagement. Europe is not even thinking about containment \u2013 quite rightly, because any attempt at containing China would cer- tainly be bound to fail. But the different perspective on China as demonstrated by the American debate is meanwhile increasingly acting as an irritant in transatlantic relations. At the moment, the EU clearly does not have a security perspec- tive on China. This chapter will argue, however, that Europe needs to develop such a perspective \u2013 and probably sooner rather than later. There is no contradiction between having a cooperative pol- icy towards China and building a security perspective towards a rising power which may soon have the capacities to challenge not only the US, but also Europe, if one assumes a notion of security which is broader than strict military perspectives seem to imply. 39 Facing China\u2019s rise: Guidelines for an EU strategy 3 cp94.qxp 09/01/2007 16:56 Page 39 ",
        "3 A policy of promoting partnership with China is easily advo- cated, but difficult to implement when it comes to almost all sen- sitive issues in international relations. In most cases, there is no solution without China, but China has got its own agenda and is pragmatically, and very strategically, following its own interests. China\u2019s growing assertiveness can easily be observed in its stance on issues such as security, energy supply, the economic effects of globalisation and even in the hotly debated field of values and human rights. China steers its own course and the West still seems to be nonplussed by the way Chinese leaders consistently and suc- cessfully pursue their strategy, without paying much attention to Western criticism. Thus, one of the major challenges ahead of us is bridging the transatlantic gap concerning the divergent China policies of Europe and the US. Dealing with China\u2019s military modernisation is certainly one of the most sensitive issues in this respect. China\u2019s military modernisation: a balance sheet Buoyed up by its economic success, China has been pursuing its process of military modernisation in a very focused way. China\u2019s military expenditure has been growing in double digits over the last two decades. In Chinese currency terms, the officially announced military budget has nearly quadrupled from about 64 billion yuan in 1995 to 248 billion yuan in 2005. 1 In 2005, the military budget grew by 17 percent. Officially, China spent US$29.9 billion on its military. However, since vital parts of the budgets of a number of ministries contain military-related expenditure, western experts assume that the real amount could be estimated at somewhere between US$35 and 90 billion. Any comparison, however, with US military spending reveals the huge gap with which China will con- tinue to be confronted: Compared to our highest estimates of US$90 billion in the case of China, the United States is spending US$501.7 billion in the fiscal year 2006 2 \u2013 roughly equal to the defence spending of the rest of the world combined. The Penta- gon\u2019s official budget of US$441.6 billion is augmented by US$49.1 billion for the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq and by an additional US$11 billion for its nuclear weapons programme. One may, therefore, conclude that China\u2019s military is catching up 40 Is China\u2019s military modernisation a concern for the EU? 1.

        "3 in absolute terms, but is still lagging far behind the US as its major potential rival on a comparative basis. Additionally, military modernisation has been accompanied by a remarkable shift in China\u2019s doctrine: the formerly perceived threat of \u2018early, major and nuclear war\u2019 has been replaced by the doctrine of \u2018local and limited war\u2019. The PLA limits its scope of operations to protecting China\u2019s sovereignty, including Taiwan and the South China Sea. Since it does not have foreign bases and has no global defence commitments, its main mission is to con- centrate on defence against foreign threats and maintain domes- tic security. As a result, a diversified military doctrine is primarily focused on Taiwan and China\u2019s immediate regional interests. The army\u2019s modernisation has been based on the country\u2019s economic success and on imports of modern weapons technology mainly from the former Soviet Union. A \u2018revolution in military affairs\u2019, to quote a term used in the US and Europe, is slowly being imple- mented \u2013 although with a distinctively Chinese slant. PLA leaders know quite well that given the relative backwardness of their mili- tary infrastructure, achieving mechanisation and sophisticated computerisation is of paramount importance to the army, although it will remain at a much lower standard compared to its western counterparts. While China is rapidly increasing its mili- tary capacities, the official policy is anything but aggressive: in its White Papers on defence, China continuously pledges never to engage in an openly aggressive policy towards its neighbours, or in a strategy of hegemonic competition. On balance, this leads to a twofold conclusion. In absolute terms, Chinese military modernisation has made tremendous progress, but in relative terms and compared to the United States, it is still not gaining much ground. This does not, however, pre- vent the US from taking an increasingly critical and proactive per- spective on China\u2019s military and defence policies. Growing American scepticism: a matter of transatlantic concern Concerns about the speed and scope of China\u2019s military moderni- sation and the country\u2019s increasing capacity for active power projection are growing internationally, especially among its Asian 41 Eberhard Sandschneider cp94.qxp 09/01/2007 16:56 Page 41 ",
        "3 neighbours and, as we have seen, within the USA. The EU so far has been very reluctant to join the debate. The US government is closely monitoring China\u2019s attempt to modernise its military and to increase not only its regional but also its global outreach. A major issue of concern is non-prolifera- tion, since China has been actively pursuing trade in weapons\u2019 technology, especially with states which in a western perspective are regarded as failing or even as rogue states. China\u2019s cooperation with Pakistan in exchanging nuclear technology, and its trade relations with Iran, Libya and Syria, have repeatedly met with harsh criticism from America. Western observers are still worried about nuclear cooperation between China and Iran. Similarly, the country\u2019s role as the only potential partner of North Korea has fuelled western suspicions, although it is true that China has played an active and increasingly instrumental part in the Six- Party talks. In contrast to Europe, the American debate on how to deal with China\u2019s growing military capacities has raised sensitive questions. China\u2019s rise is clearly perceived as a risk to regional stability in the Asia Pacific and as signalling the emergence of a potential future rival to US regional and global hegemony. Publications such as Richard Bernstein\u2019s and Ross Munro\u2019s book, The Coming Conflict with China 3 or Robert Kaplan\u2019s provocatively titled article, \u2018How We Would Fight China?\u2019 4 have attracted considerable attention in the security debate in the United States. In its 2006 Annual Report on the Military Power of the People Republic of China (PRC), the Pentagon officially addresses China\u2019s growing potential for power projection beyond its own borders, the increasing speed of its mil- itary transformation and the perceived lack of transparency of China\u2019s ultimate political and military goals. The predominant reason for America\u2019s edginess is, of course, closely related to the situation across the Strait of Taiwan. The China-Taiwan conflict has the potential to create major tensions across the Pacific, with the risk of a direct military conflict between the US and China. In 1979, the United States in its \u2018Tai- wan Relations Act\u2019 proclaimed its willingness to engage for Tai- wan\u2019s security, while China has never refrained from threatening military action in order to reintegrate the island into its own sphere of sovereignty. Military conflict is thus a looming danger and in consequence leads to serious concerns within the US mili- tary leadership about how to manage a potential direct clash with 42 Is China\u2019s military modernisation a concern for the EU? 3.

From an American perspective, \u2018China\u2019s rapid devel- opment of cruise and other anti-ship missiles designed to pierce the electronic defenses of US vessels that might be dispatched to the Taiwan Strait in case of conflict\u2019 5 has been a matter of particu- lar concern. In addition to naval capacities, China is actively striv- ing for air superiority over the Taiwan Strait. On the other hand, it certainly must be acknowledged that over the last few years China\u2019s foreign policy has been clearly oriented towards reducing conflict potentials and maintaining the status quo in order to avoid obstacles being put in the way of its overall development goals. Nevertheless the risk of an outbreak of major conflict can never be excluded. In that respect, it is obvious that Europe does not have a suitable answer \u2013 not only with regard to the conflict itself, but also regarding American expectations of at least indirect European support. Thus, any consideration of Euro- pean concerns relating to China\u2019s military modernisation always has to take into account the transatlantic component, i.e. our increasingly difficult relationship with the US, especially on issues such as China. European China policy: a critique Today the European dream of China as an El Dorado for its busi- nesses and exports is already turning into a nightmare as Europe\u2019s trading relations with China are marked by growing competition and potential rivalry. No doubt Europe has a China strategy \u2013 on paper at least. In its latest incarnation, the EU\u2019s China policy is based on four pillars: Europe wants to engage China further in a political dialogue, aims at supporting China\u2019s transition to an open society, tries to encourage China\u2019s integration into the world economy and pursues a policy of raising its own profile towards China. 6 Although some may find much to criticise in EU policy declarations/documents, the official policy as it is expressed is music to the ears of European and Chinese business leaders. The EU correctly prides itself on having established a broad spectrum of institutionalised contacts with China. The profound differences between Europe and the United States became visible during the weapons embargo controversy. When former German Chancellor Gerhard Schr\u00f6der (soon to be followed by French President Jacques Chirac) proposed during a 43 Eberhard Sandschneider 5.

        "3 visit to China in December 2003 that the EU weapons embargo on China should be lifted, his argument was simple \u2013 and correct: the embargo was part of an EU sanction which had been imposed in a declaration of the European Council on 27 June 1989 as a direct reaction to the Tiananmen Square massacre on 4 June. Twelve years later, however, China had made considerable progress not only economically, but also in terms of cooperating with the West on human rights and international conflict resolution. Although it cannot be denied that China is still guilty of extensive human rights violations, there have been some improvements, a fact which Schr\u00f6der and Chirac wanted to acknowledge. Seen in this light, the sanctions policy seemed to be a historical relic that could easily be abolished. Quite obviously, the \u2018weapons embargo\u2019 is a remnant of the EU\u2019s overall sanction policy of 1989: the second of eight different clusters of sanctions referred to the \u2018interruption by the Member States of the Community of military cooperation and an embargo on trade in arms with China\u2019. 7 Only the second part of that sentence is relevant today. All other measures have long been lifted. Even exchanges between military delegations have been resumed, as have all other forms of exchange halted by the 1989 decision. It should be added that countries like Japan and Australia were much more forthright in lifting their sanctions against China, by abolishing them altogether in the early 1990s. The fact that Europe decided to adopt a policy of progressively abandoning its trading sanctions against China, but has retained the weapons embargo as the only leftover of the EU\u2019s original 1989 embargo decisions, suggests that the arms issue is a highly sensi- tive one. On a strictly factual basis, therefore, both Schr\u00f6der and Chirac were right, but the two politicians completely miscalcu- lated the international response to their suggestion. Without hav- ing coordinated with other European Countries and without hav- ing informed the United States of their position, they immediately encountered substantial criticism from important domestic con- stituencies, among EU member states and, more importantly and more vociferously, from across the Atlantic. Analysed in a more sober perspective, the policies suggested by Schr\u00f6der and Chirac were not aimed at increasing the arms trade with China, but rather at sending a clear signal for cooperation to Beijing. But during the ensuing transatlantic debate, which was highly emotional in tenor and not really based on hard facts, it became clear that a major difference between Europe and the US is 44 Is China\u2019s military modernisation a concern for the EU? 7.

        "3 precisely a symbolic one. The United States government did not want to send the signal of engagement which some Europeans, hoping for increasing economic cooperation, were so keen on sending to China. The real problem both for the US and the EU remains unsolved: the major challenge is not the direct trade of weapons, but the problems connected with technology transfer and \u2018dual use\u2019 technology. For the time being, neither the US nor the EU have developed a satisfactory strategy on how to deal with this challenge. Whatever US criticism may have been, the upshot of all this is clear: defining relations with China and how to deal with the Chi- nese has become a major source of discord in transatlantic rela- tions. Despite the fact that the transatlantic debate on how best to manage the peaceful rise of China is slowly gaining ground, there is hardly much evidence that gives reasons for optimism. Europe and America are far from agreeing on a joint strategy on how to manage relations with China. Here lies a major challenge for Europe. Europe\u2019s perspectives on China have been dominated by economic considerations and have been focused almost exclusively on China as a future key mar- ket. At the same time, Europe has to face the fact that China is not only a market for European businesses and investors, but also a growing competitor, and maybe even a strategic rival. When it comes to securing energy resources, e.g. in Latin America and throughout Africa, China is not constrained by human rights con- ditionality in its foreign policy and thus does not run the risk of being accused of operating a policy of double standards towards its partners. China does not combine economic cooperation with attempts to promote its own political and social values. While \u2018the West\u2019 is trying to convince autocracies to implement western political standards, China is just doing business \u2018with no strings attached\u2019 \u2013 and therefore is much more welcome as an interlocutor to autocratic governments than are either the EU or the US. Viewing \u2018China as a partner\u2019 for multilateral approaches to international conflicts is similarly overoptimistic. China is look- ing after its own interests and European policies are far too weakly coordinated to constitute an effective counterweight to Chinese counterparts \u2013 whether politically or economically. The message, therefore, is very simple: during its reform poli- cies of the last twenty-five years, China has been evolving from a nation state with a comparatively limited regional outreach into a 45 Eberhard Sandschneider cp94.qxp 09/01/2007 16:56 Page 45 ",
        "3 major regional power. Its neighbours have chosen a broad spec- trum of policies in order to engage China on bilateral and multi- lateral levels. But China\u2019s global positioning is improving literally on a day-to-day basis. Europe will have to face that challenge \u2013 and in a much broader sense than present policies seem to suggest. Why have a security strategy towards China? Based on a broader understanding of security policies, which includes soft and asymmetric challenges, Europe definitely needs a security perspective towards China. The reason is not that we should expect any form of direct military confrontation \u2013 after all, Europe does not have a Taiwan Relations Act. But nor does it have an answer to an ineluctable question: what would Europe do should tensions in the Taiwan Strait escalate and lead to military conflict involving the US 7 th Fleet? Would a policy of declarations be enough? Even if one assumes that the overall risk of direct military con- flict between China and the US is pretty low today, the reasons for a European security strategy towards China are manifold. What- ever perspective one takes on global risks, China is both part of the problem and part of the solution. Developing a security policy towards China is a definite necessity for Europe in order to enhance its own global position and its own foreign and security policy. As most western observers agree, China is flexing its military muscles. The US is taking a much more critical position towards China\u2019s growing military power. But with its increasing global outreach, China poses not only a hard, but first and foremost also a soft challenge, to European security interests as well. As Robert Kaplan reminds us: \u2018China will approach us asymmetrically, as ter- rorists do. In Iraq the insurgents have shown us the low end of asymmetry. The Chinese are poised to show us the high end of the art. That is the threat.\u2019 8 Most Europeans would certainly find it difficult to share \u2013 or even understand \u2013 this position in the Amer- ican debate. Even if one accepts a certain degree of exaggeration, the core challenge should not be excluded by definition \u2013 certainly not in a medium- to long-term perspective. Thus, Europe would be well advised to include security aspects in its broader spectrum of policies towards China. It is imperative for Europe in a transat- 46 Is China\u2019s military modernisation a concern for the EU? 8. Kaplan, op. cit., p. 60. cp94.qxp 09/01/2007 16:56 Page 46 ",

Understandably, economic competition between EU Members and the US will continue. But it should not prevent us from a concerted attempt at developing a common security per- spective not only towards China\u2019s military rise, but also towards its growing global impact. Transatlantic coordination is still in its very early stages. Both Europe and the United States will have to realise that only by cooperation and coordination of their policies will they be able to meet a challenge from China which for the time being still seems to lie far in the future, but which may become real sooner than many of Europe\u2019s dreams about China seem to suggest. 47 Eberhard Sandschneider cp94.qxp 09/01/2007 16:56 Page 47 ",

        "Neither hegemon nor soft power: China\u2019s rise at the gates of the West Fran\u00e7ois Godement China\u2019s rise is indisputable. This is clearly demonstrated by its posi- tion as an international trade giant, its ever-increasing military spending, and its hyperactive regional diplomacy both in Asia and throughout the developing world. The global dimension is rein- forced by China\u2019s revamped public diplomacy, which makes full use of modern media and web communications, and by Chinese migration and the growth of Chinese tourism abroad. China\u2019s expansion is also served by its so-called strategic partnerships \u2013 even if some of these are undercut by the contentious territorial claims which complicate its relations with many of its neighbours. These are all facts that point to the possibility of a new Chinese hegemony in Asia. Just as Japan during the Meiji era formed the ambition to create its own westernised empire at the gates of Asia, China as a huge and modernised nation state \u2013 which unlike Japan has the immense advantage of enjoying an extensive linguistic and cultural influence beyond its own borders \u2013 may today be seen as establishing a latter-day Asian empire at the gates of the West.

Some will point out that this is merely a revival of China\u2019s ancient hegemony, which harks back to the centuries before Western mili- tary and colonial intrusion in Asia. 1 For a millennium before the Unequal Treaties of the 19 th century, China used \u2018soft\u2019 (commer- cial and human) means of influence over its neighbours in South- East Asia. Chinese patterns of migration and travel \u2013 e.g. the southward migration of Chinese settlers into South-East Asia and the drive westwards into present-day Western China of soldiers who founded colonies 2 \u2013 had a profound influence on the histori- cal evolution of Asia, just as China\u2019s tributary system of relation- ships for a long time functioned as an alternative to the European nation-state and Westphalian model of equal and sovereign states. 51 Facing China\u2019s rise: Guidelines for an EU strategy 1.

        "4 Some analysts go so far as to describe China\u2019s tributary system as an early model of \u2018soft\u2019 regional hegemony and draw on this anal- ogy to describe China\u2019s current bilateral moves and its overtures to multilateral organisations in the region. 3 According to this thesis, the increase in China\u2019s share of the world GDP would also represent a return to the status quo that pre- vailed before the Western conquest of Asia in the 19 th century \u2013 in terms of an analogy with the Song to mid-Qing dynasties at least \u2013 rather than an exceptional development. This argument neglects, of course, the huge impact of global integration on the Chinese economy today, in comparison to the pre-19 th century era when the traditional economy was not internationalised to the same extent. Based on the historical precedent, however, China\u2019s diplo- matic, strategic and economic dominance in the Asia-Pacific region could be viewed as inevitable, and as requiring mainly prag- matic adjustments and realism on the part of China\u2019s regional and global partners. The exponents of this viewpoint suggest that China\u2019s South-East Asian neighbours today prefer \u2018bandwagon- ing\u2019 with China rather than \u2018balancing\u2019. They also suggest that it would be ill-advised to apply a European geopolitical perspective from the 19 th century or pre-World War II era to a region which is used to an instinctive hierarchical order. \u2018Historically, it has been Chinese weakness that has led to chaos in Asia. When China has been strong and stable, order has been preserved. East Asian regional relations have historically been hierarchical, more peace- ful, and more stable than those in the West\u2019. 4 These views are not shared by serious historians of Central Asia\u2019s relations with China, 5 who depict imperial China\u2019s compe- tition with local khanates and states as characterised essentially by an alternance of \u2018soft\u2019 policies accompanied by the induce- ment of trade, and \u2018hard\u2019 policies where military power was used; nor are they borne out, for instance, by Vietnam\u2019s portrayal of its historical resistance to Chinese imperial bureaucratic rule. It would also be untrue to say that historical relations between the Korean kingdoms and China were entirely peaceful, while Chi- nese analysts of Sino-Japanese relations today highlight wars between China and Japan that occurred under five successive dynasties. But it is also true that anti-colonial struggle in the first half of the 20 th century, and the bitter memory of wartime Japan, have eroded these historical perceptions.

        "4 Beijing during the Maoist era, serves today as a key conduit for China\u2019s soft hegemony throughout the region. China and the regional balance of power The arguments of both realpolitik and historical legitimacy concur in their vision of Chinese hegemony \u2013 of an unspecified degree and nature \u2013 over Asia. These arguments are themselves also reinforced by the fact that other major powers in the Asia-Pacific appear to be on the wane. Russia: relegated to a junior role? The former Soviet Union\u2019s military and ideological influence has all but disappeared in the region since 1991. Putin\u2019s Russia may well be undergoing a new authoritarian transformation based on the control of energy and primary material resources, and a new assertion of national interests over international rules and values. Yet the impact of these recent trends is minimal in the Asia-Pacific, where Russian demography and military strength have steadily declined. With regard to key issues in North-East Asia \u2013 an area where the Soviet Union traditionally exercised considerable lever- age \u2013 such as the behaviour of North Korea, the new Russia seems to have increasingly renounced playing an active role, being con- tent with taking a back seat in the Six-Party Talks on the Korean Peninsula that have taken place irregularly in Beijing. Russia is now attempting to balance the West\u2019s democratising influence in Cen- tral Asia with a renewed pact with mostly authoritarian states that are also producers of natural resources. That balancing act, of course, also leads to areas of convergence with China, which is both a complementary consumer of these natural resources and a staunch advocate of absolute national sovereignty and non-demo- cratic development. With regard to energy issues in particular, President Putin has played a shrewd balancing act between China and Japan, maximising Russia\u2019s own gains. 6 But China is also gaining the upper hand, because of its demog- raphy, its superior economy and overall dynamism. This is not a desirable outcome for Russian leaders in the long term, however tempted they may be by an alliance of authoritarian states in their backyard. Militarily, the lure of arms purchases by China is counter-balanced by anxiety about the future control of Siberia. 7 53 Fran\u00e7ois Godement 6.

        "4 Japan: weakening or gaining strength? Japan, which is just emerging from the doldrums after a decade of financial crisis and reduced growth, has seen its political resolve strengthened on key issues of sovereignty and security. Yet it is unable to openly form an alliance with other nations of the Asia- Pacific. This is partly because of the ambiguity of its attitude towards its past history. Although the then Prime Minister, Junichiro Koizumi, apologised clearly and publicly to Asia in August 2005 for his country\u2019s deeds in the era of Japanese military imperialism, historical resentment still leaves Japan a hostage to nationalist sentiment among its Asian neighbours. While Japan\u2019s will to \u2018stand up\u2019 to China, and avoid having the terms of its rela- tionship with China dictated to it, are perfectly understandable, some of its chosen responses, which chime with a nationalist mood in Japanese society, are self-defeating on the international scene. Furthermore, Japan\u2019s insular economic interests have delayed deep economic integration in Asia. Japan did not internationalise its currency in the late 1980s, preferring to utilise regional cur- rency differentials in order to retain a competitive edge on the global markets. Its strategy of bilateral free-trade pacts in East Asia, started in response to China\u2019s bolder if more abstract regional initiatives, is designed to preserve the regional produc- tion and supply chain of Japanese firms and above all Japan\u2019s tech- nological edge. Japan competes head-on with China over issues and sectoral developments which are of symbolic significance, from the choice of members of the Asia-Pacific region to free trade agreements or participation in \u2018piecemeal projects\u2019 such as the Mekong Basin Initiative. Japan\u2019s traditional hang-ups about appearing to be leading too openly have reduced its competitive edge in regional diplomacy, while China now excels in crafting grand designs and eye-catching initiatives and in selling them through public diplomacy. 8 In their public analyses (intended for Chinese rather than foreign consumption), however, Chinese ana- lysts complain bitterly about the strength of the Japan-US alliance. They also allege that Japanese politicians take advantage of poor Sino-Japanese relations to advance their own agenda: they want to rewrite the 1946 Constitution and its Article 9 in the future, with a view to ending any statutory limitation on the use of military force abroad. While the Chinese usually remain silent about Japan\u2019s military cooperation with ASEAN and India, prefer- ring to underline Japan\u2019s regional isolation due to the historical 54 Neither hegemon nor soft power: China\u2019s rise at the gates of the West 8.

        "4 legacy of the Second World War, they also admit that Japan has a strong alliance with the United States \u2013 and that China in fact is competing with Japan for attention from Washington. 9 America overstretched The United States\u2019 overall strength and its economic and military relationships throughout the Asia-Pacific have increased, and not decreased as was commonly predicted in the 1980s and early 1990s. However, strategic tensions and military deployment from the Middle East to Afghanistan make America\u2019s resolve to open another conflict in East Asia less likely: this reluctance to become engaged on several fronts at the same time was illustrated by two years of indecision regarding North Korea (January 2000 to May 2002) and by much reluctance to respond to North Korean actions, until ballistic launches and a nuclear test in October 2006 made it impossible for the United States to further procrastinate. Over- stretching and over-commitment of military resources are a factor that contributes to more strategic consultation with China and to a predictable preference for conflict avoidance. The Bush adminis- tration has often been much tougher in its security statements regarding Asia (including China) than in its actual policies, and does not gain much benefit from its actual restraint in the area of regional diplomacy. Washington\u2019s preference for bilateral relation- ships over even shallow multilateral groupings, its proclivity towards coalitions of circumstance and its use of Asian allies to help legitimise the action in Iraq since 2003, have considerably weakened America\u2019s hand on other issues, and more generally its power of persuasion and its soft power throughout Asia. We should take note, however, that almost no previous US administration has escaped scathing criticism of its Asia policy, or the lack thereof. It is no coincidence that almost all analyses that tend to portray a Chinese \u2018soft power\u2019 on the rise throughout Asia, and eventually a new model of international relationships inaugu- rated by China, originate with American-based analysts and aca- demics. They are as much the product of doubt and frustration over present-day American policies and their public expression as thoughtful analyses of China\u2019s policy initiatives. In contrast, this vision of a weakened America is not one that is shared by all Chinese foreign policy analysts and commentators. Some certainly believe in the weakening of the political compact between America and several Asian states, and in the advent of a Beijing consensus that 55 Fran\u00e7ois Godement 9.

        "4 would challenge the US model. 10 Most analysts, however, show a healthy respect for America\u2019s hard power, and especially its military capabilities, which is often the first argument adduced for China\u2019s rise in military spending and technological modernisation. Almost all contemporary Chinese advocacy of a soft power role for China in Asia is based on consideration of the American precedent. In fact, while most Chinese foreign policy experts decry American unilat- eralism and defend the \u2018democratisation of international relations\u2019 (a catchphrase introduced by President Hu Jintao himself), they also articulate a vision for China\u2019s role, power and influence that replicates the American model on the world stage. Europe: a weak strategic partner for Asia Finally, Europe and the European Union, although they are in almost all sectors of the economy and society Asia\u2019s first or second external partner, have no discernable impact on the strategic and institutional balance of the Asia-Pacific. Europe\u2019s post-modern institutional construction, where there is no conception of a mili- tary balance and no prevailing nation-state, where the practical instruments for a common foreign and security policy are still very much in debate, and are as yet shared with the more traditional instruments of each of the 25 nation-states, is not easy to grasp for Asians, let alone regarded as a viable model for their own region. Asians predominantly see international relations either in terms of power balancing, or as a more or less subtle translation of the hier- archical relationships that prevail among nation-states. China itself, after a strong campaign for a \u2018strategic relation- ship\u2019 with Europe, has been disappointed by the failure to obtain a lifting of the arms embargo. This has led to a pragmatic concen- tration of China\u2019s European policy on trade issues, with the aim to deflect protectionism and to extend the European market\u2019s poten- tial to absorb Chinese goods and services. Europe, for which China represents the first source of external trade deficit and soon its first external supplier (before the United States), is the target of Chinese soft power and influence. But it is not a strategic partner as such, except to be used as a bargaining chip in China\u2019s relations with the US. However, on a symbolic level, the European integration model and the values it embodies are still of interest to many Chinese as well as Asians generally, because they constitute a puzzling achievement of post-national construction. 56 Neither hegemon nor soft power: China\u2019s rise at the gates of the West 10.

        "4 China\u2019s competitive advantage on the international stage The perceived decline of influence of other major actors on the international stage, and particularly in the Asia-Pacific, highlights China\u2019s own increasing clout on the international scene. But this is not merely a case of rise and fall in traditional geopolitical terms. In reality, China\u2019s international identity and its posture are not founded on the same premises as other major nations which have become pillars of the world order since 1945. In most strategic analysis, China sees itself as particularly careful to eschew the historical precedent of other great or imperial powers, and to limit the international responsibilities and burden it might have to shoulder. Two aspects stand out. China\u2019s newfound involvement with multilateralism is in practice synonymous with non-intervention in the affairs of sovereign states, including by multilateral organi- sations and internationally approved actions. This applied in the past to human rights and regime change issues. But today, in the case of both Iran and North Korea, it is also tied to a reluctance on China\u2019s part to consider any use of force or even to sanction back- ing up international resolutions. This situation cannot be said to derive from a lack of involve- ment on China\u2019s part with international organisations: China had sent 6,000 soldiers to participate in 15 UN peace-keeping mis- sions 11 before the recent decision to send another 1,000 soldiers to the UNIFIL force in Lebanon. Indeed, China has more personnel enrolled under the blue UN flag for police and peace-keeping mis- sions than any other permanent member of the UN Security Council or NATO member. 12 This also gives the PRC unique observation posts on many of the world\u2019s conflicts. It occasionally pays a price for this, with six casualties incurred over the years, the latest in Lebanon in July 2006. Increased participation by China in terms of the supply of troops does not imply a concomitant increase in China\u2019s financial contribution. China does not partic- ipate in missions where peace is established through the use of force, as opposed to peace-keeping missions, and only deploys peace-keepers under the UN flag and with UN blue helmets. As a developing country with very limited natural resources, China believes it has undertaken a huge effort of domestic reform to comply with the financial and trade rules of the global order. That domestic effort of adaptation makes China feel largely 57 Fran\u00e7ois Godement 11.

        "4 exempted from contributing to the preservation of this global order, which is still ensured by the major \u2018old\u2019 industrialised nations and in particular by the United States. In fact, China sees the threats to this free market exchange as coming more from the issue of international sanctions and blockades (e.g. from the world\u2019s pre-eminent maritime power, the United States), than from a disruption of this international order by rogue states and other unchecked actors. China\u2019s lack of commitment to the international system weak- ens the practical enforcement of international rules when sanc- tions and the use or force are called for. From its own perspective, China\u2019s bias against enforcement stems from the fear of being tar- geted one day by these very same international sanctions: concern over the Taiwan-China cross-strait issue is paramount, since China wishes to minimise international involvement over an area where it reserves the right to use force and is actively strengthening its military posture. But China\u2019s preference for a token international order and its reluctance to commit to collective enforcement also works to its advantage in another area: in effect, China does not join coalitions or international actions, does not place demands on its counter- parts, and therefore in certain circumstances appears as a \u2018safe\u2019 international partner. This is especially true for nation-states which have a reason to fear international action and sanctions, and the list of these extends well beyond rogue nations. The trend is particularly clear in relation to African states, where China now vies with other outside partners with its very competitive products and projects, including development aid packages with virtually no strings attached, other than the preferential purchase of Chi- nese goods. In effect, China is shaping a neutral international environment where there would be very little enforcement of international rules and values. Conversely, China now uses its trade, foreign investment, tourist policy, and educational exchanges as tools of influence abroad, particularly in developing or emerging countries. Eco- nomic aid, formerly very limited, is now expanding. China has, for example, earmarked 900 million dollars of preferential credit for Chinese exports towards Central Asia at the last Shanghai Coop- eration Organisation Summit in 2006. 13 That policy is by no means confined to the Asian environment. China has announced a larger contribution at the China-Africa Summit held in Beijing 58 Neither hegemon nor soft power: China\u2019s rise at the gates of the West 13.

        "4 in November 2006. President Hu Jintao pledged 5 billion dollars of preferential loans and export credits by 2009, while announcing a 5 billion dollar fund to boost Chinese investment in Africa and extolling a \u2018win-win relationship\u2019. 14 But it is particularly signifi- cant in an area where China is building the closest network of rela- tions. These aspects, along with the powerful development of modern mass communications targeting overseas Chinese audi- ences, embody a Chinese version of soft power, one which, how- ever, is predicated much more on the attraction of mutual inter- ests than on the furthering of values. Because China is a country led from above, whose firms and individuals have to be responsive to official demands, it is impossible to separate economic and societal relationships from state-to-state relations: it is the Chi- nese government which mostly dictates the terms of separation, or on the contrary linkage, between government relations and pri- vate developments. Spontaneous integration versus state-to-state relations Economists have emphasised the spontaneous drive towards eco- nomic integration in Asia, which started in fact in the mid-1980s as a consequence of the re-evaluation of the Japanese yen, and has revolved more directly around the Chinese economy since the Asian financial crisis of 1997. Trade trends, FDI figures, and the flow of people and services all indicate the birth of a cross-border transnational economy. China now sits at the centre of a triangular relationship where natural resources and technology are imported to produce finished goods using Chinese labour, and are then exported to the entire world \u2013 but principally to the United States and the European Union, the primary customers of China\u2019s processed goods industry. Much of the technologies and invest- ments originate from Asia. The argument is often made that as China integrates into the international marketplace, it accepts more international norms and rules. But the FDI and triangular trade that constitute the core of China\u2019s integration into the global market do not give much political leverage to any other state. By signing up to WTO rules, China has positioned itself at the heart of the global trading system. By adopting a very conservative policy of financial liberal- isation, it has also accumulated huge currency reserves which serve as political insurance against any international sanctions. 59 Fran\u00e7ois Godement 14.

        "4 The issue of China\u2019s soft power China\u2019s diversified and fast-growing relationship with Asia is often cited as evidence of a newly-found soft power, and indeed theories and policies of soft power are emerging among Chinese analysts themselves as an essential component of the country\u2019s foreign policy. But the term \u2018soft power\u2019 can be used in a variety of meanings, which do not necessarily coincide with the original def- inition of the phrase, as coined by Joseph Nye about the United States\u2019 unique influence abroad. 15 Joseph Nye by no means excluded the interplay of interests and the binding ties which come from technological advances or industrial mastery. But his definition of soft power proceeded from the capacity to inspire and persuade others, and therefore to apply policies, values, norms and bylaws to other countries and societies, even in the face of the reluctance and obstruction of authoritarian governments. China now possesses considerable commercial and financial influence by virtue of its own growing market, and the scope of its tourism, its media, and its educational and linguistic pull might suggest it has some claim to soft power status. Yet this can hardly compare to the global attractiveness of Western values as embod- ied by several centuries of democracy and free society. To compound the issue, theoreticians of international rela- tions sometimes get their facts on China wrong. For example, Joseph Nye himself has come out recently with an endorsement of China\u2019s soft power. 16 Unfortunately, the only distinct individual fact he cites to support the notion is the existence of Gao Xingqian, the Nobel Prize novelist of Chinese origin. This writer left his country in the wake of the Tiananmen crisis and has not been acknowledged as a fellow Chinese by PRC authorities, who never cite his work or his Nobel Prize: his case is in fact a good example of why China\u2019s influence founders on issues of democ- racy and free speech \u2013 at least as far as those who care for these issues are concerned. Much of Asia, in fact, remains ambivalent about democratic values and also feels attracted to the so-called \u2018Asian values\u2019. These values are predicated on a world view which may range from regarding society as an extended family to prioritising good gover- nance over democracy, or even to legitimising an authoritarian system that \u2018delivers the goods\u2019. This is true even in countries 60 Neither hegemon nor soft power: China\u2019s rise at the gates of the West 15.

        "4 where open and competitive electoral systems and political con- tests have taken hold, such as Japan, Korea and Taiwan. 17 For these countries, as former Singapore Prime Minister Lee Kuan- yew has expressed it, Chinese soft power may have a meaning in terms of civilisation and broad educational and cultural influ- ence. Exponents of Chinese world-views may take the process fur- ther, and put President Hu Jintao\u2019s advocacy of the \u2018democratisa- tion of international relations\u2019 and a \u2018harmonious international society\u2019 in the context of China\u2019s cultural renaissance, drawing from traditional Confucian values if not explicitly mentioning them. 18 More broadly, China\u2019s economic successes have spawned praise for a so-called \u2018Beijing consensus\u2019 as opposed to the Wash- ington consensus that originated with the post-war international order. Yet the Beijing consensus is more about what Chinese pol- icy is not than about what it is: non-interference, non-hegemony, no alliances, in short a world view which is antithetical to that attributed to the United States and which rests essentially on the principle of wu wei \u2013 the traditional Taoist prescription for inac- tion. What is much more positively emphasised, of course, is the development of mutually beneficial business relationships. China has taken a leaf out of the former Clinton administration\u2019s book: it is now advocating a \u2018win-win\u2019 approach through free trade. This is not surprising, since China often emerges as winner-takes-all in its international trade relations. Beyond this debate on the conceptual nature of China\u2019s soft power, two questions should be asked: (i) does China present to Asia a different model of relations from that proposed to other partners worldwide? (ii) does this \u2018soft model\u2019 apply to next-door neighbours with whom potential differences of interest loom largest? The answer to the first question is no. The recipes applied to South-East Asian nations and ASEAN, for instance, are not differ- ent from the policies applied to more distant partners such as Iran, Africa or South America. This holds true for attitudes towards international crises and international regimes as well as in areas of soft policy. Thus, China\u2019s slow-moving acceptance of interna- tional condemnations of North Korea\u2019s nuclear proliferation, but its steadfast opposition to any concrete sanction or international action until North Korea actually demonstrated its nuclear power status, is not different from the attitude it takes on the similar 61 Fran\u00e7ois Godement 17.

China\u2019s trade and investment diplomacy in South-East Asia is today mirrored by a similar priority given to trade and investment with South Asia, Central Asia or Africa, and this is also true of China\u2019s relations with the more distant Iran. Broad trade and human interchanges exist between China and Iran, and may be China\u2019s preferred tools of influence internation- ally. Aid linked to trade interests, investment in raw materials sec- tors, migration of Chinese businessmen and traders and resist- ance to international intervention in domestic affairs are the mainstays of China\u2019s new influence abroad. In the case of North Korea, the country\u2019s isolation has actually increased China\u2019s economic leverage and trading opportunities with Pyongyang, while many Chinese technologies were sold to North Korea and later transferred to third countries. The North Korean regime\u2019s distrust of its neighbour, and its strategy of inde- pendence, mean that a \u2018Chinese model\u2019 has not been contem- plated publicly since the early 1960s. North Korean leaders, how- ever, have repeatedly visited Chinese international development zones and tried their own hand at the concept \u2013 without Chinese help. In contrast, Iranian leaders, from Ayatollah Khamenei and former President Rafsanjani to the radical Ahmadinedjad, who do not have to deal with China as a next-door neighbour, have occa- sionally extolled a \u2018Chinese model\u2019 for Iran. 19 In both cases, China may also choose, in the event of a crisis, to distance itself from a partner who seeks its strategic and diplomatic support. Beijing balances these links with its relationship to the United States. China may in fact leverage its relations with questionable partners against the possibility of extracting a more positive attitude from the United States on its key strategic concerns, such as Taiwan and technological transfers. Even so, as we can observe from China\u2019s reaction after the North Korean nuclear test of 9 October 2006, China does not support strong economic sanctions and refuses to endorse the international inspection of North Korean ships to search for proliferation-related materials. It is very unlikely that China would take a different position in the case of Iran, should the issue arise. Similarly, China\u2019s strategy of cultural and linguistic influence is not exclusively confined to Asia. President Hu Jintao speaks of Chinese culture as intended \u2018for the world\u2019, and both the Chinese Bridge Programme and the Confucius Institutes \u2013 of which 100 62 Neither hegemon nor soft power: China\u2019s rise at the gates of the West 19.

This is also the case for diplomatic concepts such as the \u2018strategic partnerships\u2019 pioneered first with Russia, but now estab- lished with many foreign partners. ASEAN was the first interna- tional organisation to which China extended the notion of a strategic partnership, but it has sought a similar designation for its relationship with the European Union. In all these cases, the term \u2018strategic\u2019 refers more to the absence of divisive issues than to a joint strategy in the traditional geopolitical sense. Conversely, the preference for soft power and the resultant pragmatism do not apply to the same extent when China deals with its immediate neighbours and/or with issues of sovereignty. In the past half-century, China has been engaged in twenty-three territorial disputes encompassing all its land and sea neighbours, a world record. A recent perceptive study underlines China\u2019s ulti- mate willingness to compromise over many of these disputes and to settle for less than half of its original territorial claims, 21 but the same study does not necessarily take into account the outlandish scale of some of these initial claims. It cites insecurity as the main factor behind China\u2019s concessions. It also recognises that China takes a much harder stance in geographic areas where the Han population is involved, rather than ethnic minorities (e.g. Hong Kong and Macao in the past, Taiwan in the future), and is also a tougher contender in maritime disputes, because \u2018island groups cost little to dispute\u2019. 22 Finally, it notes that as China\u2019s economic and military confidence increases, the insecurity factor decreases accordingly: China might therefore be less prone to compromise in the future. In short, this analysis does not seem very convincing, beyond the fact that it is true to point out that China has indeed chosen compromise over confrontation in about half of the cases. As the continuing conflict over Taiwan and the bitter relationship with Japan indicate, and given that China has managed to become embroiled in a quarrel with North Korea over the symbolic issue of Mount Paektu and wider historical claims from the Kokuryo Kingdom period, it is clear that the PRC\u2019s irredentism can survive in the face of worldwide economic integration. In South-East Asia \u2013 where maritime issues are more remote and of less urgent con- cern \u2013 years of negotiations finally led in 2002 to a Declaration on the Conduct of Parties in the South China Sea.

Most of these commitments have little or no legally binding force. At the same time, future good relations between China and its neigh- bours do imply that China respects these new commitments. China and multilateral security in Asia China has become a member of all regional and subregional organ- isations in East Asia, whether formal or informal: e.g. APEC, the ASEAN Regional Forum, and CSCAP. 24 Furthermore, China has begun to spawn its own set of multilateral dialogues and institu- tions, such as the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation with Rus- sia and four Central Asian states, but expanding beyond this group to Afghanistan, India, Iran, Mongolia and Pakistan as observer states, and inviting representatives from ASEAN to their June 2006 summit in Beijing. More informally, China has also cre- ated the Boao Forum for Asia, originally a replica of the Davos Forum, and today essentially an economic and good relations \u2018talking shop\u2019 involving Asian leaders and some other invited par- ticipants; it participates in the North East Asia Cooperation Forum, originally created by former President Kim Dae-jung of South Korea; Chinese analysts have repeatedly floated the idea of a permanent North-East Asia Security Forum that would succeed the Six Party Talks on the Korean Peninsula, but this is strongly resisted by Japan. These developments are increasingly matched by many bilateral strategic and military dialogues, as well as port- of-call visits or even joint exercises by the Chinese Navy. In the lat- ter category, a surprising although symbolic China-India exercise in November 2003, and joint China-Russia land and sea exercises in July 2005, are important developments. It is to be noted that China has made many more discreet proposals to its neighbours for joint naval undertakings, for instance with a view to ensuring maritime security in the Malacca Straits. 64 Neither hegemon nor soft power: China\u2019s rise at the gates of the West 23.

        "4 These developments warrant two mutually complementary questions: has China significantly contributed to multilateral security by confidence-building measures and preventive diplo- macy? Do the international organisations which it has created represent an innovative and effective model of regional coopera- tive security? There are very different answers to the first ques- tion. 25 David Shambaugh speaks about the \u2018blizzard of meetings between Chinese officials and their counterparts\u2019 in Asia, and cites Chinese officials to the effect that China has come to learn the positive aspects of regional integration. He also cites China\u2019s New Security Concept \u2013 crafted in 1996 \u2013 as a major act of conversion to conflict avoidance, while recognising that this doctrine for export is mainly a rehashing of the five principles of pacific coexistence originally designed by Nehru\u2019s India and advocated by the Mao- Zhou China of the past. The reality is more complex. While China entered official mul- tilateral security institutions such as the ARF in 1993, and second- track forums such as CSCAP in 1996, its original flexibility has given way to a much more assertive stance on the Taiwan issue. After the Shangri-La Dialogue was launched in 2002 as an infor- mal meeting of Asia-Pacific Defence ministers under predomi- nantly Western auspices, China came around to the idea of an ARF defence ministers\u2019 meeting; but it began restricting its participa- tion, or even withdrawing its delegations in some instances, in all second-track security forums that invited Taiwanese participants, or that even mentioned the issue of Taiwan. ASEAN\u2019s Asia-Pacific Roundtable held annually in Kuala Lumpur, CSCAP and its work- ing groups, and the Shangri-La dialogue, have all experienced either a drop in Chinese participation, or an increase in polemics, since 2004. As regards conceptual progress and policy proposals, in 1996 CSCAP had designed a plan to move from confidence-building measures to preventive diplomacy and finally to cooperative secu- rity. Discussions have remained locked at the stage of confidence- building measures. \u2018New\u2019 issues such as terrorism and transna- tional crime have served to forge a superficial consensus. But this should not hide the lack of progress in every area that concerns the Asia-Pacific balance of power or regional preventive diplomacy, and the escalation in military spending by China. 26 Strikingly, of the original provisions discussed by CSCAP since 1996 (rotation of the ARF chair between ASEAN and non-ASEAN members, a 65 Fran\u00e7ois Godement 25.

The ARF has cre- ated an Annual Security Outlook with contributions by its mem- bers, but there is no defence White Paper process. While the ARF Chair has been tentatively entrusted with an \u2018enhanced role\u2019, that role is very limited: convening an ad hoc meeting can only be done \u2018upon prior consent of directly involved states and the consensus of all ARF members\u2019, while liaising with the heads of other inter- national organisations or second-track organisations can only be decided \u2018upon prior consent of the directly involved states and the consensus of all ARF members\u2019. 27 While a group for maritime security exists within CSCAP, it has avoided getting involved in the sensitive topics of maritime boundaries and freedom of naviga- tion \u2013 a situation in which, one must concede, Chinese semi-offi- cial participants can count on the support of their Indonesian and Indian colleagues. In sum, there has been little progress in most areas dealing with preventive diplomacy and security. A lucid Singaporean analyst 28 explains: \u2018Because of the ARF\u2019s focus on confidence building and the lack of movement on preventive diplomacy, the ARF is often seen as a talk shop. There is a growing recognition that the ARF must move from confidence building to embarking on practical cooperation. The ARF has had an encouraging response to the pub- lication of the Annual Security Outlook (ASO) of its members, which promotes transparency and builds mutual confidence. But it is unlikely that there will be scope for significant movement in areas of traditional security policy such as the prevention of mili- tary build-ups.\u2019 Most observers cite an increase in the \u2018comfort level\u2019 among participants as the essential achievement of multilat- eral security in Asia. Japan, among others, has lowered its expecta- tions with regard to both the ASEAN Regional Forum and second- track organisations related to security, because of scepticism as to the commitment of participants: \u2018it is unlikely that ARF countries will ever become willing to establish preventive diplomacy and con- flict-resolution mechanisms unless a major event shaking the regional security environment occurs\u2019. 29 Does China propose an alternative model of multilateral secu- rity for Asia that would deliver significant progress?

The latter case is easiest to dis- sect: while on paper it attracts many participants, only very formal sessions take place, with both Chinese and visiting government figures delivering speeches but no significant dialogue: although the original participation was meant to be entirely Asian, it has occasionally been broadened. Commercial interests and presenta- tions tend to preponderate at Boao, with many foreign firms offer- ing sponsorship. China has performed a very important service by hosting the Six Party Talks on the Korean Peninsula, and persuading North Korea to participate in those talks until 2005. But the meetings are said to be heavy on procedure and formality, and have not resumed since a very general declaration was adopted in October 2005. While China\u2019s diplomacy and its actual influence over North Korea are essential to the resolution of the issue, China has not created a new model of international relations in North-East Asia. Finally, the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation, which has been steadily built up as an international organisation with a Sec- retariat based in Beijing and a stream of potential applicant states, remains more ambiguous in its objectives and achievements. The 1,533 word-long Joint Communiqu\u00e9 of its June 2006 summit mentions the words \u2018terrorism\u2019 or \u2018terrorist\u2019 eleven times, reflect- ing the original goal of an organisation designed to fight against subversion. The communiqu\u00e9 only refers obliquely to a \u2018new inter- national situation\u2019, a sign that there is no possible strategic or even diplomatic joint action among the participants. Economic and trade objectives highlight the growing interrelationship between China and Central Asia. Evidently, China\u2019s energy diplomacy in Central Asia, and its aim to bring Iranian, Caspian Sea, Kaza- khstan and Russian oil and gas resources to China by pipeline, also give an incentive to the SCO, although negotiations in this sector remain bilateral between China and each of its counterparts. In short, China\u2019s soft power does not stem so much from posi- tive motives but rather from disaffection and mistrust towards American policies. China uses its good regional relations, its trade and its promises of non-interference as an instrument against containment of China\u2019s rise, and to protect China\u2019s international economic goals. This is a wise and realist policy from the point of 67 Fran\u00e7ois Godement cp94.qxp 09/01/2007 16:56 Page 67 ",
        "4 view of China\u2019s self-interest, but it is not a case of soft-power diplomacy. China\u2019s active participation in and contribution to multilater- alism is often focused on non-traditional security. In some cases this is also a response to past criticism of China: an example of this is the careful way in which the government has handled the issue of epidemics and the Asian flu, following the mismanaged SARS episode of 2002-2003. In others, the development could prove to be of more vital importance. For instance, an Asia Cooperation Dialogue (ACD) involving regular meetings of foreign ministers was started in 2002, comprising 16 Asian nations and 2 Gulf states, a membership which is still expanding. In June 2004 the ACD announced the \u2018Qingdao initiative\u2019 which includes an emphasis on \u2018ensuring safe energy transportation along vital ship- ping routes through dialogue and cooperation\u2019. 30 Since China and Japan are both signatories to this document, it may serve as a useful point of contact in the future. Regional cooperation and power balancing: a dual strategy Several conclusions emerge from this discussion. Just as Asia dur- ing the Cold War never experienced a complete freeze of economic relations, even though it was politically and militarily divided, today\u2019s tremendous economic growth and trade integration have not brought about complete d\u00e9tente and trust among Asian states. The growing interactions among diplomatic, military and second- track experts have not led to any new arrangements in traditional security, and divisions remain huge, even if more often than not they go unmentioned. In practice, this means that regional states often apply a mix- ture of \u2018bandwagoning\u2019 and hedging strategies towards China that fit in with their own interests. On the economic front, the bulk of China\u2019s global trade surplus (rising prospectively in 2006 to 200 billion dollars) comes from exports to the US and the EU, while China\u2019s neighbours benefit from exports of parts and components, or direct industrial investment, to China. This is a triangular trade pattern that benefits the more advanced Asian economies, at least in the short term. But economic \u2018bandwagon- ing\u2019 with China is matched by military \u2018hedging\u2019 against China. 68 Neither hegemon nor soft power: China\u2019s rise at the gates of the West 30.

        "4 This is true from North-East to South Asia. ASEAN as a whole, despite some reservations among its member states, has moved closer to Japan. Japan was the first external partner member at the origin of ASEAN\u2019s Post-Ministerial Conference and has taken on a maritime security role in South-East Asia, even if this is imple- mented by the Coast Guard rather than by Self-Defence Forces. Singapore may be close to China in its similar affirmation of Asian or Confucian values. But at the same time it has become a quasi- permanent port of call and logistical support for the US Pacific Fleet, in a swing area that serves both the South China Sea and the Indian Ocean. On the eve of the first East Asian Summit held in Kuala Lumpur in December 2005, ASEAN came out with a decla- ration of principle for its future legal and institutional Charter where, for the first time, it endorsed the \u2018promotion of democracy, human rights and obligations, transparency and good governance and strengthening democratic institutions\u2019. 31 Too much should not be made out of a declaration that was also signed by Burma/Myanmar and Vietnam. Nevertheless, the declaration must have sent a message both to China and to a watchful US that the new Summit was not going to be a proxy for China\u2019s diplo- macy. Finally, this duality of strategy is even more evident in the rela- tionship between China and India, the other rising economic giant in Asia. The long-sought normalisation of relations between the two nations that turned their back on each other after the bit- ter 1962 conflict has taken hold. Trade with China soared from 35 million dollars in 1995 to 15 billion dollars in 2005: a steep rise that, it should be noted, still represents only 1.2 % of China\u2019s global trade. China is now regarded enviously by many elements in Indian society, which identify the Chinese model with economic freedom and success, and compare this unfavourably with their own bureaucratic environment. The attraction towards China also implies competition. Meanwhile, India has become a member of the ASEAN Regional Forum, a partner in maritime security with several South-East Asian navies, and benefits hugely in its relationship with Washington from its status as a potential power- balancer with China. A balanced diplomacy is indeed at work, as testified by the fact that India has signed with Brazil, Germany and, most importantly, Japan, a joint pledge of solidarity to enter the UN Security Council as permanent members. 32 That particu- lar initiative has not been lost on China, which has not endorsed 69 Fran\u00e7ois Godement 31.

        "4 India\u2019s bid for a permanent seat at the Security Council, in spite of all the talk about warm relations. But India has reaped the benefits of this balanced diplomacy, most importantly with the Bush administration\u2019s decision to launch civilian nuclear cooperation with New Delhi, in effect whitewashing India\u2019s past acquisition of nuclear weapons, its 1998 tests and its ballistic developments. None of the above factors prevented the first Confucius Insti- tute in India from being launched at Jawaharlal Nehru University in May 2005, 33 on the occasion of Prime Minister Wen Jiabao\u2019s visit to India. Those who equate the rise of China\u2019s influence and, indeed, soft power, with a change in the power balance and strate- gic architecture of Asia would do well to consider this develop- ment, along with Washington\u2019s recognition and appreciation of India\u2019s strategic role in the regional balance. China\u2019s remarkable economic rise, its growing influence and more sophisticated diplomacy, do indeed create extraordinary incentives towards bet- ter relations between China and its international partners. But they also raise questions regarding the future security posture of China, and the consequences of a new balance of power in Asia and beyond. Many Asian states therefore engage China in mutually beneficial relations, while also seeking at the same time to balance Beijing\u2019s rising power with other strategic relationships. It would be a mistake, however, to expect many Asian states to take an active role in constraining China\u2019s influence by turning this regional bal- ancing act into an outright alliance against China. 70 Neither hegemon nor soft power: China\u2019s rise at the gates of the West 33.

        "China\u2019s energy policy and its contribution to international stability Philip Andrews-Speed Introduction As China\u2019s economy continues its sustained and rapid growth, so does its demand for energy and other natural resource raw materi- als. China is now the second largest consumer of primary commer- cial energy after the USA, accounting for 15% of the world\u2019s total. Over the four-year period from 2002 to 2006, China\u2019s total com- mercial energy consumption grew by more than 50%, increasing as rapidly as or even more rapidly than its GDP. This soaring demand for energy has placed a huge strain both on the economy and on the natural environment in China. As a result, energy is now at the top of the central government\u2019s agenda as they seek approaches to address the twin challenges of constraining energy demand and fulfilling energy needs. The country\u2019s appetite for energy is not only causing problems within China, but is also creating stresses overseas. These interna- tional stresses are becoming prominent at a time when energy as a whole is becoming increasingly politicised on the international scene. The aim of this chapter is to examine the drivers behind China\u2019s energy policy, to evaluate the perceived threats posed to the international community by China\u2019s international energy strategies, and to propose how the European Union may engage with China to address common interests in this domain. The sources of China\u2019s energy policy China\u2019s approach to the management of its energy sector and to the development of its energy policy derives from a number of underlying factors: (cid:90) The structure and rate of growth of the economy, and the con- sequent demand for energy; (cid:90) The nation\u2019s endowment of primary energy resources; 71 Facing China\u2019s rise: Guidelines for an EU strategy [ The author is very grateful for the contributions of Ma Xin at all stages of the writing of this chapter.] 5 cp94.qxp 09/01/2007 16:56 Page 71 ",
        "5 (cid:90) The government\u2019s perception of external threats and its prefer- ence for \u2018self-reliance\u2019; (cid:90) The nature of its industrial and social policies. As China\u2019s economy has grown over the last thirty years, inevitably there has been a concomitant rise in the demand for energy. But the rate of growth in the demand for energy, at about 5% per year, used to be consistently lower than the rate of increase of GDP, at least until the year 2002. This was attributed to the suc- cess of the government in reducing the energy intensity of the economy through shifts in the structure of the economy away from energy-intensive industries and through supporting meas- ures to enhance energy efficiency. 1 The recent years 2002 to 2005 have been marked by a substan- tial and sustained increase in both economic growth and in energy intensity. Indeed the years 2003 and 2004 saw annual rises of pri- mary energy consumption of 15%, higher than the official figures for GDP growth. This reversal of the improvements in energy intensity was a result of the government-induced boom in con- struction and heavy industry. The rapid growth of the economy combined with this rising energy intensity resulted in shortages of coal, electrical power and oil products. Since the mid-1990s China\u2019s government has become increas- ingly aware that the era of self-reliance for energy is at an end. Although it has ample coal resources, the remaining reserves of oil and natural gas are limited and growing dependence on imports for both oil and gas has become inevitable. However, the govern- ment has still sought to maintain as much direct control as possi- ble over the supply chain for oil and gas coming from overseas. This approach is based on a number of concerns which relate both to the oil and gas themselves and to wider security concerns. The reasonable belief that reserves of oil and gas are finite underlies a fear that there will inevitably be competition between nations for access to these dwindling resources. 2 This fear is fur- ther heightened by the realisation that China and the rest of the world will become increasingly dependent on the Middle East in order to meet their energy needs, with all the risks that this will entail. Furthermore, a large proportion of China\u2019s imports of oil \u2013 and, in the future, gas \u2013 will be transported through sea-lanes which are open to disruption by pirates, terrorists and accidents. 72 China\u2019s energy policy and its contribution to international stability 1.

        "5 Since its foundation in 1949, the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) has always been very sensitive to external threats from major powers, and this mindset still prevails today and is relevant to its energy strategy. The US is seen as providing the principal external threat to the nation\u2019s security today. US naval power ensures that America has control over sea-lanes throughout the world, including those which are of major importance to China. Whilst China may be prepared to free-ride on the security cover provided by the US in the Middle East, it is less comfortable with the US maintaining a controlling role in south and east Asia \u2013 not least because China\u2019s government fears that the US could block- ade China. 3 The final set of considerations underpinning China\u2019s approach to energy policy lie in the government\u2019s industrial and social policies. Despite the growth of the private sector in China and the continuing process of privatisation of state industries, the government has repeatedly insisted that \u2018pillar\u2019 industries such as energy will remain in state hands, for reasons of economic secu- rity, and that these companies are to be supported in their ambi- tions to become major international players. Such companies employ very large numbers of people. Their expansion overseas provides new opportunities for the employment of Chinese work- ers, which in turn helps the government address one of its most pressing social challenges, that of unemployment. The combination of industrial and social policies with the pref- erence for self-reliance also explains China\u2019s preference for carry- ing out as much raw material processing as possible within China, rather than importing the final processed product. Domestic pro- cessing maximises the interests of the state companies, employs more people and enhances \u2018self-reliance\u2019. Despite these short-term advantages, there are evident costs to such an approach in terms of energy consumption and pollution. These perceptions and priorities held by the Chinese govern- ment underlie an approach to energy policy which has been described as \u2018strategic\u2019 4 or \u2018mercantilist\u2019. 5 Central to this approach is the government\u2019s involvement in all parts of the energy sector, either by direct government action or by indirect influence through state energy companies, both within China and overseas. 73 Philip Andrews-Speed 3.

        "5 The key elements of domestic energy policy have been to max- imise domestic production of primary energy resources and energy products, to maintain state control of the energy sector, and to construct strategic oil storage. 6 The government continues to exert substantial control over the energy industry through its ownership of the major domestic energy companies. The govern- ment maintains tight control over prices for crude oil and oil products, as well as over wholesale and retail electricity prices. Coal prices are partly liberalised, but the government frequently has to step in to constrain the price charged to electricity genera- tors. The import and export of energy products also remain under state control. In 2004, China\u2019s energy sector was in such a state of crisis as a result of the soaring demand for energy that the government announced a strategy and a number of measures designed to tackle some of these deficiencies. Energy conservation and energy efficiency became a top priority, and incentives to develop clean and renewable energies were introduced. 7 China\u2019s international energy policy International dimensions of China\u2019s energy policy relate princi- pally to oil and, to a lesser extent, to natural gas. The main priorities are to diversify and secure imports of oil, to gain access to primary resources in the ground, and to enhance the security of oil and gas transportation to China. 8 Diversifying and securing oil imports Since the late 1990s the Chinese government has sought to secure long-term supply agreements with those states which hold large shares of global oil reserves and to diversify the sources of importa- tion. Four key agreements were achieved with Saudi Arabia, Iran, Angola and Russia. These four countries now supply some 45% of China\u2019s imports of crude oil compared to 13% in 1995. In each case, the oil supply objective was strongly supported by a range of diplo- matic and economic measures: for example, political and military ini- tiatives with Russia, a long-term political relationship with Iran backed by technology transfer and construction services, and recon- struction aid in Angola. Smaller supply agreements have also been completed with countries such as Nigeria, Brunei, Venezuela and Iraq. 74 China\u2019s energy policy and its contribution to international stability 6.

        "5 China\u2019s import strategy shows a preference for importing crude oil rather than oil products, partly because of the intention to maximize the quantity of oil refined within China 9 and partly because of the regulated prices for oil products in China, which are much lower than international levels. In this respect, the govern- ment has been encouraging certain oil-exporting states, such as Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, to invest in China\u2019s refining industry, for China needs new refineries which can process the high-sul- phur crude oil from the Middle East. The further component of the strategy for oil imports also relates to the limited capacity of China\u2019s refining industry to take the sour crude oils which many Middle East OPEC members pro- duce. This has provided a strong incentive for China to import increasing quantities of crude oil from West Africa which are both sweet and light, and well suited to China\u2019s refineries. Overseas investment China\u2019s national oil companies (NOCs) have been going abroad to acquire stakes in oil fields since 1993. They started slowly and went almost unnoticed. But now, one or more of them owns assets in almost every major oil-producing region in the world. The total investment to date has been estimated at seven billion US$. 10 In some countries, for example Sudan, they are welcomed as strategic partners. In others, such as the US, they are repelled as they are seen as representing a threat to strategic interests. The drivers for the overseas investments come from two sources: the government and the NOCs themselves. 11 The govern- ment takes the view that Chinese companies owning the produc- tion rights to oil reserves overseas will enhance national energy security. A second driver for government is the desire to promote its NOCs as national champions. This dovetails with the ambi- tions of the NOCs themselves to become major international oil companies. As remaining oil and gas reserves in China are limited, the future for expansion lies overseas. A third and final strand of government policy derives from the way in which the NOCs\u2019 activities may be used to support wider diplomatic and strategic goals around the world. In this context the Chinese government may seek to address, directly or indi- rectly, the needs of the host government. Certain host governments may need NOCs from China or other countries to participate in the development of their 75 Philip Andrews-Speed 9. Robert E. Ebel, 2005, op. cit. 10.

        "5 resources or may seek to use China\u2019s eagerness to secure oil sup- plies as a lever to fulfil their own political goals. Examples include: countries in which the US or Western governments have forbid- den their own companies to invest (e.g. Iran, Sudan, Burma/Myan- mar and Syria); governments with a stated desire to break the \u2018monopoly\u2019 of western companies (e.g. Equatorial Guinea, Libya); governments which want to \u2018tweak the nose\u2019 of the West or the US (e.g. Venezuela, Iran); governments which are keen to obtain aid and infrastructure from China (e.g. Angola, Sudan and Nigeria); and governments which want to regain control over their natural resources (e.g. Kazakhstan, Russia). Securing the transport routes China sees itself as being partially enveloped by a \u2018belt\u2019 of oil and gas reserves which extends from the Russian Far East, through Siberia to Central Asia and then on to the Middle East. In those countries and regions immediately adjacent to China, the construction of oil and gas pipelines is seen by the government as an effective way to enhance the security of oil and gas supply by reducing the country\u2019s reliance on international sea-lanes. A pipeline from Kazakhstan to western China with an initial capacity of 10 million tonnes per year was opened early in 2006. The planned capacity is 20 million tonnes per year by 2010. 12 Further oil pipelines may be con- structed from central Asia, both for oil and gas. Plans for a 20 mil- lion tonne per year oil pipeline from Russia to China continue to be delayed by controversy within Russia as well as by tension between China and Japan; 13 however it is likely that such a pipeline will be completed by 2010. In the meantime more than 10 million tonnes per year of crude oil is being transported from Rus- sia to China by rail. Gas pipelines from Russia and Central Asia are also under discussion. A second type of pipeline has been discussed which is intended to reduce the risk or distance for tankers carrying oil from the Middle East. One idea is to construct a pipeline across the isthmus of southern Thailand in order to reduce the amount of oil being conveyed through the Straits of Malacca. The likelihood of this project progressing in the near future is reduced by the cost of working in such difficult terrain and the risks associated with domestic unrest in that region of Thailand. Furthermore, this project might damage China\u2019s relations with those countries in the region which benefit financially from the shipping and which 76 China\u2019s energy policy and its contribution to international stability 12.

        "5 would stand to lose from the pipeline. 14 The second project would see a pipeline built from the Indian Ocean through Burma/Myan- mar to south-west China. This would obviate the need for oil being transported from the Middle East to pass through the Straits of Malacca and cross the South China Sea. This second alternative does indeed offer more benefits but also involves political risks and potentially high construction costs across hazardous terrain. At the same time as pursuing a pipeline strategy to reduce its dependency on sea-lanes, the government is also seeking to better protect the sea-lanes of communication through the Indian Ocean and the Malacca Strait through three types of measures. The first involves participating in the construction of new deep- water ports or gaining access to existing ports in south and south- east Asia. These steps are central to the PLA navy\u2019s strategy to develop a \u2018string of pearls\u2019 in these countries to deter the disrup- tion of energy supplies from potential threats, including the US Navy. The second involves the gradual development of the Navy\u2019s \u2018blue water\u2019 capacity, with the help of Russia. The third involves China\u2019s participation in regional initiatives to enhance security in the South China Sea region. The role of oil and gas diplomacy The relationship between China\u2019s government and its NOCs con- tinues to be close both at home and abroad. Overseas, the govern- ment has an interest not only in oil and gas, but in enhancing its wider geopolitical influence and status, in persuading govern- ments to switch their allegiance away from Taiwan, in regional security in the \u2018near-abroad\u2019 of Central and East Asia, as well as in other economic activities. The nature and strength of the links between the oil and gas strategy and these wider political, strategic and economic goals vary from country to country, and, consequently, so will the degree of involvement of the government in oil and gas decisions. In strategically important countries such as Kazakhstan, Russia, Iran, Saudi Arabia and Sudan, the government is not only very closely involved, but may actually play the leading role. In other Middle Eastern states of less strategic importance, and certain African and Latin American countries (such as Angola and Venezuela) the role of government may be less but will still be sig- nificant. Elsewhere the government may play only a supporting role. 77 Philip Andrews-Speed 14. Bo Kong, 2005, op. cit. cp94.qxp 09/01/2007 16:56 Page 77 ",
        "5 Regardless of the role played by government, oil and gas exploitation is rarely the sole activity undertaken by China in a country. In most cases it is accompanied by a package of deals arranged by state companies, private companies and government agencies, coordinated to a greater or lesser degree, which may cover a wide range of investment and trade (for example in Africa), 15 may include substantial aid packages in poorer coun- tries, may involve transfers of civilian or military technology, may be supported by the provision of civilian workers or military per- sonnel, and may be underpinned by inter-government agree- ments. International implications of China\u2019s energy strategy The early years of the twenty-first century have seen growing con- cern around the world about the way in which China is managing its domestic energy sector and is conducting its international energy policy. However, some of these concerns are based on dis- torted perceptions of Chinese intentions and misunderstanding of key issues relating to energy markets. Whilst certain parties persist in presenting China\u2019s international energy strategy as a threat to western interests, a growing number of informed commentators agree that this pattern of behaviour does not represent a concerted attempt by China to undermine the interests of the US or Europe; but rather that it has emerged from a cluster of strategies designed to address national needs. 16 The actual or perceived stresses arising from China\u2019s behaviour may be examined under three categories: economic, political or strategic, and environmental. China\u2019s ever increasing demand for oil is indeed a contributory factor to the current level of high oil prices, but only one of a num- ber of economic and political factors. The strategy of sending its NOCs to acquire oil and gas resources around the world, as a num- ber of other countries are also doing, does not reduce the total availability of crude oil to the world. Quite the reverse. These NOCs add to the world\u2019s flows of oil and gas by investing in pro- jects and locations that the private sector will not touch. Competi- tion for oil does exist in certain cases. For example, both the US and China are keen to import the sweet light crude oil from West 78 China\u2019s energy policy and its contribution to international stability 15.

        "5 Africa. However, for as long as investments from all parties con- tinue to flow into the region, the supply of this valuable oil should continue to grow. Whilst China\u2019s strategy does not directly threaten the energy security of other oil-importing nations, China\u2019s NOCs do provide competition to international oil companies (IOCs), independent oil companies and even other NOCs. This competition is seen to be \u2018unfair\u2019 given the scale of the diplomatic support given to the NOCs by China\u2019s government and the availability of funding on very favourable terms. 17 Though China by itself does not pose a threat to the effective operation of international markets for energy projects and energy products, the increasing tendency of producer and consumer governments around the world to follow such approaches certainly does threaten to undermine existing systems and norms in the international energy markets. At the same time, opportunities for inward investment in China\u2019s energy sector remain limited. 18 The convergence of China\u2019s foreign policy and energy policy does create some real or perceived stresses of a political or strategic nature. China\u2019s energy diplomacy and the acquisition of overseas oil and gas assets enhance the perception of competition between states and regions for resources. This perception \u2013 which, arguably, is misguided \u2013 will encourage energy-producing states to play China and Asia off against the West: for example, Venezuela, Russia and Iran and smaller countries. But in most cases these are merely political postures and not viable threats, for two reasons: first, the producers have concerns regarding security of demand just as much as consumers have concerns about secu- rity of supply; and second, there are always alternative suppliers, at least in the long term. Two areas of real concern do exist. The first relates to China\u2019s willingness to ignore international opinion in its dealings with \u2018states of concern\u2019 such as Iran, Sudan, Burma/Myanmar, Turk- menistan, Venezuela, Uzbekistan and a number of states in central and west Africa. China\u2019s preference to ignore the nature of the political leadership in these countries and to refrain from interfer- ing in their domestic affairs is one of the key longstanding corner- stones of the country\u2019s foreign policy. However this approach clearly undermines the policy of some western governments to encourage good governance and democracy, and to promote their 79 Philip Andrews-Speed 17. Peter C. Evans and Erica S. Downs, \u2018Untangling China\u2019s Quest for Oil through State- backed Financial Deals\u2019, Policy Brief no. 154 (Washington D.C.: The Brookings Institution, 2006). 18.

        "5 own interests. The second area of potential tension lies in China\u2019s ambition to exert greater control over sea-lanes which the US cur- rently views as being under its umbrella. The third major set of stresses arising for China\u2019s energy sector relate to the environment. Though the US\u2019s energy sector is the largest in the world and produces the greatest amount of emis- sions, China\u2019s energy sector is catching up, and in some respects is much more polluting in terms of acid rain, particulates and toxic metals. Should China\u2019s energy demand continue to grow at the rate and in the way it has in recent years, then its impact on the global and regional environment will necessarily exacerbate ten- sions with neighbours and with the world at large. Similar con- cerns relate to China\u2019s ambitions for its nuclear energy industry with respect to safety, the environment and proliferation. Challenges and opportunities for the European Union These perceived and real threats provide an opportunity for coop- eration between the EU and China in the field of energy. 19 Clear common interests exist, for example the desire to enhance the availability of oil and gas to the world and the security of energy transportation routes, and the need to improve the management of China\u2019s energy sector with positive consequences for its econ- omy and for the regional and global environment. Set against such optimism is the reality that, as in many fields of potential cooper- ation, there may be common interests but there are not always shared values, 20 especially with respect to intervention in the affairs of other states and in the relationship triangle between the US, the EU and China. Any strategy developed by the EU, or the US, to develop a sub- stantial programme of cooperation with China in the field of energy should address three issues. First, the EU should resist the temptation to criticise or obstruct China\u2019s international energy policy. Rather, there is a need to understand China\u2019s concerns and the strands of logic behind its behaviour. For China is neither the first nor the only country to have pursued or to be engaged in the pursuit of such strategies. History suggests that countries and governments follow a learning curve with respect to their understanding of and 80 China\u2019s energy policy and its contribution to international stability 19.

        "5 trust in international oil markets, 21 and that China\u2019s mercantilist approach may well evolve, not least as a result of increasing costs. The second dimension of the cooperation strategy builds on the first, and seeks to encourage China\u2019s integration into interna- tional energy and economic systems and institutions. To achieve this it is necessary to assist China in enhancing its understanding of and confidence in international energy markets and to encour- age deeper participation in organisations such as the Interna- tional Energy Agency. 22 Further, it may be desirable to encourage China to raise its international commercial credibility in the energy sector by abiding by existing international norms relating to export credits in order to reduce the impression of \u2018unfair com- petition\u2019 and by adhering to current and future WTO rules relat- ing to energy products and services. 23 Parallel diplomatic measures will be needed to raise awareness in China of perceptions in the EU and the US of China\u2019s \u2018non- interference\u2019 approach and to encourage China\u2019s active participa- tion and cooperation with western nations in addressing the chal- lenges and risks posed by failing states. There will also be a need to alleviate Chinese fears over the security of sea-lanes. The third component of a programme of cooperation should be directed at China\u2019s domestic energy sector. This would have two components, \u2018soft\u2019 and \u2018hard\u2019. The \u2018soft\u2019 component could include assistance in the formulation of energy policy and strategies, capacity building at all levels of government, assistance with energy data collection and management, and encouraging com- mercial cooperation between European and Chinese energy-pro- ducing companies. The second \u2013 and much more important \u2013 \u2018hard\u2019 cooperation would involve the provision of technologies, skills and funds to allow China to make massive and rapid advances in energy effi- ciency and energy conservation, and in clean and renewable ener- gies, including clean coal technologies, biofuels and carbon sequestration. The benefits of such programmes to China, the region and to the world will be very great, but so will the costs. The European Union and China embarked on a programme of cooperation in the field of energy in 1996. The time has come to widen the scope of this programme, to deepen the commitment and to massively expand the funding. 81 Philip Andrews-Speed 21.

        "US-China relations: running on two tracks Marcin Zaborowski Introduction There is no doubt that US-China relations are of major importance for the future of the global order and especially for international relations in East Asia-Pacific. No other power challenges America\u2019s global prominence to the extent that China does and this is likely to be even more the case in the future. The rise of China has already challenged the balance of power in East Asia and America\u2019s posi- tion in the region. China\u2019s growing economic presence in Africa, the Middle East and Latin America has provided an alternative to the US\u2019s (and the EU\u2019s) influence there and has weakened Amer- ica\u2019s leverage vis-\u00e0-vis the regimes with which it has differences, such as Iran, Sudan and Venezuela. 1 However, although the rise of China preoccupies American diplomats and Pentagon planners, it would be premature to assume that this relationship is bound to grow more acrimonious. Sino-American relations are simply too complex and multi-lay- ered to be assessed only by focusing on conflict areas. On the posi- tive side, a largely good historical record exists: the two countries were on the same side during the Second World War, America played an active role in bringing China back into the global system and there are close societal links between the two countries. For example, a considerable proportion of China\u2019s young and upcom- ing \u00e9lite has been educated at American universities. On the other hand, the two states are locked in uneasy relations over Taiwan and they increasingly compete for influence in the wider East Asian arena. The economic and energy aspects of the relationship are also ambivalent. This chapter addresses the post-Cold War evolution of the rela- tionship by way of focusing on some key areas of conflict and cooperation, including regional security, energy and the economy. The chapter also discusses Washington\u2019s and Beijing\u2019s policy approaches towards each other. 83 Facing China\u2019s rise: Guidelines for an EU strategy 1.

        "6 The end of the grand bargain In the 1970s President Richard Nixon and Chairman Mao Zedong, followed by President Jimmy Carter and Supreme Leader Deng Xiaoping, constructed a strategic \u2018grand bargain\u2019 that kept the Sino-American relationship on the path of rapprochement until the end of the Cold War. The \u2018bargain\u2019 concerned first and foremost China\u2019s posture in the Cold War context, Beijing declaring itself neutral and severing its security links with the Soviet Union. In return, the US recognised the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) and committed itself to a \u2018One-China\u2019 policy. Consequently, Wash- ington severed its diplomatic links with the government of the Republic of China (ROC) in Taiwan and withdrew from its defence treaty with the island, although it declared that it \u2018continues to have an interest in the peaceful resolution of the Taiwan issue and expects that it will be settled peacefully by the Chinese themselves\u2019. 2 It is worth noting that although farsighted and controversial, America\u2019s policy shift with regard to Taiwan did not seem as radi- cal in the 1970s as it may appear today. After all, the \u2018One-China\u2019 principle was not a matter of debate, in fact it was one of the few areas of consensus between the mainland and the island. There was no disagreement between Beijing and Taipei on the principle of unification, which was seen by both sides as their ultimate objective, albeit on their respective terms. There was also no nor- mative argument involved \u2013 Taiwan was a dictatorship, just like the mainland. Perhaps most importantly, there was no sense of urgency in addressing the issue \u2013 both the US and China agreed that the Taiwanese question should be relegated to the back- ground and dealt with in the distant future. Underpinning this \u2018grand bargain\u2019 there were some vital secu- rity and economic interests. The US was eyeing China as a huge untapped market and the Chinese were looking towards the US as a useful partner in overcoming the country\u2019s isolation and back- wardness. As long as the Cold War persisted, even the American military presence in Asia-Pacific was seen as mutually beneficial, with the Chinese perceiving it as a useful and cost-free bulwark against the Soviet threat. China also provided the US with valu- able intelligence during the Soviet operation in Afghanistan and the US did the same for China during its border war with Vietnam in 1979. 84 US-China relations: running on two tracks 2.

        "6 With the end of the Cold War and the demise of the Soviet threat, the terms of the grand bargain have collapsed one after another. In the wake of the Cold War the US no longer perceived China as a strategic asset in its competition against the former Soviet Union. In fact, with its dynamically expanding economy and its growing international confidence, China started to be seen by some in Washington as a replacement for the outgoing Soviet threat. For China the American military presence in its vicinity and its security alliances in Asia-Pacific lost their value as a cost- free deterrent against the Soviets; instead, they now perceived all this as directed towards the containment of China itself. Finally, the Taiwanese issue, for so long put on the back burner, came back to haunt the relationship much earlier than anticipated by Mao, who had not envisaged this happening for at least a century. No longer a military dictatorship, Taiwan is now a democracy. More- over, the principle of \u2018One China\u2019 ceased to unite Beijing and Taipei, with the Taiwanese President Chen Shui-bian being elected in 2000 and 2004 as an advocate of the island\u2019s independ- ence. In other words, since the 1990s the Sino-American relationship has been affected by two sets of challenges \u2013 the end of strategic congruence that followed the collapse of bipolarity and the re- emergence of regional East Asian conflicts (most importantly China\u2019s disputes with Taiwan and Japan), with the US being often pitched against China in this context. Contemporary ambiguity The post-Cold War Sino-American relationship remains dynamic, often close yet at the same time highly ambivalent. America is both China\u2019s friend and its regional rival. For one American President, China was America\u2019s \u2018strategic partner\u2019, for another it is its \u2018strate- gic competitor\u2019. 3 Washington and Beijing tend to agree on how to handle North Korea but are much less in agreement on how to deal with Iran. Economic relations between the two are increasingly interdependent, yet they are also burdened by a growing number of trade and exchange rate disputes. There are three main areas of the relationship where this ambivalence is most apparent \u2013 (i) rela- tions in Northeast Asia, (ii) energy and (iii) economic relations. 85 Marcin Zaborowski 3. The term \u2018strategic competitor\u2019 was used by President George W. Bush during his campaign to dif- ferentiate his approach from the approach of President Clinton, who referred to China as a \u2018strate- gic partner\u2019. cp94.qxp 09/01/2007 16:56 Page 85 ",
        "6 Northeast Asia Despite the end of the Cold War, America remains present in the East Asian region both diplomatically and militarily. Through its alliances with Japan and South Korea as well as its close relations with Taiwan, the American presence in the region is a pivotal ele- ment in the regional balance of power. There are currently 34,000 US troops based in Japan and another 37,000 in South Korea. Japan remains almost completely reliant on American military protection and its security relations with the US have only strengthened in recent years, including an agreement on Japan hosting America\u2019s missile defence installation. In a historic decision signifying its first overseas deployment since the end of the Second World War, in 2004 Tokyo agreed to send troops to Iraq. 4 The alliance with South Korea remains less intimate not least because the US has been critical of Seoul\u2019s \u2018sunshine policy\u2019 towards the North which Washington sees as weakening its leverage on Pyongyang. Still, Seoul is firmly sup- portive of the US military presence in the area and it tends to band- wagon behind the US on all major security issues, including Iraq. 5 Taiwan But it is America\u2019s relations with Taiwan that represent the most contentious issue in the Sino-US relationship. Contrary to com- mon belief, the US has not officially committed itself to the defence of the island. The Taiwan Relations Act (TRA), adopted by the Con- gress as the basis for regulating America\u2019s relations with the island in 1979, does not oblige the US to resort to military intervention in the event of an attack. The TRA refers merely to US interest in a peaceful resolution of the Taiwan question, stating in this context that forceful military action would be of \u2018grave concern to the United States\u2019 and that Washington\u2019s policy is to \u2018maintain the capacity of the United States to resist (\u2026) coercion\u2019 in addressing the Taiwanese issue. In this context, the TRA provides for the sale of US defence equipment and services to Taiwan that \u2018may be necessary to enable Taiwan to maintain a sufficient self-defence capability\u2019. 6 However, as long as the Cold War endured, Washington was willing to compromise with the mainland even in such sensitive matters as its arms sales to Taiwan. In a joint US-PRC commu- niqu\u00e9, issued in August 1982, the PRC stated that its \u2018fundamen- tal policy\u2019 was to resolve the Taiwanese issue peacefully. In return, Washington stated that it did not \u2018seek to carry out a long-term 86 US-China relations: running on two tracks 4.

        "6 policy of arms sales to Taiwan\u2019 and that \u2018it intends to reduce grad- ually its sales of arms\u2019. 7 Following the normalisation of US-China relations and the adoption of the TRA, Washington\u2019s policy towards Taiwan has been referred to as \u2018strategic ambiguity\u2019. On the one hand, Wash- ington recognised the PRC as the only legitimate representative of China and it agreed with the principles of the \u2018One China\u2019 policy, also indicating that it was going to end its arms sales to Taiwan in the future. On the other hand, the TRA provided for unofficial yet still extensive relations with Taiwan and continuing arms sales to the island. Whilst the 1982 US-China communiqu\u00e9 implied an eventual ending of the sale of American weapons to the island, it left it to the US to decide on the timing of such a termination. \u2018Strategic ambiguity\u2019 proved effective in maintaining the deli- cate balance in the US-China-Taiwan triangle until the end of the Cold War and even later into the early 1990s. However, the post- Cold War rise of China and the weakening of the strategic ration- ale for the continuing Sino-America rapprochement put America more firmly in the position of Taiwan\u2019s protector. Rather than decreasing the sale of its arms, as suggested by the terms of the 1982 communiqu\u00e9, the sales of US weapons to Taiwan have actu- ally expanded. For example, in 1992 the US sold 150 F-16 aircraft to Taiwan and, more recently, in 2001 President Bush approved a sale of Kidd-class destroyers, antisubmarine P-3 \u2018Orion\u2019 aircraft and diesel submarines. 8 The US has also made some bold moves and issued declara- tions suggesting that it would resist any aggression against Tai- wan. In 1996 the PRC fired missiles close to the Taiwanese shore in an apparent attempt to influence the presidential elections there \u2013 allegedly, to discourage the islanders from voting for Lee Teng-hui who was critical of Beijing\u2019s version of the One-China policy. 9 President Clinton responded by sending two US carrier battle groups into the area. In 2001 President Bush publicly declared that the US would do \u2018whatever it takes\u2019 to help Taiwan\u2019s defence \u2013 this position signifying a departure from the more cautious tone of his predecessors. In other words, \u2018strategic ambiguity\u2019 seemed to be giving way to a clearer and more assertive position on the Taiwanese issue in Washington. On the other hand, the US has not abandoned its \u2018One-China\u2019 policy and it continues to oppose Taiwanese independence. Reportedly, the US is involved in a fair amount of 87 Marcin Zaborowski 7.

        "6 arm-twisting to discourage the current administration of Chen Shui-bian against declaring independence and antagonising the mainland. This suggests that despite all the occasional muscle-flex- ing, the US and China are in fact implicitly co-operating on the Tai- wanese issue and that their objectives are not really irreconcilable. 10 North Korea The area where US-Chinese co-operation is far less problematic, although far from being free from controversy, is North Korea. His- torically, the US and China were at the frontline of the Cold War divide in the Korean peninsula. During the Korean War US marines faced the Chinese \u2018voluntary army\u2019 that crossed the border to sup- port the North Korean communist forces. Following the Armistice Agreement, the US signed a Mutual Defence Treaty with the South in 1953 and it effectively became the sponsor state of the Republic of Korea (ROK), basing its troops directly over the Southern side of the Armistice Line poised to deter aggression from the North. China played a similar role vis-\u00e0-vis the Democratic People\u2019s Repub- lic of Korea (DPRK), signing a bilateral treaty with Pyongyang and (alongside the Soviet Union) committing itself to the economic and military assistance to the North. This state of play remained in place unchallenged throughout the Cold War; in fact, much of it persists. Whilst China established diplomatic relations with the South in 1992, the US has not done the same with the North. Some American forces have been pulled out from South Korea, but the US continues to maintain a large military presence there. In the meantime, China maintained and, indeed, increased its position as the DPRK\u2019s sponsor and its main economic lifeline. China accounts now for 40 percent of the North\u2019s trade (twice as much as South Korea), it continues to sup- ply the North with essential fuels and grain and the DPRK\u2019s econ- omy is increasingly incorporated into China\u2019s development plans for its northeast regions. 11 Perhaps most importantly, China is in favour of retaining the status quo on the Korean peninsula and pre- venting a collapse of the DPRK. There are many reasons why China chooses to pursue this approach, not least because of a likely flood of North Korean refugees across its 1,400 km long bor- der and the subsequent economic implications for its weak north- east regions. But an expectation that the US could dominate a future unified Korea forms an important part of Beijing\u2019s ration- ale for its continuing support for the current DPRK regime. 88 US-China relations: running on two tracks 10.

        "6 However, despite these historical and contemporary differ- ences, the US and China share one very important objective \u2013 a strong preference for a nuclear-free Korean peninsula. For Amer- ica, a nuclear North Korea represents a direct threat to its position in the region \u2013 where it may attack or blackmail its allies Japan or South Korea \u2013 and in the longer term DPRK may develop a capac- ity (i.e. the Dapodong-II missile, which is planned to have a 4,000- mile range) to reach the US itself. 12 Even more urgently, the US is seriously concerned about the possibility of Pyongyang selling its nuclear technology to terrorists, which is not an impossible prospect considering the DPRK\u2019s dire economic situation and the regime\u2019s involvement in illegal activities (for example counterfeit- ing US currency and trade in narcotics). 13 China opposes North Korea\u2019s nuclear programme for a variety of reasons, of which perhaps the most important are its regional security implications and especially the reaction of Japan. China sees the progressive \u2018normalisation\u2019 of the Japanese defence policy as largely prompted by North Korea\u2019s aggressive posture, such as the incident in which the DPRK fired a missile that flew over Japan in 1998 or the revelation in 2002 that Japanese citizens had been kidnapped over the years by the North Korean secret service. 14 According to the Chinese, these incidents provided Japan with an \u2018excuse\u2019 to remilitarise and change its constitution in the way that would allow it to take a more proactive security role in the region and possibly counterbalance China\u2019s influence. 15 China is also worried that further development of the North\u2019s nuclear pro- gramme could prompt a domino effect in the region with Japan, South Korea and even Taiwan (the latter being the most alarming prospect for Beijing) going nuclear too. There are also environ- mental concerns for Beijing to consider, such as the possibility of an accident at a North Korean nuclear facility along the border, which would be likely to result in a large-scale contamination of the Chinese northeastern regions. 16 The US and China have closely cooperated over the North Korean issue. China was instrumental in setting up the Six-Party Talks framework in response to the US demand to multilateralise the North Korean issue. China was also the main architect of the failed agreement following the fourth round of Six-Party Talks in September 2005. This agreement was meant to end the DPRK\u2019s nuclear programme and facilitate its return to the NPT in exchange for America\u2019s security guarantees and international help 89 Marcin Zaborowski 12.

        "6 in the construction of light-water reactors in North Korea. 17 Although the September 2005 deal has subsequently collapsed, Washington\u2019s cooperation with Beijing has only increased over time. In less than a year Presidents Bush and Hu Jintao had three meetings and six telephone conversations to discuss the North Korean issue. There have been numerous interactions between the Chinese Foreign Office and the State Department, including Bei- jing sending its special envoy to the US and frequent visits by Chris Hill (US special envoy responsible for the DPRK dossier) to China. 18 Whilst the US and China agreed on their opposition to the North Korean nuclear programme, until recently they have had very divergent views on the best tactics to be applied towards Pyongyang. Washington has been continuously in favour of sanc- tions whilst Beijing has preferred dialogue and negotiations. However, following the nuclear test that North Korea appears to have carried out on 9 October 2006, both the US and China voted at the United Nations in favour of a resolution demanding an immediate return of the DPRK to Six-Party talks and imposing sanctions (under chapter 7, though excluding the use of force) against Pyongyang. 19 Although subsequently some differences have emerged in Washington\u2019s and Beijing\u2019s respective interpreta- tions of the sanctions (with China declaring that it would not search North Korean cargoes) the very fact that for the first time China endorsed a putative action against its prot\u00e9g\u00e9 demonstrates the growing convergence of American and Chinese interests on the issue. Energy The US and China are the world\u2019s largest energy consumers and major importers of raw materials, especially gas and oil. Both the US and China are expected to maintain this position and further increase their dependency on external energy sources in the future. By 2030 China\u2019s oil demand will grow by 150% from 5.3 to 13.3 mil- lion barrels per day (mb/d) whilst America\u2019s oil consumption will grow by 39% from 19.7 mb/d in 2002. 20 The US now imports about 47% of its oil but by 2030 this figure will have climbed to 66% whilst China\u2019s dependency on imported oil may grow from 40% in 2004 to as high as 80% in the next 20 years. 21 In many respects, China and the US are therefore in comparable positions \u2013 they 90 US-China relations: running on two tracks 17.

        "6 both have enormous energy needs and both are eying each other warily as competitors at the global energy market. The two states are also deeply suspicious about each other\u2019s foreign policy agendas in the energy-rich regions. The Chinese see America\u2019s Middle Eastern policy as driven first and foremost by its quest for oil and its \u2018war on terror\u2019 becoming an excuse to secure US access to the region\u2019s resources. America\u2019s \u2018democracy promo- tion\u2019 agenda is seen in this context as a tool for securing its lasting political influence and making sure that the governments in the region will favour close economic relations with the US. As argued by Jiamian Yang, \u2018 the US has taken a road of democracy promo- tion for energy security\u2019. The US military presence in Iraq and even in Afghanistan serves the same purpose according to Chinese scholars. 22 The US views with equal apprehension China\u2019s growing pres- ence in the Middle East, Africa and even in its direct vicinity in Latin America. There are three types of standard arguments that appear in the US debate on the issue. Firstly, China\u2019s aggressive investments are blamed for pushing oil prices up to the level that hurts the global, especially American, economy. It is also argued in this context that much of the recent price hikes have been artifi- cially created by China seeking contracts that would guarantee it sole use of supplies. 23 Secondly, China is accused of undermining US diplomacy and its anti-terror campaign by investing in the states that Washington accuses of sponsoring terrorist networks, such as Iran and Sudan. 24 Thirdly, some experts argue that China is proliferating its conventional and unconventional weapons technology in exchange for oil contracts in the Middle East and especially in Iran and Saudi Arabia. 25 America\u2019s economic and political prominence in the oil-rich Middle East and to a lesser extent in Latin America is apparent. However, judging by the trends of today it appears that despite (or more to the point perhaps because of) its mighty military pres- ence in the Middle East, America\u2019s influence in the region is declining. America has withdrawn from Saudi Arabia, following its invasion of Iraq its image in the region is now at an all-time low and, with the exception of Israel, it has become politically suicidal for any Middle Eastern leader to side openly with the US. Anti- Americanism is also rising in Latin America, and especially in Hugo Chavez\u2019s Venezuela, which remains one of the US\u2019s main oil suppliers. 91 Marcin Zaborowski 22.

        "6 In both the Middle East and Latin America, China\u2019s influence is growing, backed by its policy of investment that carries no polit- ical conditions. Beijing has also increased its diplomatic activity in the Middle East as demonstrated by its appointment of a special envoy for the area, Ambassador Wang Shijie, and a series of high- level state visits. For example, the visit of President Hu Jintao to Egypt and Algeria, in February 2004, led to the establishment of the Sino-Arab Cooperation Forum with the overt purpose of pro- moting energy links between China and the Arab states. 26 Follow- ing the visit of six finance ministers of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) to Beijing in 2004, China has entered into negotia- tions on the establishment of a free trade area with these states. 27 China\u2019s potentially most promising energy relationship is with Iran. Shortly after Bush\u2019s re-election in autumn 2004, China\u2019s For- eign Minister Li Zhaoxing flew to Tehran where he concluded an oil and gas deal between the state-owned Sinopec and Iranian oil ministry. The deal could be worth as much as US$100 billion over the next thirty years and according to some US commentators it is the primary reason why Beijing opposes UN sanctions against Iran in response to its nuclear programme. 28 But China\u2019s oil diplomacy goes well beyond the Middle East and Iran and it now includes Africa (from where over 30 % of China\u2019s oil comes), 29 Russia, Central Asia and Latin America. The US is especially nervous about the latter and most of all about Bei- jing\u2019s increasingly cosy relationship with defiantly anti-US Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez who was lavishly hosted by the Chinese on his 4-day trip to the country in December 2004. Most recently, America\u2019s concern about China\u2019s expansion into energy markets has hit closer to home \u2013 in the US itself. In June 2005 China National Offshore Oil Company (CNOOC) bid for the acquisition of Unocal, a middle-size American oil company based in California. CNOOC offered US$18.5 billion (the highest offer in the bid) and, in order to appease the growing political opposition to the deal, it made a commitment not to sell Unocal- controlled oil and gas resources based in the US to China. 30 The deal became highly publicised in the US, encountering stiff oppo- sition from members of the Congress and especially from the US- China Economic and Security Review Commission (USCC). The critics pointed out that CNOOC remained a state-controlled com- pany (70%) and that its offer was heavily subsidised by the Chinese state. It was also argued that while China embarked on taking over 92 US-China relations: running on two tracks 26. \u2018Sino-Arab cooperation fo- rum focuses on energy\u2019, People\u2019s Daily Online , 14 April 2005. 27.

        "6 a strategic sector US company, its own energy market remained closed to significant foreign investment and controlled by the state. 31 Whilst some of these arguments have been driven by prag- matic considerations, there is no doubt that the chief argument against CNOOC\u2019s acquisition of Unocal was political, with \u2018national security\u2019 rhetoric being brought to the forefront of the debate. In this intensely politicised atmosphere the Chinese decided to pull out from the bid. As a result the CNOOC incident, together with the more recent Dubai port deal, became clear evi- dence of politically motivated protectionism in America. There is no doubt that the energy aspect of the Sino-American relationship is a difficult one. However, it is an exaggeration to see it as destined to lead to conflict. The fact that both the US and China are increasingly dependent on external energy sources does not necessary imply that they have to compete against each other or that they have to see each other as threats. 32 For example, until recently it was not China but Japan who was the world\u2019s second energy consumer and Japan still remains the world\u2019s second importer of oil. Yet there has never been a serious debate in the US about Japan being a threat to US energy interests. This suggests that the energy relationship between the US and other countries is influenced primarily by political considerations and Washington\u2019s perception of whether a given country is an ally or not. America is not sure about China in this respect; hence this energy relationship tends to be ambivalent. On the one hand, there are the tensions as previously outlined; on the other hand the two countries are engaged in an energy dialogue that may lead to a more co-ordinated approach. For example, in May 2004 the US and China signed the Memorandum of Understanding regard- ing energy policy dialogue and energy issues were amongst the main topics of discussion at the Sino-US high-level Strategic Dia- logue in August 2005. 33 Arguably, as major energy importers, both countries have a joint interest in keeping energy prices down. They both share a common concern about the safety of transport routes, with China effectively relying on American protection in the Malacca Strait, through which most of its imported oil is shipped. Finally, global energy security is dependent on the stabil- ity and predictability of the international system \u2013 China\u2019s and America\u2019s views on global governance may differ but their inter- ests coincide in seeking to prevent a major energy crisis that would hurt their consumers. 93 Marcin Zaborowski 31. \u2018Statement of Hon.

        "6 Economic and trade relations US-China economic relations have expanded vastly since the estab- lishment of official contacts in 1979. Total US-China trade rose from US$5 billion in 1980 to US$285 billion in 2005. Whilst the EU has recently become China\u2019s main trading partner (overtaking the US) the US remains its biggest export market. For the US, China is now its third trading partner, its second largest source of imports and its fourth largest export market. There is no doubt that US- China economic relations are extremely dynamic and increasingly interdependent. However, the commercial ties between the two countries have also been strained by a number of disputes of which the most important have revolved around the US trade deficit, China\u2019s currency policy and its poor record in protecting intellec- tual property rights (IPR). 34 The US\u2019s trade with China has recorded a rapidly growing deficit since the late 1980s, reaching close to US$202 billion in 2005. Last year the US imported goods from China worth US$243.5 billion (whilst its exports were worth only US$41.8 bil- lion), which accounted for 14.5% of total US imports. The impor- tance of China as a source of US imports has grown from eighth- ranking in 1990 to second in 2005. Moreover, whilst in the past the US was mostly importing labour-intensive and unsophisticated products (toys, games, clothing), the proportion of technologi- cally-sophisticated products (such as computers) has steadily risen in recent years. 35 The ever-expanding deficit has increasingly alarmed the Administration and especially the US Congress. The Congress has responded with legislation aimed at pressuring China to open up its market to US products and change its mone- tary policy (i.e., by appreciating the yuan), which is seen in the US as the major source of the deficit. The Chinese currency, the yuan, was pegged at 8.28 to the US dollar between 1994 and 2005. In order to maintain this level of exchange, the Chinese government intervened in the interna- tional market and imposed restrictions and controls over the movement of capital in China. American policymakers and busi- ness leaders argued that the Yuan was undervalued vis-\u00e0-vis the dol- lar by 15-40% and that the policy was hurting US producers espe- cially in the manufacturing sector. Members of the Congress have called on the Administration to pressurise China to appreciate its currency or to float it freely on the international market. 94 US-China relations: running on two tracks 34. For a detailed US perspective on these questions, see Wayne M. Morrison, \u2018China-US Trade Issues\u2019, CRS Brief for Congress , 21 March 2006. 35.

        "6 Beijing has been reluctant to respond to these pressures, argu- ing that its currency policy was not designed to promote exports but to maintain economic stability at the time of major structural reforms. 36 However, in July 2005 China announced a change in its policy \u2013 an immediate appreciation of the yuan vis-\u00e0-vis the US dol- lar by 2.1% and moving towards an adjustable exchange rate based on movements within the basket of designated currencies (US dol- lar, the Japanese yen, the euro and the South Korean won). Still, this change has been seen in the US as insufficient and pressure and calls (including the threat of a Senate bill introducing a 27% tariff on Chinese products) for a more thorough reform have con- tinued. 37 The other major economic dispute concerns violations of US intellectual property rights (IPR) in China. According to American sources, counterfeiting of US products takes place on a massive scale in China, depriving US producers of licence fees. For exam- ple, it is estimated that counterfeits constitute between 15-20% of all products made in China and account for about 8% of its GDP. Industry analysts estimate that IPR piracy cost US copyright firms $2.3 billion in lost sales in 2005. The piracy rate for IPR-related products, such as films, music and software, is over 90%. According to the terms of its WTO accession (November 2001), China was obliged to bring its IPR laws into compliance with the organisation\u2019s standards. China has subsequently passed relevant legislation and the United States Trade Representative (USTR) has stated on a number of occasions that China has indeed made much progress in creating a legal framework to deal with piracy. 38 However, whilst in terms of anti-piracy legislation China may be close to international standards, its enforcement record is still rather lax. In the rare instances when IPR-offenders are caught they are subjected to mild penalties. Widespread corruption is also a factor here, with some governmental agencies being \u2018encour- aged\u2019 to be less vigilant in pursuing piracy. This economic relationship is certainly a difficult one with the issues of trade deficit, piracy and Chinese acquisition of American companies becoming an integral part of the \u2018China-threat\u2019 dis- course in the US. However, US-China economic relations are also increasingly close and interdependent. For example, while the trade between the two countries is massively unequal it is also true that China effectively finances a considerable share of America\u2019s 95 Marcin Zaborowski 36.

Some US analysts worry that should the Congress be successful in pushing China to appreciate its currency this would have a negative effect on the level of China\u2019s purchasing of the US bonds, which could result in higher interest rates, possibly leading to the slowdown of the US economy. In other words, the Chinese need the Americans to keep buying their products but the Americans need the Chinese to keep buying their bonds. Whilst China and the US are bound to disagree on some eco- nomic issues they do have much more in common than may be apparent from focusing on trade deficit or IPR. Most importantly, they both embrace globalisation and both share a belief in the value of the market economy. The US played a crucial role in bring- ing China out of its self-isolation and facilitating its gradual open- ing up to the global market. American economic success has served as an inspiration for Chinese leaders, especially for Deng Xiaoping. While it is natural that the US views China\u2019s galloping economy with some apprehension, in many respects the US is also responsible for China\u2019s economic success. Policy approaches Ambivalence is apparent in all major spheres of Sino-American interaction. It is therefore natural that ambivalence also occupies a central place in the official policies of Washington and Beijing regarding each other. In its official pronouncements the US always embraces the rise of China and although some American policy- makers may have qualms about China\u2019s success they do realise that this is an unstoppable process. Hence, the guiding American objec- tive with regard to Beijing is not to stop but to influence the rise of China in a way that would be conducive to US interests. For China, the top objective is first and foremost its self-enrichment but also, and increasingly so, America\u2019s acceptance of its privileged role in the Asia-Pacific. 96 US-China relations: running on two tracks cp94.qxp 09/01/2007 16:56 Page 96 ",
        "6 The view from the US Whilst the guiding principle of America\u2019s China policy is clear, this is not to say that there exists a domestic consensus on how to han- dle relations with Beijing in the US. In fact, hardly any other subject divides Washington\u2019s foreign policy community as much as Sino- American relations. There is certainly a very strong lobby of China bashers in the US, especially in the Congress where a peculiar coali- tion of right and left wing interests meet in demanding that the Administration takes a tougher stance towards Beijing. This coali- tion includes foreign policy conservatives, evangelical Christians, economic protectionists and human rights activists; and as such it covers a very broad spectrum of opinion in the Congress and it cuts across the parties. On the other hand, there exists an influential group of \u2018China-optimists\u2019, which consists of the realist branch of foreign policy experts and business leaders, who argue that the US has benefited from engaging China and that it should continue to do so. Both these bodies of opinion have at times been successful in influencing Washington\u2019s China policy. For example, it was apparent that China-optimists, especially business interests, had a hand in promoting America\u2019s endorsement of China\u2019s WTO membership and the ending of the sanctions following the mas- sacre at Tiananmen Square in 1989. On the other hand, the China- sceptical Congress amended the Taiwan Relations Act of 1979 by including comprehensive arms sales provisions in it. The pres- sures from the Congress have also forced the Administration to adopt a tougher position in the negotiations on China\u2019s WTO membership. Finally, the Congress set up the US-China Economic and Security Committee (known among other things for its role in opposing the sale of Unocal to the Chinese CNOOC) and it requires governmental agencies to report on Beijing policies, e.g. such as the Pentagon\u2019s annual reports on the PLA\u2019s modernisa- tion. However, despite the existence of these powerful and conflict- ing pressures in Washington, America\u2019s China policy has been marked by a remarkable consistency. There is a certain irony in the fact that a number of American presidents came into office declar- ing a major shift in their policy towards Beijing but then settled on the continuation of the policies of their predecessors.

        "6 ple, Ronald Reagan argued against Carter\u2019s policy of opening up to China and in favour of \u2018restoring\u2019 America\u2019s relations with Tai- wan. Subsequently he did neither of these but instead agreed the famous joint communiqu\u00e9 with Beijing in which the US commit- ted itself to lowering its arms sales to Taiwan \u2013 a provision that Reagan (unlike some of his successors) actually respected. Bill Clinton criticised President George H.W. Bush (the father of the present President) for his allegedly tame response to Beijing\u2019s crushing of the pro-democracy protests in 1989. However, it was under the Clinton presidency that the US removed almost all sanc- tions against China imposed in response to the Tiananmen inci- dent. Finally, the current President Bush came to office announc- ing a major overhaul of China policy, which, according to him, should be based on treating Beijing as a \u2018strategic competitor\u2019 and strengthening America\u2019s ties with regional allies, especially Japan and Taiwan. Yet, following 9/11 China came to be seen in the White House as a useful ally in the \u2018war on terror\u2019 and a much- needed influence on North Korea. This record demonstrates that whatever the intentions and political loyalties of presidential candidates, the reality is that America needs a co-operative China. Hence it is in the US\u2019s interest to continue engage Beijing. On the other hand, no American Presi- dent can ignore the fact that China is emerging as the major com- petitor for its primacy in East Asia Pacific, that the Chinese armed forces are rapidly modernising and that Beijing may sometimes undermine America\u2019s efforts at curbing nuclear proliferation. Hence, Washington believes that it cannot afford to lower its guard, it must remain vigilant towards China and be prepared for all sce- narios \u2013 including military confrontation in the Taiwanese Strait. This combination of engagement and vigilance (referred to also as dual-tracking) is reflected in all main US strategic docu- ments of recent years. For example, the 2006 National Security Strategy says: \u2018Our strategy seeks to encourage China to make the right strategic choices for its people, while we hedge against other possibilities\u2019. 39 The Quadrennial Defense Review explicitly identi- fies China as the power with \u2018greatest potential to compete mili- tarily with the United States\u2019 and argues that the US should adopt a \u2018balanced approach, one that seeks cooperation but also creates prudent hedges against the possibility that cooperative approaches by themselves may fail to preclude future conflict\u2019. 40 Whilst pursuing this dual-track approach Washington\u2019s mes- 98 US-China relations: running on two tracks 39.

        "6 sage to China might be summed up as follows: you are becoming a great power, you deserve a special place in the world system \u2013 it is time for you to act as a responsible stakeholder . In other words, Wash- ington is saying that it is prepared to acknowledge and endorse China\u2019s growing international status in exchange for Beijing\u2019s co- operation on key global issues, such as energy, nuclear prolifera- tion and dealing with rogue states, especially North Korea, Sudan and Iran. Being a responsible stakeholder also means in Washington\u2019s eyes that China should be moving towards democracy and the rule of law (including dealing with IPR piracy) and that its economic policy should avoid protectionism. 41 The view from China Unlike the US, China\u2019s official foreign policy priorities are not global and remain rather modest. The only significant exception is China\u2019s attempt to serve as a champion of the developing coun- tries. But even here it is clear that Beijing\u2019s position is driven by its economic considerations and especially its energy interests. 42 Oth- erwise, China\u2019s strategic priorities are overtly domestic or regional. The Chinese leaders continue to stress the primacy of internal developments whilst keeping a \u2018low profile\u2019 in interna- tional affairs. 43 However, China\u2019s definition of its \u2018internal developments\u2019 stretches to its periphery, routinely including Taiwan. In addition, Beijing\u2019s stated intent to keep \u2018a low profile\u2019 in international affairs does not concern its neighbourhood and especially it does not apply to East Asia-Pacific and Central Asia where China sys- tematically expands its influence. What China wants from the US is that it should recognise China\u2019s \u2018special interests\u2019 in the region and make room for Beijing in its pursuit of national interests there. The Chinese argue that this is a fair expectation \u2013 after all, regional security issues in the Asia-Pacific concern China much more directly than the US. Chinese scholars even tend to refer to the Asia-Pacific as \u2018China\u2019s periphery\u2019 and argue that any turn of events there has a major bearing on \u2018China\u2019s core interests\u2019 includ- ing its \u2018goal of building a well-off society\u2019. 44 In this context, the Chinese tend to see America\u2019s activity in the region as an interference in its own sphere of influence. Beijing remains particularly concerned about what it calls a \u2018 de facto US- Japan-Taiwan military alliance\u2019 but also about the so-called 99 Marcin Zaborowski 41. The \u2018responsible stakeholder\u2019 notion was first introduced by Robert B. Zoellick, Deputy Secre- tary of State, in his address \u2018Whither China: From Member- ship to Responsibility?\u2019, given to the National Committee on US- China Relations on 21 September 2005. The notion was subse- quently repeated in the 2006 Na- tional Security Strategy and The Quadrennial Defense Review Re- port. 42.

Beijing\u2019s response to America\u2019s presence and its alleged increased activity in Asia has not been much different from Wash- ington\u2019s own approach towards China and it boils down to com- bining cooperation with hedging. Whilst China continues to see the US as its most important partner in the developed world and, as argued here, there is a whole range of global issues on which the two countries see eye to eye, China has also taken a number to steps to hedge against America\u2019s influence in the region. Perhaps most noticeable among them was the setting up in 2001 of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation, which includes a security dimension and has called for the withdrawal of US troops from Central Asia. China has also strengthened co-operation with Rus- sia and the two have conducted military exercises, which included a Taiwanese scenario. Finally, Beijing has initiated the Asian multilateral security cooperation, which conspicuously excluded the US. (cid:82) (cid:82) (cid:82) The key factors underlining both the American and Chinese policies towards each other are complexity, intensity and mutual suspicion. Despite its intense and increasingly interdependent relationship with Beijing, America is finding it hard to grapple with the phenomenon of China\u2019s rise. The crucial issue for Wash- ington is how to ensure that this emerging superpower will be on the same side of the fence as the US. The answer so far has been to offer China a larger say in global affairs at the price of its evolution into a responsible stakeholder . But the Chinese do not really want a larger stake in a system that, as they argue, remains dominated by the US. 46 What the Chinese want is for the US to leave them alone to pursue their policy objectives in the Asia Pacific as Beijing con- siders fit. This, however, Washington is not prepared to do. As long as this strategic incongruence continues, the Sino-American rela- tionship will run on two tracks. Although these are unlikely to be heading towards a collision course, such a scenario can of course never be definitively ruled out. 100 US-China relations: running on two tracks 45. Ibid, p. 15. 46.

        "The EU-China strategic partnership: rhetoric versus reality Axel Berkofsky Introduction The parameters of the EU-China relationship are now officially based on implementing their so-called \u2018strategic partnership\u2019. But is it true to say that the EU\u2019s China strategy is \u2018na\u00efve\u2019 or \u2018unrealistic\u2019 in this regard, as some European as well as American academics and analysts have argued over the last three years? 1 The democratic EU, these critics argue, differs too much from non-democratic and autocratic China in its approaches towards the conduct of foreign and security policies, global governance and international secu- rity. The EU Commission and the EU Council, on the other hand, maintain that engaging China politically and economically is still the wisest if not indeed the only possible course of action, as China is now a global economic, political and military force to be reck- oned with, and is likely to become even more powerful in the future. Arguably, three years after the EU announced its \u2018strategic part- nership\u2019 with China, there is still a lack of understanding on the goals and objectives of the envisioned partnership, beyond the expansion of bilateral business and trade relations. What are the EU\u2019s objectives in implementing the \u2018strategic partnership\u2019 and to what extent is Brussels willing to compromise its own values and foreign and security policy principles for the sake of expanding relations on all levels with a country whose human rights record is still questionable at best? What, on the other hand, does Beijing for its part expect from its \u2018strategic part- ners\u2019 in Brussels, how in Beijing\u2019s view does engagement with the EU impact on China\u2019s economic and social development and, last but not least, how seriously does Beijing take the EU as global for- eign and security policy actor and partner? 2 In this author\u2019s view, in order to make real and measurable progress implementing the envisaged EU-China \u2018strategic part- nership\u2019, Brussels and Beijing now need to focus on and tackle the 103 Facing China\u2019s rise: Guidelines for an EU strategy 1.

        "7 day-to-day economic and political problems which over the last year have been hitting the headlines on a regular basis: the growing bilateral trade deficit in China\u2019s favour, European concerns about China\u2019s human rights record, China\u2019s failure to implement and enforce effective and transparent intellectual property rights leg- islation, as well as Chinese concerns about what Beijing refers to as growing European \u2018economic protectionism.\u2019 3 EU-China efforts to pursue and jointly implement so-called \u2018effective multilateral- ism\u2019 and co-operation on non-proliferation issues should be sec- ondary in the context of EU-China relations, not least because EU and Chinese approaches differ fundamentally, as will be shown in what follows. Three years after announcing the EU-China \u2018strate- gic partnership\u2019, it has become clear that political rhetoric on the scope and nature of EU-China relations has yet to catch up with political reality. Is the honeymoon over? In December 2006 three years will have passed since the EU called for the implementation of an EU-China \u2018strategic partnership\u2019 in its European Security Strategy (ESS). 4 Already in September 2003 the EU Council adopted the EU Commission\u2019s paper on EU- China relations, entitled \u2018A maturing partnership: shared inter- ests and challenges in EU-China relations\u2019, in which the EU referred to China as the EU\u2019s \u2018strategic partner\u2019. 5 Many EU-China conferences, workshops and seminars with direct or indirect EU Commission participation and/or sponsoring have taken place since then. Three years later, however, the EU goals of the envi- sioned \u2018strategic partnership\u2019 still remain vague and Brussels finds itself charged with the task of explaining to the outside world what exactly the strategic dimension of relations with China involves. While countries like China\u2019s arch-rival, Japan, and above all the US, fear that the term \u2018strategic\u2019 in the context of EU-China rela- tions implies that Brussels and Beijing are envisioning the expan- sion of strategic and geo-strategic relations aimed at reducing US global military influence and power, Brussels itself has repeatedly pointed out that \u2018strategic\u2019 is to be understood as \u2018comprehensive\u2019 in the context of EU-Chinese bilateral relations, excluding the 104 The EU-China partnership: rhetoric versus reality 3.

        "7 notion of a partnership aimed at counterbalancing US regional and global influence. 6 \u2018Strategic partnership\u2019, however, must have sounded more impressive than \u2018comprehensive partnership\u2019 to EU policy-makers and their counterparts in Beijing at the time, even if it very quickly turned out that announcing a \u2018strategic partnership\u2019 created expectations in Beijing which the EU was neither able nor willing to meet. This became particularly obvious during the controversy over the lifting or non-lifting of the EU arms embargo imposed on China in 1989. Back then Brussels had to find out the hard way that (at times high-sounding) political rhetoric does not always match political reality. The good news is that the expansion of EU-China bilateral eco- nomic, trade and political relations over the last three years has without doubt been very impressive and both sides will continue to invest significant political and diplomatic capital and resources in the expansion of bilateral relations. 7 To date, the EU and China are engaged in roughly 25 \u2018sectoral dialogues\u2019 covering a wide range of areas such as intellectual property rights, environment, the information society, energy & scientific co-operation, the peaceful use of nuclear energy, maritime safety, space co-opera- tion, WTO issues and others. The dialogues take place at various levels, from working to ministerial level and increasingly involve business representatives from both Europe and China. 8 Currently, however, EU policy-makers (like their colleagues in the US) are under pressure to adjust or even re-define trade and business relations with this country whose economy is growing at a rate of 10% per year, thereby creating ever-growing bilateral trade deficits. While EU-China bilateral trade is expected to exceed \u20ac 200 billion this year, the trade deficit in China\u2019s favour is expected to amount to up to \u20ac 100 billion this year (as compared to \u20ac 75 billion last year). Judging by the issues that have dominated the headlines lat- terly in the European press, the three-year honeymoon in EU- China relations might indeed be over in view of the fact that ongo- ing bilateral trade friction and European complaints about the growing trade deficit in China\u2019s favour continue to make it to the top of the agenda of EU-China summits and other official encounters. 105 Axel Berkofsky 6. Especially during the contro- versy over the EU weapons em- bargo throughout 2004 and 2005, the US was concerned that the next step of the implementa- tion of the envisioned EU-China \u2018strategic partnership\u2019 would be the lifting of the EU embargo. The lifting of the embargo followed by increased EU weapons and weapons technology exports to China, it was feared in Washing- ton, would threaten Washing- ton\u2019s security interests in Asia. 7.

        "7 EU-China trade friction, intellectual property rights and economic protectionism: whose court is the ball in? Chinese government subsidies (regarded as excessive and illegal by the EU) for the Chinese textile and shoe manufacturing sectors have over the last year exacerbated ongoing EU-China trade fric- tion and a long-term solution (as opposed to short-lived bilateral agreements like last year\u2019s agreement on the voluntary reduction of Chinese textile exports) has yet to be found and implemented. Looking at the growing trade deficit, however, it is necessary to point out that the ball, to put it bluntly, is only partly \u2018in China\u2019s court\u2019, as Chinese manufacturers and exporters essentially only export goods to Europe that European importers are willing to buy. Not surprisingly, China accuses the EU of \u2018economic protec- tionism\u2019, maintaining that Brussels is violating the rules of free trade to protect European business from Chinese competition by threatening to impose new tariffs on Chinese shoe and textile imports. Furthermore \u2013 and this usually gets limited coverage and attention in the press \u2013 it is not Chinese manufacturers and exporters, but rather European and US importers buying Chinese goods and products, who take the lion\u2019s share of profits by taking advantage of cheap Chinese labour costs. That is especially the case in the textile and shoe manufacturing sectors where Euro- pean consumers take advantage of cheap \u2018sweat shop-manufac- tured\u2019 sneakers and T-shirts. 9 However \u2013 and here the ball is indeed very much in China\u2019s court \u2013 Beijing will have to address the issue of what Brussels refers to as excessive (or illegal, if one applies WTO regulations) govern- ment subsidies for Chinese shoe and textile producers, unless of course Beijing\u2019s authorities are prepared to be faced with addi- tional duty and tariffs and shiploads of Chinese-made bras and T- shirts waiting in vain to be cleared for months in Hamburg, Antwerp and Rotterdam. Also of concern to European business \u2013 and, increasingly, to Brussels policy-makers \u2013 is Beijing\u2019s growing involvement in China\u2019s emerging private business sector (an involvement in China until recently limited to the so-called state-owned enter- prises). In view of the central government\u2019s counterproductive interference in China\u2019s private sector, EU policy-makers will be urged by European business to make sure that this interference will be kept to a minimum. Furthermore, the government\u2019s inter- 106 The EU-China partnership: rhetoric versus reality 9.

        "7 ference in China\u2019s emerging private business sector certainly does not help China\u2019s quest to be acknowledged as a market economy. China has over the last three years unsuccessfully tried to convince the EU that Beijing deserves to be granted the requested market economy status (MES). Intellectual property rights (IPR) will also remain on top of the EU-China agenda for years to come. China has throughout 2005 and 2006 failed to implement the transparent intellectual prop- erty rights legislation protecting European intellectual property in China. Typically in the past, Beijing requested more time, argu- ing that the geographical size of the country and the boom of pri- vate business start-ups make it very difficult if not impossible to effectively implement standardised intellectual property legisla- tion in China. The EU for its part will continue to pressurise the Beijing authorities to enforce WTO-compatible intellectual prop- erty rights and regulations, pointing to the fact that roughly 60% of counterfeit goods being sold in Europe originate from China. 10 Spoiling the party? Human rights, cross-strait tensions and the weapons embargo Well-researched regular reports by Human Rights Watch, Amnesty International 11 and other NGOs confirm that China\u2019s human rights record is still far from satisfactory, to say the least. Also of concern is the continuing imprisonment of journalists, human rights activists and lawyers critical of the government and Bei- jing\u2019s ill-fated efforts to strengthen control over Chinese Internet users and websites. 12 Currently 50,000 \u2018Internet policemen\u2019 are monitoring Chinese websites and bloggers although the govern- ment\u2019s ability to \u2018censure\u2019 the Internet does not appear sustainable in view of the rapidly growing number of Internet users in China. The progress of the EU-China human rights dialogue (21 ses- sions have taken place to date) 13 must be described as very limited as Beijing has up now not been able (or willing) to provide the EU with the requested \u2018verifiable evidence\u2019 on the improvement on its human rights record. Linked to the human rights issue are EU requests (presented sometimes with more, sometimes with less, insistence in Brussels) for the release of Chinese demonstrators imprisoned after having peacefully demonstrated for democracy and freedom of speech on Tiananmen Square in June 1989. So far, and 16 years after violently clamping down on the demonstra- tions, however, Beijing is unwilling to meet this EU request, 107 Axel Berkofsky 10.

        "7 unconvincingly claiming that the imprisoned demonstrators are a \u2018threat to China\u2019s national security.\u2019 To be sure, discussing human rights with Beijing still has the potential to spoil EU-China rela- tions, although one would expect that \u2018strategic partners\u2019 should not shy away from discussing sensitive issues to improve what both the EU and China refer to as \u2018mutual understanding.\u2019 Arguably, the same should be valid for EU-Chinese interaction in the context of cross-strait relations and tension around the so- called \u2018Taiwan question.\u2019 While EU statements and official docu- ments typically do not fail to criticise Taiwanese political rhetoric on cross-strait relations as \u2018unhelpful\u2019, 14 the deployment of a steadily increasing number of Chinese missiles directed at Tai- wanese territory usually does not get mentioned, at least not on the record. The EU\u2019s position on cross-strait tension is indeed less than outspoken, which is odd in view of European business inter- ests in Taiwan and significant bilateral trade relations. After all, Taiwan is the EU\u2019s fourth-largest trading partner in Asia, and one might expect Brussels to be more concerned with peace and stabil- ity in the Taiwan Strait in view of its significant economic interests in Taiwan. The EU, like the vast majority of countries, follows the so-called \u2018One-China principle\u2019 recognising the central government in Bei- jing as the sole legitimate representative of the Chinese people. However, it is arguable whether the \u2018One-China principle\u2019 should keep the EU from having a clear-cut and more outspoken position on cross-strait issues. The US approach towards Taiwan and its cross-strait policies prove that this does not necessarily have to be the case, although the strong US military presence in the region (in total roughly 100,000 troops, mainly in Japan and South Korea) without a doubt adds to the \u2018credibility\u2019 of US interests and concerns in the Taiwan Strait. Unlike the EU, the US has defence commitments in the region and maintains close defence alliances with Japan and South Korea that go back for decades. In view of the EU\u2019s less than outspoken position on cross-strait relations, Beijing does not have to be concerned about EU \u2018inter- ference\u2019 in cross-strait tensions and Brussels\u2019 timidity on this issue confirms the view of policy-makers in Beijing that the EU does not yet need to be taken seriously as a foreign and security policy actor with the influence and capabilities to threaten Chinese regional security interests. 15 Even if this reasoning is not part of the official exchange between Brussels and Beijing, it is nevertheless consid- 108 The EU-China partnership: rhetoric versus reality 14.

Numerous conversations with Chinese academics and officials over the last three years have con- firmed that China\u2019s military and defence establishment considers the EU position on cross-strait re- lations as proof that Brussels is still a \u2018weak\u2019 foreign and security policy actor. cp94.qxp 09/01/2007 16:56 Page 108 ",

Then again, armed conflict between China and Taiwan \u2013 despite the occasional cross-strait sabre-rattling \u2013 is very unlikely as both China and Taiwan are essentially interested in maintain- ing the current status quo and expanding bilateral trade relations (which amounted to more than $100 billion in 2005). 16 In fact, the absence of an immediate danger of armed conflict between Beijing and Taipei might indeed be the reason why Brussels has decided to keep a low profile on cross-strait issues even if it is debatable whether this is an appropriate position for the EU given its declared ambition to be a global foreign and security policy player. Beijing does not perceive the EU as a \u2018strategic competitor\u2019 in Asia (and beyond) as Brussels has limited strategic interests in the region and (unlike the US) does not have military troops stationed in Asia. This \u2013 together with the perception that Brussels is not seeking to expand its global military profile beyond the current level\u2013 might indeed be one of the reasons why China has agreed to a \u2018strategic partnership\u2019 with Brussels in the first place. Accord- ingly, as Alyson Bailes points out, Asian regional security issues hardly make it onto the EU-China bilateral agenda 17 and EU sources confirm that the newly-established EU-China dialogue on strategic issues has yet to do more than \u2018scratch the surface\u2019 of Asian security issues. While in 2005 the EU announced in official statements \u2018 to promise to work towards the lifting of the embargo,\u2019 China \u2018chose\u2019 to understand that the EU had effectively promised to lift the embargo, conveniently ignoring the exact nuances of the termi- nology used by Brussels. 18 Furthermore, the Chinese reasoning on the weapons embargo is based on the (as it turns out faulty) assumption that the lifting of the embargo is a \u2018one-way street\u2019: Brussels lifts the embargo and \u2018in return\u2019 Beijing agrees to expand its relations with the EU on all levels, offering European business favourable treatment when investing and doing business in and with China. In reality, however, the EU expected (and still does, even if the EU Commission usually points out that progress on human rights and the ratification of the UN Convention of Political and 109 Axel Berkofsky 16.

Beijing\u2019s insistence on having the weapons embargo lifted as soon as the ink on the EU\u2019s September 2003 China paper was dry, has delivered the \u2018proof\u2019 to a number of US academics and analysts (admittedly, many of them working for the US Administration or for right-leaning think tanks close to the Administration) 19 that the necessary pre-conditions for a EU-China strategic partnership (whatever form this might take) are not yet in place (and, in their opinion, never will be). With the weapons embargo question as well as human rights issues in China unresolved, the argument went (and still goes) that China will continue trying to \u2018hold the EU hostage\u2019, demanding that Brussels change or indeed give up some of it its foreign and security policy principles in order to implement the \u2018strategic partnership\u2019 with Beijing. Beijing of course dismisses all of this and maintains that it nei- ther needs EU weapons nor weapons technology and instead argues (admittedly not without logic) that lifting the embargo is to be understood as a signal that the EU is accepting and acknowl- edging China as an equal partner on the international stage. One of the results of the weapons embargo controversy \u2013 without a doubt unintended and undesirable from a Chinese viewpoint \u2013 was the establishment of an EU-US (2004) and an EU-Japan (2005) dialogue on East Asian security issues. At the time, Beijing regarded the establishment of an EU-US strategic dialogue on East Asia security as nothing less than an US attempt to pressurise the EU not to lift the embargo, and it was feared in Chinese policymaking circles that Brussels agreeing to consult with the US on East Asian security issues meant that the EU had already agreed to postpone the lifting of the embargo indefinitely. 20 Indeed, the embargo issue was high on the agenda of this dialogue between Brussels and Washington and there is lit- tle doubt that Washington made full use of the exchange to urge Brussels to leave the embargo in place. In fact, it is fair to assume that it is very unlikely that the US would have dedicated resources and energy discussing Asian security issues with Brussels without the embargo issue dominating the EU-China agenda in 2004 and 110 The EU-China partnership: rhetoric versus reality 19. Written analysis on China and US-China relations in US think tanks with (very) close links to the US administration, such as the Heritage Foundation or the Amer- ican Enterprise Institute, more of- ten than not lacked academic depth and credibility and the as- sessments on China and its for- eign and trade policies were often faulty, ill-researched and prone to analytical and factual errors. This was especially the case for the arti- cles on the EU weapons embargo. 20.

        "7 2005. Before the embargo issue began to dominate the headlines, the US was only to a very limited extent (if at all) interested in dis- cussing Asian security issues with the EU, including the nuclear crisis on the Korean Peninsula. 21 Either way, Beijing will continue to urge the EU to lift the weapons embargo as China (government officials and academics alike) will continue to argue that the weapons embargo leaves the implementation of the envisioned \u2018strategic partnership\u2019 incom- plete. The EU and China: really partners on the international stage? According to the official rhetoric, the EU and China share common approaches towards global governance and international co-oper- ation favouring and pursuing \u2018effective multilateralism\u2019. 22 This sounds non-controversial and is to be welcomed in principle, but EU and Beijing\u2019s policy-makers have yet to go into detail explaining where and how China and the EU plan to pursue joint actions implementing so-called \u2018effective multilateralism.\u2019 The term \u2018effec- tive multilateralism\u2019 became \u2018fashionable\u2019 after the US-led unilat- eral invasion of Iraq and was used to express the global commu- nity\u2019s determination to make unilateral decisions to invade other countries, thereby violating international law, a thing of the past. The EU and China also made \u2018effective multilateralism\u2019 part of their bilaterally shared terminology and Brussels and Beijing have continually repeated in official declarations and statements that \u2018effective multilateralism\u2019 is what the EU and China will (individu- ally or jointly) implement. Where and how exactly the EU and China are planning to jointly implement multilateral policies, however, remains largely unclear and undefined. Besides \u2013 and probably more importantly \u2013 it is questionable whether Brussels and Beijing really share common approaches towards multilateralism or \u2018effective multilateralism.\u2019 Whereas the EU as an institution itself is a product of a multilateral approach towards international relations, expressing the political will to share and indeed give up sovereignty, there is doubt as to whether the EU and China embrace similar concepts of multilat- eralism. Instead, China, as its regional foreign and security poli- cies in Asia as well as its headline-making energy security policies 111 Axel Berkofsky 21. For example, even though the EU was involved in the first KEDO Agreement in 1997, the US never encouraged the EU to participate in the so-called 6-nation talks in Beijing. 22.

        "7 in Africa, Central Asia and South America show, typically favours bilateral over multilateral solutions and agreements and only turns to multilateralism when \u2018necessary\u2019. 23 The same applies to China\u2019s regional foreign and security policies in Asia, and Chinese political rhetoric over recent years has often given the impression to the outside world that \u2018multilateralism\u2019 and \u2018multipolarity\u2019 are being used as quasi-synonyms meaning one and the same thing in Beijing\u2019s view of the world. 24 Whether Chinese policy-makers using and confusing the two terms in the same context is intentional remains a matter of spec- ulation, but there is little doubt that China\u2019s vision of the world embraces a concept of \u2018multipolarity\u2019 on which it has put its own stamp, with Beijing as one of the \u2018poles\u2019 of global power and influ- ence. In Brussels, on the other hand, \u2018multipolarity\u2019 and \u2018multilat- eralism\u2019 are not usually mentioned in the same context and it is the latter principle that the EU advocates. What does China want? China is an emerging economic, political and military power in need of international recognition. Whereas the US \u2013 at least the current Administration and those in charge of US policies towards Asia and China \u2013 perceive China\u2019s rapid economic rise as a potential threat to US global influence, the EU has repeatedly declared that China\u2019s rise is an \u2018opportunity\u2019 for Europe and the rest of the world. Beijing naturally appreciates such an assessment of its economic and social development, as it chimes with its own rhetoric of \u2018China\u2019s peaceful rise\u2019, indicating that its rapid economic growth will not (as realist scholars in the US and elsewhere argue) turn China into an aggressive military superpower with ambitions for regional and global dominance. Officially, the engagement stance of the EU dismisses the notion that China\u2019s economic and military rise is to be perceived as \u2018threatening.\u2019 China is an \u2018opportunity\u2019, not a \u2018threat\u2019, accord- ing to the official rhetoric in Brussels. 25 However, there is without any doubt concern in European circles about China\u2019s rapid eco- nomic development and its growing political and military influ- ence in East and Southeast Asia, even if political leaders in those regions (apart from the Japanese and of course Taiwan) typically choose not to voice their concerns on the record, at least not yet. 26 112 The EU-China partnership: rhetoric versus reality 23.

Numerous interviews and conversations with government officials, journalists and scholars in East and Southeast Asia over re- cent years have confirmed that China\u2019s economic and military rise, happening in parallel with a Chinese quest for regional domi- nance, is being perceived as po- tentially threatening in the region. cp94.qxp 09/01/2007 16:56 Page 112 ",
        "7 Admittedly, China\u2019s recent regional foreign (and above all foreign economic) policies in East and Southeast Asia, such as its efforts to establish a Free Trade Agreement (FTA) with ASEAN by 2012 as well as the generous provision of financial and economic support for individual developing economies in Southeast and South Asia, resemble those of a \u2018soft power\u2019 achieving political goals through economic assistance and support \u2013 even if China\u2019s economic, infrastructure and financial support for the military regime in Burma/Myanmar is controversial and a concern in the region and beyond. In \u2018return\u2019 for Brussels\u2019 engagement, Beijing has over recent years done its share to make the EU-25 China\u2019s biggest trading partner, and has actively supported and encouraged European investments in China as well as academic and people-to-people exchanges in as many areas as possible. Conclusion: what next? EU Member States will continue to speak for themselves and with \u2018one voice\u2019 in only a limited number of areas of bilateral relations. China for its part will continue to deal with individual EU Member States or the EU Commission where and when it sees fit, while from time to time \u2018complaining\u2019 that Europe is not speaking with \u2018one voice\u2019 on foreign and security policy issues (as the controversy over the weapons embargo has shown). As regards European and Chinese co-operation on international issues and security, EU and China\u2019s interests and foreign and security policy conduct will continue to differ fundamentally, realistically limiting the number of interna- tional issues where the EU and China can jointly produce results. As Beijing\u2019s energy and energy security policies in Africa and Central Asia show, China is implementing its policies strictly according to what Beijing refers to as the \u2018principle of non-inter- ference\u2019 in internal political affairs of governments with which it is doing business. To put it bluntly, it is \u2018business over principle\u2019 in China\u2019s global and regional foreign policy (and specifically for- eign economic policy) mindset. This approach means that \u2018exter- nal interference\u2019 in other countries\u2019 affairs is ruled out as a foreign policy tool. Over recent years China (mainly driven by its rising thirst for crude oil and other commodities) has expanded and intensified 113 Axel Berkofsky cp94.qxp 09/01/2007 16:56 Page 113 ",
        "7 relations with a number of African nations (including Sudan) and Central Asian nations as well as with Burma/Myanmar and North Korea in Asia, regardless of international concerns about serious and internationally acknowledged human rights violations and civil and ethnic wars (as for example in Darfur). Even if the con- duct of EU foreign and security polices is not entirely free of con- tradictions or indeed double-standards, Brussels\u2019 approach towards a number of autocratic regimes and dictatorships differs fundamentally from the Chinese approach in the sense that \u2018inter- ference\u2019 \u2013 inter alia in the form of economic and diplomatic sanc- tions (as in the case of Burma, North Korea or Zimbabwe or Uzbekistan) \u2013 is an instrument of Brussels\u2019 foreign and security policy. In view of the fact that it will remain difficult (if not impossi- ble) to formulate and implement one single EU strategy towards China any time soon, the EU is above all charged with the task of identifying areas of bilateral co-operation where there is a consen- sus amongst all EU Member States. Even if that might turn out to be a \u2018mission impossible\u2019 in some cases, it is still better to be able to implement a limited number of policies backed by consensus rather than seeking to implement a wide range of policies that lack the support of all EU Member States. EU-China bilateral trade will continue to grow for years, if not decades, to come. So, however, will the bilateral trade deficit in China\u2019s favour if the current bilateral trade problems remain unaddressed. The pressure of European business on EU institu- tions to urge Beijing to fully open its market is likely to become stronger and already there is a growing dissatisfaction among European investors about the lack of progress in creating more favourable conditions for investment and the protection of intel- lectual property rights. At the recent EU-China Summit in Helsinki on September, the EU and China agreed to formally launch negotiations on the envi- sioned Partnership and Co-operation Agreement which will, according to the summit\u2019s joint statement, \u2018encompass the full scope of their bilateral relationship, including enhanced co-oper- ation in political matters\u2019. 27 Whether and how the agreement will give EU-China relations and the Brussels-Beijing \u2018strategic partnership\u2019 new impetus and momentum is certain to be observed with great interest in Europe, China and, last but not least, in Washington. 114 The EU-China partnership: rhetoric versus reality 27.

        "Towards a comprehensive China strategy Antonio Tanca Introduction The last few years have witnessed a dynamic development of the EU\u2019s interest in the East Asian region, to a large extent driven by the phenomenon of China\u2019s rise. While the EU is of the view that its East Asian strategy should not be focused on China alone, there is no doubt that Beijing\u2019s growing regional and international status calls for special attention on the part of Brussels. For example, the recent nuclear and missile crisis in the Korean Peninsula and the role played by Beijing in finding a diplomatic solution to it, clearly demonstrate that the emergence of China as a global power with an increasing economic weight is taking place in a geopolitical context that remains highly volatile. This chapter addresses some key aspects of the EU\u2019s China strategy. It discusses the rationale behind the development of the strategy and specifies the instruments and policies that the EU can use and pursue to promote effective partnership with China. The chapter also outlines some policy initiatives that the EU has already developed. Why a comprehensive strategy? At the latest EU-China Summit, in Helsinki, the two sides stated that their relationship was \u2018maturing into a comprehensive strate- gic partnership\u2019. 1 How should this statement be interpreted? How far has the EU developed its thinking on what it expects from its relationship with China? Should the EU approach to China be seen in the more general context of the East Asian region? Until relatively recently, the Common Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP) of the EU had little to say on Asian issues, partly for historic reasons, although there has for a long time been a pres- ence of some EU Member States in the region. The European 115 Facing China\u2019s rise: Guidelines for an EU strategy 1. Joint Statement of the Ninth EU-China Summit, Helsinki, 9 September 2006. 8 cp94.qxp 09/01/2007 16:56 Page 115 ",
        "8 Commission has been active mostly on economic, trade and spe- cific co-operation issues. But there has been a remarkable absence of the EU as a whole in the East Asian region. A question could be asked: does the EU really need a comprehensive strategy towards a remote part of the world? Should the CFSP address regional secu- rity in East Asia? In doing so, is there any value added for the EU or for Asia? This answer to these questions should be positive for a number of reasons. The EU has a broad approach to security in the world based on its 2003 Security Strategy. 2 The goals pursued in that context are well known: the preservation of peace and security in accordance with the principles of the UN Charter; the promotion of the rule- based international system; the promotion of regional integra- tion; the development and consolidation of democracy, the rule of law and respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms; as well as the promotion of policies to meet global challenges (e.g. in energy, environment and health). There are several reasons why Asia (and particularly China) are especially relevant for this. Europe needs the support of Asia (and particularly of key East Asian countries) to pursue its global security and foreign policy goals effectively. Because of East Asia\u2019s increasing international political and economic weight, the region\u2019s influence is central for the achievement of the objectives outlined in the European Secu- rity Strategy (ESS) and other strategic documents of the EU. Japan and the Republic of Korea by and large already pursue a similar agenda. But the role that China will choose to play will be crucial in this context. It is also clear that, as the first trading partner of China, the EU also has major economic interests at stake in Asia. The level of eco- nomic interdependence between Europe and Asia is increasing and it is of critical importance for Europe\u2019s future growth prospects. Security and stability in the East Asia region are pre- conditions for the region\u2019s continued economic success, and for the EU this has acquired an added dimension of importance given the EU\u2019s own direct economic interests there. Hence, the EU has a vested interest in the development of harmonious and co-opera- tive relations between the region\u2019s major players. At the same time, it is clear that a possible conflict in the region would have dire security and economic implications for the EU. The rise of China has added a sense of urgency to the pursuit of the objectives outlined above. It is important that China\u2019s growing 116 Towards a comprehensive China strategy 2. \u2018A secure Europe in a better world\u2019, European Security Strategy , December 2003, p. 11.

        "8 status, whilst clearly a positive development, takes place in a man- ner that is advantageous for the international community as a whole. Given the geopolitical situation, the potential flashpoints and the increasing importance of China in the region, the EU needs to have a coherent vision on how to manage its relations with Beijing and other countries in the region (notably Japan) in order to better pursue its goals. Clearly, the policy choices of China are of great importance for the world not least because it is proba- bly the only power in the region with the capacity to become a global player. China continues to declare that its paramount inter- est is in its own peaceful economic development. Should its poli- cies remain true to these declarations, there is no doubt that China\u2019s international promotion would greatly contribute to world stability. All in all, developments in the region are not \u2018neutral\u2019 or \u2018indif- ferent\u2019 for the EU, and the EU cannot afford to be either neutral or indifferent in relation to these developments. Hence the EU must have a clear strategic vision of what it wants from the development of its bilateral relationship with China and the other countries of the region. The EU must also develop its \u2018awareness\u2019 of the tools it has at its disposal to exert its influence and have a clear vision of their effectiveness and of the means of increasing their efficiency. The key issues In the conclusions on the EU-China Strategic Partnership adopted by the Council of the EU in December 2006, one can already single out a number of key issues on which the EU is focusing and to which even more attention should be devoted: there is the rise of China as such, and its growing importance in foreign policy, cross- straits relations and in the security architecture of East Asia. Another issue, not specifically addressed in the Council Conclu- sions but also relevant, is that of Sino-Japanese and Sino-Korean bilateral relations and the problem of rising nationalisms. China\u2019s rise It is now commonly stated that the EU should foster the develop- ment of China as a successful and responsible member of the inter- national community. The Council Conclusions reinforce this point. The EU should continue to encourage China to play a con- 117 Antonio Tanca cp94.qxp 09/01/2007 16:56 Page 117 ",
        "8 structive role in the promotion of effective multilateralism. The approach of the EU should be frank, transparent, focused on seek- ing reciprocity and on promoting deeper engagement. This is as much in the interest of China as it is in the EU\u2019s interest. There are a number of specific fields where co-operation should continue and possibly increase or deepen. Here only some are mentioned which this author believes to be the most impor- tant. Besides fields such as arms control, non-proliferation and counter-terrorism, on which there is an ongoing dialogue, co- operation should increase further on energy and environmental issues. Some significant steps were taken at the 2005 Beijing Sum- mit and the importance of these issues was reconfirmed at the lat- est Helsinki Summit in September 2006. But more needs to be done. The question of illegal migration arouses a great deal of con- cern in European public opinion. China\u2019s internal developments should be followed and monitored with great attention, especially the negative effects of its economic growth (e.g. in terms of the environment, the growing income gap etc.). At the same time, the EU should contribute to the development of China\u2019s confidence in the international system. Not least important are China\u2019s activ- ities in the developing world. The EU should actively pursue the structured dialogue on Africa, which has been launched at the lat- est Helsinki Summit. On the question of cross-straits relations , the Council Conclu- sions clearly reaffirm the EU\u2019s One China Policy as well as the EU\u2019s wish to see both sides taking initiatives aimed at promoting direct dialogue between them, practical co-operation and confidence building. These measures include direct cross-straits flights, reduction in barriers to trade and increased people-to-people con- tacts. Recently the EU has been more active in taking a stance on cross-straits issues. However, it should heighten its level of atten- tion on this issue even more. It should further develop its under- standing of the cross- straits military balance (which would allow it to take sound decisions under the Code of Conduct). Also, it should not refrain from praising positive developments, and openly encouraging dialogue among all stakeholders concerned. This should include encouraging both sides to find pragmatic solutions for participation of Taiwanese experts in multilateral fora. If needed, it should express publicly or privately its concerns to either of the parties where provocative action is taken. 118 Towards a comprehensive China strategy cp94.qxp 09/01/2007 16:56 Page 118 ",
        "8 Regional security architecture The encouragement of regional integration and promotion of strong regional institutions is a key tenet of EU policy worldwide. In East Asia this process is just at the beginning and is basically cen- tred on ASEAN. Also, for the time being, such a system does not address shared regional security concerns. The US still provides a basic guarantee and this role must be recognised. There is a neces- sity to develop strategic dialogue with key partners to make sure EU policies do not undermine stability. The EU should seek to develop the authority of regional organisations or fora dealing with the issue such as the ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF), and promote direct cooperation initiatives. The Aceh Monitoring Mission is a good example of this. Competitive nationalisms Despite recent encouraging developments in the bilateral relations of Japan with China and the RoK respectively, competitive nation- alisms in each of these countries and the underlying reasons for them remain a source of concern. The EU should promote co-oper- ative relations between the States in the region and invite all sides to refrain from actions that might be misperceived. In particular, it should promote confidence-builidng measures (CBMs) on territo- rial and resources disputes, convince China to be more transparent on military expenditure, and be willing (if requested) to share les- sons from its own past. In general, it should encourage leaders to build upon their flourishing economic relations to establish better political relations and more regional integration through regional bodies. How the EU can achieve these goals The recent Commission Communication \u2018EU-China: closer part- ners, growing responsibilities\u2019 3 and the Council Conclusions are important steps towards increased coherence of the EU\u2019s thinking on China. These two texts illustrate greater awareness of the com- plexity of the relationship and the need for any serious approach to be all-encompassing. Ideally, the same approach should be taken towards the entire East Asian region. The complexity of the EU-China relationship is also demon- strated by the large number of ongoing dialogues involving the 119 Antonio Tanca 3.

        "8 Community, the Union as such, and Member States individually. These dialogues cover an increasing range of bilateral and interna- tional issues. The Council Conclusions acknowledge a need for them to be focused, and deliver practical results with benchmark- setting and follow-up mechanisms. Co-ordination between the EU and Member States should even be improved on issues such as human rights, or strategic issues, where China has ongoing dia- logues both with the EU and with a number of Member States. While the number of the dialogues should not necessarily be reduced, increased co-ordination with a view to delivering the same key messages and underlining the same concerns could be of great use. By now there have been many occasions showing that the Union\u2019s weight and influence are much greater when it speaks with one voice. This should be especially true when dealing with China. The EU also needs to work \u2018externally\u2019 by deepening its exchanges with the region\u2019s key players. It has already done so with the launching of a series of strategic dialogues with the US, Japan and China itself. Discussions with other important players in the area such as the RoK, Australia and members of ASEAN comple- ment these usefully. The EU should upgrade its engagement in the existing fora in which it already takes part, such as the Asia-Europe Meeting (ASEM), EU-ASEAN and the ARF, as this would help it to establish better channels of communication with regional players. By doing so the EU would also develop common analysis and approaches. In all of this, the EU can count on a number of assets: The first is its economic presence. EU general policy already consists of using its economic leverage to pursue a number of political goals, notably in the field of protection of human rights, counter-terrorism and non-proliferation. This is done, inter alia , by the insertion of specific clauses in its agreements with third coun- tries. This is happening also in Asia, albeit slowly (e.g. in negotia- tions of Partnership and Co-operation agreements with countries of South East Asia and the forthcoming negotiations with China). This specific tool must be used with great care in Asia. The second is the European experience with the post-war rec- onciliation. Without wanting to give lessons to anyone, if there is 120 Towards a comprehensive China strategy cp94.qxp 09/01/2007 16:56 Page 120 ",
        "8 a request from the countries in the region, some European experi- ences (notably the postwar Franco-German relationship and Ger- man-Polish reconciliation) could be of use. The third is its experience in political and economic integra- tion. Despite the great historical and geopolitical differences, which do not make the EU experience applicable as such to East Asia, some aspects of EU integration, including at the technical level, could provide a model. Finally, there is often the impression that, despite the fact that Europe shares a large number of interests and values with some East Asian countries, and despite its economic weight, it is not taken seriously enough in the region because of its perceived \u2018detachment\u2019. Some of these actors would probably welcome a more active EU interest in the region and would welcome its mul- tilateralist approach. What has been done so far? In the last two years, the EU has made considerable progress in developing its strategic thinking and increasing the efficiency of its tools towards the region. Here are some examples: (cid:90) Launching of the strategic dialogues with the US, Japan and China, and enhanced dialogue with the RoK and Australia. The launching of these dialogues (in particular with the US and Japan) was originally triggered by the question of the possible lifting of the EU arms embargo towards China. It was felt that the EU needed to be explain its position to its friends in the region, and also deepen its knowledge of the key strategic issues in the area. These dialogues are proving very fruitful and should continue, while increasing their level of focus on specific issues of common concern such as the military balance in the region, energy or the situation in the Korean Peninsula. (cid:90) Launching negotiations of the PCA with China. The goal of the agreement is to constitute the basis for the EU\u2019s comprehensive strategic partnership with China and encompass the full scope of the bilateral relationship. This of course means that the pro- visions of the 1985 Trade and Co-operation Agreement will be 121 Antonio Tanca cp94.qxp 09/01/2007 16:56 Page 121 ",
        "8 updated and be part of the new agreement. The negotiations, due to start at the beginning of 2007, will certainly be long and complex, given the complexity of the relationship. (cid:90) Launching of a structured dialogue with China on Africa. Africa is an area of increasing strategic interest. This dialogue will be an important tool for discussion and co-ordination with China on questions of great importance for the EU in the African continent, such as the situation in the Darfur region. It will also provide a tool for coordinated action for the achieve- ment of goals such as poverty reduction, sustainable develop- ment and good governance in the African continent. (cid:90) The Commission Communication \u2018EU-China: closer partners, growing responsibilities\u2019 and the Council Conclusions on EU- China strategic partnership issued in the autumn of 2006, which, taken together, constitute a comprehensive review and restatement of EU policy towards China. (cid:82) (cid:82) (cid:82) All in all, at present, the wording used in the Council Conclusions where the Council states its commitment to \u2018the maturing of the EU\u2019s comprehensive strategic partnership with China\u2019 perfectly defines the current state of affairs. Not all is ideal in the bilateral relationship. There are areas where the EU would like China to do more and vice versa. However, the general trend is that of a complex relationship which needs a lot of care and the right tools for it to be properly managed. Whereas a lot of progress has been made in terms of \u2018internal coherence\u2019 and of reaching out to the key actors in the region, it will still be some time before visible effects in the region become evident. The EU should probably further sharpen its thinking and its tools to deal with the region as a whole. The codification of real strategic guidelines could help to that end and could enhance the Union\u2019s role and visibility. 122 Towards a comprehensive China strategy cp94.qxp 09/01/2007 16:56 Page 122 ",

        "With its booming economy, China is emerging as the key player in Asia-Pacific and possibly as the world\u2019s next super- power. So far, China has mainly developed as a \u2018trading power\u2019 \u2013 concentrating on the expansion of its economy and retaining a relatively restricted international role. However, there is no doubt that the dynamic rise of China poses major challenges to the status quo in the region with consequences for its neighbours and other powers present there, such as the US and, increasingly, also the EU. What are the implications of China\u2019s rise for the EU? The transatlantic dispute over the arms embargo has high- lighted the need for the EU to develop its own security per- spective on China, which would address, among others, the issues of China\u2019s defence policy and the modernisation of its military, the security situation in East Asia and Pacific as well as China\u2019s energy policy. This Chaillot Paper provides an analysis of some aspects of China\u2019s domestic transformation and its evolving inter- national relations with a view to providing guidelines towards the development of effective EU strategic thinking on China. published by the European Union Institute for Security Studies 43 avenue du Pr\u00e9sident Wilson F-75775 Paris cedex 16 phone: +33 (0)1 56 89 19 30 fax: +33 (0)1 56 89 19 31 e-mail: info@iss.europa.eu www.iss.europa.eu \u20ac 10 ISSN 1017-7566 ISBN 92-9198-100-1 cp94-cover.qxp 09/01/2007 17:14 Page 4 "
