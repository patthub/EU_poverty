        "Foreword Employment has reached a record level: 240 million people in the EU have a job. At more than 73%, the employment rate is getting close to reach the Europe 2020 target of 75% by 2020. This has positive effects on the social side as well. The number of people at risk of poverty or social exclusion has declined over the last decade by over 10 million. We are finally making some progress towards the Europe 2020 targets, and the trend is set to continue this year. Unfortunately, this growth is not benefitting all countries and citizens in the same manner: some Member States are still experiencing high unemployment and poverty rates. Substantial disparities in employment and social indicators persist across the EU. The risk of poverty or social exclusion remains a challenge particularly for children and people with disabilities. These and the longer-term challenges linked to technological change, globalisation and ageing, call for further action to support upward social convergence. I am pleased to note that the ninth edition of the report on projects and organisations funded by the EU programme for Employment and Social Innovation (EaSI) again showcases good practices addressing these challenges. The 23 presented projects supported reforms of social protection systems, while enhancing administrative co- operation on posting of workers as well as increase the participation of the young in the Youth Guarantee. Furthermore, the report highlights the support to 19 major EU-level Non-Governmental Organisations (NGOs) active in the promotion of social inclusion, poverty reduction and access to finance. I am confident that the good work of these projects and organisations will be a source of inspiration for future initiatives.

        "Projects and organisations funded by the European Union Programme for Employment and Social Innovation (EaSI) 6 Abstract The European Programme for Employment and Social Innovation (\u2018EaSI\u2019) 2014-2020 1 is a financing instrument managed directly by the European Commission (EC) to promote a high quality and sustainable employment, adequate and decent social protection, social inclusion and poverty reduction and prevention, and fair working conditions. Following the proclamation of the European Pillar of Social Rights 2 , which sets out a guidance to support fair and well- functioning labour markets and welfare systems, the EaSI programme is an essential tool assisting the Commission to reinforce the EU\u2019s social dimension. Making the European Pillar of Social Rights a reality for citizens is a joint responsibility. While most of the tools to deliver on the Pillar are in the hands of Member States, as well as social partners and civil society, the European Union institutions \u2013 and the European Commission in particular \u2013 can help by setting the framework and giving the direction, using instruments such as EaSI. Among other initiatives, EaSI co-finances actions of public, private and civil society organisations enabling them to deliver new services, assess existing policies or develop new ones, and exchange good practices in the fields of employment, social protection, working conditions, geographical labour mobility, microfinance and social entrepreneurship. To facilitate the dissemination of the achieved results, this report presents examples of 23 projects supported by the Programme for Employment and Social Innovation (EaSI) which were completed between 2015 and the first semester of 2018. The aims of the presented projects ranged from supporting reforms of national social protection systems and enhancing administrative co-operation on posting of workers to raising awareness on how young people can benefit from the Youth Guarantee 3 . Another main part of the report presents EaSI-supported activities implemented in 2017 by 19 major EU-level Non Governmental Organisations (NGOs) active in the promotion of social inclusion, poverty reduction and access to finance. The presented organisations aimed to support the implementation of the European Pillar of Social Rights, as well as Commission\u2019s initiatives carried out towards policy objectives of the Europe 2020 Strategy, the Social Investment Package and the Political Guidelines of the Commission 4 at both national and local level. In addition, they contributed to the main EU governance processes such as the Open Method of Coordination (OMC) on social protection and social inclusion 5 and the European Semester 6 . The report also includes a description of the methodology that was applied to collect information on the presented actions and to analyse their results. Among other things, the report seeks to emphasise the European added value of the described actions and to single out potential good practices. We believe that this report will be beneficial in two major ways. First, it will serve as guidance for public and private institutions and civil society organisations wishing to apply for EU funding. Second, it will provide policy-makers with innovative ideas to design and implement new policy interventions to boost employment and ensure adequate social protection across the EU. 1 http://ec.europa.eu/social/main.jsp?catId=1081 2 https://ec.europa.eu/commission/priorities/deeper-and-fairer-economic-and-monetary-union/european-pillar-social-rights/european-pillar-social-rights-20- principles_en 3 http://ec.europa.eu/social/main.jsp?catId=1079 4 http://ec.europa.eu/social/main.jsp?catId=1044&langId=en 5 http://ec.europa.eu/social/main.jsp?langId=en&catId=1063 6 https://ec.europa.eu/info/business-economy-euro/economic-and-fiscal-policy-coordination/eu-economic-governance-monitoring-prevention-correction/ european-semester_en ",
        "Projects and organisations funded by the European Union Programme for Employment and Social Innovation (EaSI) 7 Kurzfassung Das EU-Programm f\u00fcr Besch\u00e4ftigung und soziale Innovation (EaSI) 2014-2020 7 ist ein unmittelbar von der Europ\u00e4ischen Kommission verwaltetes Finanzierungsinstrument, mit dem diese eine hochwertige und nachhaltige Besch\u00e4ftigung, einen angemessenen und menschenw\u00fcrdigen Sozialschutz, soziale Eingliederung, Armutsbek\u00e4mpfung und -pr\u00e4vention sowie faire Arbeitsbedingungen f\u00f6rdert. Im Rahmen der im vergangenen Jahr verabschiedeten Europ\u00e4ischen S\u00e4ule der sozialen Rechte 8 , die Leitlinien f\u00fcr die F\u00f6rderung gerechter und gut funktionierender Arbeitsm\u00e4rkte und Sozialsysteme formuliert, gibt das Programm EaSI der Kommission ein wirksames Instrument an die Hand, um die soziale Dimension der EU zu st\u00e4rken. Damit die Europ\u00e4ische S\u00e4ule der sozialen Rechte f\u00fcr die B\u00fcrger Europas zur Realit\u00e4t wird, m\u00fcssen alle Ebenen zusammenarbeiten. Zwar liegen die meisten politischen Instrumente, die f\u00fcr die S\u00e4ule relevant sind, in den H\u00e4nden der Mitgliedstaaten, der Sozialpartner und der Zivilgesellschaft; dennoch k\u00f6nnen die Organe der Europ\u00e4ischen Union, und insbesondere die Europ\u00e4ische Kommission, unter anderem mit Hilfe des Programms EaSI g\u00fcnstige Rahmenbedingungen schaffen und die Richtung vorgeben. So stellt das Programm EaSI unter anderem eine Kofinanzierung f\u00fcr Ma\u00dfnahmen staatlicher, privater und zivilgesellschaftlicher Organisationen bereit, mit denen diese in den Politikfeldern Besch\u00e4ftigung, Sozialschutz, Arbeitsbedingungen, r\u00e4umliche Mobilit\u00e4t von Arbeitnehmern, Mikrofinanzierung und soziales Unternehmertum neue Dienstleistungen erbringen, politische Strategien auswerten oder neue politische Ideen entwickeln sowie bew\u00e4hrte Verfahren austauschen. Um die Verbreitung der dabei erzielten Ergebnisse zu verbessern, stellt dieser Bericht beispielhaft 23 Projekte vor, die im Rahmen des Programms f\u00fcr Besch\u00e4ftigung und soziale Innovation (EaSI) gef\u00f6rdert und zwischen 2015 und dem ersten Halbjahr 2018 abgeschlossen wurden. Die vorgestellten Projekte dienten unter anderem dazu, Reformen der Sozialsysteme in den Mitgliedstaaten zu unterst\u00fctzen, die Kooperation nationaler Arbeitsverwaltungen bei der Vermittlung von Arbeitnehmern zu verbessern oder junge Menschen \u00fcber die Vorteile und M\u00f6glichkeiten der Jugendgarantie 9 zu informieren. In einem weiteren Abschnitt des Berichts werden Ma\u00dfnahmen von 19 gro\u00dfen europaweit t\u00e4tigen Nichtregierungsorganisationen (NRO) vorgestellt, die im Jahr 2017 im Rahmen von EaSI gef\u00f6rdert wurden und sich f\u00fcr soziale Eingliederung, den Kampf gegen Armut und einen besseren Zugang zu Finanzdienstleistungen einsetzen. Die Ma\u00dfnahmen der genannten Organisationen hatten das Ziel, die Umsetzung der Europ\u00e4ischen S\u00e4ule der sozialen Rechte und anderer Initiative der Kommission, mit deren Hilfe diese die im Rahmen der Strategie Europa 2020, des Sozialinvestitionspakets und der politischen Leitlinien der Kommission 10 definierten politischen Ziele f\u00f6rdert, auf nationaler und lokaler Ebene zu unterst\u00fctzen. Au\u00dferdem tragen sie zu den wichtigsten Verfahren des Europ\u00e4ischen Regierens bei, das hei\u00dft zu der offenen Koordinierungsmethode f\u00fcr Sozialschutz und soziale Eingliederung (OKM) und zum Europ\u00e4ische Semester 11 . Schlie\u00dflich enth\u00e4lt der Bericht eine Beschreibung der Methoden, die angewendet wurden, um Daten \u00fcber die vorgestellten Ma\u00dfnahmen zu erfassen und deren Ergebnisse zu analysieren. Unter anderem soll der Bericht den europ\u00e4ischen Mehrwert der untersuchten Ma\u00dfnahmen pr\u00fcfen und bew\u00e4hrte Verfahren vorstellen. Wir hoffen, dass sich dieser Bericht als hilfreich erweist, indem er erstens \u00f6ffentlichen und privaten Institutionen und zivilgesellschaftlichen Organisationen, die F\u00f6rdermittel der EU beantragen m\u00f6chten, als Leitfaden dient und zweitens politischen Entscheidungstr\u00e4gern innovative Ideen zur Entwicklung und Umsetzung neuer politischer Ma\u00dfnahmen vorstellt, mit denen Arbeitspl\u00e4tze geschaffen und europaweit ein angemessener Sozialschutz gew\u00e4hrleistet werden k\u00f6nnen. 7 http://ec.europa.eu/social/main.jsp?catId=1081&langId=de 8 https://ec.europa.eu/commission/priorities/deeper-and-fairer-economic-and-monetary-union/european-pillar-social-rights/european-pillar-social-rights-20- principles_de 9 http://ec.europa.eu/social/main.jsp?catId=1079&langId=de 10 https://ec.europa.eu/commission/publications/president-junckers-political-guidelines_de 11 http://ec.europa.eu/social/main.jsp?langId=de&catId=1063 ",

Apr\u00e8s la proclamation du socle europ\u00e9en des droits sociaux 13 , qui fixe des lignes directrices pour soutenir des march\u00e9s du travail et des syst\u00e8mes de protection sociale justes et qui fonctionnent correctement, le programme EaSI est un outil essentiel pour aider la Commission \u00e0 renforcer la dimension sociale de l\u2019UE. Faire du socle europ\u00e9en des droits sociaux une r\u00e9alit\u00e9 pour les citoyens est une responsabilit\u00e9 commune. Si la plupart des outils pour faire aboutir le socle sont du ressort des \u00c9tats membres ainsi que des partenaires sociaux et de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 civile, les institutions europ\u00e9ennes \u2013 et notamment la Commission europ\u00e9enne \u2013 peuvent aider en fixant un cadre et des orientations, \u00e0 l\u2019aide d\u2019instruments comme EaSI. EaSI, entre autres initiatives, cofinance des actions des acteurs publics, priv\u00e9s et de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 civile, leur permettant de proposer de nouveaux services, \u00e9valuer des politiques existantes ou en d\u00e9velopper de nouvelles, et \u00e9changer des bonnes pratiques dans les domaines de l\u2019emploi, de la protection sociale, des conditions de travail, de la mobilit\u00e9 g\u00e9ographique de la main-d\u2019\u0153uvre, de la microfinance et de l\u2019entrepreneuriat social. Afin de faciliter la diffusion des r\u00e9sultats obtenus, ce rapport pr\u00e9sente des exemples de 23 projets financ\u00e9s par le programme pour l\u2019emploi et l\u2019innovation sociale (EaSI), mis en \u0153uvre entre 2015 et le premier semestre de 2018, les objectifs des projets pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s allant du soutien aux r\u00e9formes des syst\u00e8mes nationaux de protection sociale et l\u2019am\u00e9lioration de la coop\u00e9ration administrative relative au d\u00e9tachement des travailleurs \u00e0 la sensibilisation \u00e0 la mani\u00e8re dont les jeunes peuvent b\u00e9n\u00e9ficier de la garantie pour la jeunesse 14 . Une autre partie importante du rapport pr\u00e9sente les activit\u00e9s financ\u00e9es par EaSI et mises en \u0153uvre en 2017 par 19 grandes ONG europ\u00e9ennes actives dans le domaine de la promotion de l\u2019inclusion sociale, de la r\u00e9duction de la pauvret\u00e9 et de l\u2019acc\u00e8s aux financements. Les ONG pr\u00e9sent\u00e9es dans le rapport avaient pour objectif de soutenir la mise en \u0153uvre du socle europ\u00e9en des droits sociaux, ainsi que les initiatives de la Commission men\u00e9es pour r\u00e9pondre aux objectifs politiques de la strat\u00e9gie Europe 2020 15 , du paquet Investissement social 16 et des orientations politiques de la Commission 17 au niveau national comme local.

Le rapport inclut \u00e9galement une description de la m\u00e9thodologie utilis\u00e9e pour collecter des informations sur les actions pr\u00e9sent\u00e9es, et pour analyser leurs r\u00e9sultats. Entre autres, le rapport cherche \u00e0 apporter un \u00e9clairage sur la valeur ajout\u00e9e europ\u00e9enne des actions d\u00e9crites, et \u00e0 distinguer les bonnes pratiques potentielles.

Ensuite, il apportera aux d\u00e9cisionnaires politiques des id\u00e9es innovantes pour concevoir et mettre en \u0153uvre de nouvelles interventions politiques qui permettront de dynamiser l\u2019emploi et de garantir une protection sociale adapt\u00e9e dans l\u2019ensemble de l\u2019Union europ\u00e9enne. 12 http://ec.europa.eu/social/main.jsp?catId=1081&langId=fr 13 https://ec.europa.eu/commission/priorities/deeper-and-fairer-economic-and-monetary-union/european-pillar-social-rights/european-pillar-social-rights-20- principles_fr 14 http://ec.europa.eu/social/main.jsp?catId=1079&langId=fr 15 https://ec.europa.eu/info/business-economy-euro/economic-and-fiscal-policy-coordination/eu-economic-governance-monitoring-prevention-correction/ european-semester/framework/europe-2020-strategy_fr 16 http://ec.europa.eu/social/main.jsp?catId=1044&langId=fr 17 https://ec.europa.eu/commission/publications/president-junckers-political-guidelines_fr 18 http://ec.europa.eu/social/main.jsp?langId=fr&catId=1063 19 https://ec.europa.eu/info/business-economy-euro/economic-and-fiscal-policy-coordination/eu-economic-governance-monitoring-prevention-correction/ european-semester_fr ",

        "Projects and organisations funded by the European Union Programme for Employment and Social Innovation (EaSI) 12 Introduction The EU Programme for Employment and Social Innovation (EaSI) 20 is one of four EU financial instruments in the area of employment and social affairs for the period 2014-2020, together with the European Social Fund 21 (ESF), the Fund for European Aid for the most Deprived 22 (FEAD) and the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund 23 (EGF). EaSI provides financial support to promote a high quality and sustainable employment, adequate and decent social protection, social inclusion, poverty reduction and prevention and fair working conditions. With this ultimate goal, EaSI is an essential tool assisting the European Commission to reinforce the EU\u2019s social dimension as affirmed by the European Pillar of Social Rights 24 . The Pillar contains principles promoting well-functioning and fair labour markets as well social protection systems, which are structured around three dimensions: > ensuring equal opportunities and access to the labour market; > fair working conditions; > and social protection and inclusion. Alongside with other financial instruments, EaSI plays a key role in the implementation of the Pillar and its follow-up initiatives. With the Pillar directly feeding into the annual cycle of assessing economic and social challenges across the EU, the EaSI programme remains central for supporting the achievement of the political goals in the area of employment and social affairs in the EU. The total budget of the EaSI programme for the period 2014-2020 is EUR 919,469,000 (in 2013 prices). Over 61% of the programme\u2019s total budget is reserved to support the modernisation of employment and social policies under the PROGRESS axis. Around 18% of the total budget has been allocated to promoting job mobility covered by the EURES axis. The Microfinance and Social Entrepreneurship axis, which aims to improve access to finance for vulnerable people, micro- and social enterprises, is supported with 21% of the programme\u2019s total budget. Analysing and disseminating information about the results of the supported projects and organisations are part of the EaSI\u2019s performance monitoring in 2014-2020. The programme\u2019s monitoring approach foresees biannual reports presenting examples of projects and organisations supported by EaSI. This is the ninth such report, which follows the first eight published in 2014-2018. The report presents the results of EaSI-funded projects and organisations \u2013 major EU-level NGOs promoting social inclusion, poverty reduction and access to finance for vulnerable groups of society and social entrepreneurs. The report consists mainly of fiches, which describe in concise and uniform format the results and the European added value of a given successful project or organisation as well as potential good practices among the implemented actions. In addition, the project/organisation fiches were developed with an aim to make them easily accessible as stand- alone documents and useful to all informed stakeholders (decision-makers, social partners, NGOs, academia, media and civil society at large). The purpose of this report is to improve learning among the national authorities, civil society organisations and private actors working in the field of employment and social affairs, to support future policy developments. First, it may serve as guidance for public, private and civil society actors wishing to apply for EU funding in the future. Second, it will provide policy-makers with ideas and suggestions that can inform the design and implementation of new policy interventions. Along with this introduction, the report has three other parts. Chapter 2 features a description of the methodology that was applied to collect information on the actions and organisations presented and to analyse their results. Chapter 3 presents projects funded by EaSI and implemented between 2015 and the beginning of 2018. In Chapter 4, the reader will find an overview of the EaSI-funded activities implemented in 2017 by major EU-level NGOs. The report concludes with a short afterword inter alia explaining the next steps in monitoring EaSI-supported projects and organisations as well as the overall programme. 20 http://ec.europa.eu/social/main.jsp?catId=1081#navItem-1 21 http://ec.europa.eu/esf/home.jsp 22 http://ec.europa.eu/social/main.jsp?catId=1089 23 http://ec.europa.eu/social/main.jsp?catId=326&langId=en 24 http://ec.europa.eu/social/main.jsp?catId=1310&langId=en ",

Since EaSI-funded projects usually last 2-3 years, the reader will find the description of the projects implemented between 2015 and the first semester of 2018. This report covers projects implemented in the areas of social protection, working conditions, employment and development of a social finance market. In the policy area of social protection , the report presents four projects that aimed to support the Member States in reviewing some selected aspects of their social protection systems and identifying the potential for improving cost- effectiveness, including by promoting the contribution of private savings to pension adequacy.

One of the main areas covered by EU labour law is working conditions. This includes provisions on working time, part-time, and fixed-term work, temporary workers, and the posting of workers. All of these areas are key to ensuring high quality and sustainable employment and decent and adequate social protection throughout the EU. The EU defines minimum requirements at European level in the field of working conditions 25 . Table 2.

The Youth Guarantee 27 (YG) is a commitment adopted in 2013 by all EU Member States to ensure that all young people under the age of 25 years receive a good-quality offer of employment, continued education, an apprenticeship or a traineeship within a period of four months of becoming unemployed or leaving formal education. Each year, over 5 million youngsters have registered in YG schemes out of which more than 3.5 million took up an offer of employment, continued education, a traineeship or an apprenticeship. Four years on from when the Youth Guarantee took off in 2014, young people\u2019s labour market performance has improved significantly. There are almost 2 million fewer young unemployed in the EU and 1 million less young people not in employment, education or training (NEETs). Youth unemployment has dropped from a peak of 23.7% in 2013 to 18.7% in 2016. The share of 15-24-year olds not in employment, education or training (NEETs) has fallen from 13.2% in 2012 to 11.5% in 2016. Another project within this group tests a need for a scheme for mobility for professionals with companies. Finally, the report presents two projects contributing to the development of a social finance market as a tool for job creation. Table 3.

        "Projects and organisations funded by the European Union Programme for Employment and Social Innovation (EaSI) 20 The key components of this report are fiches presenting the results of projects and organisations funded by EaSI programme. These project fiches are structured according to policy areas as well as themes of respective calls for proposals. The report presents all projects and organisations that were supported by these instruments and successfully completed in the first semester of 2018. In addition to an overview of activities carried out by the selected projects and organisations, the report aims to identify and describe potential good practices . To single out such practices, we followed a broad definition of the term \u2018practice\u2019 encompassing both policy development and implementation. In our view, a \u2018good practice\u2019 is a process or methodology that has been proven to work well and produce good results and is therefore recommended for others as a model or useful example. What constitutes a \u2018good practice\u2019 can thus include initiatives as diverse as legislation (at the national, sub-national and local levels), regulation, policies, strategies, institutional frameworks, planning and coordination procedures, various interventions (programmes, projects, campaigns, subsidies, financing mechanisms, tariff structures and similar), among many others. When analysing EaSI-funded projects and organisations, the report team aimed to include all information instrumental to distinguishing the most successful activities, so that only effective calls are continued in the future. To ensure that the collected information is as comprehensive as possible, we relied on three data collection strategies : 1. The main sources of information were the final technical implementation reports completed by grant beneficiaries. 2. The report team also used all available additional information about the presented projects provided to them by the European Commission. Such information included various reports and briefings, agendas of organised events, participant lists, financial information, a detailed description of deliverables and external/internal evaluations. 3. Finally, data collection was carried out in openly accessible sources, such as project/organisation websites. The report team then analysed the content of the collected material according to a pre-developed toolkit to produce fiches for each project and organisation. The toolkit included a project fiche template (covering pre-defined criteria for analysis), a list of criteria for classifying analysed projects, and a reference grid for indicating potential good practices. The resulting 42 fiches consist of two parts. The first part (a table) presents the general administrative data on a given project or organisation as well as policy areas and sub-areas as per the pre-established classification. In the second part, we outline the actions, their aims and results, effectiveness, transferability/up-scalability, sustainability, innovativeness, impact and EU added value. These criteria were also used to assess which of the project activities could be regarded as potential good practices. As the reports on EaSI-funded projects and organisations will be inter alia used by the project auditors, the aspect of effectiveness (i.e. the extent to which projects/organisations achieved their results) was given particular attention. 2 Methodology ",
        "Projects and organisations funded by the European Union Programme for Employment and Social Innovation (EaSI) 21 Box 1 provides a complete list of criteria applied to analyse projects and organisations. > Socioeconomic context. This part describes why the action was implemented and the policy-related motives behind it. It also describes how the analysed project/organisation fits into the local/national/EU policy, social and economic context. > Aims of the project/organisation. This heading summarises what the action aimed to achieve. > Results, measured impacts, achievements, lessons learnt. This part discusses the results, medium-to-long- term impacts of the action (both current and expected), achievements and lessons learnt. > Identification of potential good practices. This section identifies processes/methodologies employed by the project/ organisation that could be suggested as good practice examples to other similar projects/organisations. > Transferability element(s) of the project/activities (if any). This section discusses the potential for the action or its individual parts to be applied in other contexts/at other levels (these do not necessarily have to be good practices). > Innovativeness of the project/activities (if any). This section presents project/organisation activities that could be considered novel, in terms of standing out in the context of similar actions and settings and elaborates how exactly they are innovative. > Policy evidence generated by the project/organisation (if any). This heading provides an overview of the studies, reports, databases or other evidence produced by the project/ organisation to inform policy developments in a respective field. > Transnational dimension (if any). This section focuses on activities that were implemented in more than one country, at the EU or international level. In the fiches featuring transnational networks or projects that by design are transnational, this section was often not singled out and instead the transnational element was emphasised as a horizontal theme throughout the project/organisation description under other criteria. > New partnerships created (if any). This heading elaborates on actions that led to participating organisations finding new partners because of their involvement in a given project/network. > Dissemination strategy (if any). This section provides an overview of how the project/organisation communicated the results of their action to their internal networks, stakeholders and the general public, including relevant intermediary and ultimate target groups. > European added value. In this section, the report comments on whether the action: \u2022 could have been implemented or reached similar results without EU funding (where exactly did EU funding mostly contribute to?); \u2022 contributed to the implementation of EU legislation or ensuring that EU legislation is correctly applied; \u2022 led to economies of scale, ensuring more efficient use of money and better services for citizens; \u2022 promoted best practice examples learnt from the previous EU/national actions; \u2022 promoted benchmarking for decision-making (e.g. through peer reviews, mutual learning, producing evidence for policy-makers, etc.); \u2022 due to its transnational character, allowed cross-border risks to be reduced and their consequences mitigated; \u2022 contributed to the free movement of persons; \u2022 contributed to networking activities (especially between organisations from different countries). > Sustainability measures. This part explains what measures were taken in order to ensure that the results and impacts of the action are sustainable. Is there any evidence that activities will continue in the absence of EU funding? > Gender equality measures. This section focuses on the use of gender equality measures in the technical implementation of the project and organisations\u2019 activities. In addition, the integration of a gender perspective in the content of projects and organisations\u2019 activities is described (if applicable). The reader should note that even though projects presented in this report were funded under the same programme and many of them had similar aims, each implemented a unique set of actions. Therefore, in overviewing them the research team focused on the most relevant information for each, instead of including a uniform list of criteria in every fiche. This is to say that project fiches feature different combinations of headings, and more emphasis on specific fiches is given to some of the criteria over others, with respect to the nature of the actions themselves.

The following types of activities were funded: > Supporting obtaining empirical evidence that would help steer national reforms; > country reviews by international organisations; > secondments of policy advisers from another country; > study visits from and to countries with relevant experience; > provision of empirical evidence needed for international comparisons and mutual learning. The projects generated knowledge and evidence that help steering national reforms, either by facilitating the access to expertise from other Member States and international organisations or by obtaining empirical evidence needed for international comparisons and mutual learning. In addition, the projects focussed on major challenges that have been, or might become, the subject of country-specific recommendations 32 , as well as reforms that could strengthen the social investment dimension of social protection schemes. The country-specific recommendations form a key part of the European Semester process 33 , which sets a framework for the coordination of economic policies across the EU. On the basis of detailed country- specific analyses, the European Commission prepares a set of recommendations for each Member State. The recommendations focus on what can realistically be achieved by the EU Member States over the next 12-18 months. The recommendations are endorsed by EU leaders at a summit in June and formally adopted by the national finance ministers in July. 31 Call for proposals VP/2014/006: Support for social protection reforms 32 https://ec.europa.eu/info/business-economy-euro/economic-and-fiscal-policy-coordination/eu-economic-governance-monitoring-prevention-correction/ european-semester/european-semester-timeline/eu-country-specific-recommendations_en 33 https://ec.europa.eu/info/business-economy-euro/economic-and-fiscal-policy-coordination/eu-economic-governance-monitoring-prevention-correction/ european-semester_en 34 http://www.share-project.org/organisation/share-country-teams.html 35 http://www.share-project.org/data-access.html 36 http://www.share-project.org/data-access/share-conditions-of-use.html 37 https://cordis.europa.eu/guidance/archive_en.html 38 https://ec.europa.eu/programmes/horizon2020/en/ ",

        "Projects and organisations funded by the European Union Programme for Employment and Social Innovation (EaSI) 26 > Socioeconomic context Population ageing has been recognised as a process that has a strong impact on both economic and social security systems of EU Member States. With more than 18% of people aged 65 and above in total population, Croatia has one of the oldest populations in the EU. Demographic projections reveal a further increase in this percentage in the future. This trend carries potentially negative economic and healthcare implications. To better understand the effects of population ageing and assist policy-makers in setting out pension system reforms and other social, health and economic policies, this project facilitated the availability of evidence on these trends in Croatia. > Aims of the project/ organisation The project aimed to enhance data quality and data availability on ageing processes to support policy reforms by rigorous evidence. By supporting the implementation of the SHARE survey in Croatia, the project team also contributed a common European longitudinal study needed in researching the ageing process both on the individual and aggregate level. Ultimately, this data serves as a scientific base for more efficient public policies to improve the quality of life in older age and ease the adaptation to new demographic conditions. > Project results, measured impacts, achievements, Lessons learnt The implementation of SHARE in Croatia has produced important impacts at both national and EU level. Panel surveys tracking the individuals over a longer time period from multiple perspectives were carried out for the first time in Croatia. This data provides an innovative evidence base for effective policy-making and increased data quality. According to the project coordinator, the data will be used in answering many open questions in Croatia on health and health care, employment, retirement, working conditions, pensions, social networks etc. The data will be especially relevant for setting out pension reforms as well as employment policy for older workers - both being key tasks of the Ministry of labour and pension systems. At the same time, the collected data feeds into multidisciplinary, longitudinal and international panel database of micro-data on health, socio-economic status and social and family networks covering 27 European countries and Israel. During the sixth wave of data collection, the project team contributed to the SHARE database with almost 2,750 interviews of persons aged 50 and over in Croatia. The project results increase opportunities for cross- country comparative research. Following the database construction phase, the database was officially launched in 2017. According to the project coordinator, the database created during this project will serve as a basis for preparing evidence-based policy documents and a variety of research outputs. > Transferability element(s) of the project/activities The SHARE survey relies on rigorous procedural guidelines and programmes to ensure an ex-ante harmonised cross- national design. These elements ensure the application of the survey to other national contexts. > Innovativeness of the project/activities This project introduced methodology and tools so far rarely applied in Croatia (longitudinal study design, objective measurements of health status by e.g. grip strength test and peak flow meter), enlarging the European Research Area in this respect. Otherwise, the SHARE survey, in general, had introduced a unique transdisciplinary combination of collecting and harmonising data from a number of fields and methodological experiments in order to make surveys more efficient, less costly, and to increase response rates. > Policy evidence generated by the project The SHARE survey has informed policy-makers both at the EU and national level. The increased availability of the SHARE data allows researchers to produce scientific results and support policy-makers to design evidence- based policies. ",
        "Projects and organisations funded by the European Union Programme for Employment and Social Innovation (EaSI) 27 > Transnational dimension The project\u2019s results will complement the overall SHARE dataset. The SHARE multidisciplinary microdata helps to obtain a detailed understanding of ageing across 27 European countries and Israel. > New partnerships created With its support for the implementation of the sixth wave of SHARE survey in Croatia, the action grant supported the Croatian team to fully join the overall SHARE infrastructure. At the national level, the project supported partnerships of the scientific community and policy-makers. Promoting their collaboration has been central to this project, with a view to set grounds for evidence-based policy-making in Croatia. New partnerships could have also been developed during the project events, which directly supported networking and co-operation activities as well as additional meetings and workshops with policy-makers and database users. > Dissemination strategy Several communication channels were used to promote the project and its deliverables in Croatia. The project team relied on their participation in TV and radio shows as well as a presence in written media. They also organised a workshop for students and other potential database users at the Faculty of Economics and Business at Zagreb University. National policy-makers were approached at meetings and presentations. The central SHARE webpage and a newly built website in national language served as additional platforms for dissemination activities. > European added value Applying cross-national and temporal perspective, the SHARE survey allows for a better understanding of the interactions between demographic change and public policies in Europe, and a benchmarking with indicators derived from harmonised data across the EU Member States. > Sustainability measures The main project results feed into coordinated, multinational and longitudinal datasets. Therefore, they will be fully available even after the project activities are finished. Furthermore, the SHARE data collection and release are planned to continue up to 2024 (SHARE waves 7, 8, 9 and 10). > Gender equality measures According to the project coordinator, the promotion of non-discrimination towards the elderly has been a central element of the project (although no concrete actions had been specified). Gender equality, however, was not an issue directly addressed by the project. The total number of participants in the events and activities of the project included 46 women and 21 men. Furthermore, during the implementation phase, the project team learnt that the temporarily hired interviewers were mainly women aged 50 or over, and in many cases long-term unemployed. Rather than being a result of an intentional recruiting strategy, the overrepresentation of women among the interviewers is likely a result of gender inequalities at home as well as in the labour market, which affect older women\u2019s choices and opportunities for employment such as this one.

        "Projects and organisations funded by the European Union Programme for Employment and Social Innovation (EaSI) 29 > Socioeconomic context Tackling long-term unemployment, promoting quality and sustainable employment, making work pay and addressing lifelong learning are some of the main policy challenges facing the EU societies. The possibilities for Member States\u2019 response to these challenges are further constrained by the need of consolidation of public finances and preparing for the impact of demographic ageing on social protection systems. Adequately responding to people\u2019s needs, while prioritising social investment dimension of social policies and identifying potentials to improve their cost-effectiveness were the issues this project reconciled. By producing evidence around the above-mentioned policy challenges, this project has contributed to the formulation of future reforms in Slovenia, thus pre-empting services and assistance from social protection schemes therein. > Aims of the project/ organisation The objective of the action was to rigorously evaluate key existing social protection policies and programmes in Slovenia, examine the effectiveness of recent reforms, and formulate guidelines for future reforms as part of evidence- based policy-making. The overall aim has been to increase the well-being of vulnerable groups, particularly young people, older workers, unemployed, long-term unemployed, and the low-skilled. > Project results, measured impacts, achievements, lessons learnt The project deliverables provided in-depth analysis of the policy effects on labour market transitions, wages and productivity, based on the estimation of econometric models and labour force statistics. In addition, the project offered a rich set of policy recommendations for Slovenia in relevant policy areas derived from a comprehensive review of international and Slovenian policies. The results of the action are documented in the following eight studies: > Impact Evaluation of key employment programmes in Slovenia 39 ; > Equity effects of the new law on labour relations in Slovenia 40 ; > Productivity effects of the new law on labour relations in Slovenia 41 ; > Social and economic effects of the minimum wage increase in Slovenia 42 ; > Activation policies in cash benefit programmes for the unemployed 43 ; > Making work pay in Slovenia 44 ; > Increasing employment of older workers in Slovenia 45 ; > Combating long-term unemployment in Slovenia 46 . The project team learnt that dissemination of research findings supporting evidence-based policy-making should put more emphasis on the use of research methods and the reasons for their selection. According to the project coordinator, policy-makers should get well acquainted with the used methodology to understand its limitations and avoid misinterpretation of findings. 39 http://www.mddsz.gov.si/fileadmin/mddsz.gov.si/pageuploads/dokumenti__pdf/zaposlovanje/Razvoj_strategij_reform_na_podrocju_socialnih_politik_v_ Sloveniji/WP_1_ALMPs.pdf 40 http://www.mddsz.gov.si/fileadmin/mddsz.gov.si/pageuploads/dokumenti__pdf/zaposlovanje/Razvoj_strategij_reform_na_podrocju_socialnih_politik_v_ Sloveniji/WP_2_Equity_and_Productivity_Effects_Part_I.pdf 41 http://www.mddsz.gov.si/fileadmin/mddsz.gov.si/pageuploads/dokumenti__pdf/zaposlovanje/Razvoj_strategij_reform_na_podrocju_socialnih_politik_v_ Sloveniji/WP_2_Equity_and_Productivity_Effects_Part_II.pdf 42 http://www.mddsz.gov.si/fileadmin/mddsz.gov.si/pageuploads/dokumenti__pdf/zaposlovanje/Razvoj_strategij_reform_na_podrocju_socialnih_politik_v_ Sloveniji/WP_3_Minimum_wage.pdf 43 http://www.mddsz.gov.si/fileadmin/mddsz.gov.si/pageuploads/dokumenti__pdf/zaposlovanje/Razvoj_strategij_reform_na_podrocju_socialnih_politik_v_ Sloveniji/Report_Activation_revised_nov_2016.pdf 44 http://www.mddsz.gov.si/fileadmin/mddsz.gov.si/pageuploads/dokumenti__pdf/zaposlovanje/Razvoj_strategij_reform_na_podrocju_socialnih_politik_v_ Sloveniji/Making_work_pay_in_SLO.pdf 45 http://www.mddsz.gov.si/fileadmin/mddsz.gov.si/pageuploads/dokumenti__pdf/zaposlovanje/Razvoj_strategij_reform_na_podrocju_socialnih_politik_v_ Sloveniji/Helping_older_workers_in_the_labour_market_Aug_2017.pdf 46 http://www.mddsz.gov.si/fileadmin/mddsz.gov.si/pageuploads/dokumenti__pdf/zaposlovanje/Razvoj_strategij_reform_na_podrocju_socialnih_politik_v_ Sloveniji/LTU_report_final__3_.pdf ",

        "Projects and organisations funded by the European Union Programme for Employment and Social Innovation (EaSI) 33 > Socioeconomic context This project addressed an urgent call for reform of social care services in Rome. Particularly, increases in demand and diversification of users\u2019 needs rendered the system obsolete and ineffective. Looking for innovative but also efficient services for vulnerable users had been a long-term challenge in Rome. While different reforms had been tested in recent years, they proved unsuccessful and an effective solution was not developed. Acting upon the Country Specific Recommendations and adopting the one-stop- shop approach, this project closed this gap by implementing an integrated system contributing to the local community\u2019s effective response to new social needs. > Aims of the project/ organisation The main objective of the project was the reform of social care services in Rome, by providing a single and integrated tool, with a special focus on meeting the diverse needs of fragile people. To effectively and individually manage all types of fragility, the project team promoted a system relying on the beneficiaries\u2019 resources and on proximity networks, thus having a positive impact on the promotion of social entrepreneurship in accordance with the reform of the third sector launched in the country. Another objective was to strengthen public-private partnerships and territorial synergies among public and private, professional and informal resources. The social innovation also has the potential to release further positive effects in terms of social valorisation of care, employment, development of social enterprises, as a further driving force for economic and social development in Rome. > Project results, measured impacts, achievements, Lessons learnt For mapping of innovative social services, the project team organised 15 focus groups with municipalities and conducted an online survey to which nearly 200 organisations working in the City area answered. Next, as part of a proposal of reusing and restoring abandoned urban spaces to host experimental services, the project produced Guidelines for Social Reuse of Public Spaces. Additionally, maps of disused buildings and an overall summary map were designed. In the next phase, INSPIRE realised systemic actions aimed at redefining how the services for fragile people are organised. These included: revision of the needs assessment model; review of administrative procedure for access criteria and service contributions; development of an Information System (SICS) consisting of three Applications for managing the network of proximity services by operators and beneficiaries of services based on a Social Network Architecture; and realisation of a shared and digital system for mapping and monitoring of fragile population. By the end of the project, there were 2,700 organisations providing social care services, 952 volunteering associations and 56 different services registered in the INSPIRE information system database. The experimentation of innovative services took place in five Roman municipalities (V, VII, IX, XII, XIV). It enabled the local health and social services to reach out to over 300 beneficiaries, to give 179 people characterised by social fragility access to the services and to assess the impact of the experimental services on 162 people through a counterfactual approach. Results have shown a significant improvement in the experimentation group. For instance, relatives of the services\u2019 beneficiaries, who otherwise provide the bulk of informal care, reported improvement in reconciliation of caring and social activities. In addition, there was a decline in the number of the hospitalisations and an increase in persons capable to dress themselves improving the autonomy and social welfare indicator. The project team also contributed to the organisation of 41 extracurricular internships with 15 hosting institutions to foster the beneficiaries\u2019 social inclusion. Finally, an international workshop on the exchange of good practices was organised on 16 June 2017 in Rome which was attended by 120 people, while 210 people attended the final INSPIRE Conference 48 on 13 December 2017 in Rome. 48 https://www.comune.roma.it/resources/cms/documents/Programma_finale_13_dicembre_INSPIRE.pdf ",
        "Projects and organisations funded by the European Union Programme for Employment and Social Innovation (EaSI) 34 > Identification of potential good practices From its start in September 2015, INSPIRE adopted a working method based on a sharing system between the project\u2019s working group and Roma Capitale\u2019s internal staff (departments, municipalities, districts and ASL departments) that promoted a constant transfer of skills, processes, and tested tools to ensure continuity and sustainability of the results. INSPIRE also can be considered as a laboratory for testing a new model of local welfare governance, which was realised in a partnership between public and private institutions, profit and no profit organisations, that cooperated to create a new model for designing and delivering services. The project demonstrated that a reform targeting a number of relevant institutions and organisations at multiple levels of governance is likely to produce systematic and coordinated planning and action, and hence sustainable results. > Transferability element(s) of the project/activities The SICS database (if properly tailored) can be used to manage other kinds of networks and micro-networks. > Innovativeness of the project/activities Given the nature of the project, several of its components could be considered novel. Some of those that stood out involve, for example, the proposal of long-term and temporary reusing and restoring of abandoned urban spaces to host experimental social care services. To meet the needs of fragile people, the Inspire also tested innovative service interventions to counter social exclusion based on the personalisation of services and the collective intervention model. Concretely, three kinds of experimental services were tested: social condominiums, tutoring and socio- occupational workshops. Under the social condominium experimental service, a worker takes care of more than one beneficiary living in close proximity of each other, supporting them in leading a self-sufficient life through the activation of solidarity networks (including associations, neighbours, shop-keepers, apartment block administrator, parish or youth groups volunteers) that act as social sentinels. The tutoring service was designed as a support programme for fragile persons to acquire information, interpersonal and social skills. Socio-occupational workshops were designed as a collective service that offers fragile subjects, particularly disabled and mentally impaired adults, a path of \u2018social rehabilitation\u2019 based on the integration between occupational activities and activities that support the person\u2019s social abilities. > Policy evidence generated by the project Relevant policy analyses and possible effects of the large- scale adoption of collective have been identified and described in more than 40 reports. These include: > Report on the mapping of innovative services in the territory of Roma Capitale; > Guidelines for the reuse of abandoned buildings for social purposes; > Review of access procedures and definition of contribution criteria to service costs; > The fragile population in Rome Capital: summary data; > Report on Procedures for access to the Social Services of the Municipality of Rome; > Report on Taxonomy of Services; > Report on Best practices; > Report on Social Networks Volunteer Associations; > The impact assessment of the INSPIRE project with the counterfactual method; > Evaluation of the efficiency of experimental services. You can access a report (in English) describing project activities and results 49 and a summary 50 . > Transnational dimension and European added value The contribution of EU funding was essential for the development of the project, as it allowed the partners to mobilise human resources from nine different organisations to work together with dozens of more stakeholders for two years. The project has provided a policy innovation proposal relevant to mutual learning and allowed the stakeholders to exchange good practices during the international workshop. 49 https://www.comune.roma.it/resources/cms/documents/A5_Report_finale_ENG_def.pdf 50 https://www.comune.roma.it/resources/cms/documents/INSPIRE_Project_Experimentation_EN.pdf ",
        "Projects and organisations funded by the European Union Programme for Employment and Social Innovation (EaSI) 35 > New partnerships created INSPIRE was implemented by nine partners in the consortium of a variety of actors, including a municipality institution, both public and private research and consulting organisations and third sector organisations operating in the field of social services. From its start in September 2015, INSPIRE adopted a working method based on a sharing system between the project\u2019s working group and Roma Capitale\u2019s internal staff (departments, municipalities, districts and ASL departments) that promoted a constant transfer of skills, processes, and tested tools to ensure continuity and sustainability of the results. Moreover, with its focus on the development of local partnerships, the project altogether involved 90 operators, including municipalities, Local Health Districts and third sector partners with approximately 700 stakeholders in the implementation of the project. The team used, for example, focus groups, scouting of relevant institutions and organisations, meetings to develop a supportive network of the project and establish stable collaborations. Finally, as another key element experimented by INSPIRE was the activation of local networks, it can be assumed that more partnerships at micro-level were established. > Dissemination strategy INSPIRE defined a communication plan addressing different targets, specifying methods and instruments that allow to adequately reach them with correct information in each project phase. The working group elaborated and disseminated information about the project through brochures and leaflets, info-graphics, newsletters, e-book, presentation clip 51 , social networks 52 , mailing list directory, posters, photographic material and multimedia. A webpage was set up into the institutional Roma Capitale website 53 . > Sustainability measures As mentioned above, the project team invested significant efforts in building the policy innovation on multilevel governance and established partnerships involving a number of actors. Prioritising activation of local networks, strengthening neighbourly relations and citizens\u2019 participation is likely to make the innovation steady and sustainable. > Gender equality measures While formulating interventions in social care services has strong gendered implications, information about specific gender equality measures applied to the project is not available. This casts doubt on whether different life situations, needs and concerns of women and men were taken into consideration, and whether the project actively contributed to dismantling gender-based inequalities and discrimination. 3.1.c. Promoting the contribution of private savings to pension adequacy Below the report describes a project funded in the area of social security, particularly focusing on pensions and retirement. As Europe\u2019s population structure is experiencing rapid change and the number of people going into retirement continues to rise, pensions are putting increased pressure on national budgets. Consequently, an EaSI call for proposals 54 was launched intending to finance projects related to cross-border co- operation of pension and financial service-providers as well as relevant stakeholders. The following types of activities were funded: > conferences and seminars; > training activities; > awareness and dissemination actions; > actions aiming at the creation and improving of networks, exchanges of good practices; > studies, analyses, mapping projects; > research activities. The project was expected to facilitate cross-border co- operation regarding pensions as well as address and improve the quality of supplementary pension schemes and their contribution to secure income in retirement. 51 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLvrsi3Dt70 52 https://www.facebook.com/InspireRoma/ 53 https://www.comune.roma.it/pcr/it/dip_pr_srv_soc_sal_enspire.page 54 Call for proposals VP/2014/014: Promoting the contribution of private savings to pension adequacy.

        "Projects and organisations funded by the European Union Programme for Employment and Social Innovation (EaSI) 37 > Socioeconomic context In the context of demographic change and its influence over fiscal sustainability of public pensions systems, policy reforms and incentives have been introduced across the EU to promote complementing the old-age income with additional sources, such as voluntary pensions and private homeownership. This project addresses the challenge of promoting the contribution of private savings to achieve pension adequacy by integrating residential property with private pensions in the EU. Building on the findings of the European Commission 2008 study of Equity Release Schemes in the EU, it considers asset conversion linked to household residential property. By exploring the role that housing can play to sustain living standards and supplement incomes in retirement, it has relevance and implications to social policy issues such as low-income retirement, social exclusion, gender disparities and long-term care. > Aims of the project/ organisation The aim of this project was to reconcile the objectives of housing provision with retirement income by looking at asset conversion linked to household residential property, such as equity release schemes (ERS), in a context of ageing and housing wealth divergences in the EU. The Action sought to meet the following goals: (1) assess the potential for integration of property assets with retirement income provision in selected EU Member States; (2) investigate the enablers and challenges that such integration may involve (e.g. economic, legal, social, from consumer side, provider side, policy-making side); (3) form a network of experts and institutions from the public, private and non-governmental sectors; (4) develop and document a conceptual framework and outline policy recommendations. > Project results, measured impacts, achievements, lessons learnt The new policy evidence and innovative product models are introduced in the final report of the project 55 . Other written outputs 56 have been produced, including four reports per Member State summarising the findings of the stakeholder event and focus groups with consumers in each participating country, four academic papers, one conference report and one book publication (see references below. A final international conference and 18 stakeholder meetings at the national level, as well as 37 semi-structured interviews, were held throughout 2016 and 2017. These events concentrated on exchanging and collecting views from suppliers, regulators and intermediary organisations like home associations and consumer protection associations in each of the six countries. In addition, also in each of the six countries, three separate focus group interviews were held with ordinary homeowners and pensioners to gain information about their preferences, needs, and attitudes as to ERS products and their alternatives. Finally, for each country a stakeholder dissemination event and in some such as Germany an information event was organised to raise awareness in regard to ERS products. Leaflets in the respective national language have also been published comprising the main results of the project tailored to the respective national target audience. Outputs include a website 57 with information on ERS, leaflets and a basic information quiz. Also, a database of national ERS stakeholders with interest in the subject in the six Member States was built up during the project. The impacts have both hard and soft dimensions, all of which have public value: (1) an expanded and deeper knowledge base and expertise as evidenced by a published report, academic journal articles, book, press contributions and conference presentations; (2) a network of stakeholders crossing public, private and third sector organisations covering the six countries represented in this study; (3) a cohort of researchers with greater capacity to contribute academically, professionally and politically to improving the retirement income provision of an aging population across the EU; (4) examples of social innovation on a pan European basis that could be used and tailored by subsequent domestic and European socio-economic initiatives; (5) a contribution to education through the development of materials to improve financial literacy and advocacy. 55 https://www.equity-release.eu/final-project-report/ 56 https://www.equity-release.eu/publications/ 57 https://www.equity-release.eu/ ",

Personal contacts are key for successful implementation, partner meetings early on are crucial. > Transferability element(s) of the project/activities New policy evidence and innovative product models, as well as recommendations, have been produced by the project team. These outputs are relevant to a wide variety of stakeholders across the EU. Special care was taken to ensure the proposals are transferable to other Member States and feed into policy-making at EU level. > Innovativeness of the project/activities The activities of the project included exploration of product market solution pathways by focusing on developing viable, sustainable, trustworthy, innovative solutions. With a goal to design tools for EU-wide use, the product solution pathways focused on elaborating variations of ERS as they are currently provided today as well as alternative uses of residential property for retirement incomes such as tenancy-based solutions.

        "Projects and organisations funded by the European Union Programme for Employment and Social Innovation (EaSI) 39 > Transnational dimension The activity of comparing market conditions and policy measures across countries mitigated the risk of proposing solutions that fit only to few Member States. The project results contribute to free movement of persons as they foster harmonisation of pension systems. Moreover, the action contained cross-country mutual learning activities involving feedback loops (e.g. via stakeholder forums). Through the early involvement of international stakeholders, the project raised awareness of equity release in countries where they had been virtually unknown and have spurred consumer protectionists to take up the issue. Cross- country comparisons and academic co-operation have also helped to create transnational platforms for further work. > European added value The European dimension of the action was key for the exchange of lessons learnt between the more and less developed ERS market countries and could not have taken place without EU support. The support was crucial to explore alternative sources of retirement income such as asset-based solutions at a visible level to generate proposals and relevant debates. Through a multi-country comparison, the exchange of national experiences facilitated concentration on key issues helping minimise research efforts and consequently costs. EU funds were used to lever additional financial support from national sources and will lead to follow-up projects. The action has especially enabled networking among the national stakeholders and has contributed to some EU level networking, such as among the existing ERS providers. > New partnerships created The Action relied primarily on research work and stakeholder outreach. Scientific and practitioner networks and partnerships, beyond the project working group, have been created and will be maintained and involved in annual conferences and follow-up meetings. On the side of stakeholders, support and involvement was received primarily by a broad range of interest groups and trade associations from the six Member States and the European Pensions and Property Asset Release Group at EU level. The project coordinator believes that these new partnerships laid down strong foundations for future engagement with the subject. > Dissemination strategy Actions were disseminated through the EU multilingual digital platform, in form of a website for consumers, researchers, policy-makers and the wider public interested in ERS. The website contains an online quiz, basic information and research outputs of the project. Research outputs and events\u2019 invitations were also shared electronically with a wide range of stakeholders, including national and local authorities, NGOs, research institutes, financial institutions and the media. In addition, 18 focus groups were held in six countries where a dedicated part consisted of informing participants on ERS schemes. Finally, a number of events supporting networking and co-operation meetings were organised: 18 meetings with stakeholders, 37 semi-structured interviews, 6 stakeholder events and the final conference. Finally, the project team members participated in a hearing of the German parliament. > Sustainability measures The partners will continue their dialogue beyond the project through scientific conferences (Institut fur Finanzdienstleistung\u2019s conference 2018, presentation of results at Marburg 2018) and follow-up meetings. National follow-up projects will complement the project, such as the creation of additional multimedia information for German consumers and a hand-out for consumer protectionists consulting on equity release schemes. The partners aim at extending activities through additional funding e.g. by EU- stakeholder associations. > Gender equality measures According to the project coordinator, the research has attempted to reflect the gender dimension in the project. It acknowledged the significant gender gap in private pensions, women\u2019s greater likelihood to be excluded from homeownership, women\u2019s longer life expectancy than men\u2019s and on average worse impact of marriage breakdown on women compared to men. For these reasons, the project team assumes that the proposed solutions will largely benefit female households. This is because they can be potentially supported by the crucial availability of safe ERS offerings, information and regulatory safeguards. Also, consumers in six Member States were heavily involved in the action through the empirical research parts. Particular care was taken to ensure the composition of these 18 groups of consumers had a gender-balanced participation and that lower-income, vulnerable households were included. 65 https://www.equity-release.eu/quiz-1/ ",

        "Projects and organisations funded by the European Union Programme for Employment and Social Innovation (EaSI) 43 > Socioeconomic context Posting of workers is an important aspect of the cross-border provision of services, which allows an employee to be sent by their employer to carry out services in another Member State for a temporary period. However, the rapid growth of intra-EU mobility gave way to challenges in guaranteeing rights and working conditions of posted workers, enshrined in the Directive 96/71/EC concerning the posting of workers 72 . A lack of administrative co-operation among Member States and a scarce access to information on terms and conditions of employment have been some of the main challenges to the right application, implementation, and enforcement of the EU legislation. This project responds to these issues by promoting transnational co- operation among stakeholders and accessibility of the information to which posted workers and undertaking can turn to. Bringing changes in these areas is crucial to ensure protection and decent work of posted workers. > Aims of the project/ organisation The main objectives of this project were: 1) to improve transnational administrative co-operation between national competent bodies and social partners involved in the monitoring and correct application of the Directive 96/71/ EC 73 and the Enforcement Directive 2014/67/EU 74 concerning the posting of workers in the framework of the transnational provision of services; 2) to increase mutual trust among stakeholders, including promoting exchanges of relevant officials and training, as well as developing, facilitating and promoting best practice initiatives in the area of posting of workers in the framework of temporary provision of services; 3) to increase the accessibility and transparency of the information concerning the terms and conditions of employment; and 4) to promote measures for exchange of general and sector-specific information and best practices. > Project results, measured impacts, achievements, lessons learnt In order to promote administrative co-operation and mutual understanding on the implementation, application and enforcement of EU legislation on posting of workers, the project team organised several events bringing together a variety of stakeholders. Four conferences took place and one roundtable discussion took place in Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia, and Poland. These events provided space to trade unions, representatives of employers\u2019 organisations, national labour inspectorates, NGOs and EU institutions to discuss a number of topics, such as working conditions of posted workers, gaps in the legal protection of posted workers, obstacles to collaboration and practical implementation of the EU policy on mobility of workers. As a follow-up, the project partners identified the persistent gaps in transnational administrative co-operation between national bodies and social partners and developed a communication plan to enhance enforcement of EU legislation, including effective use of IMI system, related to posting of workers. In addition, 48 joint sessions of training for labour inspectorate officials, employers, trade union members, and workers were organised at the national level to increase mutual trust among stakeholders, promote best practices and clarify participants\u2019 questions regarding the application of regulations. To further increase the accessibility and transparency of the information concerning the terms and conditions of employment, 19 specialists in all participating countries provided more than 1,000 phone or face to face to workers or employers regarding cases of posting. Workers and employers were also reached out to by awareness-raising campaign in 40 undertakings in transport and construction sector where posting has become an increasingly important feature of employment. Main deliverables of the project also included pocketbooks and leaflets on different practices and terms and conditions of workers\u2019 posting, which were distributed to participants of these project activities. > Policy evidence generated by the project The project team conducted a diagnosis of transnational co-operation among stakeholders on posting of workers and communication effectiveness between competent state institutions and other relevant stakeholders.

        "Projects and organisations funded by the European Union Programme for Employment and Social Innovation (EaSI) 44 attention was given to the assessment of the effectiveness and relevance of the IMI system, detecting and assessing administrative burdens and identifying opportunities for improvement. Upon this analysis, the project partners formulated recommendations for improvement of Internal Market Information (IMI) System and identified opportunities for development, which were altogether put forward in the communication plan for stakeholders on enforcement of EU legislation on posting of workers. Furthermore, a sociological study, using survey for data collection, was conducted to assess the impact of the project\u2019s awareness- raising activities on posting undertakings and workers\u2019 understanding of the terms and conditions of posting. The study has shown that there is a general will among stakeholders to collaborate to eliminate fraudulent practices related to the posting of workers. Another concrete finding suggests that face to face consultations are the best way to ensure the transparency of the information and providing greater clarity. Lastly, more complete information and advice is needed concerning working time, health and safety rules, the holiday entitlement, pay rates, occupational diseases. > Identification of potential good practices Some of the project activities clearly focused on targeting the direct beneficiaries of the action. Understanding the challenges of reaching out to posted workers, the project team relied on the combination of providing information to a general audience as well as to workers in sectors where posting is often used and misused.

        "Projects and organisations funded by the European Union Programme for Employment and Social Innovation (EaSI) 45 > Transferability element(s) of the project/activities Holding international events, training and creating strategies with practical recommendations offer a platform to share good practices and generate new ideas to secure decent work of posted workers in the EU. The main transferable element of the project is, therefore, the scope of exchanged experience throughout the project. Furthermore, other project activities such as a diagnosis of transnational co-operation between competent state institutions that led to the formulation of concrete recommendations and communication plan for enforcement of the EU legislation on posting of workers can be equally useful to adopt by other cross-border partnerships. > Transnational dimension The transnational discussion of a number of stakeholders generated new ideas and suggestions on how to improve the situation of posted workers and how to effectively enforce the existing law. A particular attention was also given to sharing experiences, identifying challenges and possibilities of improvement for the use of IMI among the competent authorities of participating countries. The project results remain highly relevant for policy-making at both national and EU level. > European added value Building on previous actions, this project contributed to setting up cross-border as well as national networks working towards enforcement of EU legislation on posting of workers in the Baltic states and Poland. Bilateral and multilateral agreements have been established between labour inspectorates of participating countries. A further exchange between the authorities takes place through IMI, annual meetings and personal communication between officials. Other relevant stakeholders participate in exchanging information, best practices and consulting on common national positions/strategies. Transnational co- operation among stakeholders in these countries, which was significantly enhanced by EU funding, is a crucial step forward towards ensuring protection and decent work of posted workers in the EU. > Dissemination strategy To disseminate information to posted workers and relevant stakeholders, the project team used a variety of tools and communication channels, tailored to the target audience. Several articles have been published in national media outlets to increase awareness on the issue in the public. To illustrate, the information about the establishment of the information centre for posted and migrant workers on the Lithuanian - Polish border was widely spread through mass media. The leaflets, pocketbooks, and reports were shared with trade union members, labour inspectorate representatives, employers, NGOs and other relevant stakeholders at the roundtable discussion, conferences, consultations and training and seminar sessions. Awareness-raising campaigns among undertakings of transport and construction were selected as a means to reach out to workers and employers. Lithuanian, Latvian, Estonian and Polish labour inspectorates shared insights, outcomes, recommendations of the project with an international network of labour inspectorates via web communication. Information about the project, results, and deliverables was published on partners\u2019 websites. > Sustainability measures This action was a fitting follow-up of previous EaSI- funded projects (concretely of projects VS/2014/0011 and VS/2015/0055) that laid down first grounds for emerging transnational as well as national partnerships between stakeholders relevant to solving the weak enforcement of legislation on posting of workers. Building on this previous experience, the activities of this project aimed to make the co-operation even more effective and sustainable. For this purpose, the project team not only organised a number of events and joint activities but also initiated an assessment of transnational co-operation among stakeholders on posting of workers and communication effectiveness between competent state institutions and other relevant stakeholders. The end result is a communication plan for effective and sustainable cross-border communication system for sharing information and consultations on posting of workers, which lays down concrete objectives and actions until 2020. > Gender equality measures Information on the use of gender equality measures in the technical implementation of the project and on the integration of a gender perspective in the project content is not available. This casts doubt whether different life situations, needs and concerns of women and men were taken into consideration and whether the project actively contributed to combating gender-based inequalities and discrimination.

        "Projects and organisations funded by the European Union Programme for Employment and Social Innovation (EaSI) 47 > Socioeconomic context While posted workers play an important role in the internal market, specifically in the cross-border provision of services, their working conditions and labour rights have been poorly enforced across the EU. Social dumping \u2013 commonly referred to as an alleged unfair and uncompetitive advantage gained due to the differences present in social protection models, regulations and conditions between sectors or countries \u2013 continues to be a problem. As it stands, the number of posted workers remains to be on the rise along with problems such as unequal remuneration and unfair practices despite the EU\u2019s legislation on posting of workers 75 . Particularly, a lack of co-operation between national administrations, lack of and difficulty in accessing information on the rights of posted workers impede proper implementation of the relevant directives. This project addresses these challenges that are crucial to ensure protection and decent work of posted workers. > Aims of the project/ organisation The project was built in continuity with three previous projects (starting in 2011) led by Institut National du Travail, de l\u2019Emploi et de la Formation Professionnelle (INTEFP) in France, with the support of the French organisation Association Travail, Emploi, Europe, Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 (ASTREES) and eminent researchers in the field. Like the previous projects, this action aimed to contribute to a better implementation of Directive 96/71/EC 76 on posted workers by improving transnational administrative co-operation and collaboration between stakeholders of posting operations, in particular, social partners. The objectives of the project included improvement in the operational capacity of public authorities to implement effective administrative co-operation; shared knowledge on the developments and evolutions resulting of the Directive 2014/67/EU 77 , and enhanced understanding of the economic and social determinants in the sectors of agriculture, construction and temporary work. > Project results, measured impacts, achievements, lessons learnt The report titled \u2018Enhancing administrative co-operation through coordinated transnational actions\u2019 produced in co- operation between ASTREES and INTEFP, is the main outcome of the project. Further results include the realisation of transnational operations based on real situations or cases from the field, mutual enhancement of the operations in each of the countries concerned, and an improved understanding of tools, methods and means of intervention. Moreover, the project resulted in participants\u2019 improved capacity to act transnationally, better identification of difficulties in the implementation of transnational co-operation, as well as new co-operation perspectives and agreements. Lastly, several working seminars were held to address the various aspects concerning labour mobility and the participating parties. > Transferability element of the project The transferability was at the heart of the project since its backbone was to exchange best practices and innovative approaches in regard to problem-solving when dealing with posted workers in partner countries. A similar approach of sharing successful approaches in one country and adjusting them to the circumstances of other countries could be applied when involving more representatives from different sectors or opening dialogue and co-operation between different stakeholders within the country and the EU. > Policy evidence generated by the project The detailed report \u2018Enhancing administrative co-operation through coordinated transnational actions\u2019 consists of insights on 1) the European and national legal frameworks (including amendments); 2) the organisations, rationale for action, methods, legal tools, practices of public authorities and social partners in the various countries; and 3) the transnational organisations of production underlying the postings and the impact on the situation of workers and companies.

Outcomes of the report have been relayed to respective representatives of Member States (managers, liaison office and control agents) and the EU institutions, European social partner federations and national social partners who participated in the working seminars, researchers. In addition, the report was presented to the Project Steering Committee during a meeting on 8 February 2018. Lastly, 1,000 copies of information brochures were printed and distributed during various seminars across the participating countries. > European added value The main value added of by the project is improved cross- country co-operation in regard to problems that arise from posting of workers among different stakeholders. EU funding contributed to creating new and strengthening existing networks between international partners who work with posted workers. In addition, the project also provided them with an opportunity to participate in international and national workshops and the conference and thus ensure that Directives 96/71/EC and 2014/67/EU are correctly and effectively applied in the partner countries. > Sustainability measures The participants of the project expressed their general satisfaction with the project, affirmed that it was beneficial, and urged for its continuation.

        "Projects and organisations funded by the European Union Programme for Employment and Social Innovation (EaSI) 50 > Socioeconomic context Posting of workers is a fundamental element of the internal market. Although it can still be considered a phenomenon limited in size, the number of postings within the EU is reported to grow year by year, reaching about 1.5 million in 2015. Despite these developments, serious concerns have been raised about the misuse of posting, particularly for the purposes of unduly applying low social security contribution rates by formally establishing a company in a country without performing a substantial activity there (so-called \u2018letterbox companies\u2019) and paying wages below the standards set in the host country. The European provisions already include a set of rules to prevent these frauds (mainly through Directive 96/71/EC 79 and Regulation (EC) No 883/2004). Nevertheless, problems in terms of cross-border access to information weaken the ability of relevant authorities and stakeholders to monitor and sanction frauds, while law-abiding employers may find procedures and files required by foreign authorities in case of posting burdensome. > Aims of the project/organisation The Post-Lab project fostered administrative co-operation between inspection authorities and social partners in the field of the posting of workers in the construction sector. In particular, the project identified (1) how co-operation between inspection authorities and social partners can produce relevant data and information, and; (2) how relevant data and information can be properly registered and shared at national and transnational level, with a view to reducing the administrative burden on employers while easing the protection of workers\u2019 rights. It also promoted a wider reflection on how existing measures involving social partners can support the proper application of rules concerning posting of workers. > Project results, measured impacts, achievements, lessons learnt Post-Lab activities ran from December 2015 until January 2018. First, preliminary analysis identifying and describing the features of administrative co-operation or anti-fraudulent measures (by means of desk research and interviews) was carried out. Second, \u2018Co-operation Labs\u2019 were organised as workshops attended by key stakeholders and experts who discussed the same measures. The final phase was dedicated to a concluding analysis. Throughout these stages, Post-Lab assessed a set of measures, most of which involved social partners, in all the participating countries. These involved, for instance, transnational bilateral agreements between Italy, Austria, Germany, and France; National Agreement to Fight Social Dumping in the Construction Sector in France; and the Revisal system in Romania. The results of the preliminary analysis and of the Co-operation Labs and further inputs sent by partners through an ad-hoc and additional questionnaire were used for drafting the Guidelines 80 and the Final Report 81 , which are the main deliverables of this project. The Guidelines provided a thorough presentation and assessment of each selected practice, outlining its strengths and weaknesses. Moreover, it suggested pathways for improvement of administrative co-operation at a national or transnational level in the field of the posting of workers. The Final Report provided a clear analysis of the role social partners have in relation to the Posted Workers Directive. Moreover, it assessed social partners\u2019 co-operation activities with inspection bodies and summarised the features of the assessed measures and the methodology adopted by the project team, including the Co-operation Labs. Final remarks addressed the role social partners can play in the field of posting of workers, as inspiration for similar initiatives. In a view to properly address also the direct beneficiaries (i.e. posted workers and employers) the project developed brochures 82 presenting the European rules applying to posting, links to contact points and other detailed information. Publications produced under this project are available also in French, Italian, Romanian and Spanish, accessible using this link 83 . > Dissemination strategy The activities were supported by 1) brochures targeted at employers and workers, and providing relevant information on provisions concerning posting, as well as contact points; 2) press articles; and 3) posts in social networks (LinkedIn and Twitter), as well as newsletters targeting a selected audience.

The main dissemination event was the final conference, which took place in Rome in December 2017, and involved an audience of more than 200 stakeholders from all over Italy and abroad. In addition, the Guidelines have also been distributed at the Eurodetachement 85 Final Conference, which took place in Brussels in February 2018 and sent to the library of Eurofound 86 (EU Agency for the improvement of living and working conditions) in Dublin, where they can be freely consulted. The main findings of the project have also been briefly presented during meetings of Fondazione Giacomo Brodolini and Notus staff with the Eurofound representatives, addressing job creation in Europe and fraudulent forms of contracting work. > Transferability element(s) of the project/activities The final report provides information on the Post-Lab process and information about the role social partners can play in the field of posting of workers, with a view to supporting and inspiring the take-up of similar initiatives by competent organisations. > Transnational dimension Aspects concerning transnational co-operation and information sharing were key in most of the practices assessed by Post-Lab. In addition, some project activities such as the Co-operation Labs were organised with a view to promoting mutual learning, exploring the opportunity to put in place multilateral transnational methods of information sharing and simplifying the information flow at national and transnational level. The project stressed information sharing at transnational level shall be eased in order to provide quick access to key information in case of inspection, as well as in order to help companies to easily comply with the submission of information required by host country authorities in case of posting. > New partnerships created The project partnership, led by the Italian paritarian body coordinating sectoral funds in the construction sector (CNCE), included research centres with expertise in employment and social issues in Italy (FGB) and Spain (Notus), as well as the association Latina in Romania, which provides administrative assistance to cross-border citizens and enterprises. In addition, research activities in France were implemented by IRShare, a research and training centre on employment and industrial relations issues, as a contractor. The partnership continues to work on follow-up projects, namely the EU Post Lab project, which stems from the findings of Post-Lab. Moreover, the interviews, workshops and a conference organised during the project provided for further networking and co-operation opportunities. > European added value EU funding supported thorough assessment and comparison of selected practices, which highlighted there is room for fine- tuning the existing administrative co-operation measures both at national, transnational and EU level, with a view to easing compliance with rules on the posting of workers. Yet, administrative co-operation alone is not sufficient to tackle fraud, as there can be flaws in the available information; moreover, relevant facts and circumstances may be unknown even to the smartest databases. For this reason, following the findings of Post-Lab, the partnership currently implements another project, called the EU Post Lab. The EU Post Lab project, which is due to end in September 2018, will deliver, among other things, a final report on how national-level data and inspections fare in relation to the detection of any abuse and circumvention of Directive 96/71/EC 87 , as well as a set of recommendations on how to build and implement a database for the purpose of sharing key data at transnational level. > Sustainability measures As illustrated, the project results directly feed into policy-making and serve as the basis for further action.

        "Projects and organisations funded by the European Union Programme for Employment and Social Innovation (EaSI) 53 > Socioeconomic context The implementation of the EU legislation on Posting of Workers has a number of loopholes. Insufficient access of workers and companies to information or its poor quality, combined with a lack of administrative co-operation between national authorities represent some of the major weaknesses in this regard. These issues have opened doors to an overall spread of fraudulent practices in posting and social dumping. To combat these hurdles, this action implements activities to promote co-operation between authorities and to strengthen their capacities for monitoring of posted workers\u2019 agreements. In addition, the project partners put a strong focus on enforcement of posted workers rights\u2019 and fair working conditions. Co-applicants from Poland and Lithuania cooperated with four associated partners from Slovakia, Romania, Spain and Norway to implement the action in the respective countries. > Aims of the project/ organisation The project aimed to enhance co-operation between responsible administrations and strengthen their capacities for monitoring of posted workers\u2019 agreements to enforce workers\u2019 rights and promote best practices in posting. The specific objectives of the project were the following: 1) to improve transnational administrative co-operation between national competent bodies and social partners involved in the monitoring and correct application of the Directive 96/71/ EC 88 concerning the posting of workers in the framework of the provision of services; 2) to increase mutual trust among stakeholders, including promoting exchanges of relevant officials and training; 3) to develop and promote best practice initiatives in the area of posting of workers in the framework of temporary provision of services via joint inspection visits, international training and international conference; 4) to provide better information for posted workers and multinational companies regarding terms and conditions for posted workers in the EU via launching a web-based information centre; and 5) to provide recommendations for the decision-making bodies at national and European levels to improve the general rules for posting of workers. > Project results, measured impacts, achievements, Lessons learnt Four training meetings on the implementation and management of the EU directive on Posted Workers were organised in Warsaw, Vilnius, Bratislava and Oslo and two in Madrid. Bringing together mostly representatives of employers\u2019 associations, trade unions and labour inspection, the meetings served as platforms to exchange knowledge on and identify gaps in the Directive\u2019s implementation. The participants also discussed the possibilities for improving and enhancing cross-border collaboration. In addition, one international seminar was organised in Brussels focusing specifically on the state of art and future actions at EU level. Stakeholders\u2019 databases, created by each of the project partners, facilitated the identification of potential participants in these meetings as well as additional ad hoc lobby meetings. These ad hoc lobby meetings were held with relevant actors to raise the profile of the issue and to map gaps and trends. The promotional campaign 89 was an important key element of the action, producing a promotional spot presenting the positive aspects of workers\u2019 posting was in English and Polish, available on Youtube. The project team also created a leaflet, presenting the spot and information on the project. Moreover, an online platform 90 , with basic information concerning posting of workers was developed. The final conference in Warsaw attended by the director of the European Trade Union Institute (ETUI), gathered over 50 representatives coming from Poland, Spain, Romania, Lithuania and Norway. The conference highlighted the importance of joint action plans and joint measures/ provisions related to posting of workers. > Policy evidence generated by the project The main conclusions and recommendations are formulated in the final project report.

The training sessions, the project events, the campaigning and the preparation of final deliverables mobilised stakeholders at both national and EU level. Moreover, comparisons among national practices, methods and tools, to enhance co- operation among the Member States have been undertaken throughout the project to formulate the final conclusions and recommendations, which in turn feed into national and EU governance. > New partnerships created The project\u2019s implementation would not be possible without a partnership between trade unions and workers\u2019 advocacy organisations from Poland, Lithuania, Norway, Slovakia, Spain and Romania. It is likely that project events and training provided opportunities to develop partnerships that would proactively act on poor enforcement of posted workers\u2019 rights also with other stakeholders such as national labour inspectorates and employer\u2019s organisations. > Dissemination strategy The project team used mainly the project website, social media and project events as platforms to disseminate project findings and outputs. In addition, the partner organisations undertook lobbying actions in each country. They worked towards persuading trade union members to include the topic of workers\u2019 posting in their regular agenda. Finally, the campaign combined awareness material published on the website with a toolbox of promo items, gadgets and posters distributed at events and video material shared on YouTube, social media and streamed at social partners\u2019 events. > Gender equality measures The project took special care in order to ensure equality and anti-discrimination. According to the project coordinator, criteria for selecting participants into project events were merit-based and considered the potential of the selectees to disseminate knowledge to others. The event dates were discussed with participants beforehand so as to accommodate as many participants as possible. No other proactive gender equality measures to ensure gender balance in events were applied. In all eight project events over one-third of the participants were female.

(NYGIP). The Bulgarian Plan reflects all key efforts for achieving results in the work with young people \u2013 it contains measures and initiatives to activate and outreach young people as well as for their successful employability. The National Youth Guarantee of Bulgaria also extends to young people aged under 29 . Hence the National Youth Guarantee of Bulgaria provides that every young person aged 15-29 (inclusive) should receive a good-quality job offer, and an opportunity to continue his/her education, apprenticeship or internship within four months after becoming unemployed or after leaving the formal education system. To implement this commitment, this project supported a widespread information campaign to raise awareness and disseminate information on employment and training opportunities for young people, including those who are not in employment, education or training (NEETs). > Aims of the project/ organisation The main objective of the project was to promote the Bulgarian Youth Guarantee Implementation Plan 2014 - 2020 by raising awareness about the practical opportunities for young people. The specific objectives of the project included: > Raising awareness among young people, including those who are not in employment, education or training (NEETs) to engage them in the activities developed in the Bulgarian Youth Guarantee Implementation Plan 2014-2020; > Encouraging state institutions, social partners, education and training institution, youth organisations, regional and local administrations to reinforce their contribution to the implementation of the Bulgarian Youth Guarantee Implementation Plan 2014-2020; > Enhancing administrative capacity of youth mediators appointed in municipalities with a high number of NEETs. > Project results, measured impacts, achievements, Lessons learnt The project execution contributed to awareness raising about the Bulgarian Youth Guarantee through: > development of an online portal 94 ; > Publication of a booklet (available in 2,000 copies and online) and 5 short films highlighting the success stories of young persons who have benefited from the Bulgarian Youth Guarantee; > Publication of 10,000 copies of informational leaflets and 250 posters that were disseminated among young people (including NEETs) during the information days and workshops and delivered to youth mediators as an information tool for their day-to-day work; > Production of 600 advertising packages (including a notebook, a pen, a folder, a keychain and a document bag) and 2,000 advertising kits (each consisting of a T-shirt and a bag) that were disseminated during the information days, workshops and the conference and provided to youth mediators as an information tool for their work; > Creation of the Guide for the outreach and activation of young people, neither in education, nor in employment or training 95 (published in 300 paper copies and available using this link. Approximately 889 participants attended 6 information days, 2 workshops held at the local level and a conference with international attendance. The events brought together participants of a diverse background, including young people, youth mediators, local employers, representatives of universities, schools and training institutions, representatives of regional and local governments, representatives of ministries, social partners, the European Commission and other EU countries with relevant experience. The administrative capacity of youth mediators was improved mainly through their participation in workshops and by providing them with specific instruments (the Guide for the outreach and activation of young people and information materials) useful for their everyday work. According to the project coordinator, the project enhanced awareness of the Bulgarian Youth Guarantee Implementation ",
        "Projects and organisations funded by the European Union Programme for Employment and Social Innovation (EaSI) 58 Plan, strengthened local partnerships between different institutions and partners, and increased provision of more qualitative tailored offers corresponding to young people\u2019s needs as well as extended coverage of this support. As a result, it is expected that in the long-term, the project will contribute to reducing youth unemployment and inactivity. > Transferability element(s) of the project/activities Most of the project activities could be transferred to the context of measures implemented to combat unemployment among other disadvantaged groups e.g. long-term unemployed. In addition, the Guide for the outreach and activation of young people, neither in education, nor in employment or training was translated in English and is available on the Youth Guarantee online portal. As such, stakeholders from other countries and context are free to adopt it for their own use. > Innovativeness of the project/activities The Guide for the outreach and activation of young people, neither in education, nor in employment or training was designed to support the work of youth mediators, labour intermediaries, case managers and career counsellors, psychologists, Roma mediators and all other relevant specialists. By promoting case-management methods, focusing on determining individual profile, individual preferences, paths and specific steps to activate different groups of inactive young people, it presents an innovative approach in the context of policy approaches used in Bulgaria to activate inactive people. > Policy evidence generated by the project The Guide for the outreach and activation of young people, neither in education, nor in employment or training has been designed to support the implementation of the Youth Guarantee in Bulgaria. > Transnational dimension The project involved organisation of an international conference on the Youth Guarantee - midterm state of play, held in May 2017 in Sofia. To accelerate mutual learning and exchange of good practices, the representatives of the European Commission, the International Labour Organisation and other EU Member States participated (Germany, Spain and the Czech Republic). Altogether, 61 participants attended the conference to exchange views and share good practices regarding the implementation of Youth Guarantee. European added value The contribution of EU funding was essential for the development of the project, as it allowed implementation of a number of different activities going beyond the traditional approach of national authorities to active labour market policy. Furthermore, the conference provided opportunities for networking and mutual learning to both national and European stakeholders. > New partnerships created The project events that brought together a variety of participants, including social partners, education and training institutions, youth organisations, regional and local authorities, youth mediators were the primary means used to enhance local partnerships. Dissemination strategy Handbooks, booklets and leaflets were disseminated among all interested stakeholders including national, regional and local authorities, employment services, social partners, training and education institutions. Booklets, leaflets and advertising kits (each consist of T-shirt and bag) were disseminated among young people (including NEETs) during the information days. All outputs of the project implementation are available on the Youth Guarantee online portal including five short films. The films were broadcasted on TV with national coverage. > Sustainability measures The sustainability of the project impacts will be ensured through a regular update of the Youth Guarantee portal and continuous use of produced material, especially the handbook, by specialists working with young people neither in employment nor in education or training. The Ministry also intends to continue organising workshops with youth mediators to exchange experience and good practices and discuss the implementation of the Youth Guarantee in Bulgaria. > Gender equality measures Information on the use of gender equality measures in the technical implementation of the project and on the integration of gender perspective in the project content is not available. It is not clear how gender equality was taken into account and how the project contributed to combating gender-based inequalities and discrimination. ",

        "Projects and organisations funded by the European Union Programme for Employment and Social Innovation (EaSI) 60 > Socioeconomic context Young people in Greece have been more adversely affected by the crisis than in the other EU Member States. By 2013, youth unemployment and the share of young people who are not in education, employment or training (NEETs) rose to unprecedently high levels - above 55%. As a reaction to the soaring social situation of youth, European and national initiatives have intensified. These include implementation of the Youth Guarantee 96 , launched throughout the EU in 2013, aimed at ensuring that all young people under the age of 25 years receive a good-quality offer of employment and training. The Greek Youth Guarantee Implementation Plan 97 was first presented in December 2013 and updated in June 2014. It is based on a broader national strategy to tackle youth unemployment. > Aims of the project/ organisation The main objectives of this project were: 1) to improve transnational administrative co-operation between national competent bodies and social partners involved in the monitoring and correct application of the Directive 96/71/ EC and the Enforcement Directive 2014/67/EU concerning the posting of workers in the framework of the transnational provision of services; 2) to increase mutual trust among stakeholders, including promoting exchanges of relevant officials and training, as well as developing, facilitating and promoting best practice initiatives in the area of posting of workers in the framework of temporary provision of services; 3) to increase the accessibility and transparency of the information concerning the terms and conditions of employment; and 4) to promote measures for exchange of general and sector-specific information and best practices. > Project results, measured impacts, achievements, lessons learnt This project aimed to accelerate the implementation of Youth Guarantee in Greece through removing of the existing obstacles and filling of the existent policy gaps. Specific objectives of the Action were: (1) to create close and stable partnerships with a strategic holistic policy approach and sense of shared responsibility for youth\u2019s successful transition from school to employment; (2) to foster clear division of roles and responsibilities among the key organisations; (3) to provide all partners with the latest information; (4) to mobilize and involve the local government in the implementation of the Youth Guarantee; (5) to cultivate collaboration across different stakeholders; (6) to provide latest information to young people regarding the opportunities and possible benefits under the Youth Guarantee; (7) to encourage young NEETs to seek for support from the Youth Guarantee provider; (8) to specify the real needs of NEETs; (9) to link the awareness raising campaigns with the forthcoming programmes of the Youth Guarantee implementation plan; (10) to foster the dissemination of information on the relevant legislation and policies related to the Youth Guarantee; (11) to provide early intervention but also information and outreach to the most vulnerable groups of youngsters; (12) to establish processes to identify participants in the Youth Guarantee from different vulnerable backgrounds; (13) to increase the number of persons that complete the formal education, enrol in the Second Chance Schools and participate in the apprenticeship training programmes; (14) to foster the dissemination of information on the European Union policy on youth employment; (15) to contribute to the evaluation of the Youth Guarantee\u2019s implementation. > Project results, measured impacts, achievements, lessons learnt The project led to a number of results. First, an informative Youth Guarantee web portal 98 targeted at young people and a Facebook page 99 were set up. Radio spots were produced and broadcasted nationwide. A TV interview has been aired on a local television channel, hosting the project coordinator and a YMCA executive. Four youth fairs were organised in Kallithea, Thessaloniki, Peristeri and Egaleo by public employment services to raise 96 http://ec.europa.eu/social/main.jsp?catId=1079 97 http://www.yg.mlsp.government.bg/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/NARYCHNIK-preview_VII.pdf 98 https://www.facebook.com/YGAdmin 99 https://www.facebook.com/YGAdmin ",
        "Projects and organisations funded by the European Union Programme for Employment and Social Innovation (EaSI) 61 awareness and to motivate youth. During each fair, the project team organised seven activation workshops for young NEETs. In Kallithea, 47 young people participated in workshops, while in Thessaloniki 72, in Peristeri 58 and in Egaleo 29 young people participated. Approximately 10,000 promo brochures were disseminated among young people at the fairs. In addition, four on the spot campaigns took place in schools, public services and local organisations (e.g. youth centres, trade associations) in order to inform young people as well as relevant stakeholders. Three outreach teams for targeted engagement with vulnerable youth, especially Muslim and Roma youngsters, were set up by the Ministry of Education; two in Attica Region (Chalandri, West Attica), and one in Thrace (Xanthi). In Xanthi, 11 NEETs from the Muslim minority benefited from individualised guidance and 120 youngsters of the same background participated in group counselling and information session. In Challandri, 60 Roma youngsters were approached through group counselling, while 25 received personal guidance. In addition, 21 Roma young people who are within the formal education system benefited through information provision and counselling support. In West Attica, 50 Roma youngsters participated in group counselling. In co-operation with the Department of Social Work of the Technological Educational Institute of Athens, the Municipality of Egaleo conducted a survey to assess the needs of the young 15-24 years old in the area regarding education, training, employment and unemployment. This survey recorded the views of 300 young people aged 15- 24 in the region of Egaleo. The main findings of the survey were presented at the thematic workshop organised by the Municipality of Egaleo. Three final reports of action by the three expert groups who had undertaken outreach work with specific vulnerable groups were produced. A two-day conference event was held in Athens with the participation of representatives from the European Commission (DG EMPL) and experts from Finland, Germany and Spain and also participants from PES, universities, social partners, ministries and youth organisations. For the purposes of the conference, a guide/brochure on the labour rights was produced. The printed material was distributed to the participants of the conference while the roll-up banners were placed at the venue and the posters in different public spots for raising awareness and inform anybody interested in participating. Also, the guide on the labour rights was distributed by the information desk of the Ministry of Labour (IRIDA). According to the project coordinator, the main achievements of the action could be described as the following: > provision of the latest information regarding the Youth Guarantee so that young NEETs to know what opportunities are available and how they might benefit from the Youth Guarantee; > reaching out to young NEETs to get registered with the Youth Guarantee provider; > fostering the dissemination on the YGIP policy and on the relevant legislation on labour, apprenticeship, training and traineeship; > increasing awareness of policy-makers and bringing relevant stakeholders on board; > increasing the number of NEETs who received counselling services and participated in awareness raising workshops; > sharing good practices and exchanging experiences with EU peers in the context of mutual learning; > creating partnerships and co-operation mechanisms between involved stakeholders; > mobilisation and involvement of local authorities on the implementation of the Youth Guarantee. > Transferability element(s) of the project/activities Most of the project activities could be transferred to other geographical and thematical contexts. > Policy evidence generated by the project The Municipality of Egaleo conducted a survey, in co- operation with the Department of Social Work of the Technological Educational Institute of Athens. The findings on the needs of the young 15-24 year-olds in the Municipality of Egaleo regarding education, training, employment and unemployment were presented at the thematic workshop. In addition, three reports were written by the three expert groups that had undertaken outreach work/support with specific vulnerable groups. The reports were submitted to the Ministry of Labour. > Transnational dimension The project involved organisation of a two-day conference with international presence held in Athens on 19-20 October ",

Experts from Finland, Germany and Spain and representatives of the European Commission participated in this event, next to participants of local public employment services, ministries, social partners, youth organisations and academia. Altogether, 114 participants attended the conference (74 women and 40 men). > European added value The EU funding allowed the implementation of the above- mentioned project activities. Furthermore, the conference provided opportunities for networking and mutual learning to both national and European stakeholders. > New partnerships created All the key organisations involved in the project are also the competent authorities for the design and implementation of the Youth Guarantee in Greece - namely the Ministry of Labour, the Ministry of Education, the public employment services and local authorities. Thanks to this action, strong partnerships were developed among these actors to further facilitate the implementation of Youth Guarantee at all levels. > Dissemination strategy Given the project\u2019s focus on awareness-raising and activation of youth, dissemination via various channels has been key. Information was shared through social media 100 and website 101 , the update of which was ensured by a working group established for this purpose. Moreover, information about upcoming events and the programme were broadcasted on the radio and shared through press releases. The project team also participated in a TV interview and organised events, such as a conference, to disseminate printed material produced for this purpose and foster mutual learning and networking. > Sustainability measures Reaching out to young NEETs will continue beyond the respective project and is above all an ongoing effort that goes alongside with the specific measures and reforms that are implemented in the framework of Youth Guarantee. Thus, the soft communication tools initiated during the project continue to be in place and allow to link existing information channels to the forthcoming programmes of the Youth Guarantee implementation plan. Furthermore, the partnerships developed in the process continue to provide the basis for further work and national authorities aim to further enhance them. Co-operation with the public employment services has been considered durable, which is crucial as they constitute the main Youth Guarantee provider. > Gender equality measures The actions addressed the whole population of NEETs, with a focus on young vulnerable people facing multiple barriers as suggested by the Council\u2019s Recommendation. One concrete project activity targeted NEETs of diverse background. However, there is no information whether gender equality measures were applied in the project. This suggests a lack of clarity on how a gender equality perspective was taken into account from different angles in both technical implementation and content. 3.3.b Mobility for professionals This section focuses on a project in the field of labour mobility, funded under the call for proposals aimed at supporting the free movement of workers and tackling abuse by means of better coordination of social security systems 102 . The key point of the call is to address labour mismatches, skill shortages and qualification gaps concerning small and medium-size enterprises (SMEs) at the national and EU level.

This includes the rights of movement and residence and the rights for family members to be treated on an equal footing. According to estimates from 2013, some seven million EU citizens worked and lived in a Member State other than their own. This corresponds to some 3.3% of the total EU labour force. While these figures may seem good at first glance, intra-EU mobility trails significantly behind the US. There, mobility accounted for 2.7% of the population in 2011/2012. The corresponding values for the EU are only at about 10% of the U.S. level. These figures are troubling, as labour mobility has a number of advantages, e.g. addressing skill shortages, tackling unemployment disparities between EU members states, etc. The aforementioned advantages are especially important for Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs), which account for the majority of the market share in the EU. Presently, lack of intra-EU mobility creates bottleneck situations in skill supply. This, in turn, harms MSMEs, as they cannot count on prestigious in-house training programmes and large human resources departments scouting for talent outside their region/country. > Aims of the project/ organisation The project analysed the opportunities for cross-border mobility of employees of MSMEs in the EU and examined the benefits that follow. It aimed to determine whether a stable European scheme for MSME employees, similar to the Erasmus programmes for university students and young entrepreneurs, could be viable in the EU. Much like the Erasmus for Young Entrepreneurs programme, which supports aspiring entrepreneurs to start and run a successful business in Europe, mobility between borders concerning MSMEs would also act as a mechanism in the facilitation process for cross-border business development. This seems like a rational path to follow as there is currently no European scheme in place to address this. Additionally, MSME employees often do not qualify to join programmes such as Erasmus for Young Entrepreneurs. This only strengthens the argument for the necessity of an improved cross-border exchange. > Project results, measured impacts, achievements, Lessons learnt The final evaluation report, providing analysis, research and evaluation regarding the feasibility of a public support scheme for cross-border mobility of employees of MSMEs entitled \u2018Mobilities for professionals and qualified employees of SMEs\u2019, concluded the mobility of employees, be it in a private or public sector, is seen as positive. It does not only benefit the employees themselves (better knowledge, new skills, increased technological literacy, intercultural competences) but also the host/sending ",
        "Projects and organisations funded by the European Union Programme for Employment and Social Innovation (EaSI) 65 organisations, as they develop stronger relations between themselves, and receive better-trained employees. Current mobility schemes target a wide variety of people as regards age, seniority, qualification and function, and there are no mobility schemes similar to the idea of the presented project (MobiliseSME). Over 100 persons from different parts of Europe, took part in the kick-off event for the MobiliseSME pilot scheme. Attendants learned about the scheme\u2019s features and had a possibility to watch two videos about the matchmaking process and the testimonials of SMEs entrepreneurs and employees in Europe. The event closed with a panel debate on how the new scheme can bring new advantages to different parties. The MobiliseSME pilot exchange scheme resulted in a total of 50 successful exchanges between hosting and sending MSMEs. Lastly, over 100 attendees attended a final conference entitled \u2018The Future of a Mobility Scheme for SMEs and their Employees in Europe\u2019. By September 2017, a total of 50 exchanges took place. Out of these 44 exchanges, involving in total 59 enterprises were evaluated. Over 350 companies expressed their interest in the scheme, while 102 companies posted partner requests. While a larger number of exchanges could be expected if the project were to be rolled out at a larger scale, most partners estimated that the annual number of exchanges that would be achievable in their countries would range between 10 and maximum 60, and therefore considering the average and the number of EU Member States, the scheme could facilitate up to 1,000 exchanges per year. Most companies interested were small microenterprises (<5 employees) or self-employed. No clear trends could be identified regarding the company sectors and no sector dominated. However, ICT, communication and marketing and business services appeared to be the most promising for exchanges. Worthwhile to note was that 86% of the exchanges undertaken were between not-neighbouring. Bordering regions took up to 14% of the exchanges. Across participants, learning and skill development was the main motivation to participate. There is thus a high level of consistency between the pilot\u2019s stated objectives and the companies\u2019 reasons for participation. > Transnational dimension The project included cross-country exchanges of MSME employees between 17 different countries, most actively Germany (15x), Spain (13x), Hungary (10x) and Estonia (8x). > Dissemination strategy MobiliseSME and its partners took a very active role in the promotion and advertising of the scheme, and a wide number of communication activities were undertaken. The main communication activities used to promote and advertise the project were the following: 1) news articles released by the project partners as well as third parties; 2) monthly electronic newsletters published by MobiliseSME consortia; 3) three press releases by the European Entrepreneurs CEA-PME; 4) digital advertisement on EUobserver and EurActiv; 5) seven MobiliseSME videos; 6) event organisation/participation; 7) social media channels: Twitter 103 , Facebook 104 and LinkedIn 105 . > European added value The evaluation results show that a scheme supporting transnational exchanges between companies within the EU, brings EU added value at several levels. It has been found that there is currently no mobility scheme similar to the idea of MobiliseSME. Furthermore, evidence also shows that there are multiple benefits of transnational exchanges between businesses in Europe, e.g. development of new services, products and practices. Lastly, it is suggested that the key added value of MobiliseSME lies in the transnational aspect of the exchange scheme - allowing employees to work internationally, experiencing a foreign culture, and foreign markets in the sector in which they had experience at home, and adopting a global outlook. > Sustainability measures The outputs of the project, i.e. report findings and observations, are expected to serve as a basis for further development of an EU-wide cross-border mobility scheme for MSME employees and to help address low MSME export rates in the European Single Market. It is believed that stronger connections among companies in different European countries would naturally lead to more competitive businesses able to respond to the challenges of globalisation. > Gender equality measures During the pilot scheme, 24 men and 20 women participated as visiting employees. More information on the use of gender equality measures would have been benefitial in the technical implementation of the project and on the integration of a gender perspective in the project content to understand how the project contributed to combatting gender inequalities. 103 https://twitter.com/CeaPme 104 https://www.facebook.com/CEAPME/?hc_ref=ARRbb8sCf_n8hXBxjrkaGXFaH3W_gM6Bbjg0_aV645gANB1J7Ogwne81dZqfQwPyJbE&fref=nf&__ xts__%5b0%5d=68.ARA7FKnfLt2-y9fus-IafE43LG3wI6Nd7LwXxpqRJBXHZ3zFKd6G1BJDF4njZPMO94bZXd3p7C7Jw3q8b45gsifr3s6ieCbL86SkKcATBhY58 drfIe9laYp-JNuTGQecuCu-rmNdwWwRjEIPNzDsfWiuEvhSLX_Y3fTVpO9KjS6iqa84bcW2&__tn__=kC-R 105 https://www.linkedin.com/showcase/programme-mobilisesme ",

The mission of the Goodbiz programme was to support companies that demonstrate the potential for sustainable growth. The specific objectives of the project included the creation of high-level quality and sustainable employment, reduction of long-term unemployment and fight against poverty and social exclusion. At the same, it aimed at upgrading business expertise, developing investment readiness support methodology and raising the awareness regarding the role of social enterprises in establishing more inclusive and sustainable society, Through a combination of business and non-governmental approaches, Zavod Viva and its partners implemented events, facilitated cross-sector collaboration and organised various entrepreneurial programmes. In specific, peer-to- peer social entrepreneurship community was strengthened and the availability of financial and business resources for social entrepreneurs (a number of investments and business partnerships) increased. Also, the Book of Goodbiz 106 was prepared which provides an overview of the current Slovenian and European market trends and presents social impact management tools. Overall, the project team managed to increase awareness on the importance of social entrepreneurship as a tool for creating sustainable work and increasing social inclusion. Second, the visibility, attractiveness and networking potential of the programme for social enterprises on national and transnational level were also increased. > Lessons learnt Implemented project showed that there is a need for more frequent and shorter modules with individualised and hands-on approach in the module. Additionally, the project team learnt that more attention should be given to potential finance providers in the future, including offering capacity building opportunities. Furthermore, in order to successfully implement the project, it was crucial to attract quality social entrepreneurs. Additional support for the social enterprises is needed in building the understanding of financial management, human resources planning and innovativeness. 106 https://issuu.com/boljseresitve/docs/goodbiz_knjiga_web_spread ",
        "Projects and organisations funded by the European Union Programme for Employment and Social Innovation (EaSI) 69 > Identification of potential good practices The Voice of Goodbiz was designed as a communication- networking strategy aimed at increasing the visibility of programme activities, communication messages and attracting quality participants to the programme. Six essential stakeholder groups were targeted: 1) research and educational organisations, 2) entrepreneurship support environment, 3) finance providers, 4) social enterprises, 5) enterprises/companies, and 6) public agencies. Thanks to the agreements, a wide variety of stakeholders were aligned around the promotion of social entrepreneurship and impact topics, transnational partners and video materials supported the campaign as well. > Policy evidence generated by the project Even though no policy follow-up has been implemented, co-operation between partners and associate organisation SPIRIT Slovenia, public agency for the promotion of entrepreneurship, was reached. All counterparts agreed to continue with the support to social entrepreneurs and further develop investment mechanisms to start-ups with a clearly defined social and/ or environmental impact. Moreover, regular consultations and meetings with public officials were held. Additionally, state secretary in the office of the prime minister regularly attended project workshops and showcase events. > Transnational dimension The transnational workshop \u2018Social impact and social finance: The do\u2019s and don\u2019ts of setting up a Social finance ecosystem\u2019 was held. It provided Slovenian partners and stakeholders with a unique insight regarding current trends and examples of good practice. The workshop provided an opportunity for transnational partners to exchange opinions on further collaboration and internationalisation of social entrepreneurs. > Dissemination strategy Information systems were developed and maintained in order to exchange and disseminate information. In particular, the following were used to disseminate information: project website 107 , newsletter Goodbiz.info, Slideshare, Soundcloud, LinkedIn profile, Facebook, Youtube. Furthermore, four press releases and six events covering the social entrepreneurship topics were organised. The Book of Goodbiz with an overview of the main findings was distributed offline and online. Finally, national and international stakeholders were reached through the individual offline meetings. > European added value The project could not have been implemented without the financial contribution of the EaSI grant. Staff and service costs (mentors and expertise) and communication and information dissemination infrastructure (website, materials production, and graphic design) required most of the funding. In addition to the financial contribution, the EaSI grant made a significant contribution to the development of a strong transnational network of potential partners through the organization of transnational activities in Slovenia, project workshops and expert mentorship for programme activities. At the same time, the project increased prospects for the internationalisation of Slovenian social enterprises. Co-operation with specialised intermediaries like Financing Agency for Social Entrepreneurship (FASE) and the Nonprofit Enterprise and Self Sustainability Team (NESsT) led to quality internationalisation opportunities. Finally, the visibility of programme activities was raised due to the prominence of guest speakers from transnational partner organisations at showcase events. > Sustainability measures The EaSI programme supported the project consortium and associate organisations in terms of co-financing the development of the necessary infrastructure for the implementation of programme activities (programme materials development, communication infrastructure, travel costs and transnational co-operation costs, food, etc) and compensation of staff costs. Further sustainment of the programme activities would not be possible without public and/or private grants due to the relatively low purchasing power of the social entrepreneurship sector in Slovenia. > Gender equality measures The participation in the programme activities was gender- balanced. However, the project team did not report more information on the use of gender equality measures in the technical implementation of the project and on the integration of a gender perspective in the project content. More information would have been desirable to understand the project\u2019s contribution to tackling gender ineqaulties. 107 http://www.goodbiz.si/ ",

        "Projects and organisations funded by the European Union Programme for Employment and Social Innovation (EaSI) 71 > Socioeconomic context In France, very few programmes and social enterprise support organisations offer to assist social enterprises in terms of strategy development, fundraising or any other part of the activity chain. Considering as their business models and legal environment are not that well known, social enterprises, more often than not, fail to receive the support they need. France Active and its partners on the project \u2013Mouves and Antropia ESSEC \u2013 have thus decided to take advantage of their complementarity of skills and activities and support social enterprises as well as tackle their issues concerning investment readiness. > Aims of the project/organisation The aim of the project \u2018ReadinESS\u2019 was to provide social entrepreneurs with the funding they need to develop their projects and thus create added value and jobs in respective territories, and to strengthen social cohesion through networking between social entrepreneurs and through the social impact of their project. Further aims included casting light on territories through the social enterprises taking part in the project, and strengthening local relations between France Active, Mouves and Antropia ESSEC so as to support innovative and ambitious projects. The main objectives were the following: > to prepare and help 30 social enterprises to raise funds to support their business\u2019s development and growth; > to support these 30 social enterprises with fundraising negotiations; > to enhance mutual knowledge between social entrepreneurs and funders; > to enable the creation of communities for social entrepreneur on the territories. > Project results, measured impacts, achievements, Lessons learnt The programme was successful in all territories, thanks to both local and national involvement of France Active, Mouves and Antropia ESSEC. A total of 30 social enterprises (10 per territory) were provided with individual and group-based support to structure their financial strategy. Furthermore, the social enterprises got support in regard to fundraising negotiations \u2013 8 social enterprises managed to achieve their negotiations at the end of the programme and raised the funds they required. 6 other social enterprises are still currently in their way to finalise the negotiations. The total amount of funds raised is EUR 3,886,900. Further results include the enhancement of mutual knowledge between social entrepreneurs and funders, as well as the enablement of the creation of communities for social entrepreneurship on territories. > Dissemination strategy The results and findings of the ReadinESS programme were relayed to France Active, Mouves, Antropia ESSEC and the European Commission. Further information about the programme was shared on France Active\u2019s homepage, as well as via social media (YouTube, Twitter, Facebook). > European added value The EU funding has mostly contributed to the costs of the staff working on the programme. It would have been more difficult to implement the programme to a similar extent without the funding of the EU. The ReadinESS programme also contributed to improved networking activities among social entrepreneurs across France. > Sustainability measures ReadinESS has led to an especially strong networking among social entrepreneurs and stakeholders (through the workshops organised by the European Commission and the transnational activities). As such, feedback from the project participants was highly positive. Most of the social enterprise participants expressed a willingness to continue and strengthen co-operation even after the termination of the project. The beneficiaries also confirmed that the inputs and support provided by the project will be used for future strategy development, fundraising activities, etc. France Active along with Mouves and Antropia ESSEC wish to up-scale the programme. As such, they have updated the programme plan thanks to the lessons learnt and are currently in search of financial support to back up the newly revamped ReadinESS programme. ",

        "Projects and organisations funded by the European Union Programme for Employment and Social Innovation (EaSI) 74 > Socioeconomic context EURES-T Upper Rhine 108 was founded to promote labour mobility in a cross-border region. Currently, the partnership acts as a framework for the collaboration of relevant actors from Germany, Switzerland and France. The services provided by the partnership cover the entire Upper Rhine region (Alsace, southern Palatinate, Baden and North-western Switzerland), where every day more than 93,000 cross-border commuters travel across the border for work. The main labour mobility flows appear from Germany to Switzerland (3%) and from France to Switzerland and Germany (61%). The number of cross-border commuters increased by around 7% during 2002-2014, with an increase in mobility flows from Germany to Switzerland by 53% and Germany and from Switzerland to France by 38%. In contrast, mobility from France to Germany decreased by 21% and from France to Switzerland by 2%. Furthermore, the share of cross-border workers aged 50 years and above accounted for 33% of the total, while the share of young people under the age of 30 amounted to 15%. > Aims of the project/ organisation The EURES-T Upper Rhine cross-border partnership acts in collaboration with the border states\u2019 public employment services in order to facilitate and increase labour mobility. This particular action aimed to tackle skills mismatch and enhance the quality of advisory services provided to employers, jobseekers and people considering a job change. It also aimed to foster cross-border collaboration by initiating cross-border debates regarding differences in national labour, tax and social security policies. EURES-T Upper Rhine sought to act as an incubator for new projects and initiatives. > Project results, measured impacts, achievements, lessons learnt In order to mitigate labour mobility restricting barriers, 20 activities and sub-activities were implemented in co-operation with the German, French and Swiss partners and their networks. First of all, relevant information was distributed to jobseekers and employers. The target groups were reached through updated brochures containing all the relevant information regarding employability, i.e. different job typology, border status, cross-border training, social security, health insurance etc. The brochures were made available in French and German, and are free to download from the EURES-T Upper Rhine website 109 . A specific focus was given to the integration of people aged 50 and above into the labour market. Second, the action enhanced the quality of employment requests and offers in the cross-border labour market and developed joint investment projects, which are a part of the EURES reform. Successful collaboration within the cross- border placement services is reflected in the framework agreement between the Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg and Rhineland- Palatinate-Saarland Bundesagentur f\u00fcr Arbeit and P\u00f4le Emploi Grand-Est, which led to an agreement to continue framework activities until the end of 2018. Third, a one-stop-shop method, combining and integrating different services in cross-border countries, was designed and implemented. A precise system for measuring one-stop- shop results has been put in place as well. Moreover, three steering committee meetings (with 25 participants) and two meetings of the praesidium to follow-up and observe the workers\u2019 placement trends took place in the beginning, middle and the end of the financial year. Lastly, a measure has been put in place to help jobseekers aged 50 and above. Older people were provided with the following: 1) four days of group training covering CV preparation, cover letter editing, etc.; 2) two one-hour interview training sessions; 3) six half- an-hour interview training sessions online. Activities aimed at jobseekers, workers, apprentices and employers in the Upper Rhine Region reached the intended objectives regarding placement, information and advice provision. The objectives corresponded to the EURES service catalogue (covering pre-recruitment, recruitment/matching/placement, information and advice, and co-operation border). Overall, over 10,000 individual contacts between EURES advisors, jobseekers and employers were made. The majority of individuals were consulted about placement (3,934), social security, taxation (2,797) and general information regarding EURES services (1,075). In addition, EURES advisors carried out 260 group contacts with more than 4,000 jobseekers and employers. 108 https://www.eures-t-oberrhein.eu/ 109 http://www.eures-t-rhinsuperieur.eu/telechargements ",
        "Projects and organisations funded by the European Union Programme for Employment and Social Innovation (EaSI) 75 > Identification of potential good practices The distinctive feature of this action lies within its control and monitoring system. The action\u2019s impact was measured by an operational monitoring committee. The monitoring framework included indicators of the EURES-T catalogue. The collected information was later presented to the partnership praesidium and the steering committee. Furthermore, regular exchange sessions with the operational network (project managers, EURES advisers and EURES-T task managers) took place. The main objectives of the meetings were to draw up interim activities, identify and resolve any mobility bottlenecks and make budget adjustments. The cross-border apprenticeship training program can be identified as a potential good practice. It offered young people the opportunity to integrate into the labour market of the neighbouring countries and companies gained additional recruitment opportunities. This measure will be maintained in the coming years. Additionally, the one-stop-shop is another example of a good practice. The one-stop-shop optimised the treatment of cross-border workers requests and indicated specific needs of workers from different regions. As the measure attracted 2,250 requests via emails and phone calls, it will be continued in the following years. > Innovativeness of the project/activities The novelty of the action lies within its focus on unemployed youth and older people aged 50 and above. In particular, the former group was targeted by initiating skill development sessions in the cross-border region. The sessions offered young people opportunities to gain international work experience and to obtain a double qualification. The latter group was offered a specialised support such as individual and group coaching. > Policy evidence generated by the project Policy-makers at the local and regional levels are part of the partnership and actively participate in the development and implementation of the activities. They were regularly informed about the strategic orientations and partnership activities, particularly, during the seminars and annual conference or steering committee meetings. Moreover, the effective controlling and monitoring system of the action allowed observing the evolution of the labour mobility trends in Germany, France and Switzerland. The gathered evidence was presented to the members of the praesidium and the steering committee, both of which further defined the strategic directions and future operational activities of the partnership. > Dissemination strategy The information materials, which include the financial partnership information and logos of EURES, EUREST, the European Union and Switzerland, were presented and disseminated in individual and/or group meetings with local, national or European political and economic decision- makers. Brochures, studies and reports are accessible online on the partnership\u2019s website 110 . At the same time, a newly developed Facebook page 111 acted as an excellent vector of information for youth. The social media significantly contributed to increasing the visibility of the cross-border EURES-T Upper Rhine partnership and the EURES network among young people. Finally, the seminar and other events received attention from the public media, thus the activities of the partnership were presented to the wider public through press releases as well. > European added value The partnership provides a framework for developing new innovative projects. Furthermore, the action stands out for its effective networking functions. Exceptional coordination ensured the efficiency and unity of the partnership, as well as a contact point for the EC, project managers, EURES advisors and partner organisations. > Gender equality measures No specific or direct gender equality measures were undertaken in the project. The only relevant information available suggests that all the events had a gender-balanced audience, with women slightly outnumbering men in some cases. It would have been useful to receive more information on the use of gender equality measures in the technical implementation of the project and on the integration of a gender perspective in the project content for the sake of understanding how the project contributed to tackling gender inequalities. 110 https://www.eures-t-oberrhein.eu/?author=1&cHash=03638f74a6f0cbb37b90f034069e9563 111 https://www.facebook.com/Eures-T-Oberrhein-135564580377466/ ",

        "Projects and organisations funded by the European Union Programme for Employment and Social Innovation (EaSI) 77 > Socioeconomic context Despite the common ancestry, the regions of Northern Portugal and Galicia today are distinguished by disparities in terms of unemployment and wage rates. Citizens of Northern Portugal frequently face difficulties in finding work in Galicia due to high unemployment rates, whereas, residents of Galicia lack the incentive to seek employment in Portugal. This is because average wages are sometimes lower than the unemployment benefits in Spain. Moreover, it has been noted that due to different cross- border socio-economic contexts, some of the organisations and sectors resort to social dumping practices. Finally, the recent financial crisis has led numerous companies and businesses to close on both sides of the border, particularly in sectors that granted work mostly to cross-border workers. > Aims of the project/ organisation This project aimed to provide information related to the facilitation of cross-border mobility by increasing the visibility of potential cross-border employment benefits. To this end, the cross-border partnership sought to enhance dialogue between national and local labour market authorities that are active in the region as well as between other labour market stakeholders (universities, trade unions, employer organisations) and social partners. At the same time, the cross-border partnership aimed to facilitate labour market mobility by initiating information exchange sessions between Northern Portugal and Galicia. In particular, the partnership sought to provide employers and jobseekers with all the relevant information regarding working and living conditions abroad. Furthermore, one of the main objectives was to tackle youth unemployment by developing measures needed to boost and facilitate the mobility of young workers. Finally, the project partners sought to carry out labour market monitoring activities and disseminate gathered information, including information on professional internships and apprenticeships, and their effective implementation among key stakeholders. > Project results, measured impacts, achievements During 2017, the project partners implemented various activities to increase cross-border labour mobility, reduce youth unemployment and disseminate information regarding working and living conditions in the regions of Northern Portugal and Galicia. First, the official website 112 was completely redesigned and re-directed towards social networks and smart devices. Concurrently, it has been updated in accordance with the enforcement of new national legislation on labour and social security. All project related activities and events were advertised on the website and the links to the pages of the EURES cross-border partner entities were provided as well. National and regional public employment services are especially visible and well positioned in the different sections of the webpage. Second, the EURES cross-border Northern Portugal and Galicia partnership initiated 59 information gathering and sharing sessions. In addition, a sectorial workshop with employers was established in order to identify sectors showing potential for cross-border institutional and organisational collaboration and to identify the needs of employers regarding training and qualification requirements. Moreover, seminars on taxation and free service provision in the region were organised in co-operation with local professionals, employers and entrepreneurs. The information exchange session led to the following: 1) increased perception of employer expectations and demands in the frontier labour market; 2) identification of barriers restricting employment of cross-border workers, and 3) strengthened links between potential employers of the public employment services and other agents operating in this region within the EURES network. Third, the partners facilitated job matching, placement and recruitment processes, and developed joint placement initiatives in line with the EURES recommendations. Some of these initiatives were the following: a) Job day (virtual and on-site) was organised under the umbrella of the European Job Days Portal 113 ; b) Job offers were disseminated on a weekly basis at job centres in the cross-border area; 112 http://www.eures-norteportugal-galicia.org/ 113 https://www.europeanjobdays.eu/ ",
        "Projects and organisations funded by the European Union Programme for Employment and Social Innovation (EaSI) 78 c) Comprehensive services were provided spanning throughout the pre-recruitment and post-recruitment periods, and thus enhancing the connection between employers and jobseekers throughout the entire employment process. A one-stop-shop, which combines and integrates different services for clients in Northern Portugal and Galicia, was designed and established. The establishment facilitated the partnership clients\u2019 access to services offered by the cross-border action. Overall, co-operation with tax and social security authorities has been carried out, along with the EURES service catalogue. Moreover, significant efforts were also made to combat youth unemployment. To this end, project partners informed universities about the EURES network and aimed to realise student placements in the labour market, offered job search tools and provided job search and internship strategies. Accordingly, students were prepared and informed on cross- border employment practices, and they were able to gain first- hand cross-border employment experience. This experience has allowed the students to acquire intercultural competences essential to enter and integrate into the labour market. Finally, the partners monitored and followed-up placements of frontier workers in order to analyse the quality of the provided job vacancies, the workers\u2019 integration process and the effects of socio-economic benefits for workers, employers and local communities. Overall, 1,608 individual and 12 group (including 475 people) contacts between EURES advisors and jobseekers and employers were made and 35 people have found a job due to EURES activities. > Lessons learnt Despite the partners\u2019 efforts, recent data indicates that public employment services in Galicia and Northern Portugal are seldom used by employers to provide and offer job vacancies. Therefore, mechanisms and tools that enhance the \u2018market share\u2019, (i.e. the relationship between the percentages of placements managed by the public employment services in relation to total placements) of Public Employment Services, and that of EURES-T Galicia-Northern Portugal (G-NP), should be developed. > Identification of potential good practices The EURES cross-border partnership published two bulletins in 2017 with relevant information concerning companies and workers. In order to detect the most productive sectors that could generate employment and produce high demand professions in Galicia and Northern Portugal, special attention in the bulletins was paid to the analysis of job offers and jobseekers\u2019 needs. Legislative novelties and relevant policy initiatives were also addressed. An overview of consultations attended by the EURES-T partners was published as well. The bulletins are available on the EURES cross-border North Portugal-Galicia website and were disseminated on Facebook and LinkedIn. All the relevant information including frequently asked questions regarding labour laws, social security and health issues, unemployment benefits, cross-border taxation and academic degrees recognition and accreditation was provided in the partnership handbook which is available at the partnership website 114 . Overall, the creation of a EURES-T G-NP network with Social Security and Labour Inspection of Galicia and North Portugal mitigated barriers restricting cross-border mobility. > Transferability element(s) of the project/activities The cross-border partnership between Galicia and Northern Portugal organised a programme to foster the mobility of Portuguese university students. The initiative targeted bachelor\u2019s and master\u2019s students with an objective to inform them about the living and working conditions abroad. Students gained first-hand cross-border experience. > Policy evidence generated by the project The coordination office of the EURES cross-border partnership between Galicia and Northern Portugal carried out monitoring and controlling functions of each activity mentioned in the annual plan. In order to collect the necessary quantitative information, a series of numerical indicators were introduced, such as the number of assistants attending an event, number of registered people in activities, number of participants in a working group, number of CVs worked on, and the number of available job offers. The qualitative data was obtained by launching a service satisfaction questionnaire. Furthermore, expressed verbal opinions by users of the service, observations and interpretations were gathered as well. The information obtained was reviewed and organised in order to draw the conclusions from the analysis provided by the steering committee of the EURES-T G-NP. Later on, the committee made appropriate recommendations for the planning of the next action. Moreover, the indicators 114 http://www.eures-norteportugal-galicia.org/ ",
        "Projects and organisations funded by the European Union Programme for Employment and Social Innovation (EaSI) 79 were updated throughout 2017 and a study titled \u2018Update indicators of mobility on the Northern border of Portugal- Galicia\u2019 was prepared and is available at Confederaci\u00f3n de empresarios 115 de Galicia (CEG) and partnership websites. > Dissemination strategy The overview of work groups, training sessions, seminars, information sharing events and sectorial meetings was published in EURES cross-border Galicia-Northern Portugal website. In addition, each of the partner organisations also published the agenda, programme and description of results on their own web page. Other dissemination channels such as periodical magazines, TV channels and social media sites were used as well. Finally, the bulletins were published in both digital and paper formats, and distributed to partner organisations as well as shared with 1,000 employers. > European added value The partnership contributed to the added European value by increasing the visibility of the EURES network. At the same time, the implemented actions promoted benchmarking activities for decision-making. In addition, one mutual learning event was produced, along with three reports. Furthermore, the partnership mitigated cross-border mobility barriers by providing targeted groups with relevant information and, thus enhanced free movement of people. Finally, three networking events were held with an objective to identify cross-border mobility bottlenecks as well as to enhance co-operation between key cross-border organisations and institutions (labour inspectorate and social security). Nevertheless, Galicia- Northern Portugal cross-border partnership has not yet established a database which gathers data on the cross- border mobility flows. > Gender equality measures Promotion of gender equality is not indicated as an objective of the partnership. The only relevant information available suggests that in all events women and men were represented almost equally, with men slightly outnumbering women in most cases. More information on the use of gender equality measures in the technical implementation of the project and on the integration of a gender perspective in the project content would have been benefitial to understand how the project contributed to gender equality. 115 http://www.ceg.es/index.php?idMenu=2421 ",

        "Projects and organisations funded by the European Union Programme for Employment and Social Innovation (EaSI) 81 > Socioeconomic context EURES plays an important role in cross-border regions where a high level of cross-border commuting has a potential to develop. To support the mobility of cross-border workers and employers in parts of Saxony (Germany), Bohemia (the Czech Republic) and Lower Silesia (Poland), the EURES \u2013TriRegio cross-border partnership was established. Over 2,000 cross-border workers from the Czech Republic and Poland contacted Saxony employment services regarding available job vacancies in Germany. At the same time, only 21 jobseekers from Germany were interested in working in Poland (10) and the Czech Republic (11). Thus, the partnership aims to establish a long-term co-operation between public employment services, trade unions and employers\u2019 organisations and address differences in cross-border labour mobility flows. > Aims of the project/ organisation The overarching goal of the EURES-TriRegio partnership is to develop a common labour market compatible with local labour and social standards. The main objective of this action was to provide placement services in the cross-border region, especially on behalf of small and medium enterprises, as well as counselling and provision of information for cross- border commuters on living and working conditions in the neighbouring country. The specific objectives of the EURES TriRegio partnership under this action are: 1) to promote interregional employment by offering matching services for jobseekers and local businesses and create a regional job placement offer, thus increasing the overall employment rate; 2) to enhance cohesion between cross-border region countries by keeping up the dialogue on the best strategy and actions that benefit all three regions of the partnership; 3) to promote high labour standards and prevent social exclusion and social dumping; 4) to reduce the language barrier in job searching by offering language courses or by placing linguists in job boards; 5) to create a platform for dialogue between employment services, employers\u2019 organisations and trade unions as well as other actors, such as guests at the meetings of the partnership or experts in information and communication mediation activities. > Project results, measured impacts, achievements In 2017, the partnership implemented 25 activities which addressed jobseekers, the unemployed, employers (especially small and medium enterprises), young people, politicians, public employment services and social partner organisations. Altogether, 294 events took place, which were attended by more than 7,500 participants. Jobseekers were informed about vacancies in cross-border triangle region and labour and social security laws. Workers could also register in the database and receive training with reference to preparing a high-quality job application. Overall, 8,282 individual and 92 group (with over more than 1,000 participants) contacts between EURES advisors and employers and jobseekers were made. The implemented EURES activities led to 206 placements. Furthermore, in co-operation with sectoral trade unions, seven group meetings for cross-border commuters took place and addressed workers in the cleaning, automotive, transport as well as hotel and catering sectors. At the same time, the partnership developed information material for jobseekers and cross-border commuters about different labour laws and social security benefits. For instance, a booklet aimed at citizens seeking employment in a cross-border region was prepared and distributed. Additionally, 13 workshops, aimed at presenting essential information regarding the cross-border mobility, were held. In the workshops, 250 people participated, including 106 women (42%) and 144 men (58%). The workshops were organised in collaboration with other institutions, including district laboratories, secondary schools and higher education institutions. Five career guidance sessions with over 200 participants were organised. During the activities, more than 200 pupils from the Czech and Polish schools were informed on professions and the dual vocational system in Saxony. During the action, three job boards of EURES-TriRegio, one in the Polish part of the partnership and two in the Czech Republic, were instigated. The job boards were attended by 2,630 visitors and 139 exhibitors. Company visits and contacts with employers\u2019 networks were initiated during consultation days for the Lower Silesian employers, information events in Saxony, Lower Silesia and Northern Bohemia. Within the framework of the partnership, two training sessions on the regulations and procedures of employing foreign citizens were carried out. As for the placement services, EURES-advisers ensured that jobseekers were offered work opportunities corresponding to their qualification and were free of bias. ",
        "Projects and organisations funded by the European Union Programme for Employment and Social Innovation (EaSI) 82 > Lessons learnt The growth in labour market mobility led to an increased amount of request of advice on employment conditions and social security in border countries. In addition, there were more questions concerning sick leave and benefits, pensions, taxation, work accidents and labour standards. In many cases, answering the questions required the co-operation of several partners. Thus, the implementation of the action showed the necessity of more profound interregional co- operation. Moreover, local companies, particularly SMEs, should be involved in the development and implementation of specific activities more thoroughly in the future. > Identification of potential good practices In order to strengthen cross-border co-operation between vocational schools and employers and promote training, career counselling and company visits were organised for 16 students from the Czech Republic and two educational consultants in Germany. In the future, this initiative will continue under the title of \u2018Traditional Youth Exchange\u2019. > Policy evidence generated by the project Co-operation between employers\u2019 organisations, trade unions and public employment services in the triangle of Saxony, Lower Silesia and Northern Bohemia is considered a success by the partners and will be continued. In order to evaluate the results of the action a study on cross-border labour market \u2018Today and tomorrow: analysis and overview of approaches to employment and mobility of workers in Poland, the Czech Republic and Germany\u2019 was carried out. Also, four exchanges of good practice, peer reviews and mutual learning events were held. > Dissemination strategy Various information dissemination strategies were applied in 2017. Information was targeted at two main groups - employers and jobseekers - via printed and digital versions of event summaries. Throughout the implementation phase, the project website was the main tool for knowledge sharing. Furthermore, 11 conferences and seminars were organised to disseminate key information on cross-border mobility. For instance, an international conference in Dresden involved key local, regional and national authorities and was open to the public. At the same time, four learning events were organised. The project partners shared the information mostly through their own channels. Finally, events aimed at jobseekers, such as job boards and information and consultation days, were advertised regionally, with the help of advertisements in the local press, public transportation and radio spots. > European added value The EURES TriRegio partnership has contributed to the free movement of workers and enhanced the cohesion in the cross-border region. Cross-border mobility and the activities of EURES-TriRegio contributed to a rise of the employment rate in the region. Furthermore, two EU-wide, multilingual digital data exchange systems were established. Finally, EURES TriRegio has contributed to networking activities not only between cross-border region countries but among other neighbouring states as well. > Gender equality measures The risk of marginalisation and discrimination against female employees can be reinforced due to language barriers. Therefore, the EURES TriRegio partnership has promoted gender equality by providing information in German, Polish and Czech about labour laws, contacts of local trade unions and multilingual lawyers. More information would have been benefitial to follow up on how gender inequalities were considered from different angles in both the technical implementation and content of the partnership\u2019s activities.

        "Projects and organisations funded by the European Union Programme for Employment and Social Innovation (EaSI) 84 > Socioeconomic context The border region between the Netherlands and North Rhine-Westphalia is marked by relatively low mobility flow of young people (15-25 years old). In addition, due to different social benefits, disability pension systems and diplomas recognition practices, German-speaking workers from Belgium commute more often to Germany, than German workers to Belgium. According to a Belgian Trade Union Confederation survey (2014), 6,024 workers travelled to Germany from Belgium, while only 501 workers commuted from Germany to Belgium. In this context, this EURES partnership promotes the rights of employees and employers to move freely within the border region and works towards improving the placement process in the Euregional labour market. Set in the border region of Belgium, Germany and the Netherlands, it covers 21 partner organisations from the Euregios Maas-Rhine, Rhine-Waal, Rhine-Maas-North and Gronau. > Aims of the project/ organisation The main objective of the action was to facilitate free movement of workers in the cross-border region by providing jobseekers and employers with relevant information. At the same time, the action aimed to mitigate the mobility barriers by increasing co-operation among the state institutions responsible for taxation, social security and labour law in the respective geographical areas. Additionally, it sought to promote the transparency of cross-border labour market and tackle the existing skills mismatch in the cross-border region. > Project results, measured impacts, achievements, Lessons learnt A large portfolio of activities was implemented, in co-operation with external partner organisations and employers. Activities could be categorised into the provision of information and facilitation of placements. The activities consisted mainly of organising information events, joint training sessions, workshops, seminars and individual consultations. In order to simplify cross-border recruitment procedure, job board meetings and university fairs were organised. Multilingual, \u2018one-stop-shop\u2019 contact points contributed to removing existing labour mobility bottlenecks and skills mismatch in the cross-border region by providing relevant information to jobseekers and employers. Overall, 21 joint information events were held and over 5,000 individual consultations were provided. Moreover, the speech days were organised and attracted over 500 cross-border workers in German- Dutch region. During the event, specialists from relevant social security authorities and institutions together with EURES advisors provided counselling on cross-border taxation and social benefits. Additionally, EURES advisors supported the employers with the recruitment of cross-border workers. In 2017, 28 visits were made to employer\u2019s organisations to facilitate job placements and recruitment procedures. Finally, the implemented activities led to enhanced collaboration between project partners, key stakeholders and local, regional and national authorities. The partnership acted as a forum for debates regarding the enforcement of workers\u2019 rights and better access to social benefits. > Policy evidence generated by the project Two reports and two databases were developed to inform policy-makers about potential policy developments in the cross-border region. Moreover, one training event for policy- makers was held. Additionally, throughout 2017, information exchange sessions, mainly at regional level, with politicians and various members of the cross-border partnership took place. The support of the policy-makers enabled to reach the objectives of the action. > Dissemination strategy Project results were disseminated using a variety of means. First of all, seminars, workshops were carried out and a database was developed. Moreover, information was disseminated internally through seven border info points. Brochures, guides and leaflets were printed and handed out. Regional and local decision-makers and social partners were reached by posting information on social websites (Twitter, Facebook) and traditional information sources such as newspaper, magazines, radio and television. Finally, the network of EURES advisers and social partners supported dissemination of relevant information through their channels. In addition, information to potential jobseekers was provided ",

        "Projects and organisations funded by the European Union Programme for Employment and Social Innovation (EaSI) 87 > Socioeconomic context When compared to the working population as a whole, the mobility flows in the region are relatively small-scale. The majority of commuters are employed in industrial goods, retail and logistics sectors. Moreover, mobility tendencies correlate with housing prices in the cross-border region. Due to higher real-estate prices in East Flanders (Belgium) as compared with the prices in Zeeland (Netherlands), workers are more likely to commute from East Flanders to Zeeland rather than from Zeeland to East Flanders. The low scale cross-border labour mobility is troubling because in the Dutch and Belgian border regions, labour supply and demand do not always match. While the current labour shortages could be solved by widening the geographical scope of workers\u2019 recruitment, employers usually rely on hiring strategies lacking incentives for cross-border labour mobility. Potential workers are discouraged by a lack of information on working conditions and possibilities for guide and advice. > Aims of the project/organisation The principal aim of this action was the promotion of cross- border labour market mobility within the region of Antwerp, East and West-Flanders (in Belgium) and North-Brabant and Zeeland (in the Netherlands). The action focused on increasing opportunities for jobseekers and employers from both sides of the border. Moreover, the action aimed to provide training to support cross-border mobility and develop mixed cross-border recruitment teams to facilitate the access to job vacancies for jobseekers. The specific objectives were the following: 1) to provide employment services to workers and employers in the cross-border region; 2) to provide employment services to actual and potential cross-border commuters, mobile jobseekers and employers; 3) to develop innovative and efficient service delivery mechanisms; 4) to monitor and report labour mobility obstacles; 5) to deliver information exchange sessions between EURES advisers and other relevant actors; 6) to develop integrated co- operation between the partnership, stakeholders and other labour market initiatives, in particular, through the Interreg programme Vlaanderen-Nederland; and 7) to improve visibility and access to EURES services. > Project results, measured impacts, achievements A wide range of activities were carried out under the partnership \u2013 11 work packages were successfully implemented. Activities focusing on the provision of information and advice for actual and potential cross-border workers ensured that vacancies were regularly exchanged between the EURES advisors and employment services. Registered jobseekers were directly informed of the job openings in the cross-border region. In 2018, an application was developed to assist with the matching of CVs and employers in the cross-border labour market. The EURES advisors were regularly approached to attend job fairs and events organised by parties within their network. In addition, three new activities were instigated. These included the development of a brochure for employers; production of an animation film about cross-border mobility and running the EURES newsletter. The partnership coordinator ensured a regular update of the website with relevant news items, the posting of events and contact information. Furthermore, three information and advice sessions and a job fair, mainly targeting employers and students, were organised. Jobseekers were provided with tailored guidance regarding job application procedures in the cross-border region. Finally, a brochure titled \u2018ABC for cross-border workers\u2019 was published in hard copy and digital form. Overall, 5,101 individual and 69 group contacts between EURES advisors, jobseekers and employers were carried out and 151 placements inside and outside Scheldemond region were made. > Identification of good practices Recognising the importance of job quality and sustainability, the action put a strong emphasis on access to a decent job with fair working conditions and rights. A meeting on fair mobility took place to discuss the issue. Participants agreed that the absence of a fair mobility approach would have a detrimental effect on good cross-border labour mobility and could be disadvantageous for both employees and companies. Therefore, they opted for the development of an instrument that would allow an easy check of the main lines of the respective legal acts. The participants have agreed to develop such an instrument in 2018. In addition, a pilot training project for improving jobseekers\u2019 opportunities to find a placement can be identified as a potential good practice. From eight participants that have attended the training, three have found a job and one has found a traineeship placement. The pilot project will be repeated in 2018. Moreover, EURES advisors worked on a new low-threshold approach to improve access to ",
        "Projects and organisations funded by the European Union Programme for Employment and Social Innovation (EaSI) 88 information. They relied on using ABC of cross-border work approach, which will be also applied to the content on the partnership website 117 . > Policy evidence generated by the project Analytical outputs directly related to EURES Scheldemond activities included two internal and unpublished reports on customer satisfaction and key HR challenges. Another report provided a comparative analysis of nursing competences MBO4 verpleegkundige (Netherlands) and HBO5 verpleegskundige (Flanders) 118 . The overall findings gathered over the course of the project implementation were shared with policy-makers. The findings also supported the national coordination office (NCO) as well as public employment services (PES) while implementing initiatives such as Interreg project Grensinformatievoorziening and WerkInzicht. > Lessons learnt The action confirmed a need to further raise employers\u2019 awareness on the potential of cross-border labour mobility and increase provision of transparent information. Strategic partnerships with private employment services should be further pursued. Furthermore, during the implementation phase, it was observed that some employers tend to be biased towards young workers with less experience over people aged 50 and above. Thus, actions in the future should be more strongly orientated towards combatting discrimination and inequalities. > Transferability element(s) of the project/activities The objective to concentrate not only on the quantitative part of cross-border labour mobility but on the qualitative side could be indicated as a potential transferable element to other projects related to cross-border labour mobility. The principle of fair mobility was promoted through the means of awareness raising and information sharing. Innovativeness of the project/activities The novelty of the action lies in the drive to test new services extending further than the regular EURES activities. These include the introduction of post- recruitment support, specific services for placement of long-term unemployed, youth, and disadvantaged jobseekers or the focus on the quality of job vacancies. Also, the inclusion of HR departments and private employment service through the development of network platforms can be considered as innovatory. The action also supported piloting of training supporting cross-border labour mobility for jobseekers and employers and a mentoring project for university graduates for whom Dutch is a second language (Hoger Opgeleide Allochtonen/HOA). > Dissemination strategy The action adopted a diversified approach to dissemination using a number of tools to reach out to diverse audience, particularly vulnerable groups. The project website, which provided information regarding activity-related news and events, was used as a primary dissemination tool. Additional measures were taken to increase the availability of information. For instance, Uitvoeringsinstituut Werknemersverzekeringen (UWV) advisors in co-operation with the EURES advisors, developed a newsletter for jobseekers registered with public employment services. The project team also developed an awareness-raising film about work in the cross-border region. The film was distributed with the website and social media. The quick reference guide was updated in 2016 and handed out to jobseekers and employers at job fairs and events. A brochure for employers recruiting cross-border workers was also developed, next to the ABC for cross-border workers brochure. Finally, four exchanges of good practices, peer reviews and mutual learning events were held. > European added value and New partnerships created The action provided an opportunity for the public employment services to join forces with EURES and other relevant institutions in the provision of services tailored to the needs of this cross- border region. The EU funding ensured a smooth collaboration between the involved public employment services and social partners through the provision of human resources. The action, in turn, facilitated free movement of the labour force in the EU, increased the visibility of EURES and implemented innovative social policy experiments. > Gender equality measures Roughly the same number of men and women took part in the project events. However, no specific measures were taken to promote gender equality. 117 https://werkenoverdegrens.eu/abc-van-de-grensarbeid/ 118 http://www.euresscheldemond.info/fileadmin/user_upload/Analyse_verpleegkundige_opleidingen.pdf ",

        "Projects and organisations funded by the European Union Programme for Employment and Social Innovation (EaSI) 90 > Socioeconomic context The potential for co-operation in the Ireland/Northern Ireland border region has been strongly influenced by thirty years of a violent conflict, which set the communities against each other. The conflict has also adversely affected the views of employers, who have been reluctant to locate start-up businesses in the border region. Additionally, transport infrastructure remains underdeveloped in some areas. Nevertheless, the region is moving on from its recent history and communities are committed to pragmatically work together in seeking for common employment and trade opportunities. With Brexit on a sight, the region runs into yet another major challenge to the co-operation as those living, working and running a business in the cross-border region might especially feel its impacts. > Aims of the project/organisation This particular project of the Ireland/Northern Ireland cross- border partnership aimed to offer services to actual and potential cross-border workers and employers by increasing the visibility of cross-border labour mobility benefits in the border region. In particular, the EURES cross-border partnership aimed to address skills bottlenecks and imbalances through 1) the provision of clear and factual information on living and working conditions, 2) support of employers in finding the required skillsets, and 3) aid jobseekers in cross-border. The partnership also sought to ensure that public employment services (PES) and EURES advisers in both jurisdictions play a more active role while providing services. The specific goals of the partnership were the following: > To address skills mismatches and employment bottlenecks in the region through EU Job Day Online events; > Promote recruitment of people from the live register and those currently neither in employment, education or training with a particular focus on young people and long-term unemployed; > Provide information, counselling, placement and recruitment services for workers and jobseekers regarding job vacancies, job applications, living and working conditions and social security, taxation and labour laws; > Continue developing and modernising information and communication activities to raise awareness of labour mobility opportunities and to promote the services of PES and EURES. > Continue to mainstream EURES in the regular work of PES. > Key results The project partners delivered a range of activities which resulted in 71 people attending training programmes and over 70 migrants or refugees entering the labour market, advancing their careers and integrating into the community. Moreover, four seminars were organised that provided information to small and medium enterprises on employment and business incentives available in the region as well as information regarding tax and social security to both employers and jobseekers. Furthermore, information and advice on job placements and recruitment services were provided through job fairs, which were attended by 2,300 jobseekers and 120 employers. Also, a special effort was made to combat youth unemployment. In relation to this, a cross-border work-shadowing programme was operated to assist 18 young people in entering the cross-border labour market. Moreover, public employment services, local enterprise organisations and INTERTRADE (Cross-border business support) worked together and designed guidelines supporting employers interested in cross-border labour mobility. Consequently, the partnership developed a database to record and report on events and individual adviser activities. This database will also serve as a template for work of regional PES managers in their own organisations. Overall, EURES cross-border advisors dealt with jobseekers and employers during 1,805 individual and 114 group contacts which included 3,211 individuals. > Lessons learnt In this cross-border region, where 1.8 million people in Northern Ireland are entitled to an Irish citizenship, it will be increasingly important to provide cross-border communities with specialised information on cross-border labour mobility. An increased demand for this information was evident at all events and activities. Therefore, it is important that cross- border coordinators are included in national planning to ensure a cohesive and joint approach. > Potential good practice A one-stop-shop 119 website was developed in 2017 as a knowledge hub facility to publicise outcomes (good news stories 119 http://www.eurescrossborder.eu// ",
        "Projects and organisations funded by the European Union Programme for Employment and Social Innovation (EaSI) 91 etc.) and present event reports and photographs. Altogether, 1,521 people visited the website accumulating a total of 6,566 views in the first 10 months. Moreover, the project contributed to the development of a largely rural cross-border region, strengthened and encouraged close relationships and critical linkages between PES and social partners in both jurisdictions. The project also provided a networking platform among national organisations, e.g. PES and EURES managers who would not usually have the opportunity to meet, shared information, learnt from each other and worked together. > Innovativeness of the activities EURES cross-border partnership acted as a laboratory for new initiatives. For instance, 71 EU migrants and refugees in the region were assisted through the provision of the \u2018English for Employability\u2019 and \u2018Communicating across Cultures\u2019 programmes. Migrants and refugees were informed about unique working and living conditions in the region. Moreover, in order to ensure the inclusion of people with speech and hearing disabilities, sign language interpretations were provided at all public EURES cross-border events, and physical assistance was arranged for those with eyesight problems. > Policy evidence generated by the project The reports of the Online Jobs Fairs activities were distributed to national, regional and local policy-makers and EURES partners, PES senior management in both jurisdictions, steering committee, EURES advisers and managers. Five evaluation and impact assessments were implemented, and two new quantitative and qualitative databases were developed. Building on the generated evidence, the partnership will focus in the future on implementing four main recommendations: 1. The work of the EURES Cross-border partnership will be further enhanced by continuing to ensure that mainstreaming is embedded not only in PES but also in partner organisations. 2. Qualitative and quantitative reporting has been essential for the development of the partnership\u2019s work. That is why the partnership developed a database to record and report on events and individual adviser activity which will be rolled out in 2018. This database will also serve as a template for work of regional PES managers in their own organisation. 3. Considering the developments under EURES, the partnership will examine its mission statement to consider any changes. 4. Follow up with employers and event participants should be further developed. A peer review exercise with other cross- border partnerships and the European Commission should be pursued. > Dissemination strategy The information of the project was disseminated using a variety of different means. Three exchanges of good practices, peer reviews and mutual learning events as well as eight conferences and seminars, which attracted more than 2,000 participants, were held. Events and activities were promoted in regional newspapers, radio advertisements and on PES and partners\u2019 websites. It is worth to mention that an article and editorial on EURES were published in the high circulation edition of the Enterprise magazine that was distributed to all passengers on the main cross-border train route. Therefore, the results were relayed to the ultimate target group. > European added value The EU\u2019s support via the EaSI programme is invaluable and makes a tangible and practical impact in this region thanks to the provision of financial support and advice along with access to the EURES network and portal. The partnership continued to offer client services to actual and potential cross-border workers as well as employers through promoting the benefits of cross-border labour mobility and improving awareness of job opportunities and career development. The employers were encouraged to see the potential of having access to a larger cross-border labour market and free EURES cross-border services in the region. Moreover, the partnership promoted benchmarking through organising two mutual learning events about employer engagement strategies between Ireland, Northern Ireland and other countries of the UK. Due to its transnational character, the project mitigated cross-border mobility barriers by providing information about cross-border taxation, social security, education, medical care and equality issues. > Gender equality measures In all of the events women and men were represented almost equally, with women slightly outnumbering men in most cases. Moreover, all EURES advisers received equality training and engaged with the designated equality authorities. Lastly, a newly established website has a specific section dedicated to information and guidance on equality and discrimination issues. ",

        "Projects and organisations funded by the European Union Programme for Employment and Social Innovation (EaSI) 93 > Socioeconomic context The cross-border region between Algarve (Portugal) and Andaluc\u00eda (Spain) is marked by a rapidly increasing number of commuters. At the same time, disparities exist between labour, fiscal and social security regimes as well as health care and educational systems. Language difference is another barrier to cross-border mobility. The present set of issues challenge the future of cross- border labour mobility in the region. > Aims of the project/ organisation EURES Transboundary Andaluc\u00eda-Algarve partnership was established in 2017 to enhance free movement of the labour force. With a distinctive focus on information provision, this particular action sought to remove recruitment barriers by providing a full range of services to workers and employers. Moreover, particular attention was given to vulnerable cross- border workers such as the young and long-term unemployed people. Finally, the partnership aimed to tackle discrimination and marginalisation practices in cross-border labour mobility. More specifically, the objectives of the action were the following: 1. To create a EURES cross-border services framework between Andaluc\u00eda and Algarve which would provide specific and personalised services to frontier workers and employers; 2. Intensify the visibility of EURES in the cross-border region and provide mobility facilitating services to targeted groups; 3. Initiate the design of future recruitment projects that would consider the concrete recruitment needs of the border businesses; 4. Build up a larger EURES cross-border partnership structure that would progressively incorporate other key stakeholders in the region; 5. Monitor mobility in the region to analyse the quality of student job placements, job vacancies and the integration process of workers; 6. Monitor and gather statistical data regarding cross- border mobility trends. > Project results and achievements Since 2017, numerous activities were implemented by the partnership. First, information and counselling services were provided to jobseekers thus facilitating employment procedures. The provided information included an overview of different social security benefits and tax obligations. Information brochures for jobseekers and employers were also created. Second, in order to raise the visibility of EURES cross-border partnership, a communication strategy with target groups was designed. The strategy included the development of a website 120 , advertising employment services of Andaluc\u00eda and Algarve via social media sites and initiating a campaign aimed at increasing visibility of the partnership. The key goal of the communication strategy was to facilitate the access to vacancies, inform jobseekers about living and working conditions in the region and provide contacts of EURES cross- border officers and advisors for future reference. Third, a joint meeting with public employment services and jobseekers from Andaluc\u00eda and Algarve as well as events targeting students were held. The latter include an employment fair for 300 students at the University of Huelva, workshop at the University of Algarve and two information sessions in employment offices in Algarve. Finally, in order to integrate partner organisations and expand the reach of the partnership, a one-stop-shop network was established. Thus, by bringing together the expertise of trade-unions, employer\u2019s organisations and other territorial authorities, the action has succeeded to set up an efficient one-stop-shop network, providing services to cross-border workers and employers. Overall, EURES advisors carried out 37 individual contacts with jobseekers and employers (most of the users requested information regarding the job fair and existing employment opportunities in both regions). 120 http://www.eures-andalucia-algarve.eu/ ",
        "Projects and organisations funded by the European Union Programme for Employment and Social Innovation (EaSI) 94 > Measured impacts The action had the following impact on each target group: 1. Impact on jobseekers and workers: increased visibility and availability of EURES cross-border services. Moreover, the activity contributed to removing mobility barriers by providing relevant information. 2. Impact on employers: a wider range of professional profiles which enabled to recruit workers with the right qualifications was made available online. > Lessons learnt The partners learnt that the effectiveness of the partnership could be enhanced by building a network which furthers the integration of partners and develops local and regional institutional linkages. In order to reach the unmet needs of the 2017 action, the partnership is planning to strengthen its effectiveness with the incorporation of two new entities in 2018, both of which function as associated organisations. Also, the partnership will seek to strengthen collaboration with other territorial networks and relevant institutions such as social security, taxation and health-care authorities with the purpose to promote the better functioning of the cross- border labour market. > Identification of potential good practices The partnership was eager to properly monitor the quality of the provided services. The tools have helped to register user information and were useful in carrying out an action analysis and for presenting evidence to policy-makers. Nevertheless, the monitoring tools mainly covered data from the Andalusia region, as due to administrative obstacles no data was gathered from Algarve. It is expected that the updated quantitative data will be provided in the 2018 report of the next action. > Policy evidence generated by the project The project partners developed a quantitative and qualitative database, a report and four evaluation and impact assessment studies. Using indicators developed in the study titled \u2018The Labour market and labour mobility between Spain and Portugal\u2019, the partnership also developed monitoring tools used to gather user information. Furthermore, driven by the interest of all involved partners and institutions and the positive results of the current action, the partnership has submitted a proposal for a new project which has been awarded a grant. Recommendations from the EU and lessons learnt from the current action will serve as a lever for the implementation of the second action. > Dissemination strategy The results and achievement of the partnership were mostly disseminated on the partnership website (both in Spanish and Portuguese) and through three training sessions and two mutual learning, exchange of good practices events. Furthermore, three general information brochures for jobseekers, workers and employers were designed and are available on the partnership website. Moreover, local authorities were informed by training sessions, territorial authorities and directorate of public employment offices were reached by meetings. > European added value The EU grant has enhanced the capacity of public employment services and other relevant authorities to conduct a wide range of activities in the field of employment. Not only has the action had an effect in both territories, but in the medium term, it is expected to have an impact in other similar EURES cross-border partnerships and territories thanks to the good practice exchange sessions. The action has also contributed to the implementation of EU legislation in the field of labour mobility by monitoring project activities, including the quality of services\u2019 provision. Finally, the action addressed and mitigated cross-border mobility bottlenecks by providing information to users and carrying out networking activities with other agents. ",

        "Projects and organisations funded by the European Union Programme for Employment and Social Innovation (EaSI) 96 > Socioeconomic context The situation in the Norwegian labour market has been marked by a continuing decrease in unemployment. In 2017, the unemployment rate was 2.4%, compared to 2.8% in 2016. While property management, construction and health sectors experience labour surplus, service and sale, hospitality, teaching, transport and storage sectors are experiencing labour force shortages. In spite of these developments, every year, less and less workers from EU Member States take up jobs in Norway. This action feeds into this context by showcasing the potential of developing intra EU-EEA labour market and benefits of intra EU-EEA mobility. > Aims of the project/ organisation The overall aim of this action was to facilitate voluntary and fair labour mobility in the EEA countries as well as support the work of the EURES network in EEA countries in line with the standards and procedures established in the EURES regulation. The action also sought to focus on vulnerable groups, promote gender equality, combat any kind of discrimination and promote a high quality and sustainable employment. Finally, the overall goal of the action was to integrate EURES with national priorities and strategies and to mitigate barriers restricting free movement of workers. > Project results, measured impacts, achievements, Lessons learnt The EURES partnership in Norway has implemented numerous activities in order to facilitate the free movement of labour force between Norway and EU/EEA. Norway contributed to the EURES programming cycle and information exchange sessions between Member States. Specifically, two meetings at national level with EURES line managers were organised. The meetings resulted in an exchange of good practices between EURES members. Moreover, during the meetings, a new organisational setup of EURES in Norway was designed and the more active role and functions of the national coordination office were discussed. In general, 167 events supporting networking and co-operation meetings were held. Moreover, job matching and placement procedures were facilitated. The result was achieved due to successful local and regional job fairs and recruitment events. Jobseekers from Norway and employers from EU/EEA participated and provided opportunities for jobseekers and employers to learn more about the advantages of mobility, especially with regard to finding a job or the right candidate. To achieve full effect, some events were carried out in co-operation with a local NAV. Additionally, 14 people from EURES Members and the Norwegian Labour and Welfare Administration (NAV) participated in classroom training and eight people from EURES Members and NAV participated in virtual training. Finally, the visibility and awareness of Norway\u2019s EURES in EU/EEA countries were increased. The responsible body for dissemination, the National Coordination Office, organised an information dissemination seminar for the public employment services and EURES staff. Furthermore, an official guide to working or doing business in Norway \u2018Work in Norway 121 \u2019 was promoted. Overall, the EURES advisors had a contact with a total of 7,268 employers from different sectors. Norwegian employers recruited 802 people from another EU/EEA country and EURES services have assisted 174 jobseekers in other countries. The EURES members reported that 2,467 individual contacts with jobseekers and employers regarding cross-border issues were carried out. > Identification of potential good practices The objectives were reached by organising numerous meetings with local, regional, national and EU-level stakeholders. The willingness to participate and organise a vast number of events could be identified as a good practice of the action not only for result dissemination but also for increasing visibility. In particular, 209 events supporting capacity building and 167 events supporting networking and co-operation meetings were organised. > Policy evidence generated by the project The national coordination office conducted an internal survey on the awareness of EURES initiatives and services among public employment services. The survey data showed that 121 https://www.nav.no/workinnorway/en/Home ",
        "Projects and organisations funded by the European Union Programme for Employment and Social Innovation (EaSI) 97 there is a sufficient knowledge and awareness regarding the EURES services. The respondents also pointed out that, in their view, services are tailored more to employers rather than jobseekers. > Dissemination strategy The results and achievements of the action were communicated through a set of means, such as EURES postcards, posters and short films. Best practices were shared in the local press and on the NAV intranet. Furthermore, the EURES Norway communication platform supported information dissemination activities. EURES cooperated with the EU mobility networks and other authorities. Therefore, constant information flow within and outside Norway was achieved. > European added value EU funding was vital to achieve and support the partnership\u2019s objectives. The core benefit of the action was the enhancement of free movement of EU/EEA workers. At the same time, visibility and awareness of EURES have been increased. > Gender equality measures As a public body, NAV is obliged by law to take gender equality into consideration at all levels. For instance, publication of vacancies in NAV\u2019s database is based on rules to combat discrimination based on sex, racial or ethnic origin, religion or belief, disability, age or sexual orientation. To ensure this, NAV has developed guidelines for job vacancies to be published on NAV\u2019s web page. ",

Therefore, keeping foreign jobseekers well-informed and recruiting employees from abroad has become a top priority of EURES Iceland. > Aims of the project/ organisation The action aimed to facilitate and enhance mobility between (and within) the EEA countries, EU and Iceland. Concurrently, it aimed to contribute to the EU policy in promoting sustainable employment and fighting poverty and social exclusion. The specific objectives were the following: (1) to focus on enhancing the effectiveness of job and skills matching and placement procedures; (2) commence the preparation plans for the implementation of EURES regulations; (3) enhance the quality of services provided to local employers; and (4) decrease youth unemployment rate. The action was also based on a pragmatic vision to be able and ready to adjust the action\u2019s design due to rapidly changing labour market context. > Project results, measured impacts, achievements Nine work packages were implemented and led to the creation of special EURES National Coordination Office (NCO) group and a workplace, where information, training material, specific instructions and minutes of the meetings were disseminated. Furthermore, in 2017 the action plan proceeded with legal and IT departments in drawing up an admission system and facilitated job and skills matching and placement procedures by posting vacancies in English and Icelandic on EURES website. Further steps were taken to raise the visibility and increase awareness of EURES Iceland by launching a Facebook page, holding EURES day and an ad- hoc information and training sessions for public employment services\u2019 staff. The implemented activities resulted in 241 confirmed placements. The action had a major impact on employers and jobseekers due to professional assistance. The partnership has carried out 3,657 information provision, counselling, recruitment and placement services. Moreover, in an indirect way, the promotion of high quality and sustainable employment, social protection and non-discrimination were addressed by surveying employers for information regarding wages and other employment terms. The action also put a strong focus on transnational networking. EURES Iceland participated in an event organised by the Nordic-Baltic Co-operation (Nordic-Baltic Eight \u2013 NB8) and an event organised by the European group. The European group represents active EU programmes in Iceland (Erasmus+, Enterprise Europe and Horizon 2020). Internal organisational changes, requiring the active involvement of EURES assistants in regional offices, were considered as the biggest challenge for the implementation of the 2017 action. > Identification of potential good practices EURES Iceland actively participated in a special working group devoted to fighting against human trafficking in Iceland. Employees will continue to receive informal training from stakeholders within the group and will learn how to handle such cases in 2018. > Innovativeness of the project/activities Action and its implemented activities are first and foremost novel due to efficient use of limited resources. For instance, PES resources were used and EURES assistants were given a more active role in the service delivery. > Policy evidence generated by the project In order to provide policy-makers with policy-relevant evidence, the emphasis was put on the follow-ups and the presentations of service results. It is expected that throughout years accumulated experience will facilitate the adoption of EURES regulation process. > Dissemination strategy The results from meetings, training and webinars were reported to public employment services and were further disseminated through organisational channels.

First, meetings with local, regional and national authorities were held. Meetings were useful for acquiring first-hand experience and knowledge regarding cross- border labour mobility. During the meetings \u2018mobility packages\u2019, containing relevant information regarding cross-border placements and unemployment benefits were developed. Second, information points and service desk were established in both cross-border regions to provide information regarding social security, taxation, living and working conditions. Furthermore, the project partners developed a visibility strategy promoting the info point with an outreach to relevant target groups. The FEMPEX (association of municipalities) also organised a workshop for employees of local administration situated in the border region. Finally, the Spanish trade union UGT carried out a mobility study and prepared a cross-border information guide. Overall, 276 services were provided to jobseekers and employers, and 401 individual contacts with jobseekers and employers were carried out. > Lessons learnt Given that the cross-border Extremadura and Alentejo partnership is a recently established co-operation, the implementation of this action provided relevant insights for its improvement in the next years. First of all, the partnership noted that in order to increase the efficiency of the action, more coherent and up-to-date information on the specific aspects of cross-border mobility needs to be collected. Second, the partnership learnt that municipalities are essential to disseminating information to target groups in the future, thus should have an active role in facilitating cross- border labour mobility. To improve activities, the partnership will from now on also set tangible objectives and indicate and monitor concrete measures during the following actions. > Identification of potential good practices The establishment of the technical network between the social security, taxation bodies and public employment services at both sides of the border can be considered as a potential good practice. The technical network facilitates day-to-day labour movement in the border region and ensures enforcement of commuters\u2019 rights as well as allows identifying the possible administrative, mobility restricting bottlenecks. It also enables the public bodies to receive commuters\u2019 feedback and opinion regarding social security coordination rules and tax agreements. > Policy evidence generated by the project The statistical information regarding participants\u2019 profiles is published on the partnership\u2019s website 122 . In addition, 20 surveys and studies and 20 monitoring and assessment reports on the transposition and implementation of Union law were prepared. Nevertheless, new policy evidence (studies, reports and methodologies) were not produced yet. > New partnerships created The partnership successfully participated in the new call for proposal for 2018. The 2018 action includes several partners such us trade unions and employer associations from both sides of the border as well as associations of town halls. > Dissemination strategy. The main tool for disseminating the information was the partnership website. The partnership developed a statistical document and mobility packages which are accessible on the website. Moreover, other dissemination tools were used. For instance, the visibility of info service point was raised through advertisements in media. > European added value The EURES cross-border Extremadura-Alentejo partnership has contributed to free movement of people by providing relevant information to jobseekers and employers regarding social security and taxation. Moreover, the existing skills mismatch was mitigated as the activity supported employers in finding suitable workers. > Gender equality measures The project partners did not make any direct efforts to ensure gender equality.

The overall goal of the funded organisations active in the promotion of access to finance (microfinance or social enterprise finance) is to support the Commission\u2019s efforts to promote access to microfinance, particularly to vulnerable groups, and stimulate the creation, development and growth of social enterprises, on the basis of an integrated strategy, as set by the Social Business Initiative. To this end, the following types of activities were implemented in 2017: > support for the Commission in its outreach activities at EU, national and local level to ensure the implementation of EU policies in the relevant area, e.g. Programme for Employment and Social Innovation, European Social Fund, Social Business Initiative etc.; > expanding the capacity of the network\u2019s members , including through mutual learning; > voicing the concerns and expectations of organisations facilitating access to finance to (potential) entrepreneurs from disadvantaged and underrepresented groups and social enterprises; > providing data and research on developments in the field and on priority topics. Maps indicating the geographical coverage of actions are not provided in the project fiches of organisations, since most of them cover the whole of Europe and beyond. 123 Funded under the Call for Proposals for Operating Grants Open to EU-Level NGO Networks that have signed a Framework Partnership Agreement for 2014- 2017 and are active in the Area of Social Inclusion and Poverty Reduction or Microfinance and Social Enterprise Finance (VP/2016/012). 124 Introduced in 2010, the European Semester provides a framework for the coordination of economic policies across the European Union and addressing common economic challenges. Every year the Commission undertakes a detailed analysis of each Member State\u2019s plans for budget, macroeconomic and structural reforms. It then provides EU governments with country-specific recommendations for the next 12-18 months. Policy decisions in response to the country-specific recommendations are made by the national government in question, based on whatever action they deem appropriate. ",

        "Projects and organisations funded by the European Union Programme for Employment and Social Innovation (EaSI) 108 > Socioeconomic context The after-effects of the 2008 financial crisis continue to afflict different societies across the EU \u2013 by 2016, every fourth person was at risk of poverty or social exclusion in the EU as a whole. The EU 2020 strategy has been implemented as a response mechanism in order to tackle the issues that have materialised as a result of the crisis, i.e. increased levels of poverty and social exclusion, through different cooperative means. While said problems are being addressed by member organisations in an increasingly proficient manner, there is still plenty of room for improvement. Caritas Europa seeks to optimise the participation of its 49 members in addressing said issues by reinforcing the understanding of key processes of the EU 2020 strategy and stressing their importance in order to bring about a more inclusive EU. > Aims of the project/ organisation Caritas Europa is a network of 49 national organisations in 46 European countries that aims to aid the most deprived members of society, offers services to people experiencing poverty, and advocates for policies affecting them to be changed. Caritas Europa also provides humanitarian aid as well as promotes voluntary work. The main policy themes of the 2017 Work Programme were the following: > Child poverty, including the implementation of the Commission\u2019s Recommendation on investing in Children and the child-related Country-Specific Recommendations (CSRs) produced within the European Semester Process 125 ; > Social exclusion among young people (including the implementation of the Youth Employment Initiative 126 , Youth Guarantee and youth-related CSRs); > Legal, employment and inclusion conditions of migrants and their integration (including CSR addressing social exclusion and legal conditions and unemployment among migrants); > European Pillar of Social Rights 127 , including the collective complaints mechanism of the European Social Charter 128 as an additional tool to ensure that all residents enjoy the social right they are entitled to, thus contributing to achieving the Sustainable Development Goals 129 , and reinforcing the significance of the (Revised) European Social Charter 130 ; > Social economy and social innovation; > Any other policy area that may affect the objective of poverty reduction and social inclusion in Europe. > Project results, measured impacts, achievements, Lessons learnt In 2017, Caritas Europa along with its member organisations carried on providing relevant inputs to decision-makers, both at the national level and EU level, regarding the development and implementation of social policies. The network also identified the policies\u2019 impacts, risks, and gaps and provided constructive proposals concerning the development of the European social model(s) in the future, with a special focus on family. Additionally, EU decision-makers continued to recognise Caritas Europa as a relevant partner in policy dialogue and were provided counsel in the fields of social policy, migration and social economy through Caritas Europa\u2019s lobbying and advocacy activities. Further actions included member organisations of Caritas Europa increasing their capacity in regard to advocacy and networking, organisational development and financial sustainability by meeting and sharing their experience. Lastly, Caritas Europa Mapping 131 \u2013 an online platform where Caritas Europa member organisations will be able to share and find information about each other \u2013 was jointly developed in order to collect and analyse data at the grassroots level. This platform allows Caritas Europa to have a) more and better evidence- based data on the situation of poverty, social policies, good practices in social innovation and the possibility to upscale these practices, and b) improved sharing of experiences and key information \u2013 both of which contribute to continuous improvement, mutual learning and joint actions. 125 https://ec.europa.eu/info/business-economy-euro/economic-and-fiscal-policy-coordination/eu-economic-governance-monitoring-prevention-correction/ european-semester_en 126 http://ec.europa.eu/social/main.jsp?catId=1176 127 https://ec.europa.eu/commission/priorities/deeper-and-fairer-economic-and-monetary-union/european-pillar-social-rights_en 128 https://www.coe.int/en/web/turin-european-social-charter 129 https://ec.europa.eu/europeaid/policies/sustainable-development-goals_en 130 https://rm.coe.int/168007cf93 131 http://mapping.caritas.eu/ ",

In 2017, Caritas Europa proposals for recommendations on social rights and the European Pillar of Social Rights were adopted by the Conference of International Non-Governmental Organisations of the Council of Europe 132 . Some of the suggestions include earmarking at least 30% of the European Social Fund 133 for social inclusion and the fight against poverty, providing greater visibility to children in poverty and their families in the next EU\u2019s Multi-Annual Financial Framework (2021-27) 134 , as well as approaching and acknowledging social spending as a social investment (e.g. in education or leading to reduced health costs). > Dissemination strategy Both Caritas Europa and its member organisations engaged in disseminating information about the implemented activities. Some centralised dissemination activities in 2017 included media (15 press releases yielded 94 media mentions in 12 countries), social media (1,043 Twitter posts and 666 Facebook posts), intra-network email communication (24 email alerts) as well as diverse level events. Overall, media engagement has significantly increased in comparison to the previous year. Communication activities of Caritas Europa target media, decision-makers and other civil society organisations present in Brussels, as well as the whole European Caritas Network and a broader public. > Sustainability measures Caritas Europa worked towards sustainability, empowering its members to contribute to advocacy activities by providing collected information, building capacities, and networking. Their inputs, analyses, and country-specific reports were shared with relevant stakeholders in the EU and used in ongoing activities throughout the year. All the activities implemented contribute to dialogue and advocacy strategies towards bringing about change for people experiencing poverty. > Gender equality measures Caritas Portugal, in partnership with the Portuguese Commission for Citizenship and Gender Equality, created the \u2018Igualitas\u2019 project which provides awareness raising materials about equal opportunities in employment and work-life balance. Furthermore, a toolkit 135 with tips to empower women inside their own organisations was produced. 132 https://www.coe.int/en/web/ingo/home 133 http://\\\\ec-bir-fs01\\fdrive\\Birmingham\\MSU\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Windows\\INetCache\\Content.Outlook\\JNQM819E\\ec.europa.eu\\esf\\home.jsp 134 https://ec.europa.eu/commission/sites/beta-political/files/communication-modern-budget-may_2018_en.pdf 135 https://www.caritas.eu/blog/honouring-the-social-service-and-care-workers-who-contribute-to-the-wellbeing-of-vulnerable ",

Currently, ESN unites over 120 member organisations in 33 countries. > Aims of the project/ organisation The network\u2019s programme for 2017 focused on the political priorities of the EC regarding the social welfare reform and the modernisation of social protection by addressing key challenges for public social services, e.g. the so-called refugee crisis. > Project results, measured impacts, achievements, Lessons learnt In 2017, ESN continued to monitor the European Semester 136 process. An analysis of the EC\u2019s country-reports and country- specific recommendations was carried out by the European Social Network\u2019s European Semester Reference Group 137 . The reference group also provided their perspective on social issues felt at the local level. The analysis was presented in the European Social Network\u2019s annual report \u2018Bringing together Europe and local communities: Social services priorities for the European Semester 2018\u2019 138 . The report identified several recurring themes, placing particular emphasis on social policy and service implementation, social care for older people, development of community- based services, promotion of more inclusive policies, and the implementation of administrative reforms across the EU. According to the report, the European Pillar on Social Rights 139 should recognise the public authorities\u2019 duty of care towards the individual throughout the life course to ensure that its social protection principles go hand in hand with local statutory duties. The provided analysis also contributed to discussions that took place in the annual meeting between the reference group members and representatives of the EC. Additionally, ESN held three meetings on the social services\u2019 perspective on the modernisation of social welfare. The meetings provided contextual background on developments and issues felt by social services. Further issues discussed included growing inequalities in Europe stemming from the financial crisis and the resulting need to ensure the sustainability of public services against a backdrop of austerity measures. Lastly, a number of activities involving ESN members took place to reflect on the challenges and opportunities for social services in addressing social welfare trends and steering preparations for European Social Network\u2019s 2018-2021 strategy, e.g. a seminar on \u2018Migrant children and young people: Social inclusion and transition to adulthood\u2019. > Identification of potential good practices ESN implemented an aspiring and wide-ranging 2017 work programme, focussing on a number of main themes, including disabilities and ageing, migrant children, social protection and social services within the European Semester process, as well as on a general forward-looking reflection on the future of welfare. The work programme combined several instruments and channels, such as working groups, member meetings, a seminar and participation in third-party activities. > Policy evidence generated by the project In 2017, ESN continued providing valuable inputs on social policy formulation to EU policy-makers and other respective entities. The network published two toolkits, advising senior practitioners in local social services on active ageing, integrated care, the workforce and independent living in the fields of disability and older people\u2019s services.

For example, it provided inputs into several of the EU\u2019s main social policy initiatives such as children\u2019s services, disability, ageing and care, activation and social welfare reform. Additionally, the network continued to raise awareness of EU policies among its members at a local level, enhanced networking and the exchange of good practices among its members and those active in delivering social services and addressing the issues of poverty and social exclusion. > Sustainability measures The network drafted a strategy for its future areas of work ranging from 2018 to 2021, which will highlight, support and assess the role and importance of quality social services in the implementation of key EU social inclusion policies. ESN will continue to connect policy, practice and research through a series of knowledge exchange activities, such as working groups, workshops and seminars, and work with external experts to research and produce professional outputs on key social inclusion themes and implementation at local level. 140 https://www.linkedin.com/groups/4644372 141 https://twitter.com/ESNsocial ",

It offers its members a platform for sharing knowledge, exchanging ideas and aims to shift the focus of EU legislation in a way that allows city governments to tackle strategic challenges at a local level. > Aims of the project/ organisation The EUROCITIES Social Affairs Forum is one of the six thematic forums through which the network\u2019s day-to-day work is conducted. In 2017 its priorities were the following: tackling rising inequality and poverty levels in cities across Europe, integrating refugees and asylum seekers both into the labour market and education, fostering Roma inclusion on a local level, promoting labour market inclusion, and ensuring social rights for all. The EaSI grant was used to support activities of the Social Affairs Forum and achieve objectives outlined in the grant agreement. > Project results, measured impacts, achievements, Lessons learnt In 2017, similarly to the preceding year, EUROCITIES continued to improve knowledge of its members on the European Pillar of Social Rights 142 through regular policy briefings. It engaged senior policy-makers, both politicians and city administrators, in EU social policy development through a high-level roundtable discussion on inclusive labour markets and other high-level events on affordable housing and refugee integration. In order to share their findings on EU social policy-making, EUROCITIES produced several publications reflecting on the feedback of member cities. The policy statements elaborated on the following: the Cohesion Policy 143 , by providing inputs on the European Social Fund 144 and its social inclusion aspects; the European Pillar of Social Rights, by exploring cities\u2019 capacity to bring policy change at a local level as well as highlighting their contribution to the development of the Pillar; and other important dissemination. A mapping report on the situation of Roma in EUROCITIES, along with other reports, was also generated and covered the characteristics of Roma communities and the key challenges they face. As a result, EU policy-making has been enriched by evidence on trends in social policy development and good practices from the local level in the following areas: social entrepreneurship, labour market integration of refugees and asylum seekers, and Roma inclusion. EUROCITIES also organised several events for its members in order to share information and encourage learning. Two meetings of the Social Affairs Forum were held: one in Lisbon (focusing on Urban Poverty) and one in Gothenburg (focusing on the European Pillar of Social Rights). The events were attended by over 120 experts, NGO representatives as well as local and European level stakeholders. The participants shared transferable practices and discussed opportunities for joint actions regarding housing, homelessness, migrant integration, Roma inclusion, urban ageing, smart social inclusion, education, employment and inclusive labour market. > Identification of potential good practices EUROCITIES acts as a platform for its members to share knowledge and exchange ideas that have a direct impact on policies at a local level. For example, thanks to the mutual learning between cities during the study visit in Cluj- Napoca in September 2017, the two different departments in Gothenburg, one in charge of promoting social inclusion of Swedish Roma and, the one promoting social inclusion of Roma EU mobile citizens residing in Sweden started to collaborate and work together to bridge the gaps and the unequal treatment of the two different Roma groups in their city. Other instances of sharing good practices include the Annual Convention for Inclusive Growth during which Ghent representatives presented how a Youth Guarantee 145 project implemented at the local level could open up quality pathways for young people. At the same event, Nantes presented how the city is investing in affordable childcare to break the cycle of disadvantage and lift barriers to employment, and Barcelona presented the city\u2019s labour market insertion scheme for young people. 142 https://ec.europa.eu/commission/priorities/deeper-and-fairer-economic-and-monetary-union/european-pillar-social-rights_en 143 http://ec.europa.eu/regional_policy/en/faq/ 144 http://ec.europa.eu/esf/home.jsp 145 http://ec.europa.eu/social/main.jsp?catId=1079 ",

It focused on high- priority issues such as Roma inclusion, the refugee crisis, homelessness, etc. For example, the report on \u2018Labour Market Integration of Refugees and Asylum Seekers\u2019 examines the inclusion of refugees and asylum seekers into the labour market as an essential factor of integration at a local level. The presented findings show that adjusting the policy approach at a local level is vital by having direct, shared responsibility and providing integration via work rather than the \u2018integrate first, work later\u2019 method. > Dissemination strategy Publicity measures aimed at awareness raising included: 4 online Social Affairs Forum newsletters, 3 websites, 1 twitter account, 3 videos and 5 shorter video capsules with interviews, 45 articles on EUROCITIES flash newsletter, 40+ Articles in the EU, National or local press and 6 Social Affairs Forum policy updates. There were 2,153 downloads of EUROCITIES publications from the social affairs publication section of the official website 146 . > European added value With the support of the EaSI grant, EU policy-making has been augmented with good practices from the local level, with the analysis of challenges faced by the cities in implementing such policies as migration and integration, skills, the Youth Guarantee and the EU urban agenda, and with suggestions for their improvement. Dedicated programmes for mutual learning and knowledge transfer have been created among local public administrations on Roma inclusion, migrant integration, social housing, inclusive labour markets, active inclusion of homeless people, social innovation and inclusive public services. Finally, in 2017 real policy change in Gothenburg emerged due to the transfer of good practices among cities on Roma inclusion, refugee and migrant integration and inclusive labour markets. > Sustainability measures The network will continue its work on the inclusion Roma as well as refugees and the creation of inclusive labour markets in cities through the network\u2019s initiatives: Solidarity Cities and Declaration on Work. It will engage its members in support for the Commission in the development and implementation of the European Pillar of Social Rights through EUROCITIES high-level roundtable discussions and other events. > Gender equality measures EUROCITIES published a position piece 147 titled \u2018Towards a stronger future for a Europe of citizens\u2019.

        "Projects and organisations funded by the European Union Programme for Employment and Social Innovation (EaSI) 117 > Socioeconomic context Established in 2004, Eurochild is a network of organisations working with and for children throughout Europe and striving for a society that respects the rights of children. It advocates for children\u2019s rights and well-being to be at the heart of EU and national policy-making. The United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child 148 is the foundation of all Eurochild\u2019s work. > Aims of the project/ organisation With the EaSI current operating grant, Eurochild\u2019s ambition is to mobilise its members towards better implementation of Europe 2020. Accordingly, it aims to support, influence and monitor EU driven processes to improve outcomes for children at national and subnational levels. Further aims include increasing the network\u2019s outreach to its members and the members\u2019 advocacy capacity and strengthening the internal working of the network as well as external representation. Lastly, Eurochild intends to continue pooling evidence and relevant information for its policy and advocacy work through its members and partners so as to gather a strong evidence-base on trends concerning children and their families in Europe. > Project results, measured impacts, achievements, Lessons learnt Eurochild contributes to EU policy debate by bringing the perspective of children and the organisations working with and for children. In 2017, Eurochild implemented its research project \u2018Childonomics\u2019 on measuring the long-term social and economic value of investing in children. The advocacy for the project is grounded in strengthening the economic case in support of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child, and the United Nations Guidelines on Alternative Care 149 . The current plan is to look into long-term societal costs linked to insufficient investments as well as misdirected funding of outdated care systems \u2013 both of which disenfranchise and further marginalise vulnerable children and families. The network conducted a number of meetings and events. For example, an event was organised in the European Parliament on Universal Children\u2019s Day, in partnership with the United Nations Children\u2019s Fund 150 (UNICEF), hosted by the European Intergroup on Children\u2019s Rights and under the auspices of the European Parliament President Antonio Tajani. During the event, the participating children and other young people who form the Eurochild Children\u2019s Council held debates on children\u2019s rights, engaged in the development of the Eurochild Child Participation Strategy, and met over a dozen MEPs so as to begin their advocacy work. In 2017, Eurochild also adopted and implemented the Eurochild\u2019s Child Participation Strategy that included setting up a Eurochild Children\u2019s Council and a renewed Children Participation Reference Group. The document presents steps that need to be taken so as to make child participation improve and happen on a more frequent basis. Lastly, the network adopted the \u2018Child Protection Policy\u2019 in order to address and protect children and other young people from potential abuse and exploitation during their involvement with Eurochild. The move is perceived as crucial in ensuring that underaged children have the rights, information as well as the space in which they can share their views and engage in effective communication with other children and adults. > Policy evidence generated by the project In 2017, the network produced a flagship report on the European Semester 151 \u2018Investing in children in the era of social rights\u2019 that provides an overview of the situation concerning child poverty and children\u2019s rights in 18 EU countries. In the report, the network\u2019s members highlight some positive example of stakeholder engagement. For instance, the organisation Defence for Children Netherlands 152 was able to productively engage in the Semester process by working with the Semester\u2019s officers located in the country. Accordingly, the organisation produced evidence and recommendations contributing to the Semester based on a perspective of children\u2019s rights. Overall, 148 https://www.ohchr.org/en/professionalinterest/pages/crc.aspx 149 https://www.unicef.org/protection/alternative_care_Guidelines-English.pdf 150 https://www.unicef.org/ 151 https://ec.europa.eu/info/business-economy-euro/economic-and-fiscal-policy-coordination/eu-economic-governance-monitoring-prevention-correction/ european-semester_en 152 https://defenceforchildren.org/dci-netherlands/ ",
        "Projects and organisations funded by the European Union Programme for Employment and Social Innovation (EaSI) 118 the key takeaway of the report is that the need of additional investments in children remains. Further recommendations include the following: avoiding counter-productive country- specific recommendations, ensuring a more effective civil society dialogue, and guaranteeing consistency between the European Semester and the next European funding cycle. Aside from the aforementioned report, Eurochild provided inputs (i.e. briefings, statements, participation in relevant events and consultations) to the European Pillar of Social Rights 153 , and generated feedback on key EU policy developments including the future Multiannual Financial Framework, post-2020 strategy, sustainable development goals 154 , and others. > Dissemination strategy Outputs of Eurochild were disseminated through direct email messages, the website, newsletters and social media channels as well as during key events. Eurochild\u2019s newsletters had a total of 4,400 readers, 5 new videos were produced and gained over 2,000 views on YouTube. The number of followers on Twitter increased by 24%, and the number of supporters on Facebook increased by 15%. > European added value The key added value of Eurochild\u2019s activities was achieved through networking between organisations working in the field of children\u2019s well-being in different countries. A number of activities aimed at improving the network\u2019s outreach to its members and improving the advocacy capacities of members were carried out, including events co-organised with partners from Germany, Spain and Serbia, 2 meetings of the 16 national coordinators of Opening Doors for Europe\u2019s Children 155 , 2 meetings of the 21 national networks of children\u2019s rights, and the previously mentioned event organised in the European Parliament on Universal Children\u2019s Day. Feedback from participants shows that these events had the potential to strengthen national efforts to address insufficient investments in children, poverty and exclusion. > Sustainability measures In order to sustain its policy and advocacy work in 2018, Eurochild will attempt to follow through with the following: continue to monitor EU policy developments from the perspective of child poverty and child rights and provide analysis and recommendations based on members\u2019 expertise; coordinate member-led actions to influence actors/entities on both EU and national levels to prioritise investments in children and tackle child poverty; mobilise members, children, and young people to raise awareness of the EU\u2019s impact on children\u2019s rights and child poverty; and push for greater EU policy and funding to help Member States and accession countries complete the transition from institutional care to family-support and community-based care services. > Gender equality measures The total number of participants in Eurochild events included 754 women and 237 men. Eurochild also produced a position paper 156 on the European Pillar of Social Rights. In said paper, unequal parents\u2019 participation in the labour market is discussed in relation to women\u2019s social exclusion and the negative effects that follow concerning children and families. 153 https://ec.europa.eu/commission/priorities/deeper-and-fairer-economic-and-monetary-union/european-pillar-social-rights_en 154 http://ec.europa.eu/budget/mff/index2021-2027_en.cfm 155 http://www.openingdoors.eu/ 156 https://www.eurochild.org/fileadmin/public/05_Library/Thematic_priorities/02_Child_Poverty/Eurochild/Eurochild_s_Policy_Position_on_the_European_Pillar_ of_Social_Rights.pdf ",

Its members are national and regional institutes, academic and research centres, national and regional authorities and government departments. EuroHealthNet supports their work in the EU and associated states through policy and project development, networking and communications. > Aims of the project/ organisation The two primary aims of EuroHealthNet in 2017 were: 1) to improve and sustain health between and within the European States through action on the social determinants of health, and 2) to tackle health inequalities. > Project results, measured impacts, achievements, Lessons learnt Throughout 2017, EuroHealthNet continued to act as a catalyst that facilitates creative relationships between authoritative bodies and stakeholders from different members states and sectors. The network supported EU, national and regional policy and practice developments relevant to tackling health and social inequities by implementing actions in line with the dynamic EU priorities and instruments. In 2017, EuroHealthNet produced the \u2018Information and Advocacy Action Plan\u2019, which included four policy briefs, a report and briefing on the European Semester 157 analysis, as well as one info-sheet on the approved European Pillar of Social Rights 158 . The plan accentuated the importance of modern, effective, and sustainable health promotion via digital and technological advances. Further emphasis was placed on tackling health inequalities between and within EU countries through an integrated holistic approach, addressing underserved occupational groups, and helping parents combine work with parental responsibilities. EuroHealthNet also submitted nine public consultation responses and four inception impact assessment responses to the EC, and provided feedback to the European Committee of Regions (CoR) on its draft paper \u2018Health in Cities: The Common Good\u2019. The network\u2019s representatives also attended the \u2018EU Expert Group of Social Determinants and Health Inequality\u2019 meeting and introduced topics linked to the social policy agenda. Particular emphasis was placed on recognising the central role that health equity plays in building strong and sustainable social market economies. EuroHealthNet representatives pushed for the development of indicators and mechanisms that are able to measure progress concerning health equity across the EU. Further attention was given to the mechanisms that would enable wide-spread access to core health services, and investments towards health promotion and disease prevention. Lastly, it was suggested that the existing \u2018Health System Performance Analysis\u2019 tools need to be harmonised in order to assess national health system performances on health equity. > Identification of potential good practices The network collected and disseminated 85 news items on good practices in high-level events and made them available on its website www.health-inequalities.eu. > Policy evidence generated by the project In 2017, EuroHealthNet continued to collect and disseminate data and evidence on policy developments and trends to tackle health and social inequalities through thematic reports, local case studies and good practices. For example, a policy briefing titled \u2018The European Semester: A health inequalities perspective\u2019 examined three key social determinants of health and how they are represented in the European Semester. The examined determinants were the following: 1) access to health care for all population groups; 2) early childhood education and care; 3) poverty and income inequalities. It was found that more focus should be placed on encouraging investments in primary care, health promotion and disease prevention, especially for the most vulnerable, including migrants. As mentioned previously, the network also produced the 157 https://ec.europa.eu/info/business-economy-euro/economic-and-fiscal-policy-coordination/eu-economic-governance-monitoring-prevention-correction/ european-semester_en 158 https://ec.europa.eu/commission/priorities/deeper-and-fairer-economic-and-monetary-union/european-pillar-social-rights_en ",

Lastly, an updated policy pr\u00e9cis was generated on the European Pillar of Social Rights covering the areas of health care; education, training and life-long learning; access to social protection; work-life balance; and childcare and support for children. > New partnerships created EuroHealthNet implemented joint activities with European Anti-Poverty Network 159 , Eurochild 160 , Eurodiaconia 161 , AGE Platform 162 , Smoke Free Partnership 163 , European Public Health Alliance 164 , Mental Health Europe 165 , European Federation of National Organisations 166 , European Youth Forum 167 , Eurocarers 168 and other. > Dissemination strategy The increased online presence of the network led to an increase of 23,878 views and 4,571 visitors since the previous year. By the end of 2017, EuroHealthNet had nearly 3 000 Twitter followers, 90 Facebook likes, and 800 LinkedIn followers. Hard copies of reports were disseminated at events, conferences and meetings, while digital communications were disseminated through email, websites, social media, newsletters and the EuroHealthNet online magazine. > European added value Thanks to EaSI funding, EuroHealthNet continued to act as a leader of a thematic network of NGOs and stakeholders that are part of the EU Health Policy Forum and developed joint statements for action on health and equity (e.g. EU#4health, AIiC, etc). It has worked closely with partners from the health, social, research, environmental, economic and other sectors to stimulate social investment actions and the engagement of stakeholders on the ground. The network continues to maintain and regularly updates a database of good practices in tackling health inequalities and their social determinants. An exchange of good practices was promoted by organising 4 country exchange visits hosted by Germany, Latvia, Greece and Sweden. The visits increased awareness of EU policies and initiatives, and supported exchanges between members. > Sustainability measures The network will further strengthen the engagement of its members and stakeholders in the strategic issues the European Pillar of Social Rights, the European Semester and the EU Solidarity Corps. It will continue the promotion and exchange of good practices, as well as systematic monitoring of relevant sectors and inter-sectoral work, which are essential in implementing policies related to the social, economic and other determinants of health. > Gender equality measures EuroHealthNet released a policy pr\u00e9cis 169 \u2018Making the Link: Gender Equality and Health\u2019.

        "Projects and organisations funded by the European Union Programme for Employment and Social Innovation (EaSI) 123 > Socioeconomic context FEANTSA was established in 1989 as a European non-governmental organisation to prevent and alleviate the poverty and social exclusion of people threatened by or living in homelessness. It is the only major European network that focuses exclusively on homelessness. Most of FEANTSA\u2019s members are national or regional umbrella organisations of service providers that support homeless people with a wide range of services, including housing, health, employment and social support. Evidence from across Europe continues to point towards a worsening homelessness situation, reaching record numbers across all Member States, except Finland. National upward trends show that millions of people are being left behind due to inadequate policies, leading to dramatic consequences for the European social cohesion and economic stability. > Aims of the project/ organisation Similar to the previous year, FEANTSA aimed to strengthen the evidence base for EU, national and local policies addressing homelessness, and to focus on the most promising practices such as Housing First. It also sought the inclusion of homelessness in the most relevant EU processes, especially the European Semester 170 and the European Pillar of Social Rights 171 > Project results, measured impacts, achievements, Lessons learnt In 2017, FEANTSA produced a statement on the European Semester ahead of the launch of the Annual Growth Survey. Due to its lobbying capacity, the network was able to secure a strong mention of homelessness as a social priority under the chapter on investment. The network also contributed to all the relevant activities of the European Parliament 172 , the European Economic and Social Committee 173 , and the European Committee of Regions 174 (CoR). A large share of the reports of the European Parliament related to the European Semester adopted in 2017 included a strong call to act on homelessness thanks to FEANSTA\u2019s effective lobbying. The network collected and analysed up-to-date information on the homeless population and homelessness policies from all EU Member States represented by FEANTSA. Thanks to the collected data, the FEANTSA was able to provide a number of political and economic entities (e.g. Social Protection Committee 175 , OECD 176 , etc.) with valuable inputs concerning homelessness. Further results include producing a statement on the Europe 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development 177 with concrete suggestions on how to address homelessness at the EU level along the lines of the United Nations\u2019 Sustainable Development Goals 178 . For instance, it is advised that all EU Member States develop homelessness strategies addressing poverty, accommodation, and the inclusion of the homeless as key stakeholders, with the EU acting as a watchdog and supporting the progress. In addition, the network\u2019s campaign \u2018Be Fair, Europe - Stand Up for Homeless People\u2019 was launched in the European Parliament. The campaign includes a manifesto, regular blog posts, roadmaps for EU action in certain policy fields, a twitter hashtag, interviews with key EU leaders by cooperating with the International Network of Street Papers, etc. Furthermore, FEANSTA also produced a toolkit \u2018FEANTSA Ending Homelessness Awards: A Handbook on Using the European Social Fund to Fight Homelessness\u2019 on how the European Social Fund can be used for the fight against homelessness. In the handbook, it is suggested that the new Multi-Annual Financial Framework will require to undergo a fair deal of changes, e.g. including a specific provision for people in the most deprived situations, facilitating integrated approaches, creating opportunities for social investment, etc. Lastly, the network also applied for and obtained the funding of approximately EUR 250 000 from the European Programme for Integration and Migration for a project on free movement and homelessness. The new project called PRODEC \u2013 Protecting the Rights of Destitute Mobile EU Citizens \u2013 is expected to: 1) create a sense of urgency at the European political level on the issue of homelessness among mobile EU citizens, 2) ensure legal certainty concerning the rights of the homeless, and 3) empower those who have become destitute to claim their rights. 170 https://ec.europa.eu/info/business-economy-euro/economic-and-fiscal-policy-coordination/eu-economic-governance-monitoring-prevention-correction/ european-semester_en169 https://eurohealthnet.eu/publication/making-link-gender-equality-and-health 171 https://ec.europa.eu/commission/priorities/deeper-and-fairer-economic-and-monetary-union/european-pillar-social-rights_en 172 http://www.europarl.europa.eu/portal/en 173 https://www.eesc.europa.eu/en/agenda/our-events/events/transition-post-2020-europe 174 https://europa.eu/european-union/about-eu/institutions-bodies/european-committee-regions_en 175 http://ec.europa.eu/social/main.jsp?catId=758 176 https://www.oecd.org/ 177 https://ec.europa.eu/europeaid/policies/european-development-policy/2030-agenda-sustainable-development_en 178 https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/?menu=1300 ",
        "Projects and organisations funded by the European Union Programme for Employment and Social Innovation (EaSI) 124 > Innovativeness of the project/ activities Housing First is arguably the most important innovation in homelessness service design in the last 30 years in that it uses housing as a starting point rather than an end goal, especially for people who need significant levels of support to enable them to escape homelessness. In 2017, FEANTSA continued to develop the Housing Frist Europe Hub. The Hub is now up and running and has an annual budget of approximately EUR 300 000. Furthermore, a website 179 for the Housing First Europe Hub was launched along with a new Twitter account 180 . > Policy evidence generated by the project The European Observatory on Homelessness (EOH), set up by FEANTSA in 1992, has become a lead actor in transnational homelessness research in Europe and beyond. Two editions of the Journal on Homelessness were published in 2017 with a third one currently being underway. The network also produced thematic comparative research \u2018Family Homelessness in Europe: seven EOH Comparative Studies on Homelessness\u2019. The research examines the nature of family homelessness across Europe and provides an overview of the spectrum of preventative measures and other services for families facing homelessness. The annual research conference, organised in co-operation with the University of Barcelona, attracted 200 participants, mostly academics and presented about 40 research papers related to homelessness. Throughout 2017, FEANTSA supported the EC by providing it with extensive data and analysis on homelessness and housing exclusion. The provided data served an important role in developing the 2017 and 2018 country reports. The network also helped get solid references to homelessness in a handful of the 2017 country reports and provided aid in further improving the analysis of the social impact of housing market dynamics. > New partnerships created In 2017, FEANTSA continued to be actively involved in the work of several European networks and alliances as a member of the board, member organisation, or partner. The network managed to convince the following organisations to include homelessness in their lobbying work: European Anti-Poverty Network 181 , European Public Health Alliance 182 , and the Social Platform 183 . Furthermore, FEANTSA was accepted as a member of the Urban Poverty Partnership 184 and undertook a leading in the field of homelessness. > Dissemination strategy EU support allowed FEANTSA to maintain and redesign three websites (FEANTSA 185 , Housing Rights Watch 186 , Housing First Europe Hub), all of which are major European online resources on homelessness. In addition, it published and disseminated three thematic magazines, eleven monthly news flashes, two newsletters on migration and two newsletters on health. In 2017, FEANTSA increased its presence on social media, with 6,200 followers of the related Twitter accounts and over 3,500 likes on Facebook. > European added value EU funding has contributed to FEANTSA\u2019s efforts to put homelessness issues on the EU policy agenda. It provided a platform for homelessness stakeholders to get involved in transnational co-operation and networking. The European Observatory on Homelessness has been a key tool to promote, facilitate and disseminate research on homelessness across Member States and beyond. FEANTSA\u2019s work allowed for proper defence of the interest/concerns of the most vulnerable EU citizens. Homelessness would otherwise be largely absent from EU policy-making. > Sustainability measures FEANTSA will continue to work on enhancing and supporting the progress on tackling homelessness through the European Semester as well as providing further inputs on the design and improvement of Europe 2030 strategy and the European Pillar of Social Rights. All findings and evidence from prior and current publications are available online for further use and scrutiny. > Gender equality measures In 2017, for the very first time, the network organised a European roundtable on women\u2019s homelessness with members and partners. It gave FEANTSA\u2019s work on the gender aspects of homelessness a boost. The efforts of the network throughout 2017 helped put women\u2019s homelessness on the European agenda. FEANTSA also engaged in transnational projects to deliver concrete outcomes with the wealth of expertise of its members and partners on the gender dimension of homelessness. 179 http://www.housingfirsteurope.eu/ 180 http://twitter.com/@HousingFirstHub 181 https://www.eapn.eu/ 182 https://epha.org/ 183 http://www.socialplatform.org/ 184 https://ec.europa.eu/futurium/en/urban-poverty 185 https://www.feantsa.org/en 186 http://www.housingrightswatch.org/ ",

        "Projects and organisations funded by the European Union Programme for Employment and Social Innovation (EaSI) 126 > Socioeconomic context The social, economic and political developments over the last few years have shown that the EU is yet to recover from the economic and social crisis. Additionally, the EU keeps struggling with finding a comprehensive response to the so-called refugee crisis. Against this background, a strong response by civil society is needed more than ever to keep promoting the founding values of the European project. Over the last four years, SOLIDAR has set up 16 national EU strategy groups and is committed to strengthen their capacity and support them in monitoring social progress, the impact of structural reforms and producing recommendations for policies at a national and EU level. > Aims of the project/ organisation SOLIDAR is a European network of civil society organisations working to advance social justice in Europe as well as worldwide. Its aims are based on three pillars. First, SOLIDAR aims to enhance progress towards a more social Europe by advocating for policy change that puts social consolidation back at the heart of EU policies. Second, it is currently working towards creating an inclusive learning society based on the grounds of openness and democracy, where all members have a chance to participate in lifelong and life-wide learning opportunities. Lastly, with inequality, encroachment on democracy and social unrest increasing internationally, SOLIDAR intends to improve social justice for all and provide increased attention to democracy-building and the fair distribution of resources. > Project results, measured impacts, achievements, Lessons learnt In 2017, SOLIDAR continued promoting high-level social protection throughout the EU \u2013 with a focus on most vulnerable groups such as young people and migrants, particularly third-country nationals - as a key to achieve social justice, sustainable and inclusive economic development and more cohesive societies. It was successful in strengthening the 15 national EU strategy groups created in previous years and more importantly \u2013 setting up a new national EU strategy group in Estonia. Further results included launching a research programme to assess the procedures in place from the first reception at the arrival to the integration in society and labour market of asylum seekers and migrants in three countries: Greece, Italy and Germany. Additionally, the network\u2019s initiative titled \u2018Social Progress Watch 2017\u2019 187 was developed. The report presented the main findings and general recommendations in the areas of modernisation of social protection systems and the integration of third-country nationals. Some of the recommendations were the following: higher involvement of NGOs and civil society organisations in implementing legislation and policies as they provide essential support in developing campaigns to fight discrimination and support migrant integration measures, increased collaboration between governmental authorities and NGOs to strengthen and promote social awareness on the of discriminatory issue and decreasing tolerance levels, etc. > Identification of potential good practices SOLIDAR strengthened the formation of local strategic partnerships and promoted their involvement in EU policy processes regarding employment and social inclusion at local, national and EU level. Further practices included enhancing the knowledge transfer between members and partners to share good practices developed at local level and promoting their scaling up as well as co-operation with each other and other civil society organisations. > Policy evidence generated by the project The network maintains the Social Progress Watch 188 initiative \u2013 a tool implemented to monitor the commitment and progress made by national governments towards a more social and cohesive Europe. With the help of the Social Progress Watch, SOLIDAR is able to produce annual general and country-based reports providing recommendations for upward social convergence, social inclusion and quality job 187 http://www.solidar.org/system/downloads/attachments/000/000/754/original/SPW_2017_Country_studies_compiled.pdf?1519217588 188 http://www.solidar.org/en/activities/social-progress-watch ",

EASDP strives to deliver high- quality services promoting full societal participation and inclusion of all persons with disabilities. > Aims of the project/ organisation EASDP strives to deliver high-quality services that promote the full inclusion and participation in society of all people with disabilities. Its key aim is to have a Social Europe for everyone \u2013 including people with disabilities \u2013 that provides universal access to the services for those in need. > Project results, measured impacts, achievements, Lessons learnt The network continued to contribute to the development, implementation, monitoring and evaluation of pertinent social initiatives related to persons with disabilities through its analytical and networking activities. The key output throughout 2017 has been the \u20182017 EASPD Review of the European Disability Strategy\u2019, which analysed the impact of the European Disability Strategy 2010- 2020 190 and its significance to disability service providers in the implementation of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities 191 . The key challenges identified in the report were the following: 1) lack of resources along with funding, and 2) lack of awareness and the prevalence of traditional attitudes, i.e. shortage of appropriate disability-friendly policy development and respective policymakers. As such, in the review, EASPD provided several recommendations. To start with, it is suggested that in order to tackle the aforementioned lack of awareness, the concept of universal access ought to be embedded in future policy. Second, the service provision sector needs to continue developing its community-based person-centred support so as to ensure the accessibility of goods and services to persons with disabilities. In regard to funding, it is recommended that more of the funds must be appropriated towards improving communication between public authorities, service providers and persons with disabilities. Lastly, in order to increase the inclusion of people with disabilities into the open labour market, comprehensive national strategies need to be implemented including more active labour market policies that favour the employment of people with disabilities. The network also published an impact report of EASPD work done in the context of the European Parliament Resolution on the European Pillar of Social Rights 192 , and the 2017 European Semester Report 193 focusing on funding policies and trends regarding the support services sector in the EU. Further results include producing a briefing paper in reaction to the launch of the European Solidarity Corps 194 initiative. In said paper, EASPD highlights the importance of the initiative for service providers and participants/volunteers alike regarding solidarity-minded projects and describes the initiative\u2019s structure, primary functions and benefits. Several other briefing papers were produced including the topics of work-life balance, economic policy coordination, and country-specific recommendations with regard to support services sectors. Aside from reports and briefing papers, a variety of miscellaneous publications and items were also produced, such as the annual work plan on the European Semester with a specific focus on investment trends in social sector and financial sustainability, an online toolkit 195 on the European Fund for Strategic Investments 196 , leaflets with information on European Fund for Strategic Investments and how to access better loans for social service providers; and a booklet titled \u2018Ten best practices on employment strategies for persons with disabilities\u2019. Lastly, EASPD conducted the following studies: 1) Recruitment and Retention in Social Services: Unlocking the 190 https://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=COM:2010:0636:FIN:en:PDF 191 https://www.un.org/development/desa/disabilities/convention-on-the-rights-of-persons-with-disabilities.html 192 https://ec.europa.eu/commission/priorities/deeper-and-fairer-economic-and-monetary-union/european-pillar-social-rights_en 193 http://www.easpd.eu/sites/default/files/sites/default/files/easpd_impact_report_on_ep_empl_report_on_ags.pdf 194 https://europa.eu/youth/solidarity_en 195 http://www.easpd.eu/en/content/european-fund-strategic-investments 196 http://ec.europa.eu/growth/industry/innovation/funding/efsi_en ",

As a result, EU policy topics are now clearer for the social care and support services sector, and organisations better understand their potential as instruments in advancing Social Europe. > Policy evidence generated by the project EASPD has continued intensive co-operation with the EC and the European Parliament and maintained fruitful co- operation with the European Economic and Social Committee, the Council of Europe and many different EU-wide networks. Overall, the network\u2019s communication, dissemination and promotional activities continued to increase, with an evident impact on the coverage of EASPD\u2019s activities and publications. Throughout 2017, EASPD produced 9 different publications on policy, activities and communication work. > New partnerships created In 2017, during the Annual Conference on Supported Employment, EASPD signed a co-operation agreement with the European Network of Public Employment Services. The intent of the agreement is to promote the increase of employment rates of persons with disabilities. EASPD considers this is a stepping-stone towards the EU Network\u2019s Public Employment Services 2020 Strategy 198 and believes it will contribute in creating a more inclusive society. Additionally, EASPD received 20 new member organisations thus increasing its representativeness at the European level. > Dissemination strategy The network has a specific focus on striving for and supporting the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities 199 and the European Disability Strategy 200 , therefore, it disseminates information concerning said initiatives to its stakeholders via different channels, reaching a large share of its audience through its official website, social media and YouTube channel. Throughout 2017, EASPD publicised more than 250 news items (in English and French) on their website, regularly updated its Facebook page, Twitter feed, YouTube channel and LinkedIn page on a daily basis. Furthermore, with the help of its new communication tool launched last year \u2013 Video flash 201 \u2013 EASPD has been able to increase its activity and visibility on YouTube (22 video flashes were produced). In 2017, the network experienced growth in terms of followers, likes and subscribers on all of the aforementioned social media platforms. > European added value EASPD and its network is an important player in the field of disability at the European level. Its work is essential in developing project ideas and consortia combining different stakeholders as well as disseminating project outcomes and outputs. Because of EASPD\u2019s work, its members and partners\u2019 capacity has been built in terms of effective participation in the European Semester 202 processes. The EASPD provides a unique EU added value by bringing support services closer to the EU decision-making process and by providing the EU institutions, bodies and networks with first-hand information on the situation at the grass-roots level. > Sustainability measures Similar to the previous year, more practical knowledge and work needs to be done to ensure sustainability. As such the EASPD will keep monitoring their implementation and providing the EC with input for policy design, seek closer co-operation with national, regional and local authorities, continue raising awareness on the fact that accessibility is a human right, but it is also an investment as well as an opportunity; make sure the role of support services is sufficiently recognised, highlight the job creation potential of the social services sector and the EU actions needed in this sense, and ensure the availability and the provision of quality services that support persons with disabilities. 197 http://dlot.eu/ 198 http://ec.europa.eu/social/BlobServlet?docId=9690&langId=en 199 https://www.un.org/development/desa/disabilities/convention-on-the-rights-of-persons-with-disabilities.html 200 https://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=COM:2010:0636:FIN:en:PDF 201 http://www.easpd.eu/en/content/launch-easpd-new-videoflash 202 https://ec.europa.eu/info/business-economy-euro/economic-and-fiscal-policy-coordination/eu-economic-governance-monitoring-prevention-correction/ european-semester_en ",

At the moment, ENSIE gathers 27 national and regional networks from 23 European countries. > Project results, measured impacts, achievements, Lessons learnt In 2017, ENSIE took part in European lobbying work through direct participation in debates and concrete activities on topics linked to social policies, EU 2020 target, the Inclusive Growth, European Pillar of Social Rights 203 and social innovation. It also participated in Social Economy and Extreme Poverty and Human Rights Parliamentary Intergroups, Commission Expert Group on the Social Business Initiative 204 (GECES) and European Structural and Investment Funds 205 (ESIF) activities. Moreover, ENSIE established contacts with the EC, European Parliament committees, and civil servants of the EU presidency. A number of papers, guidelines and publications were produced including five policy recommendations, seven press releases and four contributions to other EU networks papers, all of which acted as valuable sources of information for policymakers and other related entities alike. For instance, a booklet titled \u2018WISEs: The empowerment of people through social enterprise to create a stronger society\u2019, provides a better understanding of the characterisation of work integration social enterprises, as well as how they work towards economic efficiency and social aims. Furthermore, ENSIE and its members actively engaged in the European Semester 206 and some consistent work was done within the framework of the European Semester process in order to improve ENSIE members\u2019 national advocacy work and recognition. Moreover, an analysis on social and employment policies related to work integration social enterprises in the whole European Semester was conducted. At the national level, ENSIE organised analyses and good practise exchange sessions for its members. During said gatherings and events, the focus was placed on migrants and activities along with methodologies that would help improve the competences and skills of disadvantaged people. Altogether, 13 exchanges of good practice, peer reviews, and mutual learning events took place and attracted 301 participants. > Policy evidence generated by the project The network maintains and regularly updates a database gathering work integration social enterprises from several European countries. It also gathered evidence about its members\u2019 social performance through the Impact Work Integration Social Enterprise tool, which analysed data spanning from 2015 to 2016. In 2016, in 730 work integration social enterprises interviewed, present in seven countries of the European Union and among 12,954 disadvantaged workers: > 48% found a job in the same work integration social enterprise, in another work integration social enterprise or in the classic labour market; > 16% became self-entrepreneurs or found a professional training; > 35% have other outcomes such as unemployment, illness or death. Thus, the figures show a positive impact of active employment measures on the development of these enterprises. In total, 29 reports (surveys, studies, analyses and expertise) were produced. > New partnerships created The network welcomed two new members: Irish Social Enterprise Network 207 (ISEN) and Union Luxembourgeoise de l\u2019\u00c9conomie Sociale et Solidaire 208 (ULESS) from Luxembourg, 203 https://ec.europa.eu/commission/priorities/deeper-and-fairer-economic-and-monetary-union/european-pillar-social-rights_en 204 http://ec.europa.eu/transparency/regexpert/index.cfm?do=groupDetail.groupDetail&groupID=2753 205 https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/funding-opportunities/funding-programmes/overview-funding-programmes/european-structural-and-investment- funds_en 206 https://ec.europa.eu/info/business-economy-euro/economic-and-fiscal-policy-coordination/eu-economic-governance-monitoring-prevention-correction/ european-semester_en 207 https://www.socent.ie/ ",

In 2017, several good practices were exchanged. They were highly appreciated by members, especially those related to the integration of migrants and activities and methodologies improving competences and skills of disadvantaged workers. ENSIE plans to continue these kinds of exchanges with its members and take advantage of the added value. > Sustainability measures The need to implement a fundraising strategy was clearly defined, therefore the base has been set for its design and implementation in 2018. This will allow ENSIE to work independently and sustain work integration social enterprises more effectively. In addition, the importance of assessment of the potential services that could be offered was highlighted and will be developed in 2018. 208 https://www.uless.lu/en/ 209 http://www.socialeconomy.eu.org/ 210 http://www.ripess.eu/ 211 https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/funding-opportunities/funding-programmes/overview-funding-programmes/european-structural-and-investment- funds_en ",

        "Projects and organisations funded by the European Union Programme for Employment and Social Innovation (EaSI) 135 > Socioeconomic context The European Anti-Poverty Network (EAPN) was established in 1990, and is the largest European network of national, regional and local networks, involving anti-poverty non-governmental organisations and grassroot groups as well as European organisations, active in the fight against poverty and social exclusion. At present, EAPN is a network of 31 national networks of voluntary organisations and grassroots groups and 13 European organisations. > Aims of the project/ organisation The network\u2019s main objectives in 2017 were the following: 1) to promote and enhance the effectiveness of actions to eradicate poverty and prevent social exclusion; 2) to raise awareness around poverty and social exclusion; 3) to empower the people living in poverty and social exclusion; 4) to lobby for and with people and groups facing poverty and social exclusion. > Project results, measured impacts, achievements, Lessons learnt Adequate and sustainable social protection is a key topic for EAPN and was addressed prominently and rigorously in all of its policy work, as well as internal reflections on Financing for Social Protection. The network also implemented the \u2018European Minimum Income Network\u2019 212 (EMIN2) project throughout 2017 and engaged in many debates and events on minimum income, basic income and social protection more widely. An online communication tool \u2018Webex\u2019 was successfully used for more regular meetings of the Bureau - this provided more regular guidance for the network and proved to be a good avenue for participation and leadership of its members. Such online communication tools are likely to become more important for the network in the future. In 2017, the network was actively participating in different projects and alliances (e.g. various structures of the Social Platform 213 , including the Steering Committee and various Task Forces), stakeholder dialogues and structured dialogues. It was also closely cooperated with the Semester Alliance 214 , Social Platform and other Brussels and national-based alliances. It was actively involved in The Annual Convention on Inclusive Growth 215 and participated in the Social Summit, as part of the Social Platform delegation. Furthermore, EAPN held numerous visibility events and webinars, as well as one policy conference on the post-2020 strategy and participated in two events in the European Parliament on the Semester and the Social Pillar 216 . > Identification of potential good practices In 2017, the network organised 10 Exchanges of good practice, peer reviews and mutual learning events, which attracted 267 participants in total. Additionally, EAPN worked with its members to understand the various best practices all over Europe in terms of participatory policymaking, looking at the structured engagement processes which exist in places like Spain, Portugal and Ireland. The network has been making the case at the European level for the participation of both organised civil society and people experiencing poverty in political processes at all levels. > Policy evidence generated by the project In 2017, the network produced a detailed analysis of the Annual Growth Survey 217 , Joint Employment Report 218 , and Synthesis report (\u2018More Social Europe in the European Semester?\u2019) on the implementation of the 2017 country- specific recommendations, and proposals for alternative country-specific recommendations for 2017, as well as assessed the 2017 country-specific recommendations.

There is also a Key documents page with all documents from multiple years which gets many visits. The network also reaches about 1,800 users through its targeted mailing system, as well as users on Facebook, Twitter 220 and its official website 221 . > European added value The major added value of EAPN is that it brings a strong voice from people experiencing poverty and people working at ground level into the debates and the implementation of EU policies at EU, national, regional and local levels which is its key added value. > Sustainability measures The European Pillar of Social Rights has been the main policy and political focus for the network in 2017. The main challenge in the near future will be to ensure that there are funds set aside for its implementation, that Member States have the political will to implement it at the national level and that it is able to make a meaningful impact on poverty at the national level. This will be a continued focus of the network throughout 2018, at both national and European level. Furthermore, EAPN will continue its work concerning the EU post-2020 strategy, as well as the following key topics: minimum income, economic justice, energy poverty, participation and civil dialogue, the European Parliament elections, in-work poverty and the future of work. Topics regarding the Growth and Stability Pact 222 , the European Social Fund 223 and the Multiannual Financial Framework 224 will also receive continuous attention throughout 2018. > Gender equality measures EAPN includes the objectives of gender equality and non- discrimination in all its areas of work. In 2017, the EAPN\u2019s Women and Poverty Informal Working Group published a paper on \u2018Gender and Poverty\u2019, which made a distinguishing contribution to the promotion of gender equality. It also took part in the discussions convened by the Social Platform concerning gender equality in the workplace. Furthermore, EAPN established an internal Task Force on Migration, which is specifically looking at vulnerable groups, notably refugees, and asylum seekers. The network\u2019s participation in various dialogues (e.g. Roma Inclusion Structured Dialogue) provides the opportunity to challenge specific issues of discrimination. Its Task Force on Poverty and Human Rights argues that poverty is a human rights violation, and therefore makes a strong case for combatting poverty on human rights grounds. 219 https://ec.europa.eu/info/business-economy-euro/economic-and-fiscal-policy-coordination/eu-economic-governance-monitoring-prevention-correction/ european-semester/european-semester-timeline/national-reform-programmes-and-stability-convergence-programmes_en/ 220 https://twitter.com/eapneurope?lang=en 221 http://issuu.com/eapneurope 222 https://ec.europa.eu/info/business-economy-euro/economic-and-fiscal-policy-coordination/eu-economic-governance-monitoring-prevention-correction/ stability-and-growth-pact_en 223 http://ec.europa.eu/esf/home.jsp 224 http://ec.europa.eu/budget/mff/index_en.cfm ",

        "Projects and organisations funded by the European Union Programme for Employment and Social Innovation (EaSI) 138 > Socioeconomic context COFACE Families Europe, originally founded in 1958, is a network of civil society associations representing the interests of all families. It focuses on policies and legislation that impact the lives of children and families, particularly in the fields of social protection and inclusion, safeguarding the rights of disabled and dependent persons, prevention and fighting child poverty, reconciling family and work-life, migration, inclusive education and early childhood education and care, parenting support services to families, information and communications technologies, health and consumer policies and other relevant policy areas. > Aims of the project/ organisation COFACE works towards promoting the well-being, health and security of families and their members in a changing society and serves as a trusted entity for family mainstreaming as well as for the voice and needs of families in the EU and beyond. By continually assessing the needs of families at grass-roots levels, gathering evidence and observing project trends, COFACE links the needs of families to the appropriate policy mechanisms and legislative initiatives at the EU level, as well as national and sub- national levels. In 2017, the network\u2019s aims were the following: 1) to support the development, implementation, monitoring and evaluation of initiatives undertaken towards the policy objectives of Europe 2020 strategy, open method of coordination for social protection and social inclusion (Social OMC), and the European Pillar of Social Rights 225 ; 2) to support stakeholders\u2019 involvement in the policy process, by helping national member organisations to implement the main political EU-driven processes, and building co-operation with other civil society organisations and social partners organisations at the EU/national/regional/local level; 3) to strengthen the capacity of EU level NGO networks and their national members as well as the implementation of EU priorities; and 4) to provide data and strong evidence base on policy developments and trends as well as collect information about citizens\u2019 concerns and good practices in the social policy field in Member States in order to contribute to better policy- making. > Project results, measured impacts, achievements, Lessons learnt In 2017, COFACE held four internal expert meetings (on themes of disability, reconciliation, etc.), inducing knowledge transfers and capacity building among national civil societies. The network also conducted four main COFACE statutory meetings during which participants agreed upon a common budget, a four-year strategy, and a work plan for 2018. Furthermore, three public affairs events took place, which brought together a wider mix of stakeholders for mutual learning and exchange, including many high-level speakers from the EC, United Nations, etc. Further results include producing nine responses to EU/ international public consultations concerning urban agenda, migration, poverty, and family carers, as well as issuing nine joint statements with other NGOs with reference to work-life balance, the multiannual financial framework, and EU financial reforms. Lastly, the network also produced 4 workshop reports, held 10 training events, and took part in 18 EU research projects concerning demographic change challenges, the impact of earnings in families, Internet literacy, etc. > Policy evidence generated by the project Throughout 2017, COFACE Families Europe continued to collect and disseminate data and evidence on policy developments and trends to tackle the needs of families across the EU through thematic research reports, policy positions and recommendations, various assessments and policy briefs. COFACE produced six policy positions and recommendations to multiple EU institutions with reference to poverty-stricken families, ethical mortgages, family carers, people with disabilities, and internet literacy. Among them was the position paper \u2018Families on the Edge\u2019, which suggests pushing for a \u2018reconciliation economy\u2019 where economic actors are also measured on the social impact they have in their community. It is proposed that families ought to have more available resources at hand to avoid the risk of poverty, more adequate provision of care services, as well as more leave schemes and flexible working arrangements. The network also produced three research reports giving insights on the situation of family carers across the EU and the necessary 225 https://ec.europa.eu/commission/priorities/deeper-and-fairer-economic-and-monetary-union/european-pillar-social-rights_en ",

For example, the report \u2018Who cares? Study on the challenges and needs of family carers in Europe\u2019 provides a better understanding of the situation in Europe and presents policy recommendations directly from family carers so as to better meet their needs. The report indicates that 80% of care work in Europe falls on family carers, who are left without adequate financial compensation, social rights, or a pension scheme. Furthermore, 85% of carers are women and one out of three respondents provides highly intense care of more than 56 hours per week. COFACE also produced two assessments, one of the European Pillar of Social Rights, and the other on the EC\u2019s Work-Life Balance Package 226 . In the latter assessment, one of the key suggestions made to the EC is to keep grants as the mainstream financial tool to support interventions in childcare and long-term care, and to only make use of other financial instruments when it can be demonstrated that said instruments have a a more added value than grants. Lastly, the network produced five policy briefs. > Transnational dimension Mutual learning and transfer of knowledge is a key tool of the network to drive innovation in local communities, involve the national civil society in European policy-making, and establish common positions for EU advocacy. To this end, COFACE has used online communication channels, organised public events, internal expert meetings and strategic statutory meetings. > New partnerships created In 2017, COFACE strengthened consensus and co-operation on work-life balance with the AGE Platform Europe 227 , European Women\u2019s Lobby 228 , Eurocarers 229 , Eurochild 230 , European Network on Independent Living 231 , and Make Mothers Matter 232 , all of which promote different aspects of work-life balance. The network also welcomed several new partnerships with key EU influencers \u2013 Directorate-General for Education, Youth 233 , Sport and Culture 234 (DG EAC) and the Secretariat-General 235 (SECGEN). > Dissemination strategy COFACE disseminated its outputs by distributing physical copies of its reports during meetings and events, as well as by sending 11 electronic newsletters to more than 3,000 contacts. Further dissemination was carried out via social media (Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, etc.) and on the official website 236 of COFACE Families Europe. The network also targeted specific stakeholders (participants of events, key policy-makers, MEPs) via email to disseminate its reports. > European added value With its policy outputs COFACE has bridged the gap between the EU and the local level, highlighting the emerging needs of families to be taken into account in EU law and policy. It has also added value to the EU by establishing networking systems for the regular exchange of information and actions with member organisations on the common European issues of reconciliation, diversity and disability, as well as reaching out to individuals who support COFACE\u2019s mission. Furthermore, COFACE is the only European civil society player to specialise and promote work-life balance measures at the EU level, and successfully lead a coalition of NGOs to jointly advocate on this topic. The network also published four European benchmarks: 1) Family carers stocktaking common methodology; 2) Families on the Edge reconciliation vision and policy checklist; 3) Revision of European Charter for family carers in line with the United Nations\u2019 Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities; 4) Internal Monitoring and Evaluation matrix. > Sustainability measures Sustainability of EU advocacy work has been ensured by building the capacity of the COFACE network members to understand and influence the policy process in the target areas. During membership meetings and other events, COFACE members have exchanged knowledge on family support services and programmes at local level and have thus gained ideas on family policy, which could be fed into the national policy processes. Being a member of advisory boards in six EU research projects, COFACE will continue to mainstream the perspective of families in these research areas. > Gender equality measures In 2017, COFACE Families Europe promoted gender equality through its work with the SDG Watch Europe 237 and with its nomination to the newly set up EU multi-stakeholder platform on the implementation of the social development goals (where gender equality is the focal social development goal). 226 http://ec.europa.eu/social/main.jsp?&catId=1311&langId=en 227 https://www.age-platform.eu/ 228 https://www.womenlobby.org/ 229 http://www.eurocarers.org/ 230 https://www.eurochild.org/ 231 http://enil.eu/ 232 https://makemothersmatter.org/ 233 https://ec.europa.eu/info/departments/education-youth-sport-and- culture_en 234 https://ec.europa.eu/info/departments/education-youth-sport-and- culture_en 235 https://ec.europa.eu/info/departments/secretariat-general_en 236 http://www.coface-eu.org/ 237 https://www.sdgwatcheurope.org/ ",

        "Projects and organisations funded by the European Union Programme for Employment and Social Innovation (EaSI) 141 > Socioeconomic context Eurodiaconia is a European federation of social and health care organisations founded upon Christian faith and the promotion of social justice. Its network represents the needs and unique experiences of 45 national and regional organisations in 32 countries. Eurodiaconia provides its members with political and advocacy support in the field of social inclusion and social services, offering information materials, training and seminars designed to keep members up to date on European policy issues that concern them, and at the same time equip them to participate in the policy process themselves at the national and European level. In addition, Eurodiaconia engages directly with the EU institutions, grounding its policy contributions on the experience of the network organisations. > Aims of the project/ organisation Eurodiaconia\u2019s primary aims to include the following: advocation for inclusion, care, and empowerment of the most vulnerable and excluded; engagement with other organisations across Europe by facilitating networks, meetings, member partnerships, and best practice sharing; and bringing together experts from all over the continent, whose shared goals are the further development of practical approaches, identity and community in Christian social care today. > Project results, measured impacts, achievements, Lessons learnt In 2017, the network continued to influence the EU institutions, and strengthen co-operation with the European Parliament, European Economic and Social Committee 238 and the Committee of the Regions 239 , by providing quality briefings, policy papers, suggestions, guidelines and publications on key social policy issues in regard to Europe 2020 and the European Semester 240 . For example, the policy paper \u2018Towards an Effective Integration of Third Country Nationals\u2019 suggested extending the Asylum, Migration and Integration Fund 241 as well as the European Social Fund 242 to include migrants irrespective of their status. Other suggestions focused on equal access to education, labour market, basic services and equal opportunities for social participation. The network also hosted a number of training seminars and working group events, attended thematic external as well as cross-party meetings, met with individual MEPs (e.g. A. Kozlowska-Rajewicz), and played an active role in EC events such as the Annual Convention on Inclusive Growth. Further results include Eurodiaconia working with its members to build capacity and transfer knowledge on the architecture, adoption and implementation of European social policy development, as well as on content and orientation, equipping its members to be effective advocates and implementers of adequate and, where necessary, innovative social policies. Accordingly, the existing social policy, European Semester and EU funding toolkits were updated. > Policy evidence generated by the project To support its engagement in key advocacy topics in 2017, Eurodiaconia continued to develop policy reports on topics such as upward social convergence, addressing inequalities through social services, policy recommendations on ending homelessness through innovation and investment. For example, the report \u2018Effectively Fighting Homelessness in Europe: The Role of Social Innovation and Investment\u2019 proposed to pursue an integrated investment strategy into social services that address homelessness as people suffering from homelessness have a broad set of needs and problems, which require to be addressed in a holistic way. Eurodiaconia also provided opportunities for its members to engage in EU-driven social policy topics through study visits to Brussels, participating in EU-level conference and debates such as the Annual Convention, the Fund for European Aid to the Most Deprived platform, the Roma Platform and others. Additionally, the network arranged intricate contact mechanisms for reaching 238 https://www.eesc.europa.eu/ 239 https://europa.eu/european-union/about-eu/institutions-bodies/european-committee-regions_en 240 https://ec.europa.eu/info/business-economy-euro/economic-and-fiscal-policy-coordination/eu-economic-governance-monitoring-prevention-correction/ european-semester_en 241 https://ec.europa.eu/home-affairs/financing/fundings/migration-asylum-borders/asylum-migration-integration-fund_en 242 http://ec.europa.eu/esf/home.jsp ",

The organisation also formed and led an alliance on integrated and long-term care services and developed their co-operation with the European Confederation of Independent Trade Unions 250 on common issues such as economic governance and labour mobility. As a result, Eurodiaconia published a paper on how EU economic governance could be revised to support investment in social infrastructure and held a discussion event with the participation of the European Policy Centre 251 and the EC. Several follow up meetings were also held with interested stakeholders and developed the next stage of the work for 2018. > Dissemination strategy Among the activities implemented in 2017, Eurodiaconia continued developing and improving its communication channels. The network raised the visibility of its work in the social field with the help of press and media exposure, online webinars and social media activity. Similar to the previous year, a substantial increase on Eurodiaconia\u2019s social media channels was registered both in terms of numbers of followers (e.g. 270 new Twitter followers), and interaction on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram. Additionally, Eurodiaconia has weekly e-news that is published every Friday for around 35 weeks of the year, plus a monthly newsletter in French and German. This year, 127 additional people received the newsletter. Finally, to reflect Eurodiaconia\u2019s ever-diversifying network, developments on the organisation\u2019s website were made to ensure an easier and more accessible experience for members communicating in different languages. > European added value Thanks to the EC\u2019s funding that constitutes a sizeable portion of Eurodiaconia\u2019s budget, the organisation was able to proceed with its activities in many areas of social development across Europe. The organisation and its members became increasingly engaged due to the various capacity-building activities and tools developed by Eurodiaconia in 2017. Furthermore, Eurodiaconia and its network member organisations continued their work in different alliances at the EU level with a mission to further reduce poverty, inequalities, social exclusion and unemployment. > Sustainability measures In 2018, Eurodiaconia will proceed to work on the European Pillar of Social Rights both in terms of content and implementation. The organisation will also continue to engage in specific areas such as Roma integration, child poverty etc. It will also try to provide more opportunities for its members to engage in the European Semester. Furthermore, the organisation will look at creating more synergies with national-level actions in the European Semester and links with the national semester officers. Lastly, with the forthcoming European Parliament elections in May 2019, citizens will have the opportunity to vote not only on the future but also provide their view on what has been achieved over the past 5 years. As such, in 2018 Eurodiaconia, together with its member organisations, will try and develop appropriate responses to the current trends of populism and to the wider concern regarding youth disengagement from democratic processes. 243 http://www.europarl.europa.eu/portal/en/ 244 http://\\\\ec-bir-fs01\\fdrive\\Birmingham\\MSU\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Windows\\INetCache\\Content.Outlook\\JNQM819E\\ec.europa.eu\\social\\main. jsp?catId=758 245 https://ec.europa.eu/commission/priorities/deeper-and-fairer-economic-and-monetary-union/european-pillar-social-rights_en 246 https://www.eapn.eu/ 247 https://www.socialserviceseurope.eu/ 248 http://www.fininc.eu/ 249 http://www.socialplatform.org/ 250 https://www.cesi.org/ 251 http://www.epc.eu/ ",

        "Projects and organisations funded by the European Union Programme for Employment and Social Innovation (EaSI) 144 > Socioeconomic context Microfinance can give European citizens the opportunity to access additional financial instruments in order to create, develop and sustain their economic activities, and to better respond to shocks in the future. The EU has recognised the potential of microfinance to reduce social and financial exclusion and has started regulatory and financial initiatives in this sector. However, the accessibility of microloans across the EU is uneven and provided by diverse and mostly small organisations. > Aims of the project/ organisation The European Microfinance Network\u2019s (EMN) primary aim is to advocate on behalf of the microfinance sector, as well as to facilitate capacity building at the EU level by promoting transparency, good practices, and research among organisations that provide financial services to the underserved or who facilitate access to such services. > Project results, measured impacts, achievements, Lessons learnt The action grant contributed to the expansion of the EMN\u2019s activities in terms of advocacy and capacity building. Advocacy, which is important to increase the recognition of the sector, took the shape of addressing policy-makers by meeting with them and providing written inputs on different topics affecting the microfinance sector. A total of 9 national legislative mapping reports were published, covering 19 countries. Regular meetings and events continued to enhance communication between the microfinance sector and the different policy-makers at the EU and national levels. Other key activities in this area included the following: issuance of a policy note on a new common microfinance definition to respective EU representatives, provision of a special note on the capital markets union to the Directorate-General for Financial Stability, Financial Services and Capital Markets Union 252 (DG FISMA), provision of a note on the European Social Fund\u2019s study on market failures to EC representatives, and coordination of the third European Microfinance Day. In terms of capacity building, the action grant contributed to strengthening the skills of EMN\u2019s member organisations as well as increasing its organisational capacity. In 2017, EMN members participated in four peer-to-peer visits and seven webinars. The network collected and shared good practices of the field through its website; organised the \u2018European Microfinance Research Award\u2019 ceremony, set up two webinars, mobilised members to six working groups related to microfinance, financial and social inclusion and social entrepreneurship. Regarding the network\u2019s organisational capacity, the action grant allowed for the continuous development of a communication tool to send targeted information to stakeholders, implement internal and external audits, and provide training to EMN staff on project management, social media strategy, advocacy, languages, etc. > Identification of potential good practices The EMN identified a few lessons and recommendations for the network\u2019s future activities. First, microfinance is a multi- policy tool and thus it is necessary to reach out to a wider range of DGs. Second, the network realised that external stakeholders value the input from the microfinance sector and its ability to respond quickly to requests for information with feedback from the field. Lastly, EU institutions value and appreciate the space that is offered to them in events and publications thus indicating a potentially greater demand of EU institution involvement. > Policy evidence generated by the project In 2017, the EMN issued three intellectual outputs regarding the microfinance sector. A new edition of the network\u2019s main publication \u2018Microfinance in Europe: A Survey of EMN-MFC Members. Report 2016-2017\u2019 presented key facts and figures of the two microfinance networks operating in Europe, as well as an overall view of the European microfinance market, thus deepening the understanding of core issues, such as scale, outreach, sustainability and social and financial performance. Additionally, the EMN published the \u2018Pan-European 252 https://ec.europa.eu/info/departments/financial-stability-financial-services-and-capital-markets-union_en ",
        "Projects and organisations funded by the European Union Programme for Employment and Social Innovation (EaSI) 145 Legislative Mapping report\u2019 for microcredit provision. The aim of this series of national factsheets was to provide a snapshot of the various legislative frameworks treating the provision of microcredit in the EU by non-bank financial intermediaries. Lastly, the research paper \u2018Microfinance and Start-ups in Europe: Review of the Current Practice in Europe\u2019 was published, in which four country reports helped map the relationship between microfinance and the non-tech start- up ecosystem in the EU. The research paper provided an overview of microfinance initiatives, national strategies and a set of policy recommendations oriented towards deepening the effectiveness of microfinance-based support of start-ups. > Transnational dimension By the end of 2017, the EMN had 108 members in 27 European countries. As a result of the action grant, members were able to meet and learn from each other. > New partnerships created In 2017, the network welcomed 27 new members and also strengthened the established connections by participating in 14 joint actions with peer networks. The meetings were effective for discussing collaboration opportunities and agreeing on topics where organisations can unite and promote their positions together at the EU and national levels. > Dissemination strategy EMN based its dissemination strategy on its e-communication channels. To communicate with its members and stakeholders it relied on social media, its website and newsletters. Social media tools were updated regularly throughout the year. EMN tweeted 387 times, received 282 new followers and 16,306 profile visits. The Facebook page was liked 3,147 times during 2017, while the LinkedIn page received 138 new followers. Their website was updated regularly: its content included 36 microfinance-related news pieces, 18 microfinance-related calls, 12 job opportunities in the microfinance field, 37 microfinance events promoted, 63 microfinance-related reports and documents uploaded. By the end of 2017, EMN had edited, published and sent 6 newsletters to 4,000 contacts each time. Additionally, the Customer Relationship Management tool began its first operational phase. The finalised communication tool will allow sending targeted information by area of interest to separate mailing lists \u2013 e.g. researchers, practitioners, policy-makers, partners, etc. > European added value In 2017, much like in the previous year, EMN implemented a number of advocacy, research, networking and communication activities, which helped to strengthen the microfinance sector. It would not have been possible to carry out most of the project activities without the support of the EU. > Sustainability measures The provided outputs, i.e. research papers, reports and policy notes can lay foundations for further enhancement of microfinance-oriented practices and development tools across the EU, which would help to promote start-up enterprises and address the needs of low-income clients.

The network works to ensure that care is valued and unpaid care is recognised as central to the sustainability of health and long-term care systems. There are more than 100 million informal carers in the EU today, and their number is likely to increase due to demographic ageing. Informal carers across the EU provide over 80% of all care, with women providing approximately two-thirds of it. The economic value of unpaid informal care is huge. In EU Member States its share of the overall cost of formal long-term care provision ranges from 50% to 90%. Being a significant part of the provision, organisation and sustainability of health and social care systems, carers often suffer from physical and mental health impairment, face difficulties in balancing paid work with care responsibilities, challenges to the natural socialisation processes as well as formal education, family relationships and employment prospects, especially young carers. > Aims of the project/ organisation Eurocarers is a long-time proponent of societal integration and recognition of informal carers throughout the EU. In 2017, the network\u2019s key aim was to advance the issue of informal care at both national and EU levels by: 1) raising awareness of the significant contributions made by carers to the health and social care systems and the economy as a whole; and 2) ensuring that EU and national policies take account of carers. > Project results, measured impacts, achievements, Lessons learnt Eurocarers continued to contribute to the development, implementation, monitoring and evaluation of relevant social initiatives with the help of its analytical and networking activities. It supported stakeholder involvement in policy processes through publishing activities and meetings, strengthened member capacity by organising study visits and regional seminars, and collected evidence on informal carers by participating in research projects. Throughout 2017, Eurocarers representatives played an active role in 180 events. Furthermore, Eurocarers developed and disseminated 5 newsletter issues, and a total of 12 joint statements/calls for action concerning work-life balance, young people\u2019s social inclusion, health equity, mental health and patient safety. Lastly, Eurocarers began contributing to in-country events in order to promote its messaging, relevant EU priorities and to ensure the development and implementation of support and empowering measures targeted at carers at both national and local levels. > Identification of potential good practices: In 2017, the network developed a table providing an overview of the number of carers across Europe as well as the support measures available to them. The table allows highlighting the great diversity of approaches that exist across Europe when it comes to recognising, identifying carers and underline the gaps that still need to be bridged. The document will serve as an advocacy piece for more comprehensive strategies at EU level and across Member States in order to support and empower carers. > Policy evidence generated by the project The network produced the following six position papers: 1) The relevance of EU policy development to carers and vice versa; 2) The gender dimension of informal care; 3) Informal care as a barrier to employment; 4) Young Carers; 5) Joint White paper on Cancer Carers; 6) A Policy Roadmap on addressing Metastatic Breast Cancer. The presented papers tackle the political and societal relevance of carers, unequal gender division among carers, the impact of informal carers, and the gaps in the framework supporting cancer carers. Said papers also served as recommendation pieces for various EU institutions, e.g. Directorate-General for Research and Innovation 253 (DG RTD), Directorate-General for Employment, Social Affairs and Inclusion 254 (DG EMPL), etc. New partnerships created In 2017, the Eurocarers welcomed seven new member organisations and maintained strong contacts with many non-member organisations. 253 https://ec.europa.eu/info/departments/research-and-innovation_en 254 http://ec.europa.eu/social/home.jsp ",

The network organised 14 peer-learning events for 824 participants, and 6 conferences and seminars attracting 736 participants. It also disseminated 14 issues of guides and educational material and developed/maintained 3 information systems. > European added value Eurocarers is the only EU-level network that supports all carers, and EaSI is its main source of funding. Therefore, a clear European value added comes from the fact that, in the absence of EU funding, the network\u2019s activities would be severely limited. The EaSI funding ensures economies of scale and efficient use of money, leading to better services for citizens due to the work of Eurocarers. > Sustainability measures Eurocarers will continue to support the EC in its efforts to create a political environment that is favourable for sustainable, equitable and quality long-term care services and where carers are recognised, supported and valued. The organisation\u2019s action plan for 2018 includes advocacy, communication and capacity-building activities focusing on the implementation of the objectives of the Europe 2020 strategy 255 , the European Semester 256 , the Work-life balance package 257 , the European Pillar of Social Rights 258 , the blueprint on innovation for active and healthy ageing and any other carer-friendly policy developments. > Gender equality measures Eurocarers developed a position paper 259 titled \u2018The Gender Dimension of Informal Care\u2019, which analyses unequal division of care between women and men as well as the State and family. The paper also addresses the root causes and consequences of these inequalities and integrates findings of the newest edition of the Gender Equality Index 2017 260 , produced by the European Institute for Gender Equality 261 .

Roma people, being the single largest minority in Europe, have been treated as insignificant and discriminated and stigmatised for centuries. Many Roma have suffered from antigypsyism, manifested mainly in inequalities in employment, education, health and housing. Roma face many obstacles in obtaining equal citizenship and recognition as active agents in civic life. In combination with inadequate and biased public policies, this results in the exclusion of Roma from the wider society. > Aims of the project/ organisation The network\u2019s main objective is to convince policy-makers that positive change for Roma is possible when antigypsyism is recognised and tackled as a root cause of the inequality they face, and when Roma can take part in civic life as equal stakeholders. > Project results, measured impacts, achievements, Lessons learnt An important step towards the fulfilment of the EU 2020 Strategy was taken in 2017 by adopting the European Pillar of Social Rights 262 . ERGO took part in strategic dialogue meetings concerning the European Pillar of Social Rights, as well as a meeting between civil society representatives and the European Commissioner for Employment, Social Affairs, Skills and Labour Mobility, Marianne Thyssen, pointing out the need to put the emphasis on those citizens who are hardest to reach by mainstream social policies. Moreover, the network had two press releases on the topic, welcoming the Pillar, but also placed emphasis on the fact that the Pillar as it is presently formulated will not succeed without additional efforts by EU Member States. During the EU Roma Week in April 2017, ERGO along with other key stakeholders organised an event to take an overview of the European Roma Policy Framework 263 so far, along with institutional and civil society partners that contributed to the process towards the mid-term review during the year. ERGO also contributed to the 2017 EC Communication and EC Staff Working Document on the Midterm Review of the EU Framework for National Roma Integration Strategies up to 2020 by answering a civil society questionnaire and disseminating and promoting the public consultation. Following the publication of the EC Communication, the network organised key civil society stakeholders to launch common reflections on the Post-2020 EU Roma Framework 264 in order to support the EC in proposing a framework that is based on the needs of grassroots Roma communities. ERGO also strengthened ties with EU level networks that work on cross-cutting social issues in order to bring a Roma perspective to the wider social policy field and to learn from other organisations\u2019 expertise and experiences. ERGO is a member of the Social Platform 265 , taking part in its taskforce on EU funding, and cooperates with the European Network for Rural Development 266 mainly on community-led local development, and with the initiative \u2018Community Living for Europe: Structural Funds Watch 267 \u2019 in order to support de-institutionalisation. The network\u2019s members have become key experts in the community-led local development process who capacitate local authorities, other civil society organisations and Roma actors in ways to better engage in the community-led local development process and improve Roma involvement. Finally, the network, together with the European Network Against Racism 268 and the German Central Council for Sinti and Roma 269 , steer the Alliance against Antigypsyism 269 - a coalition of organisations working to combat antigypsyism on local, national and EU level. In 2017, ERGO became perceived as one of the key actors on the EU level on Roma inclusion due to its expertise. The network\u2019s work in the Roma coalition and the Social Platform 270 has further fostered its position as a competent and reliable partner when it comes to EU policies targeting Roma. Moreover, ERGO strengthened its communication and outreach work in order to increase members\u2019 engagement with the network. > Identification of potential good practices ERGO took part in the Annual Convention on Inclusive Growth 271 in 262 https://ec.europa.eu/commission/priorities/deeper-and-fairer-economic- and-monetary-union/european-pillar-social-rights_en 263 https://ec.europa.eu/info/policies/justice-and-fundamental-rights/ combatting-discrimination/roma-and-eu/roma-integration-eu- countries_en 264 https://epha.org/post-2020-eu-framework-for-national-roma- integration-strategies/ 265 http://www.socialplatform.org/ 266 https://enrd.ec.europa.eu/ 267 https://communitylivingforeurope.org/ 268 http://www.enar-eu.org/ 269 https://www.minderheitensekretariat.de/en/minority-council/central- council-of-german-sinti-and-roma/ 270 http://www.socialplatform.org/ ",
        "Projects and organisations funded by the European Union Programme for Employment and Social Innovation (EaSI) 151 order to share a good practice example of an income-generating and health-related activity of one of its member organisations, a community gardening project in a rural community of Roma and non-Roma in Hungary. The network believes that sharing promising and good practice examples in the field of social inclusion can play a big role in supporting the implementation of the EU 2020 strategy 272 in an efficient and bottom-up approach. > Policy evidence generated by the project The main research project of ERGO in 2017 was a fact-finding research on Roma youth employment in five EU countries (Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Hungary, Romania and Slovakia), called: \u2018Investing in our future: What work(s) for young Roma\u2019. The spotlight of the research was given to the views of young Roma themselves. The presented results showed that not only are young Roma willing to work and that positive example of employment measures targeting them exist but that they are willing to provide recommendations and advice to their national and EU policy-makers. > Transnational dimension The network brings together 29 organisations from different European countries. As a grassroots platform, the network\u2019s activities reflect common concerns, priorities, objectives and approaches of its members. It closely works with strategic European and international partners such as the TernYpe Youth Network 273 , Phiren Amenca 274 , Open Society European Policy Institute 275 , European Network Against Racism 276 , Amnesty International 277 , Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights 278 , Fundacion Secretariado Gitano 279 , the Social Platform and many others The transnational dimension is clearly seen in common research projects and policy papers, but especially in the meetings between members, where they can share their work and define common priorities for the network. > Dissemination strategy Outputs produced by ERGO in 2017 were disseminated online through personalised e-mail to specific partners, articles on the official website of the network, articles on its blog (www. romareact.org), the quarterly newsletter, Roma-related newsletters and mailing lists, as well as in-person meetings and participation at conferences and events. The news is also regularly published through its Facebook page (1,513 followers) and Twitter account (800 followers), which is also used to report directly from advocacy meetings in Brussels. In 2017, the network hired a person responsible for managing communications. Moreover, the website www.ergonetwork.org was completely revamped and since then the communication became more professional alongside with increased outreach. > European added value The network bridges the gap between the Roma grassroots level and the European level through its activities, therefore, resulting in the promotion of best practice, and thus providing EU added value. It informs Roma actors about the possibilities offered by EU policies and programmes and builds their capacity to engage and monitor their implementation. Furthermore, it brings evidence from the local level to national and EU policy-makers in order to improve policies and programmes, e.g. by participating in shadow reporting on the National Roma Integration Strategy 280 , fact-finding missions on projects funded by the European Social Fund and monitoring the community-led local development process. > Sustainability measures ERGO will carry on its work done in 2017 by providing realistic proposals on how to better improve the poverty reduction and social inclusion of Roma through reforms of the Youth Guarantee 281 , more effective youth employment measures and better tackling of antigypsyism in institutions. It will also continue representing and advocating the Roma perspective in EU policies by providing alternative and complementary data to feed into national and EU-level policy process and support the development of the post-2020 EU Roma strategy. > Gender equality measures In 2017, ERGO hosted an event on combating antigypsyism and addressing a gender and youth dimension in the current and post-2020 EU Roma policy, which was co-organised with the Greens/European Free Alliance. 271 https://ec.europa.eu/commission/priorities/deeper-and-fairer-economic- and-monetary-union/european-pillar-social-rights_en 272 https://ec.europa.eu/info/business-economy-euro/economic-and-fiscal- policy-coordination/eu-economic-governance-monitoring-prevention- correction/european-semester/framework/europe-2020-strategy_en 273 http://www.ternype.eu/ 274 http://phirenamenca.eu/ 275 https://www.opensocietyfoundations.org/about/offices-foundations/ open-society-european-policy-institute 276 http://www.enar-eu.org/ 277 https://www.amnesty.org/en/ 278 https://www.ohchr.org/EN/pages/home.aspx 279 https://www.gitanos.org/ 280 https://ec.europa.eu/info/publications/national-roma-integration- strategies-annual-reports_en 281 http://\\\\ec-bir-fs01\\fdrive\\Birmingham\\MSU\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\ Windows\\INetCache\\Content.Outlook\\JNQM819E\\ec.europa.eu\\social\\ main.jsp?catId=1079 ",

        "Projects and organisations funded by the European Union Programme for Employment and Social Innovation (EaSI) 153 > Socioeconomic context Established in 1993, the European Platform for Rehabilitation (EPR) is a network of European providers of rehabilitation services to people with disabilities and other disadvantaged groups. Its members deliver services in the fields of vocational training and education, reintegration of service users into the labour market and improvement of their employability, physical rehabilitation and social care. The ultimate goal of the network is to assist its member organisations in continuous professional improvement, identification of best practices and sustainable growth through mutual learning. > Aims of the project/ organisation EPR aims to enhance the understanding of EU policy developments among its members, identify policy priorities and formulate recommendations, benchmark and bench- learn to improve the quality and effectiveness of services. > Project results, measured impacts, achievements, Lessons learnt In 2017, EPR continued to enhance the understanding of its members of EU policy developments through the mapping of relevant policy processes and initiatives, online training sessions, coordinator meetings, and by updating the online platform on the European Semester 282 . For example, members of EPR organised three national awareness- raising and training events for national and local civil society organisations, including social partners, on the topics of employment, mental health, community-based services and the quality of social services. Furthermore, the network also organised an inclusive vocational education and training event in collaboration with REA College Pluryn in order to facilitate service providers\u2019 exchange of experiences in supporting students with special needs in mainstream education to make education systems more inclusive. Further events included setting up an Annual Conference Committee to collect and build on members\u2019 inputs on informal education settings, improving mobility, digital health innovations in daily rehabilitation practice, sustainable agriculture programmes; and organising an expert-led training workshop on EU funds and EU fund applications. EPR also drafted and disseminated seven electronic e-bulletins with varied information relating to EU policies on the social sector, legislation, events and projects. In 2017 particularly, the network worked to improve the selection of topics and the elaboration of the bulletin making the news articles more relevant to its members and more reader- friendly. Additionally, nine funding alerts were drafted and disseminated too. Lastly, EPR drafted a comparative study in joint collaboration with its members together with the participation of the AGE Platform Europe 283 , European Network for Independent Living 284 and Inclusion Europe 285 as members of the selection of practices committee. > Identification of potential good practices EPR produced a good practice report on the theme of \u201cRights and Ethics in social services\u201d, looking at policy and good practice on how key quality principles of the European Voluntary Quality Framework 286 are implemented. Furthermore, the network also produced four sets of leaflets showcasing the best practices of EPR members from the four years of activities funded by the EaSI programme related to the topics of mainstreamed services, employment, quality and mental health. > Transferability element(s) of the project/activities In 2017, EPR Innovation Prize contest was organised. In total, five practices were submitted. The contest is a way for EPR to promote the exchange of innovative practices within the network and foster new ways of thinking and working with the view to continuously improve the service delivery to people with disabilities. 282 https://ec.europa.eu/info/business-economy-euro/economic-and-fiscal-policy-coordination/eu-economic-governance-monitoring-prevention-correction/ european-semester_en 283 https://www.age-platform.eu/ 284 http://enil.eu/ 285 http://inclusion-europe.eu/ 286 http://\\\\ec-bir-fs01\\fdrive\\Birmingham\\MSU\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Windows\\INetCache\\Content.Outlook\\JNQM819E\\ec.europa.eu\\social\\ BlobServlet?docId=6140&langId=en ",

Policy evidence generated by the project In 2017, the network produced three analytical papers on topical EU policy initiatives and developments in service delivery for people with disabilities. The paper titled \u2018Skills\u2019 highlights the main EU initiatives regarding the development of skills in EU and includes reflections on future global trends in employment, consumer markets and education. The paper on the European Pillar of Social Rights provides a brief analysis of the context under which the Pillar has been developed and what are the main principles of the Pillar related to the network members\u2019 sectors. The briefing paper \u2018Mid Term Review of the European Disability Strategy\u2019 focuses on analysing main challenges to achieve the completion of the strategy by 2020 together with looking at the development of the strategy post- 2020, and providing recommendations for improvement and future initiatives in areas related to employment, education and social inclusion. Lastly, EPR worked together with Social Services Europe 288 in creating policy recommendations for recruitment and retention in the social sector. > Transnational dimension EPR is founded on the principle of transnational mutual learning and unites 25 organisations from 16 EU Member States. In 2017, it continued cooperating with EU-level organisations and their national members, particularly through public events and by participating in Social Services Europe activities. > New partnerships created In 2017 EPR broadened co-operation with new networks and deepened co-operation with others, e.g. by joining the European expert group on de-institutionalisation as an observer member. > Dissemination strategy All analytical outputs were disseminated through EPR communication channels at organisational, national and EU levels: personal emails, seven e-bulletins, official website, Facebook page, LinkedIn page and on partners\u2019 newsletters or websites (Social Services Europe 289 and Social Platform 290 ). Printed copies were distributed within the network and during main internal and external events. They were presented and discussed during bench-learning and training activities. Articles, press releases, video and posts were published in local newspapers, members\u2019 websites and social media. > European added value The external evaluation of the action in 2017 shows that EPR members see its added value first of all in the position it has acquired at the EU level as a trustworthy and representative public body for disability service providers. Second, the membership of service providers in the EU network strengthens their position at the national level. Lastly, the benchmarking of services and the exchange of innovative practices help members improve the quality of their services. > Sustainability measures EPR will continue to work on its own and alongside the Social Services Europe to promote the social dimension of the European Semester process and make recommendations to ensure effective social protection systems, and social and labour market inclusion of people with disabilities and other disadvantaged groups. Its members will continue applying good practices and innovative methods learnt throughout 2017. The network will also further explore the transferability of innovative practices collected during the Innovation Prize contest. > Gender equality measures EPR published a study titled \u2018Rights and Ethics in Practice 291 \u2019. The study touches upon the promotion of equal treatment and equal opportunities for service users, i.e. people with disabilities who receive support. 287 https://epr.teachable.com/p/e-learning-module-on-co-production-and-mental-health-promotion 288 https://www.socialserviceseurope.eu/ 289 https://www.socialserviceseurope.eu/ 290 http://www.socialplatform.org/ 291 https://equass.be/images/Documents/Publications/EPR-Rights-Ethics 2017.pdf ",

        "Projects and organisations funded by the European Union Programme for Employment and Social Innovation (EaSI) 156 > Socioeconomic context Established in 2001, PICUM is a network of individuals and organisations working to ensure social justice and human rights for undocumented migrants. It provides a direct link between the grassroots level and the EU level by reporting on issues regarding undocumented migrants through its members\u2019 experiences and by simultaneously monitoring developments within the EU institutions. > Aims of the project/ organisation The project titled \u2018Transnational Solutions to Local Challenges: Addressing the Social Inclusion Needs of Undocumented Migrants to Build a More Cohesive Europe\u2019 aimed to monitor and evaluate social progress and policy changes with regard to EU objectives in the areas of employment, social affairs and inclusion; to support frontline organisations working to address the urgent social protection needs of undocumented migrants; and to advance informed effective, and non-discriminatory social policies. > Project results, measured impacts, achievements, Lessons learnt In 2017, PICUM engaged in European lobbying work through direct participation in debates, meetings, conferences, and coalitions (e.g. Global Coalition on Migration 292 , Women in Global Migration Network 293 , and Civil Society Days of the Global Forum on Migration and Development 294 ) on topics related to social, economic, and political marginalisation of migrant communities, social inclusion needs of migrants, better practices regarding labour market access, and better recognition of skills. PICUM also monitored and assessed the social situation of migrants, social exclusion and poverty, and the impact of migration policies and practices on social inclusion. Furthermore, a number of events were organised and served as a basis for further policy development. The Annual General Assembly held in May brought together 80 member organisations from 28 different countries. Members tackled new challenges and opportunities for undocumented migrants\u2019 rights and shared their breakthroughs concerning access to health care, labour migration, and alternatives to detention. For example, \u2018Freed Voices\u2019 \u2013 one of the projects covered during the assembly \u2013 served as a model for a discussion on how to empower migrants to fight and advocate for their rights in a hostile environment. Another prominent event was held together with the European Commission Against Racism and Intolerance. The event received representatives from the Council of Europe as well as members of civil society, service providers and local police. Lastly, PICUM held a series of strategy meetings - involving COFACE 295 , European Association of Service Providers for Persons with Disabilities 296 , Eurocarers 297 , and UNI Europa 298 \u2013 ensuring an open and collaborative process for discussion and sharing. > Identification of potential good practices In addition to building a broad consensus around needed policy change during strategy meetings, PICUM and its partners produced a working document addressing the issues related to domestic and care work from a migrant\u2019s perspective. The fact that the policy roundtable was co-hosted by the COFACE 299 , European Association of Service Providers for Persons with Disabilities 300 , Eurocarers 301 , PICUM, and UNI Europa 302 also demonstrated the multi-stakeholder approach PICUM has been propagating publicly. > Policy evidence generated by the project In 2017, the network continued to update and maintain its case law database \u2013 a tool used to monitor how law and legislation is applied to ensure undocumented migrants\u2019 rights at the national, European and international level. As mentioned previously, PICUM provided 8 internal policy updates for members, as well as 29 reports and fact-sheets, 3 policy briefs, and 7 written responses to 6 EU led consultations. Many of the aforementioned publications provided valuable insights to respective organisations and networks. For example, its report \u2018Defending Migrants\u2019 Rights in the Context of Detention and Deportation\u2019 presented evidence 292 http://gcmigration.org/ 293 http://womeninmigration.org/ 294 http://www.gfmdcivilsociety.org/ 295 https://www.coface.com/ 296 http://\\\\ec-bir-fs01\\fdrive\\Birmingham\\MSU\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\ Windows\\INetCache\\Content.Outlook\\JNQM819E\\easpd.eu\\ 297 http://www.eurocarers.org/ 298 http://www.uni-europa.org/ 299 https://www.coface.com/ 300 http://\\\\ec-bir-fs01\\fdrive\\Birmingham\\MSU\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\ Windows\\INetCache\\Content.Outlook\\JNQM819E\\easpd.eu\\ 301 http://www.eurocarers.org/ 302 http://www.uni-europa.org/ ",
        "Projects and organisations funded by the European Union Programme for Employment and Social Innovation (EaSI) 157 on the international as well as national context across the EU regarding the overuse of detention and deportation on migrants. It also provided recommendations to policy-makers at the national, regional and local levels. The report revealed that despite the continuous and tireless work undertaken by legal practitioners to challenge deportation and detention orders, their efforts continue to be grossly undervalued and insufficient. In order to tackle this, greater co-operation between legal practitioners and NGOs is suggested. While the legal work primarily focuses on questioning the legality of individual decisions, NGOs challenge the legitimacy of detention regime as a whole. Combining the two is expected to yield better results in addressing the detention and deportation of migrants in the future. In addition, PICUM provided detailed input and support to the Directorate-General for Regional and Urban Policy 303 (DG REGIO) in their development of a toolkit entitled \u2018Use of EU Funds for the Integration of People with a Migrant Background 304 \u2019, and met with the City of Amsterdam during the \u2018EU Urban Agenda Partnership for the Inclusion of Migrants and Refugees\u2019. To counter the ongoing lack of discussion of undocumented migrants within the EU Urban Agenda 305 , PICUM suggested addressing the issue by highlighting promising local level practices of cities implementing a \u2018firewall\u2019 procedure \u2013 prevention of state and private sector actors from effectively denying human rights to irregularly present migrants \u2013 in the area of health and access to justice. > New partnerships created PICUM welcomed 8 new members, with Bulgaria and Macedonia now being a part of PICUM\u2019s network, bringing the total to 32 countries. The network also strengthened contacts with other EU- level and global organisations such as the Council of Europe 306 , United Nations 307 , Eurodiaconia 308 , etc. > Dissemination strategy All PICUM outputs were shared through its website, which had 80,500 visits in 2017. The network continues to rely on over 200 dedicated volunteers who compile news, translate and proofread newsletters and publications, in order for the website\u2019s content to be available in 7 languages. Active engagement in social media yielded significant increases in terms of followers (1,200 new Facebook \u2018likes\u2019 and 1,447 new Twitter followers). Lastly, in 2017 PICUM had a total of 79 media appearances. Throughout the year, PICUM also disseminated its key messages in one-to-one meetings with policy-makers, local and regional authority representatives and other stakeholders as well as during events organised by partners where PICUM was given a speaking role (e.g. Initiative for Children in Migration). In addition, PICUM regularly responded to information requests from media, researchers, policy-makers, students and undocumented migrants themselves. > European added value PICUM and its network play an important role in the field of social inclusion of migrants at the national, European, and international levels. Their work is essential in developing project ideas combining different stakeholders as well as disseminating project outcomes and outputs. Thanks to PICUM\u2019s work, the capacity of its members and partners has been built in terms of tackling the overuse of detention and deportation, and other migrant-related areas. > Sustainability measures Looking forward to 2021, PICUM will continue to address policy shortcomings and support the modernisation and sustainability of Social Europe. PICUM\u2019s growing and engaged network, as well as its increased focus on youth empowerment, political engagement, unaddressed labour market needs and inequality drivers facing migrant communities, will ensure the provision of vital insights. Said insights will help better understand how different social models across the EU include or exclude migrants. These actions and others are expected to be critical in the assessment of Member States\u2019 employment and social performance. > Gender equality measures PICUM continued to promote realisation around the intersectional discrimination faced by migrant women and men, and how an irregular migration status intersects with the gender-related aspects of age, health, sexual orientation, disability, precarious employment, and insecure housing. Recognising that violence against women is a manifestation of gender inequality and gender-based discrimination, and in response to the Commission\u2019s key focus to combating violence against women in 2017, PICUM filled a vital gap in the debate. PICUM continued to draw attention to immigration laws that perpetuate inequality by making women\u2019s status and rights heavily dependent or derivative and advancing positive practices that promote gender equality for migrant women. To bring visibility to the wider public about how irregular status exposes women to discrimination, exploitation and abuse, PICUM authored \u2018The Women Who Fear Saying #MeToo\u2019 published on Al-Jazeera.com and shared on Al Jazeera\u2019s social media channels, including their Facebook page which has over 10 million followers. 303 https://ec.europa.eu/info/departments/regional-and-urban-policy_en 304 http://ec.europa.eu/regional_policy/en/information/publications/ guides/2018/toolkit-on-the-use-of-eu 305 https://ec.europa.eu/futurium/en/urban-agenda 306 https://www.coe.int/en/web/portal 307 http://www.un.org/en/index.html 308 https://www.eurodiaconia.org/ ",

The venture philanthropy approach includes the use of the entire spectrum of financing instruments (grants, equity, debt, etc.) and its ultimate objective is to achieve societal impact. Currently, it has more than 210 members from 29 countries, mainly in Europe, but also in the United States, the Middle East and Asia. > Aims of the project/ organisation The network\u2019s strategic objectives in 2017 were the following: > Increase funding and expertise coming into the venture philanthropy and Social Investment space; > Increase the effectiveness of venture philanthropists and social investors; > Co-create a well-functioning ecosystem for societal impact. > Project results, measured impacts, achievements, Lessons learnt As part of the Partnership agreement EVPA focused on four priorities: > It supported the EC in its outreach activities through regular exchanges with EU and multilateral authorities, organised an EVPA policy session that focused on EU funding concerning the societal impact and held a number of webinars. > It reinforced the capacity of the network\u2019s members by organising parallel roundtables, six EVPA Country Meetings, and three courses of the network\u2019s training academy: (1) the Fundamental Course on Venture Philanthropy and Impact Investing; (2) social impact management workshops: the fundamentals and advanced training; (3) crash course on Venture Philanthropy and Impact Investing. In order to ensure that the Training Academy and the EVPA Conference remain easily accessible to the network\u2019s members, the Partnership enabled the financing of travel and entrance fees for interested members in underrepresented member nations. > It also voiced the concerns and expectations of organisations facilitating access to finance to (potential) entrepreneurs from disadvantaged and under-represented groups/social enterprises through the network\u2019s National Policy Nexus and publishing a series of blog and interviews co-created in co-operation with its members. > Lastly, the EVPA provided research on developments in the field and on priority topics through aggregation of four years of data into an interactive format, in order to help practitioners and the public understand how venture philanthropy and societal impact has evolved. Moreover, the network produced 7 leaflets as part of the collection \u2018Little Funding Stories, Big Social Impact\u2019. The stories were presented during a fruitful session at the EVPA Annual Conference in Oslo. > Identification of potential good practices In order to best serve its membership base and facilitate access to learning possibilities for its members with limited access to resources to join learning opportunities, the EVPA defined clear scholarship criteria.

The EVPA received a total of 31 applications for the fundamental course and the two workshops, and selected 15 people for a full scholarship (travel and full course fee) and 7 people for a partial scholarship (travel and 50% of the course fee/one day only). > Policy evidence generated by the project The EVPA regularly screens, shares and disseminates members\u2019 (and non-members) research reports of relevance to the sector; to rationalise all this information and make sure it is used internally in the most effective way to connect its members doing similar research, the network has developed ",
        "Projects and organisations funded by the European Union Programme for Employment and Social Innovation (EaSI) 160 an internal database mapping the current research of its members conducting research, which is known as the \u2018Research Circle\u2019. In 2017, the EVPA concentrated on the topic of tailored financing and hybrid finance, and published the report \u2018Financing for social impact - the role of tailored financing and hybrid finance\u2019. It was launched in front of an audience of 520 practitioners and experts at the 13th network\u2019s Annual Conference in Oslo. About 500 copies of the report were distributed at the Knowledge Centre booth at the Annual Conference, and since the official launch (on 9 November 2017) the report page of the website had 1,305 unique page views. The network\u2019s Policy Nexus 309 is a project that allows members to have an overview of the most important developments in the national policy landscape in a selected number of EU countries, and identify best practices and allow benchmarking between countries in terms of policy-making. The project was developed through a number of interviews and the consultation of numerous reports. > New partnerships created In 2017, the EVPA gained 46 members, primarily from Europe, and some from outside. It is worth noting that three of the new member countries in Central Eastern Europe were the following: Georgia, Slovakia and Slovenia. > Dissemination strategy The EVPA regularly shares and disseminates information relevant to the sector through the electronic channels: the network\u2019s newsletter, webinars, social media, EVPA website, as well as through the meetings (conferences, encounters). In 2017, the EVPA\u2019s website had an increase in the number of new visitors, and also in the number of total visits due to the concentration of efforts to make the website the first \u2018stop\u2019 in terms of information for members and other interested parties in venture philanthropy or social investment. > European added value The EU added value is rather important. The first value is increased credibility which the EVPA and the social investment market receive just because of the support and interest of the EC. A second value is how the support of the Commission allows the EVPA to increase its services to the sector, and how it also incentives the network to invest in better planning and reporting. A third value is the proper initiatives which the Commission undertakes - with prominent examples like the Commission Expert Group on the Social Business Initiative 310 (GECES) and the European Social Entrepreneurship Funds 311 (EuSEF) and the Directorate-General for Research and Innovation 312 (DG RTD) Expert Group on venture philanthropy and societal impact. > Sustainability measures In 2018-2021, the EVPA will build on its strengths: in-depth market knowledge, credibility as a transparent and reliable organisation, and broad membership. The network also plans to assist more mature markets in bringing them to a higher level more targeted events, increase its investments in dissemination and training, and look for strategic partnerships. It will continue its efforts to make the funding opportunities available at the EC level more accessible for practitioners, and regulation at national and supranational level more transparent. The EVPA will also work on informing the EC on the perception of how its sector uses the funding and perceives the regulations. > Gender equality measures The EVPA organised sessions specifically targeted at expert members during its Annual Conference and tackled, among others, the topic of investing with a gender lens in 2017. 309 https://evpa.eu.com/policy/national-policy-nexus 310 http://ec.europa.eu/transparency/regexpert/index.cfm?do=groupDetail.groupDetail&groupID=2753 311 https://www.eesc.europa.eu/en/our-work/opinions-information-reports/opinions/european-social-entrepreneurship-funds 312 https://ec.europa.eu/info/departments/research-and-innovation_en ",

        "Projects and organisations funded by the European Union Programme for Employment and Social Innovation (EaSI) 162 > Socioeconomic context Present-day Europe includes some of the most innovative countries across the globe. The technological advancements are rapidly affecting different aspects of every citizen\u2019s daily life. However, despite the ongoing progress, some key aspects remain largely unaltered. In the case of Europe, one of the problems lies within the financial sector as over 130 million Europeans remain financially excluded and cannot access many of the frequently used financial products or services. Accordingly, the Microfinance Centre\u2019s (MFC) programme Financial Inclusion for Inclusive Growth in Europe was designed to tackle the issue and galvanise EU practitioners and policymakers into action and to ensure wider and deeper financial inclusion of all EU citizens. > Aims of the project/ organisation The aim of the Financial Inclusion for Inclusive Growth in Europe programme is to increase awareness of the current policies and programmes existing in the EU that support improvements in providing finance to various excluded groups, as well as to encourage necessary modifications in legal and regulatory frameworks for inclusive finance. Another important aspect is to develop the capacity of the MFC members and non-members active in overcoming access to finance barriers and providing finance to micro-entrepreneurs and social enterprises. Lastly, the MFC programme aims to work out ways of improving understanding of access to finance issues in the EU via development of special toolkits such as Access to Finance Ambassador 312 toolkit and the EU Access to Finance Barometer 313 . > Project results, measured impacts, achievements, Lessons learnt In 2017, the network continued being engaged in a very constructive dialogue with the EC to provide feedback on the EU microfinance support instruments and discuss the current obstacles concerning sectoral development as well as future progress. Moreover, the Alternative Finance Forum was organised in October in Warsaw. The event was met with great interest as the number of participants peaked over 200 alongside with 22 speakers. It allowed representatives of the more traditional microfinance sectors meeting with financial technology providers and discussing opportunities and challenges. It also provided valuable inputs to the MFC\u2019s strategic planning process and shaped the new 4-year EU programme submitted to the EC in 2017. Furthermore, country-level meetings were organised in Albania, Bulgaria, Serbia, Montenegro and Macedonia, and allowed local stakeholders to share information, discuss trends and challenges related to microfinance. The events also helped shape the new 4-year EU project, which was submitted to the EC in September 2017. Further results include various research and analyses, e.g. on start-ups, digitalisation and defining microfinance, which enriched dialogue between the MFC and other stakeholders while subsequently strengthening sectoral performance and programmes the EC offers to the financial sector. Lastly, the network\u2019s significant contribution to the European Microfinance Network\u2019s 314 (EMN) Social Performance Management think tank resulted in preparing recommendations for the EC about the social performance dimension in the European Code of Good Conduct 315 . This can help to stress the value of social aspects of microfinance sector work. > Identification of potential good practices The MFC conducted three webinars to present trends and good practice regarding topics important to the sector. The topics included the following: digitalisation, effective implementation of the European Code of Conduct and effective advocacy work on a country level. Several events dedicated to EU topics were organised. Important subjects for microfinance practitioners in Europe were tackled. Furthermore, special focus was given to green microfinance while presenting various approaches and sharing the acquired experience. Lastly, there was also a special working lunch meeting organised between EC representatives and members of the MFC to discuss present-day trends and developments. 312 http://mfc.org.pl/ambassadors-toolkit/ 313 http://old.mfc.org.pl/en/content/access-finance-barometer 314 https://www.european-microfinance.org/ 315 http://ec.europa.eu/regional_policy/sources/thefunds/doc/code_bonne_conduite_en.pdf ",
        "Projects and organisations funded by the European Union Programme for Employment and Social Innovation (EaSI) 163 > Transferability element(s) of the project/activities During the Alternative Finance Forum in October in Warsaw, representatives of the more traditional microfinance sector had the opportunity to meet with financial technology providers and discuss potential opportunities and current challenges. Co-operation and dialogue between new and old industries alike often led to sharing good practices and generating new ideas. > Policy evidence generated by the project In 2017, the MFC continued research about the role the EU microfinance sector plays in supporting start- ups. Similar research was undertaken by the EMN. As a result, a research paper and a position paper were prepared. In those papers, both networks make a number of conclusions and recommendations for policy makers regarding support for monetary financial institutions with the view of supporting start-ups. The key takeaway is that there is a need for a definition of a start-up as different institutions consider start-up phase differently (pre-seed, negative cash flow, positive cash flow but small-scale, etc.). The outreach to start-up enterprises is currently mostly concentrated on positive cash flow non- tech enterprises. However, monetary financial institutions declare willingness to serve broader start-up market. In order to play a more significant role in supporting start- ups, the monetary financial institutions need better tools to assess the risks of new ventures (alternative scoring models), as well as to have access to low-cost capital and risk support (specialised guarantee fund). Following the discussions on the common definition of microcredit, the MFC together with the EMN, developed a joint paper recommending significant changes in the EU definition of microcredit. Such changes will enable improved access to the EU support programmes for monetary financial institutions with a social focus. The important drawback of the current definition is that it does not prevent EU funding instruments ending up with institutions that do not have a social focus. Finally, the MFC has contributed to the study commissioned by the EMN by sharing its research methodology and approach for market size estimation and facilitating consultation with members. The study analysed the total market potential for business microcredit in Europe and market outreach of non-bank monetary financial institutions in different market segments. Results show a significant non-bank monetary financial institution market size of 260,000 businesses loans per year in 2020, representing a total annual market value of nearly EUR 1.15 billion. > Dissemination strategy The policy, research papers and case studies were sent via email to all contacts of the MFC (around 6,000 contacts including policy and decision makers, practitioners, and networks) either through a dedicated press release or by personal updates. All papers are also available on the MFC\u2019s website; all papers were also promoted through the network\u2019s social media as well as an annual conference or/and country meetings. Additionally, the network has disseminated its papers through the EMN\u2019s communication channels. Some research was presented during thematic webinars e.g. digitalisation webinar. The external evaluation report was shared with the relevant Microfinance Centre staff. > European added value As mentioned previously, various research and analyses enriched the dialogue between the MFC, the EC and other stakeholders to strengthen the sector\u2019s performance and programmes the EC offers to the financial sector. Furthermore, MFC\u2019s significant contributions to the EMN\u2019s Social Performance Monitor think tank resulted in preparing recommendations to the EC about the social performance dimension in the European Code of Good Conduct. > Sustainability measures The outputs of the project, i.e. research papers and surveys, can serve as a basis for further improvement of EU financial instruments and microfinance-oriented practices. Acquired results can also provide better financial grounds and facilitate access to low-cost or free capital for start-up enterprises as well as develop financial products to better match the needs of the more financially excluded branches of society.

A total of 42 projects and organisations fiches, which can be read as stand-alone documents, were produced by the research team and presented in the report. Analysing and disseminating information about the results of supported projects and organisations form part of EaSI performance monitoring for 2014-2020. The programme\u2019s monitoring approach foresees biannual reports presenting projects and organisations supported by EaSI and its predecessor programme PROGRESS. This is the ninth such report. It follows the first eight issued between 2014 and the beginning of 2018. It is expected that this report will be beneficial to public authorities of the Member States, civil society organisations and private actors in at least two ways. First, it will serve as guidance for public, private and civil society actors wishing to apply for EU funding in the future. Second, it will provide policy-makers with ideas that can inform the design and implementation of new policy interventions in the covered policy areas. In addition to these key aims, the results are expected to contribute to further EaSI monitoring and evaluation activities. The developed project/organisation fiches will feed into preparing the EaSI Performance Monitoring Report for 2017-2018. Finally, the report team believes that the results will be useful for the evaluators of the programme. 5 Afterword ",
