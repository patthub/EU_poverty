        "COMPACT GUIDES Basic figures on the EU First quarter 2019 ",
        "General information Coverage This short guide shows information for the EU, the euro area, the EU Member States and three EFTA countries. The euro area (EA-19) is composed of: Belgium, Germany, Estonia, Ireland, Greece, Spain, France, Italy, Cyprus, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, the Netherlands, Austria, Portugal, Slovenia, Slovakia and Finland. The EU-28 includes the EA-19 countries and also: Bulgaria, Czechia, Denmark, Croatia, Hungary, Poland, Romania, Sweden and the United Kingdom. The EFTA countries are: Iceland, Lichtenstein, Norway and Switzerland. In an effort to give readers a better overview of the data available in the Eurostat database, each edition of Basic figures on the EU introduces a set of three alternating indicators. In this edition they are \u2018Employees aged 15-29 with temporary contracts', 'Housing cost overburden' and \u2018Goods handled in ports'. For the EU, the information presented in this short guide is generally based on data for the EU-28 and EA-19 aggregates. However, the data for inflation is based on moving aggregates that reflect the membership of the EU and euro area over time (coded EU and EA in the graphs). Quarterly growth rates are expressed in relation to the previous quarter. Quarterly data are generally adjusted by working days and/or seasonally adjusted data, although data for the government surplus/deficit and debt as well as annual rates of change for inflation are based on non-seasonally adjusted data. Symbols and abbreviations : not available Figures in italics are estimates, provisional or forecast. Next edition Extraction made in February 2019. The next edition is planned for June 2019. The most recent data is available at https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/ data/database. Data codes The Eurostat online data code, which is given as part of the source for figures and tables, provides users with a quick and efficient way of accessing the most up-to-date statistics. When used through the \u2018search\u2019 facility of Eurostat\u2019s website, each data code directs users to the corresponding dataset offering the freshest data and longer time-series. ",
        "Indicators of the Europe 2020 strategy for smart, sustainable and inclusive growth (\u00b9) The overall EU target is to lift at least 20 million people out of risk of poverty or social exclusion by 2020 with 2008 as a baseline year. Monitoring/target refers to EU-27 as Croatia joined EU in 2013 and EU-28 data is therefore only available starting from 2010.

        "Eurostat, the statistical office of the European Union Eurostat\u2019s mission is to provide high-quality statistics for Europe. Eurostat publishes official, harmonised statistics on the European Union and the euro area which offer an objective portrayal of social and economic trends. These statistics are available for EU Member States, and are sometimes broken down by region. Furthermore, some of the indicators are published for enlargement countries, EFTA countries and other non-member countries. Eurostat collects data from national statistical institutes; the statistics are harmonised according to Europe-wide methodologies. Data are, therefore, genuinely comparable across the whole of the EU. Website Eurostat\u2019s website https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat provides free access to EU statistics, and is available in English, German and French. Statistics Explained https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained is a wiki-based system that presents statistical topics in an easy-to- understand way. Together, the articles make up an encyclopaedia of European statistics. Eurostat releases a range of publications, all of which are available free of charge on its website in PDF format. Among these, the \u2018Agriculture, forestry and fishery statistics\u2019 - providing facts and figures about farms, farmers, farm production and prices, the performance of the agricultural sector, trade in agricultural goods, and forestry and fishery activities.
