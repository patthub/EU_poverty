NO. TJ-AI-17-002-EN-N Enrique Calvet Chambon MEP visits Eurofound On 13 January, Eurofound welcomed Enrique Calvet Chambon MEP (front row, centre) to its premises in Dublin. The European Parliament\u2019s rapporteur on the revision of Eurofound\u2019s Founding Regulation, Mr Calvet Chambon met with the Agency\u2019s Director, Juan Men\u00e9ndez-Vald\u00e9s (front row, left) and Deputy Director Erika Mezger (front row, right), as well as senior staff. In August 2016, the European Commission made a Proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and the Council on establishing the European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions (Eurofound), and repealing Council Regulation (EEC) No 1365/75. The Commission\u2019s Proposal aims to revise Eurofound\u2019s Founding Regulation in order to align certain provisions of the existing Regulation governing Eurofound with the Common Approach on Decentralised Agencies, as well as to update the objectives and tasks of Eurofound. Source: Eurofound\u2019s Network of European Correspondents Exploring statutory minimum wages in the EU At a conference on the European Pillar of Social Rights in January 2017, European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker told delegates that every EU Member State should have a minimum wage. As part of its ongoing investigation into the implementation of minimum wages across the EU, Eurofound has just published its annual topical update on the subject. The update gives information on minimum wage coverage across the EU, examines statutory minimum wage levels, and describes how Member States determined the minimum wage level for 2017. In 22 out of 28 EU Member States, a generally applicable statutory minimum wage exists. However, the level of this minimum wage varies greatly from one country to another: the monthly rate in Luxembourg is over eight times that in Bulgaria. In six Member States, there is no statutory minimum wage: Austria, Cyprus, Denmark, Finland, Italy and Sweden. However, in all of these countries except Cyprus, the minimum wage level is de facto set in (sectoral) collective agreements. From the data, it can be seen that the minimum wage grew more over the year preceding 1 January 2017 than in the previous year.

The report Working anytime, anywhere: The effects on the world of work synthesises research carried out by both organisations in 15 countries, both inside and outside the EU. The study identifies employees who use new technology to work outside the employer\u2019s premises \u2013 regular home-based teleworkers as well as workers performing occasional and extensive telework and ICT-mobile work. The report highlights a number of positive effects of this type of work: greater working time autonomy leading to more flexibility in terms of working time organisation, and reduced commuting time resulting in a better overall work\u2013life balance and greater productivity. However, the report also identifies several attendant disadvantages, such as a tendency on the part of workers to work longer hours, and a blurring of the boundaries between paid work and personal life, which can lead to high levels of stress.

        "Public to private? Changing face of hospital services Private companies are increasingly involved in providing a range of services in the hospital sector \u2013 in the medical sphere and in areas like catering and cleaning. Contracting out services to private operators is seen as one way to cut hospital waiting lists and manage budgets. A new report from Eurofound, Delivering hospital services: A greater role for the private sector? examines the impact of private sector involvement in hospitals in terms of quality, efficiency and accessibility of services. The report finds that private providers complement rather than replace the services provided by the public sector. It concludes that an optimal approach would involve a more structured relationship between public and private hospitals rather than opting for on-the-spot contracting. This could reduce the tendency to select more profitable patients and to refer unscheduled complex cases to public hospitals.

Consequently, policy attention is starting to shift towards addressing this lack of equal opportunities as well as the transmission of (dis)advantage across generations. On 4 May, in Paris, Eurofound and the OECD Centre for Opportunity and Equality will host a joint high-level conference \u2018The only way is up? Social mobility and equal opportunities\u2019. The event will provide a platform to discuss new findings on intergenerational mobility and policies supporting upward mobility, especially among disadvantaged groups in the EU and the OECD countries. The event will be opened by Secretary-General OECD Angel Gurr\u00eda, and Juan Men\u00e9ndez-Vald\u00e9s, Eurofound\u2019s Director.

The annual report from Eurofound\u2019s European Restructuring Monitor (ERM) Globalisation slowdown? Recent evidence of offshoring and reshoring in Europe describes the nature of this recovery \u2013 in particular, indicating the sectors that have gained and lost jobs. It also examines the offshoring of production to countries with lower labour costs and the reverse process of reshoring work to relatively high-wage economies. The report finds that offshoring has accounted for a much lower proportion of job loss (less than 3%) in 2015\u20132016 than it did in 2003\u20132007 (7%). The extent of reshoring, the report concludes, is modest and increasing only slowly.

The figure shows aggregate job loss and job gain as recorded in the ERM dataset from the peak crisis years 2008\u20132010 to end June 2016. The main trends since the global financial crisis have been a decline in announced job loss and a gradual increase in announced job creation. The two time series have largely converged since 2014.
