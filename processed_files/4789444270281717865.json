By implication, the GNI-based resource ensures that the general budget of the Union is always balanced ex ante . The GNI call rate is determined by the additional revenue needed to finance the budgeted expenditure not covered by the other resources (VAT-based payments, traditional own resources and other revenue). Thus a call rate is applied to the GNI of each of the Member States. The rate to be applied to the Member States\u2019 gross national income for financial year 2020 is 0,6802%.

The catching-up process for these economically and socially lagging regions requires long-term sustained efforts. This category of regions concerns those regions whose GDP per capita is less than 75 % of the average GDP of the EU-27. Promotion of equality between women and men horizontally and through specific actions should be part of the support provided by the ESF, in order to improve the employability of women and their participation in the labour market. Special attention should be paid to non-discrimination in the labour market, combating the feminisation of poverty, access to education and affordable childcare services.

It represents the specific allocation to the Youth Employment Initiative under the Investment for growth and jobs goal in regions with a level of youth unemployment exceeding 25 % in 2012 or for Member States where the youth unemployment rate has increased by more than 30 % in 2012, regions that have a youth unemployment rate of more than 20 % in 2012. This appropriation is intended to finance the creation of decent jobs. While promoting gender equality, special attention should be paid to the situation of young women who can face gender-specific obstacles to get a good quality offer of employment, continued education, an apprenticeship or a traineeship.

To ensure continuity between the two programmes, expenditure shall be eligible for a support from a FEAD operational programme if it is incurred by a beneficiary and paid between 1 December 2013 and 31 December 2023. The FEAD shall promote social cohesion, enhance social inclusion and therefore ultimately contribute to the objective of eradicating poverty in the Union by contributing to achieving the poverty reduction target of at least 20 million of the number of persons at risk of poverty and social exclusion in accordance with the Europe 2020 strategy, whilst complementing the Structural Funds. Since the proportion of women at risk of poverty or social exclusion is higher than is the case for men, FEAD will take a gender-sensitive approach by adapting measures to the groups actually at risk, including women and the elderly, migrants, and minorities (including marginalised communities such as the Roma). FEAD shall contribute to achieving the specific objective of alleviating and eradicating the worst forms of poverty, by providing non-financial assistance to the most deprived persons by food and/or basic material assistance, and social inclusion activities aiming at the social integration of the most deprived persons. This objective and the results of the implementation of the FEAD shall be qualitatively and quantitatively assessed. The FEAD shall complement and shall not replace or reduce sustainable national poverty eradication and social inclusion policies, which remain the responsibility of Member States. The resources for the FEAD available for budgetary commitment for the 2014-2020 period shall be EUR 3 395 684 880 in 2011 prices. Poverty is a multidimensional problem and tackling it should become a primary goal. Greater emphasis needs to be placed on poverty in all strategies, as poverty is a complex problem with many causes. Most importantly, it also has a great impact not only on the present but also on the future. People who experience poverty, especially children, are at greater risk of not succeeding in later life and of being excluded from society.
