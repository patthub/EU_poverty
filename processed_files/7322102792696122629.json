        "EN 1 EN EXPLANATORY MEMORANDUM 1. CONTEXT OF THE PROPOSAL \u2022 Reasons for and objectives of the proposal The proposal for a Council recommendation on Roma equality, inclusion and participation responds to a need at European Union level to combat discrimination and achieve equal treatment of Europe\u2019s largest ethnic minority, including by promoting equality and socioeconomic inclusion. This proposal is presented jointly with a Communication from the European Commission \u2018A Union of Equality: EU Roma strategic framework for equality, inclusion and participation\u2019 (\u2018the Communication\u2019) 1 which includes EU objectives and headline targets and proposes the use of a portfolio of indicators (Annex 2 to the Communication). Tackling discrimination and socioeconomic exclusion is even more important in a crisis context , where poverty and structural inequalities are likely to rise. Therefore, social recovery measures should reach out to all, in particular the most disadvantaged, irrespective of sex, racial or ethnic origin, religion or belief, disability, age or sexual orientation. The Commission President Ursula von der Leyen has committed to promoting a Union of Equality and is determined to \u2018 ensure that equality is at the heart of the recovery\u2019 . The \u2018 EU framework for national Roma integration strategies up to 2020 \u2019 2 , adopted by the Commission on 5 April 2011, is drawing to a close. Its main objectives were to tackle the socioeconomic exclusion of Roma in the EU and enlargement countries by promoting equal access to education, employment, health and housing. This framework called on Member States to design national Roma integration strategies and set national goals based on Roma integration goals in the above four areas. In 2013, the Council adopted a Recommendation 3 on effective Roma integration measures in the Member States. This was the first EU soft law instrument to target the Roma explicitly. The Recommendation reinforced the EU framework by: \u2022 providing guidance to Member States on how to make national measures to improve the integration of the Roma more effective and how to implement their national Roma integration strategies (NRIS) more effectively; \u2022 recommending that Member States take effective policy measures to ensure equal treatment for Roma, including equal access to education, employment, healthcare and housing, and indicating how each of the four goals (ensuring equal access to education, employment, healthcare and housing) could be met; \u2022 stating that these goals could be achieved through either mainstream or targeted measures, including specific initiatives to prevent or compensate for disadvantages, or through a combination of both, with particular attention to the gender dimension; \u2022 focusing more closely on anti-discrimination, referring explicitly to antigypsyism, and extending work on Roma integration to new horizontal and structural areas beyond employment, education, health and housing; and 1 COM(2020) 620 final. 2 COM(2011) 173 final. 3 Council Recommendation of 9 December 2013 on effective Roma integration measures in the Member States (OJ C 378/1, 24.12.2013).

        "EN 2 EN \u2022 calling on Member States to inform the Commission annually, starting from 2016, of any measures taken in line with the Recommendation and any progress achieved in implementing the strategies. The Conclusions from the Employment, Social Policy, Health and Consumer Affairs (EPSCO) Council of 8 December 2016 4 called on the Commission \u2018to carry out a mid -term evaluation of the EU framework for national Roma integration strategies up to 2020 and to propose a post 2020 strategy on Roma integration, and include therein a proposal for a revision of the Council Recommendation\u2019 . The Commission carried out an in-depth evaluation of the EU Framework 5 , which was adopted in December 2018, and published the staff-working document on the evaluation 6 . The evaluation and the conclusions drawn from it by the Council, the European Parliament and several Europe-wide and national civil society organisations 7 show a need to renew and step up the commitment to Roma equality. This commitment should ensure a specific focus on non-discrimination, which includes tackling antigypsyism and addressing the four socioeconomic areas in which inclusion needs to be improved: education, employment, health and housing 8 . It should also reflect the needs of specific groups and diversity within the Roma population; involve Roma people in designing, implementing, monitoring and evaluating Roma equality and inclusion strategies; improve target setting, data collection, monitoring and reporting; and make mainstream policies more sensitive to Roma equality and inclusion. In July 2019, the prime ministers of the Western Balkans countries endorsed the Roma integration declaration 9 , committing, by accession time, to tangible progress in education, employment, health, housing, civil registration and non-discrimination. In September 2019, the Commission adopted the 2019 report on the implementation of national Roma integration strategies 10 . Europe still has a long way to go to achieve equality for its Roma population . Today, the marginalisation of Roma persists, and many of th e continent\u2019s estimated 10 -12 million Roma 11 continue to face discrimination, antigypsyism, and socioeconomic exclusion in their daily lives. These phenomena are intertwined. There is no equality when discrimination persists, and it is impossible to combat discrimination effectively without tackling antigypsyism and improving the socioeconomic inclusion and participation of the Roma 4 EPSCO Council Conclusions of 8 December 2016, Accelerating the Process of Roma Integration (15406/16). 5 COM(2018) 785 final. 6 SWD(2018) 480 final. 7 European Parliament resolution of 12 February 2019 on the need for a strengthened post-2020 Strategic EU Framework for National Roma Inclusion Strategies and stepping up the fight against anti-Gypsyism (P8_TA(2019)0075).

        "EN 3 EN population. Roma children\u2019s potential is hampered as too many of them do not enjoy equal access to education due to poverty, exclusion and discrimination According to available data gathered by the EU Agency for Fundamental Rights in 2011, 2016 and 2019, overall progress in Roma integration has been limited since 2011, although there are significant differences across policy areas and countries 12 . Most progress has been achieved in education (with reductions in early school leaving and improvements in participation rates in early childhood education, care and schooling, but increase in segregation). Despite the alleviation of poverty risk and improvements in self-perceived health status among the Roma, medical coverage remains limited. There has been no statistically significant improvement in access to employment, and the proportion of young Roma people not in employment, education or training has actually increased. The housing situation remains complex and is one of the biggest challenges the Roma community is facing in the European Union and beyond. Antigypsyism continues to give serious cause for concern. At the same time, there is some evidence of a slight reduction in Roma people\u2019s experiences of discrimination when accessing certain types of service. Under Council Directive 2000/43/EC of 29 June 2000 implementing the principle of equal treatment between persons irrespective of racial or ethnic origin (the \u2018Racial Equality Directive\u2019) 13 , the Commission has initiated infringement procedures against three countries for school segregation of Roma children 14 . The COVID-19 pandemic has revealed the extreme exposure of excluded and marginalised Roma communities to both short-term negative health impacts and to medium-term socioeconomic impacts. Roma children living in marginalised communities are among the hardest hit by the pandemic. Distance learning has been impossible for too many Roma children living in households without IT facilities or electricity. The crisis has also revealed the urgent need for a more efficient policy response at European level. The persistence of inequalities and systemic disadvantage represents a loss of human capital and resources to Europe\u2019s economies. The disadvantages faced by the Roma population affect the economy and societies within Europe. In countries with a larger share of Roma people, this group represents a growing proportion of the school-age population and the future labour force. Progress in socioeconomic inclusion for the Roma has the potential to reduce labour and skills shortages in times of adverse demographic developments, reduce social expenditure, and benefit the economy . Investment in better education and upskilling of a previously excluded labour force can positively affect productivity growth. The European Union must address inequalities more effectively by ensuring that Roma people can make full use of social protection systems and ensure that Roma people can deploy their potential to contribute to the economy and society in general, which will lead to better social and economic outcomes for all. This proposal, combined with the Communication, adopted by the Commission at the same time, has the potential to address the inequalities affecting the Roma population and lead to better social outcomes for all. The proposal for a recommendation takes stock of the measures reported by Member States since 2016 under the 2013 Council recommendation, and reviews and expands them. The purpose is to renew and replace the 2013 instrument, by providing stronger guidance to Member States and confirming their renewed long-term commitment to addressing the 12 Report on the evaluation of the EU framework for National Roma Integration Strategies up to 2020, COM(2018) 785 final. 13 OJ L 180, 19.7.2000, p. 22. 14 CZ, HU, and SK.

        "EN 4 EN persistent problems and challenges facing the Roma community, which risk being exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic and its impact. It complements the Communication. Both initiatives constitute the EU Roma strategic framework up to 2030, which is designed to incorporate the lessons learned from the previous EU framework for national Roma integration strategies up to 2020 as regards areas of intervention, monitoring and reporting objectives, cross-sectoral coordination, funding and involvement of various stakeholders. The proposal falls into five chapters: 1. Chapter on three horizontal objectives designed to prevent and combat discrimination by promoting: (i) equality, (ii) inclusion and (iii) Roma participation; 2. Chapter on four sectoral objectives: education, employment, health and social services, and housing and essential services; 3. Chapter on partnerships and institutional capacity; 4. Chapter on funding; 5. Chapter on monitoring and reporting. The proposal is designed to ensure synergies with new initiatives developed at European level for the period up to 2030 and with the use of Union funds, to improve implementation at national, regional and local levels. \u2022 Consistency with existing policy provisions in the policy area The recommendation is consistent with existing provisions in the field of equality. It builds on the EU framework for national Roma integration strategies, due to end in 2020, and fully addresses the findings of the evaluation. It renews and replaces the 2013 Council Recommendation on effective Roma integration measures in the Member States, to provide Member States with more relevant and effective guidance on how to accelerate progress towards equality, inclusion and participation for the Roma over the next 10 years. The proposal is consistent with and envisages the effective implementation of EU equality legislation, in particular the Racial Equality Directive, which prohibits discrimination based on racial or ethnic origin in employment, social protection, social advantages, education, and access to and supply of the goods and services available to the public 15 . The proposal is also consistent with the Commission Recommendation (EU) 2018/951 16 establishing standards for an effective and independent functioning of bodies for the promotion of equal treatment (\u2018equality bodies\u2019), which were set up under the Racial Equality Directive 17 . It is also in line with the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the EU, which prohibits discrimination on any grounds, including race and ethnic origin 18 . In addition, Council Framework Decision 15 Council Directive 2000/43/EC of 29 June 2000 implementing the principle of equal treatment between persons irrespective of racial or ethnic origin (the \u2018Racial Equality Directive\u2019), ( OJ L 180, 19.7.2000, p. 22). 16 Commission Recommendation (EU) 2018/951 of 22 June 2018 on standards for equality bodies (OJ L 167, 4.7.2018, p. 28). 17 Article 13 of Council Directive 2000/43/EC, (OJ L 180, 19.7.2000, p. 22). 18 OJ C 303, 14.12.2007, p. 17.

The current proposal is designed to pursue the implementation of the European Pillar of Social Rights by consolidating principle 3, \u2018equal opportunities\u2019 and by its relevance to several other principles. It also takes inspiration from the UN Agenda 2030 and the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) . The proposal is consistent with recent strategies in the area of equality, such as the gender equality strategy for 2020-2025 20 , the EU anti-racism action plan 2020-2025 21 and the forthcoming LGBTI+ equality strategy, which address the specific situation of Roma women and Roma LGBTI+ peopl e, respectively, and the EU strategy on victims\u2019 rights 22 . \u2022 Consistency with other Union policies The proposal is consistent with other EU policies, in particular the European pillar of social rights, designed to increase social fairness, irrespective of sex, racial or ethnic origin, religion or belief, disability, age or sexual orientation. It is part of the specific initiatives implementing the European pillar and consistent with similar initiatives such as the reinforced youth guarantee 23 , the future child guarantee or and the forthcoming action plan to implement the pillar. It contributes to the implementation of the EU anti-racism action plan 2020-2025 24 and is consistent with Directive 2012/29/EU , which lays down minimum standards for the rights, support and protection of victims of crime 25 , with a particular focus on victims of a crime committed with a bias or a discriminatory motive. The specific needs of Roma are already included in the new EU victims\u2019 rights strategy and will feature in the upcoming st rategy for the implementation of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the EU. The proposal is also consistent with the EU legal and policy framework addressing trafficking in human beings 26 . The proposal is also compatible with the Audiovisual Media Services Directive 27 which sets out requirements protecting users of audiovisual media services and video sharing platforms from incitement to violence or hatred, as well as from discriminatory audiovisual commercial communications. It also obliges video sharing platforms to take appropriate measures to protect users from racist and xenophobic content. In addition, the proposal ensures coherence between EU policy support on the one hand, and legal and funding instruments that can be mobilised and aligned towards Roma equality and 19 Council Framework Decision 2008/913/JHA of 28 November 2008 on combating certain forms and expressions of racism and xenophobia by means of criminal law ( OJ L 328, 6.12.2008, p. 55). 20 COM(2020) 152 final. 21 COM(2020) 565 final. 22 COM(2020) 258 final. 23 COM(2020) 277 final. 24 COM(2020) 565 final. 25 Directive 2012/29/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 25 October 2012 establishing minimum standards on the rights, support and protection of victims of crime, and replacing Council Framework Decision 2001/220/JHA (OJ L 315, 14.11.2012, p. 57). 26 Directive 2011/36/EU on preventing and combating trafficking in human beings and protecting its victims, and replacing Council Framework Decision 2002/629/JHA (OJ L 101, 15.04.2011, p1) and the 2017 Communication \u2018Reporting on the follow up to the EU strategy towards the eradication of trafficking in human beings and identifying further concrete actions (COM(2017)728). 27 Directive (EU) 2018/1808 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 14 November 2018 amending Directive 2010/13/EU on the coordination of certain provisions laid down by law, regulation or administrative action in Member States concerning the provision of audiovisual media services (Audiovisual Media Services Directive) in view of changing market realities (OJ L 303, 28.11.2018, p. 69 \u2013 92).

LEGAL BASIS, SUBSIDIARITY AND PROPORTIONALITY \u2022 Legal basis Article 292 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU), under which the Council adopts recommendations on a proposal from the Commission, in conjunction with Article 19(1) TFEU which provides for appropriate action to combat discrimination based on sex, racial or ethnic origin, religion or belief, disability, age or sexual orientation. Other relevant legal provisions are: \u2013 Article 2 of the Treaty on European Union, which states that the Union is founded on the values of respect for human dignity, freedom, democracy, equality, the rule of law and respect for human rights, including the rights of persons belonging to minorities. These values are common to Member States in a society in which pluralism, non-discrimination, tolerance, justice, solidarity and equality between women and men prevail. \u2013 Second subparagraph of Article 3(3) of the Treaty on European Union, under which the Union is required to combat social exclusion and discrimination and promote the protection of the rights of the child. \u2013 Article 10 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union , which provides that the Union, in defining and implementing its policies and activities, aims to combat discrimination based on sex, racial or ethnic origin, religion or belief, disability, age or sexual orientation. \u2013 Article 8 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union , which states that in all its activities, the Union will aim to eliminate inequalities and to promote equality between men and women. Under Article 157(3) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union , the European Parliament and the Council are to adopt measures to ensure the application of the principle of equal opportunities and equal treatment of men and women in matters of employment and occupation, including the principle of equal pay for equal work or work of equal value. \u2013 Article 21 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union , which prohibits any discrimination on any grounds, such as sex, race, ethnic origin, religion or belief, disability, age or sexual orientation. Article 23 of the Charter enshrines the right to equality between men and women in all areas, including employment, work and pay. Article 26 recognises and respects the right of people with disabilities to benefit from measures designed to ensure their independence, social and occupational integration and participation in the life of the community. Moreover, the equality of everyone before the law is enshrined in Article 20 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union. \u2022 Subsidiarity (for non-exclusive competence) Underlying shared values, such as equality and fundamental rights, and common objectives, such as economic prosperity, social cohesion and solidarity between Member States, call for the Union to play a role in policies to achieve equality and inclusion for the Roma. In addition, transnational mobility of Roma across EU countries, in the context of freedom of ",
        "EN 7 EN movement and of the migration of Roma from third countries, makes Roma inclusion a joint EU-level objective. The proposal ensures the continued added value of action at EU level. The evaluation of the EU framework showed that it has had positive EU added value by putting Roma inclusion on the EU and national agendas, developing structures, and improving the coherence of EU policy and legal and funding instruments that have been mobilised and aligned to advance the inclusion of the Roma. The proposal will uphold political commitment and focus on Roma equality and inclusion in the EU countries. At present, the effects of the EU framework are unlikely to last after 2020 if there is no further EU support. National efforts need to be stepped up, and more time is needed to consolidate working structures, to further align and mobilise other policy, legal and financial instruments, and to monitor the impact of policies more effectively. The proposal is also designed to reduce fragmentation in implementation at national level, one of the weaknesses identified in the evaluation of the EU framework. The added value of EU-level action is becoming even more crucial in view of the challenges associated with and following from the COVID-19 crisis . Many Roma communities have suffered disproportionately because of generally limited access to basic hygiene and sanitary infrastructure, limited access to clean water and healthcare services, high levels of economic precariousness, overcrowded households, and segregated settlements or camps that are also overcrowded. There is need for action at EU level to ensure that the burden of the pandemic does not fall disproportionately on the most vulnerable and to prevent existing inequalities from worsening. \u2022 Proportionality The proposal abides fully by the proportionality principle. Member States face challenges in seeking to ensure equality, inclusion and participation for the Roma. However, these challenges vary both in intensity (depending on the size of the Roma population and their share of the overall population, as well as on the wider economic context and the legacy of exclusion and discrimination) and in their specific features (such as transnational mobility, migration or issues associated with civic documentation). The proposal builds on the Communication setting a common EU framework with shared minimum commitments for all Member States, complemented by different degrees of additional political commitment according to the specific situation of the countries and the different challenges facing Roma living in their territory. The proposed action takes full account of Member States\u2019 practices and the diversity of national strategic frameworks. To measure progress, the Commission, with the support of the EU Agency for Fundamental Rights, has set up the Roma Working Party on indicators and reporting to complement Member States\u2019 efforts. The Working Party has proposed a portfolio of indicators for Roma equality, inclusion and participation 28 , developed with full respect for specific national situations. Countries can select relevant qualitative and/or quantitative indicators to measure progress from a portfolio of common indicators. At the same time, by requiring countries to select qualitative and/or quantitative national objectives on the way to EU-level targets, the proposal avoid s excessive fragmentation and seeks to increase countries\u2019 commitment to achieving progress towards equality, inclusion and participation for the Roma. The proportionality assessment also played a key role in the choice of instrument. 28 See Annex 2 to the Communication. ",
        "EN 8 EN \u2022 Choice of instrument The proposed instrument is a proposal for a Council recommendation, which abides by the principles of subsidiarity and proportionality. The proposed recommendation provides guidance to Member States on how to speed up progress towards Roma equality, inclusion and participation. The proposal is presented together with the new Communication on an \u2018EU Roma strategic framework for equality, inclusion and participation\u2019. The aim is that Member States, the Commission and all stakeholders should work together consistently and coherently towards shared objectives. As a legal instrument, the proposal signals the Member States\u2019 commitment to the measures laid down in this recommendation and provides a strong political basis for cooperation at European level in this area, while fully respecting the remit of the Member States. Once the proposal is adopted, it will replace the Council recommendation of 9 December 2013 on effective Roma integration measures. This initiative signals a renewed and strengthened commitment by Member States to improving national Roma strategic frameworks for equality, inclusion and participation, strengthening national Roma contact points, and continuing coordinated reporting to and monitoring by the Commission . This recommendation thus meets the need to act at EU level, while also taking account of country-specific differences as regards the situation of the Roma. The recommendation enables the EU to pursue common objectives while also allowing the Member States some flexibility in terms of achieving their qualitative and/or quantitative targets, depending on their starting point, national history and current practices. 3. RESULTS OF EX-POST EVALUATIONS, STAKEHOLDER CONSULTATIONS AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS \u2022 Ex-post evaluations/fitness checks of existing legislation Further to the Council conclusions of 8 December 2016 29 , the Commission carried out an in- depth evaluation of the framework, adopted a report 30 on the evaluation in December 2018, and published a staff working document on the evaluation 31 . The evaluation, which covered 2011- 2017, assessed the framework\u2019s relevance, coherence, effectiveness, efficiency, coordination, equity, sustainability and EU added value. It was based on: \u2013 an extensive desk review of secondary literature, reports and databases, \u2013 in-depth country studies, \u2013 interviews with stakeholders in 16 EU countries, \u2013 interviews at EU level and in three enlargement countries, \u2013 an open public consultation, \u2013 a survey among non-governmental organisations, 29 EPSCO Council Conclusions of 8 December 2016.

The evaluation concluded that the four priority areas (employment, education, health and housing) continue to be key for Roma equality and inclusion. In addition, the evaluation highlighted that the specific non-discrimination goal should both build on an inclusion approach and be pursued with a strong focus on antigypsyism, preventing and combating discrimination. The evaluation found that the framework had a positive EU added value by putting Roma inclusion on the EU and national agendas, developing structures and improving the coherence of EU policy and legal and funding instruments that have been mobilised and aligned for Roma inclusion. It noted that the framework allowed Member States to adapt their objectives to specific national contexts. While this meant they could tailor their approach as appropriate, the evaluation found that it also tended to fragment implementation, reduce effectiveness, and limit progress towards the EU\u2019s Roma integration goals. The evaluation also concluded that the framework had limited capacity to deal with diversity within the Roma population. It gave too little attention to targeting specific groups among Roma (women, young people and children, and EU mobile Roma). Finally, it found that governance mechanisms are in place at the EU and national level, but that their function remains limited. Efforts have been made to improve civil society participation, but opportunities for Roma people to participate effectively in political life and in all stages of the policy process remain limited. The Commission\u2019s report on the in - depth evaluation concluded that \u2018the evaluation has shown that the EU Framework is the beginning of a process that, despite many limitations and taking into account the massive task involved, has shown positive results and an initial change in trends\u2019. While it underlined that \u2018the initial phase has achieved some tangible, albeit insufficient results\u2019, it also stressed a need for \u2018the ove rall process [to] be strengthened and [to] become better focused, with an emphasis on improved political commitment, the introduction of specific measurable targets and rigorous monitoring, and more effective implementation supported by sufficient funding and participatory governance systems.\u2019 \u2022 Stakeholder consultations Evaluating the EU framework 32 required extensive consultations, some with numerous forward-looking questions, which fed into the preparation of the initiative. The additional consultations for the initiative complemented those already carried out for the evaluation 33 , their scope and objectives being aligned with the remaining data collection needs. Targeted consultations sought to collect opinions and advice on key thematic aspects such as policy options; how to address antigypsyism, Roma participation and diversity in the initiative; and how to improve monitoring and measurement of progress through indicators 32 For an overview of these activities, see SWD(2018) 480 final, Annex 2. 33 The evaluation is based on an extensive desk review of secondary literature, reports and databases, interviews with stakeholders in 16 EU countries, interviews at EU level and in three enlargement countries, an open public consultation, a survey among non-governmental organisations, 2016 survey data from FRA (EU-MIDIS II), and a validation workshop.

The staff working document 34 , published at the same time as the Communication setting out the strategic framework and this proposal, details the consultation activities, the stakeholders involved and how their contributions informed the new initiative. \u2022 Collection and use of expertise The proposal is grounded in the Commission report on the EU framework evaluation 35 , the staff working document on the evaluation 36 , and the detailed external evaluation support study provided by ICF/Milieu 37 , on which it builds. The results of surveys carried out in 2011, 2016 and 2019 by the EU Agency for Fundamental Rights in eleven, nine and five additional Member States respectively remained relevant to the proposal. The information about implementation of the strategies at national level in the EU, gathered from the national Roma contact points since 201 6, was assembled in the Commission\u2019s report on progress towards Roma integration of September 2019 38 . This information was complemented by reports from civil society in the context of the Roma Civil Monitor European Parliament Pilot Project, 2017-2020 39 . Additional evidence and data were sought through the results of a Eurobarometer survey on perceptions of discrimination against Roma 40 and external expert studies focusing on how to operationalise the need to take better account of diversity among Roma, the fight against antigypsyism, and Roma participation 41 . The proposal also benefited from close cooperation with the EU Agency for Fundamental Rights on monitoring arrangements, including development of outcome and process indicators 42 . \u2022 Impact assessment The instrument proposed \u2013 a Council recommendation \u2013 offers guidance on the implementation of the Roma strategic frameworks, while also allowing Member States to be flexible in designing and implementing measures. Consequently, no impact assessment is needed. The expected impacts depend largely on what level of commitment to Roma equality and inclusion the Member States agree to, i.e. the ambition reflected in the Council recommendation once adopted and the national strategic frameworks put in place thereafter 43 . Moreover, in addition to general challenges of quantifying and monetising equality, non- discrimination and respect for fundamental rights, conducting an impact assessment in the field of Roma equality and inclusion faces serious limitations as regards ethnic data collection in some Member States. 34 SWD(2020) 530 final, see Annex 1. 35 COM(2018) 785 final. 36 SWD(2018) 480 final. 37 The external evaluation support study is available here. 38 Report on the implementation of National Roma Integration Strategies, COM(2019) 406 final, accompanied by SWD(2019)320 final on Roma inclusion measures reported under the EU Framework. 39 For details of the project, see here. 40 Special Eurobarometer 493 on Discrimination in the EU (first results released in September 2019). 41 Reports covering these themes were finalised in February 2020 and are published here. 42 Annex 2 to COM(2020) 620 final and Monitoring framework for an EU Roma strategic framework for equality, inclusion and participation \u2013 Objectives and indicators . 43 See the Staff Working Document published at the same time as this proposal, SWD(2020) 530 final.

BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS This recommendation has no financial implications for the EU budget. 5. OTHER ELEMENTS \u2022 Implementation plans and monitoring, evaluation and reporting arrangements The proposal takes a common but differentiated approach. It provides guidance to Member States on how to design more effective national strategic frameworks, taking into account country-specific challenges related to Roma equality, inclusion and participation. To monitor progress better, the proposal calls on Member States to use the common indicator framework for Roma equality, inclusion and participation. A working party on indicators for Roma equality, inclusion and participation post-2020, coordinated by the EU Agency for Fundamental Rights at the Commission\u2019s request, worked to develop this framework. The indicator framework provides comparable, robust and relevant indicators for monitoring progress and evaluating the results of the national Roma strategic frameworks. It includes process indicators to reflect measures (including policies, programmes and projects) and outcome indicators to measure progress towards objectives based on statistical data, which can be populated from census, administrative data and/or survey data.

The purpose of this Recommendation is to contribute to the effective implementation of that Directive. (2) Council Framework Decision 2008/913/JHA 47 obliges Member States to criminalise public incitement to violence or hatred on the grounds of race, colour, religion, descent or national or ethnic origin and to ensure that racist and xenophobic motivation is considered an aggravating circumstance or, alternatively, that it may be taken into consideration by national courts in the determination of the penalties. This Recommendation is designed to step up the fight against hate speech, hate crime and violence directed against Roma people. In line with Directive 2012/29/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council 48 establishing minimum standards for the rights, support and protection of victims of crime, the Recommendation also aims to promote support to Roma victims of such crimes. (3) The European Pillar of Social Rights 49 sets out a number of principles to support and increase social fairness, irrespective of sex, racial or ethnic origin, religion or belief, disability, age or sexual orientation. Targeting groups at high risk of discrimination or social exclusion is key in supporting the implementation of the Social Pillar principles.

While the evaluation acknowledges the added value of the framework, it notes that Roma people in Europe continue to face discrimination and socioeconomic exclusion. (9) The evaluation and the conclusions drawn from it by the Council, the European Parliament and several Europe-wide and national civil society organisations 59 show the need for a renewed and stronger commitment to Roma equality and inclusion. That commitment should ensure a specific focus on non-discrimination, including by tackling antigypsyism - a specific form of racism against Roma people - and focusing on the four socioeconomic inclusion areas of education, employment, health and housing 60 . It should also reflect the needs of specific groups and the diversity of the Roma population; involve Roma in the design, implementation, monitoring and evaluation of Roma equality and inclusion strategies; improve target setting, data collection, monitoring and reporting; and make mainstream policies more sensitive to Roma equality and inclusion.

The Communication sets EU level objectives and targets and minimum commitments for all Member States, possibly complemented by additional national efforts and EU support depending on the national context and size of the Roma population. Recent data show that six out of ten Europeans still believe that discrimination against Roma people is widespread in their country, while over six out of ten agree that society could benefit if the Roma were integrated better 65 . The overarching objective of this Recommendation is to help promote equality and combating exclusion of Roma, with their active involvement. (12) The COVID-19 pandemic brings an extreme exposure of excluded and marginalised Roma communities to both negative health and socioeconomic impacts, which risks further aggravating existing inequalities. This Recommendation strives for reducing structural inequalities faced by Roma by tackling the limited access to clean water 66 , sanitary infrastructure and healthcare services, lack of facilities and digital skills that would enable people to participate in distance education, the high levels of economic precariousness, overcrowded households, segregated settlements or camps. (13) In the context of rising populism 67 and racism within the Union 68 , there is a need to focus on fighting and preventing discrimination, including by tackling antigypsyism, which is a root cause of and has an impact on discrimination and exclusion. The EU anti-racism action plan 2020-2025 69 acknowledges this and sets out concrete action to combat racism. Antigypsyism is a still highly accepted 70 form of racism, which has its origins in how mainstream society views and treats those considered as \u2018gypsies\u2019 in a process of historical \u2018othering\u2019, which builds on stereotypes and attitudes, even if unintentional or unconscious.
