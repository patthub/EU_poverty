        "I (Resolutions, recommendations and opinions) OPINIONS EUROPEAN DATA PROTECTION SUPERVISOR Opinion of the European Data Protection Supervisor on the legislative proposals on alternative and online dispute resolution for consumer disputes (2012/C 136/01) THE EUROPEAN DATA PROTECTION SUPERVISOR, Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 16 thereof, Having regard to the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, and in particular Articles 7 and 8 thereof, Having regard to Directive 95/46/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 24 October 1995 on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data ( 1 ), Having regard to Regulation (EC) No 45/2001 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 18 December 2000 on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data by the Community institutions and bodies and on the free movement of such data ( 2 ), and in particular Article 41 thereof, HAS ADOPTED THE FOLLOWING OPINION: I. INTRODUCTION I.1. Consultation of the EDPS and aim of the Opinion 1. On 29 November 2011, the Commission adopted two legislative proposals on alternative dispute resolution (here\u00ad inafter: \u2018the proposals\u2019): \u2014 proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on alternative dispute resolution for consumer disputes (hereinafter: \u2018the ADR proposal\u2019) ( 3 ), \u2014 proposal for a regulation on online dispute resolution for consumer disputes (hereinafter: \u2018the ODR proposal\u2019) ( 4 ). 2. On 6 December 2011, the EDPS received the ADR proposal and the ODR proposal for consultation. The EDPS had also been consulted informally before the adoption of the proposals and has issued informal comments. The EDPS welcomes this early consultation and the fact that most of the recommendations contained in these comments have been included in the proposals. 3. The present Opinion aims at analysing the processing of personal data foreseen by the proposals and at explaining how they address data protection issues. It will focus on the ODR proposal, as it involves a centralised processing of personal data related to disputes through an online platform. I.2. Aim of the proposals 4. Alternative dispute resolution schemes (ADR) provide an alternative means of solving disputes which is usually less costly and faster than bringing a case to court. The ADR proposal aims at ensuring that these entities are in place in all EU Member States to solve any cross-border consumer dispute arising from the sale of goods or the provision of services in the EU. EN 11.5.2012 Official Journal of the European Union C 136/1 ( 1 ) OJ L 281, 23.11.1995, p. 31. ( 2 ) OJ L 8, 12.1.2001, p. 1. ( 3 ) COM(2011) 793 final. ( 4 ) COM(2011) 794 final. ",
        "5. The ODR proposal builds on this EU-wide availability of ADR for consumer disputes. It establishes an online platform (hereinafter: the \u2018ODR platform\u2019) that consumers and traders will be able to use to transmit complaints on cross-border online transactions to the competent ADR entity. II. GENERAL REMARKS 6. The EDPS supports the aim of the proposals and welcomes the fact that data protection principles have been taken into account from the earliest stage of the drafting process. 7. The EDPS also welcomes the references to the applicability of the data protection legislation in the ODR proposal ( 1 ) and to the applicability of national legislation implementing Directive 95/46/EC in the context of the ADR proposal ( 2 ), as well as the references to the consultation to the EDPS ( 3 ). III. SPECIFIC REMARKS III.1. Role of the controllers: need for a clear allocation of responsibilities 8. According to the ODR proposal, the data will be processed by three types of actors in the context of each dispute submitted through the ODR platform: \u2014 ADR entities, \u2014 ODR facilitators, that will provide support to the resolution of disputes submitted via the ODR plat\u00ad form ( 4 ), \u2014 the Commission. Article 11(4) states that each of these actors is to be considered as a controller as regards the processing of personal data related to their responsibilities. 9. However, many of these controllers could be deemed responsible for the processing of the same personal data ( 5 ). For example, data related to a particular dispute sent through the ODR platform may be examined by several ODR facilitators and by the competent ADR scheme who will deal with the dispute. The Commission may also process these personal data for the operation and maintenance of the ODR platform. 10. In this respect, the EDPS welcomes the fact that recital 20 of the ODR proposal states that data protection legislation applies to all of these actors. However, the legislative part of the ODR proposal should specify at least to which of the controllers data subjects should address their requests of access, rectification, blocking and erasure; and which controller would be accountable in case of specific breaches of the data protection legislation (for example, for security breaches). Data subjects should also be informed accordingly. III.2. Access limitation and retention period 11. According to Article 11 of the ODR proposal, access to personal data processed through the ODR platform is limited to: \u2014 the competent ADR entity for the purposes of the resolution of the dispute, \u2014 ODR facilitators to support the resolution of the dispute (e.g., to facilitate the communication between the parties and the relevant ADR entity or to inform consumers of means of redress other than the ODR platform), \u2014 the Commission, if necessary for the operation and maintenance of the ODR platform, including to monitor the use of the platform by ADR entities and ODR facilitators ( 6 ). 12. The EDPS welcomes these limitations of the purpose and the access rights. However, it is not clear whether all ODR facilitators (at least 54) will have access to personal data related to all the disputes. The EDPS recommends clarifying that every ODR facilitator will have access only to the data needed to fulfil his or her obligations under Article 6(2). 13. As regards the retention period, the EDPS welcomes Article 11(3), which allows the retention of personal data only for the time necessary for the resolution of the dispute and for the exercise of data subjects' right of access. He also welcomes the obligation to automatically delete the data six months after the conclusion of the dispute.

( 3 ) Preambles and explanatory memoranda of the proposals. ( 4 ) Each Member State will have to designate one contact point for ODR that will host at least two ODR facilitators. The Commission will establish a network of ODR contact points.

",
        "III.3. Processing of special categories of data: possible need for prior check 14. Taking into account the purpose of the proposals, it is possible that personal data related to suspected infringements will be processed. Health data might also be processed in the context of disputes arising from the sale of goods or provision of services related to health. 15. The processing of personal data in the framework of the ODR platform may therefore be subject to prior checking by national data protection authorities and by the EDPS, as required by Article 27 of Regulation (EC) No 45/2001 and Article 20 of Directive 95/46/EC ( 1 ). The EDPS understands that the Commission is aware of the necessity of assessing, before the ODR platform becomes operational, whether the processing should be subject to prior checking. III.4. The EDPS should be consulted on delegated and implementing acts relating to the complaint form 16. The information to be provided in the electronic complaint form (hereinafter: \u2018the form\u2019) is detailed in the Annex to the ODR proposal. This includes personal data of the parties (name, address and, if applicable, e-mail and website address) and data aimed at determining which ADR entity is competent to deal with the relevant dispute (con\u00ad sumer's place of residence at the time the goods or services were ordered, type of goods or services involved, etc.). 17. The EDPS welcomes Article 7(6) which reminds that only accurate, relevant and not excessive data can be processed through the form and its attachments. The list of data contained in the Annex also respects the purpose limitation principle. 18. However, this list can be modified by delegated acts and the modalities of the form will be regulated by implementing acts ( 2 ). The EDPS recommends including a reference to the need to consult the EDPS as long as these acts concern the processing of personal data. III.5. Security measures: need for a privacy impact assessment 19. The EDPS welcomes the provisions dedicated to confiden\u00ad tiality and security. The security measures detailed in Article 12 of the ODR proposal include access controls, a security plan and security incident management. 20. The EDPS recommends adding also a reference to the need to conduct a privacy impact assessment (including a risk assessment) and to the fact that compliance with data protection legislation and data security should be period\u00ad ically audited and reported. 21. In addition, the EDPS would like to remind that the devel\u00ad opment of IT tools for the establishment of the ODR platform should integrate privacy and data protection from the very early design stage (privacy by design), including the implementation of tools enabling users to better protect personal data (such as authentication and encryption). III.6. Information to data subjects 22. The EDPS welcomes recital 21 of the ODR proposal, which states that data subjects should be informed about the processing of their personal data and their rights through a publicly available privacy notice. However, the obligation to inform data subjects should also be included in the legislative part of the ODR proposal. 23. In addition, data subjects should also be informed on which controller is responsible for compliance with their rights. The privacy notice should be clearly visible for anyone filling the form. IV. CONCLUSION 24. The EDPS welcomes the fact that data protection principles have been integrated in the text, in particular as regards the purpose and access limitation, the limitation of the retention period and the security measures. However, he recommends: \u2014 clarifying the responsibilities of the controllers and informing data subjects accordingly, \u2014 clarifying the limitation of access rights, \u2014 complementing the provisions on security, \u2014 mentioning the need to consult the EDPS on delegated and implementing acts related to the processing of personal data. EN 11.5.2012 Official Journal of the European Union C 136/3 ( 1 ) Article 27 of Regulation (EC) No 45/2001 requires that the processing of \u2018data relating to health and to suspected offences, offences, criminal convictions or security measures\u2019 be subject to prior checking by the EDPS. According to Article 20(1) of Directive 95/46/EC, the processing operations likely to present specific data protection risks, as determined by national data protection legislation, are subject to prior checking by the national data protection authority.

The term \u2018maximum work periods and minimum rest periods\u2019 set out in point (a) of the first subparagraph of Article 3(1) of Directive 96/71/EC covers terms and conditions regarding \u2018maximum normal working hours\u2019, such as those described in the request for an Advisory Opinion. 2. Article 3(1), first subparagraph, point (c) of Directive 96/71/EC, as interpreted in light of Article 36 of the EEA Agreement, does, in principle, preclude an EEA State from requiring an undertaking established in another EEA State which provides services in the territory of the first State to pay its workers the minimum remuneration fixed by the national rules of that State for work assignments requiring overnight stays away from home, unless the rules providing for such additional remuneration pursue a public interest objective and their application is not disproportionate. It is for the national authorities or, as the case may be, the courts of the host EEA State, to determine whether those rules in fact pursue an objective in the public interest and do so by appropriate means. 3. Directive 96/71/EC does not permit an EEA State to secure workers posted to its territory from another EEA State compensation for travel, board and lodging expenses in the case of work assignments requiring overnight stays away from home, unless this can be justified on the basis of public policy provisions. 4. The proportion of the employees covered by the relevant collective agreement, before it was declared universally applicable, has no bearing on the answers to questions 1(a), (b) and (c).

Member State or Third Country: Finland 3. Description of the agricultural product or foodstuff: 3.1. Nature of product: Class 1.7. Fresh fish, molluscs, and crustaceans and products derived therefrom 3.2. Description of the product to which the name in point 1 applies: The name Kitkan viisas is used for vendace (Coregonus albula) caught in the lakes of the Koillismaa highlands. The main characteristics of Kitkan viisas are the following: \u2014 Kitkan viisas are smaller in size than many other vendace stocks. Depending on annual fluctuations in growth conditions, their average size after one growth period is between 7 and 9 cm. Due to their small size, the backbone of the vendace does not harden, but instead remains soft. The small size of the fish is due to the low levels of nutrients in the waterways and the briefness of the growth period. \u2014 Kitkan viisas reach maturity at around 15 months of age, when the fish are approximately 8 cm long and weigh 4-5 grams. The fish have a dark colour; their backs are almost black, their sides are bright silver and their fins are light-coloured. Vendace can be distinguished from whitefish, bleak and other fish fry of the same size by their lower jaw, which is significantly longer than their upper jaw. Vendace roe is small in size: a litre of roe contains approximately 500 000 fish eggs. The spawning season is in autumn, after which the fish eggs spend the winter in a state of rest, developing into fish fry over a few weeks during the spring. EN 11.5.2012 Official Journal of the European Union C 136/13 ( 1 ) OJ L 93, 31.3.2006, p. 12. ",
        "\u2014 In winter, the intestines of Kitkan viisas empty completely because of the enforced fast during the long winter, which is why it does not need to be cleaned. Kitkan viisas is sold fresh and frozen. 3.3. Raw materials (for processed products only): Not relevant 3.4. Feed (for products of animal origin only): The vendace feed on plankton and insect larvae. The vendace get all the nutrition they need from the natural freshwater of the defined geographical area. 3.5. Specific steps in production that must take place in the defined geographical area: The fish must be caught in the defined geographical area. To guarantee quality, preliminary processing must also take place in the same defined geographical area. Preliminary processing involves cleaning and freezing the fish, which here means the following: When the fish is cleaned, at least the guts and gills of the vendace are removed. If desired, the head and tail and other parts of the fish may also be removed. However, the original form of the vendace must remain recognisable. When frozen, the temperature of the fish is reduced to at least \u2013 18 degrees Celsius. 3.6. Specific rules concerning slicing, grating, packaging, etc.: Not relevant 3.7. Specific rules concerning labelling: Not relevant 4. Concise definition of the geographical area: The geographical area consists of the river basins of the Koutajoki and Kemjoki highland catchment areas, located in the municipalities of Kuusamo and Posio, which run into the White Sea, not including lakes located on the Russian border area. 5. Link with the geographical area: 5.1. Specificity of the geographical area: Kitkan viisas vendace live in the river basin of the Koillismaa highlands. The area is located near the Arctic Circle of the northern hemisphere, where the lakes are covered by ice from October to May. On average, the Koillismaa highlands are 240 metres above sea level. The waterways of the area are low in nutrients and clear, with near-neutral acidity levels. The fluctuations in the height and current of the waterways are extremely small, which is why there are no currents in the lake basin at any time of the year. The oxygenation conditions of the water also remain good during the winter period. These environmental conditions mean that vendace remain in the water basins where they are born and do not migrate into lower bodies of water. Because Kitkan viisas are so small, special fishing technology is needed to catch it. Seine nets are the traditional and most common method used by local fishermen to catch vendace. During the spawning season, nets are also used to catch vendace, and in summer, traps. Trawlers are not used to catch Kitkan viisas. 5.2. Specificity of the product: The Arctic conditions and the low nutrient levels of the waterways mean that Kitkan viisas are significantly smaller than several other species of freshwater vendace. Due to their small size, the backbone of Kitkan viisas does not harden, but instead remains soft. The enforced fast during the long winter means that the intestines of the vendace empty entirely, which is why it can be consumed in winter without being cleaned.

        "5.3. Causal link between the geographical area and the quality or characteristics of the product (for PDO) or a specific quality, the reputation or other characteristic of the product (for PGI): Kitkan viisas are recognised by their distinctive appearance, which is a result of the Arctic conditions of the Koillismaa highlands and the low nutrient levels of its waterways. The traditional fishing methods used in the area and the use of uncleaned vendace in winter are specifically due to the characteristics of the geographical area. The fact that Kitkan viisas do not migrate to lower waterways is due to environmental conditions in the waterways of the geographical area.

Concise definition of the geographical area: The production area of \u2018Cipolla Rossa di Tropea Calabria\u2019 PGI covers suitable land in all or part of the following municipalities in the region of Calabria: (a) Province of Cosenza: part of the municipalities of Fiumefreddo, Longobardi, Serra d'Aiello, Belmonte and Amantea. (b) Province of Catanzaro: part of the municipalities of Nocera Terinese, Falerna, Gizzeria, Lamezia Terme and Curinga. (c) Province of Vibo Valentia: part of the municipalities of Pizzo, Vibo Valentia, Briatico, Parghelia, Zambrone, Zaccanopoli, Zungri, Drapia, Tropea, Ricadi, Spilinga, Joppolo and Nicotera. 5. Link with the geographical area: 5.1. Specificity of the geographical area: \u2018Cipolla Rossa di Tropea Calabria\u2019 is grown in medium, sand-rich loam or in heavy loam rich in clay or lime, in the coastal area or around alluvial rivers and streams which, despite the gravel, does not restrict the growth and development of the bulbs. Coastal land is ideal for growing early onions for fresh consumption. Inland areas with heavier, clay-rich soil are ideal for growing late onions for storage. Today as in the past, red onions are grown in family vegetable patches as well as in large crops and form part of the rural landscape, local food and dishes and traditional recipes. EN 11.5.2012 Official Journal of the European Union C 136/19 ",
        "The soil and climate conditions in the defined area contribute to the high quality and uniqueness of the product, which is widely acclaimed the world over. 5.2. Specificity of the product: The \u2018Cipolla Rossa di Tropea Calabria\u2019 is known for its qualitative and organoleptic characteristics, including the tenderness and sweetness of the bulb and its high digestibility. These characteristics enable the \u2018Cipolla Rossa di Tropea Calabria\u2019 also to be consumed raw, in larger quantities than for normal onions. 5.3. Causal link between the geographical area and the quality or characteristics of the product (for PDO) or a specific quality, the reputation or other characteristic of the product (for PGI): The application to register the PGI \u2018Cipolla Rossa di Tropea Calabria\u2019 is justified by the product's reputation and recognition thanks partly to a number of advertising campaigns, as shown in historical and bibliographical references. Historical and bibliographical references credit the arrival of onions in the Mediterranean basin and Calabria first to the Phoenicians and then to the Greeks. Highly appreciated in the Middle Ages and during the Renaissance, it was considered a staple food and key to the local economy where it was bartered for, sold, and exported by sea to Tunisia, Algeria and Greece. The many travellers who went to Calabria between 1700 and 1800 and visited the Tyrrhenian coast between Pizzo and Tropea frequently refer to the red onions commonly found there. Onions have always been a feature of the rural diet and of local production. Dr Albert, who travelled to Calabria in 1905 and visited Tropea, was struck by the poverty of the local people who ate only onions. In the early 1900s, onion growing in Tropea moved from the family garden and vegetable patch and became a major crop. In 1929, the Valle Ruffa aqueduct paved the way for irrigation and, as a result, better yields and quality. The product became more widespread during the Bourbon period, reaching north European markets and swiftly becoming sought after and prized, as described in Studi sulla Calabria \u2014 1901 , which refers to the shape of the bulb, the red oblong onions from Calabria. The first organised statistical information on onion-growing in Calabria is contained in the Reda agricultural encyclopaedia (1936-1939). Because of its unique characteristics, which have helped forge a nationwide reputation and, above all, its historical and cultural significance in the area concerned, a significance that is still reflected today in farming practices, cooking, in everyday language and folkloric events, attempts have been made to imitate the product and make unauthorised use of the designation.
