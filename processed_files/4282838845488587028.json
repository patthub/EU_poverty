        "R. whereas current macroeconomic policies should better reflect the importance of unpaid care and domestic work and whereas evidence shows that 80 % of care in the EU is provided by unpaid informal carers, 75 % of whom are women; whereas certain taxation policies, underfunded public services and access to social services disproportionately affect low-income groups, and especially women, as they often fill the gaps in caregiving, education and other kinds of family support, typically without remuneration, perpetuating women\u2019s disproportionate responsibility for care; whereas it is the poorest and most vulnerable women in EU countries who face the double burden of informal care work and low paid precarious work ( 1 ); S. whereas almost all Member States have dualised their income tax systems by applying a higher marginal tax rate to the income of the second earner and by introducing uniform tax rates for most types of capital income; whereas the disproportionately high tax burden for second earners in most Member States as a result of the direct progressive tax schedules applied to labour incomes is one of the main disincentives for women\u2019s participation in the labour market ( 2 ), in addition to other joint tax and benefit provisions and the costs and lack of universal childcare services; T. whereas the levels of the inactivity trap (currently at 40 %) and the low-wage trap, which disproportionately affect women and discourage them from full participation in employment, are determined to a significant degree by direct tax provisions, in addition to the loss of benefits; U. whereas in some Member States families can still have tax reductions when having a dependent spouse, allowances for married couples and/or tax credits for sole-earner couples, which perpetuate asymmetries with single-parent families, single parents being mostly women, and fail to recognise the diversity of family situations existing in the EU; whereas such tax advantages usually disincentivise married women from accessing the labour market and directly or indirectly provoke the reallocation of women\u2019s time from paid to unpaid work; V. whereas the impact of taxation on gender gaps concerning corporate wealth, personal wealth and property is an under-developed area of research and there is an urgent need to ensure that gender-disaggregated data in these areas is available; 1. Calls on the Commission to support gender equality in all taxation policies and to issue specific guidelines and recommendations to Member States in order to eliminate tax-related gender biases and to ensure that no new tax, spending laws, programmes or practices that increase market or after-tax income gender gaps are established; 2. Stresses that, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as defined in Article 5(3) of the TEU, Member States are free to set the rules for their tax policies, provided they comply with EU rules; stresses, furthermore, that EU decisions on tax matters require unanimous agreement by all Member States; 3. Calls on the Commission to promote EU ratification of the CEDAW Convention, as it did for the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and is doing for the Istanbul Convention; 4. Encourages the Commission to enhance the status of the Strategic Engagement for Gender Equality by adopting it as a communication ( 3 ) and to include clear objectives and key actions to enhance equality between women and men through a sectoral analysis, including taxation aspects, of all EU actions; calls on the Commission and the Member States to ensure that EU legislation against indirect and direct gender discrimination is properly implemented and its progress systematically monitored, in order to ensure that men and women are equal actors; C 411/42 EN Official Journal of the European Union 27.11.2020 Tuesday 15 January 2019 ( 1 ) Institute of Development Studies, Redistributing Unpaid Care Work \u2014 Why Tax Matters for Women\u2019s Rights .

        "Direct taxation Personal income taxation 5. Notes that tax policies have varying impacts on different types of households (dual-earner households, female and male single-earner households, etc.); underlines the negative consequences of failing to incentivise women\u2019s employment and their economic independence and draws attention to the high gender pension gap resulting from joint taxation; stresses that tax systems should no longer be based on the assumption that households pool and share their funds equally and that individual taxation is instrumental to achieving tax fairness for women; considers it essential that men and women become equal earners and equal carers; urges all Member States to phase in individual taxation while ensuring full preservation of all financial and other benefits linked to parenthood in current joint taxation systems; acknowledges that transition periods towards such an individual taxation system may be necessary in some Member States; calls, during these transition periods, for the elimination of all tax expenditures based on joint income and notes the need to ensure that all tax benefits, cash benefits and in-kind government services are given to individuals in order to ensure their financial and societal autonomy; 6. Takes note of the Commission communication of 20 November 2017 entitled \u2018EU Action Plan 2017-2019 \u2014 Tackling the gender pay gap\u2019 (COM(2017)0678), which recognises eight areas for action and calls on the Member States to step up their efforts to tackle the gender pay gap effectively in order to improve the economic situation of women and safeguard their economic independence; 7. Notes that the net personal average tax rates for second earners with two children stood at 31 % on average for the EU OECD members and 28 % for all OECD countries in 2014; calls on the Commission to continuously monitor and strengthen the application of the equal pay for equal work and work of equal value principle between women and men in Member States, to ensure that inequalities are eradicated in both the labour market and taxation sectors; calls on the Commission and the Member States to tackle horizontal and vertical segregation in the labour market by eliminating gender inequalities and discrimination in employment and, in particular through education and awareness-raising, encouraging girls and women to take up studies, jobs and careers in innovative growth sectors, including in ICT and STEM subjects; 8. Calls on the Member States to ensure that tax incentives related to employment and self-employment do not discriminate on the basis of gender and to consider tax incentives and other fiscal benefits or services for second earners and single parents; calls on the Member States furthermore to look at different ways of tackling the issue of women\u2019s underrepresentation in the labour market and to address potential economic disincentives for second earners entering the labour market; notes that gender bias may occur also in work-related tax deductions and exemptions, such as favourable tax treatment of extra working hours, which benefit mostly professions that are currently occupied by men; 9. Calls on the Member States not to reduce the progressive nature of their personal income tax systems, for example by attempting to simplify personal income taxation; 10. Calls for personal income tax (structure of rates, exemptions, deductions, allowances, credits, etc.) to be designed to actively promote equal sharing of paid and unpaid work, income and pension rights between women and men, and to eliminate incentives that perpetuate unequal gender roles; 11. Considers that, owing to labour market inequalities, women may be disproportionately affected by certain tax policies; believes that the appropriate way to tackle this problem is through the reform of labour market instruments to address the issue of women\u2019s economic independence; calls for the Member States and the Union institutions to promote studies on the effects of the gender gap on the pensions and financial independence of women, taking account of issues such as the ageing population, gender differences in health conditions, and life expectancy, the fact that family structures have changed and the number of single-occupancy homes has risen, and differences in women\u2019s personal situations; 27.11.2020 EN Official Journal of the European Union C 411/43 Tuesday 15 January 2019 ",
        "Corporate taxation 12. Calls for the Member States identified in the European Semester for their aggressive tax planning provisions to amend their legislation and close these provisions as soon as possible ( 1 ); is concerned by the risk that, while working on coordinating their corporate tax bases, Member States may find new provisions to facilitate aggressive tax planning by corporations, leaving it to Member States to find other sources of taxation (including consumption taxes), which have a disproportionate effect on women; 13. Calls on the Member States to rationalise the tax incentives or breaks they give to corporations, to ensure that these incentives and tax breaks mostly benefit small enterprises and favour real innovation, and to assess ex ante and a posteriori the potential impact of these incentives on gender equality; Taxation of capital and wealth 14. Notes that corporation and wealth taxes play a crucial role in reducing inequality through redistribution within the tax system and in providing revenues to fund social provisions and social transfers; 15. Notes that unavailability, prohibitive costs and lack of sufficient infrastructure offering quality childcare services remain a significant barrier to, primarily, women\u2019s equal participation in all aspects of society, including employment; calls on the Member States to enhance tax policies to improve the availability and accessibility of affordable, high-quality childcare services, through tax incentives in order to reduce the obstacles for women to taking up paid employment and contribute to a more equal distribution of paid and unpaid work within households, and thus minimise gender pay and pension gaps; emphasises that these policies should allow women\u2019s integration in the labour market and particularly focus on low-income families, single-parent families and other disadvantaged groups; 16. Calls on Member States to fully implement Council Directive 2004/113/EC of 13 December 2004 implementing the principle of equal treatment between men and women in the access to and supply of goods and services, which, among other matters, addresses and prohibits discrimination based on sex in the provision of financial goods and services in insurance and related fields; calls for data to be collected in order to obtain precise information regarding possible gaps in the implementation process; stresses that, property ownership is subject to the subsidiarity principle and that there is no property ownership law in the EU that would discriminate against women or men, as the right to property lies with the owner; 17. Deplores the fact that, overall, the contribution of wealth-based taxes to overall tax revenues has remained rather limited, at 5,8 % of overall tax revenues in the EU-15 and 4,3 % in the EU-28 ( 2 ); 18. Deplores the fact that the share of taxes on capital has shown a declining trend since 2002 as a consequence, inter alia, of the general tendency of no longer applying the regular personal income tax schedule to capital incomes, but rather taxing them at relatively moderate flat rates, observable in many Member States ( 3 ); Indirect taxation 19. Notes that the share of consumption taxes rose in the Union from 2009 to 2016; notes that VAT typically accounts for between two thirds and three quarters of consumption taxes in the Member States and that VAT has reached a share of about one fifth of overall tax revenues on average in the EU ( 4 ); 20. Notes that gender bias occurs where tax legislation intersects with gender relations, norms and economic behaviour; notes that VAT exerts a gender bias because of women\u2019s consumption patterns, which differ from those of men as they purchase more goods and services with the aim of promoting health, education and nutrition ( 5 ); is concerned that this, C 411/44 EN Official Journal of the European Union 27.11.2020 Tuesday 15 January 2019 ( 1 ) European Commission, European Semester: Country Reports, 7 March 2018.

        "combined with women\u2019s lower income, leads to women bearing a larger VAT burden; calls on the Member States to provide for VAT exemptions, reduced rates and zero-rates for products and services with positive social, health and/or environmental effects, in line with the ongoing revision of the EU VAT Directive; 21. Considers period poverty to be an ongoing issue in the EU, with Plan International UK estimating that 1 in 10 girls cannot afford sanitary products; regrets that female hygienic products, and care products and services for children, elderly people or people with disabilities, are still not considered as basic goods in all Member States; calls on all Member States to eliminate the so-called \u2018care and tampon tax\u2019 by making use of the flexibility introduced in the VAT Directive and applying exemptions or 0 % VAT rates to these essential basic goods; recognises that a reduction in price due to an exemption of VAT on these products would have an immeasurable benefit for young women; supports the movements undertaken to promote widespread sanitary supply availability and encourages Member States to provide complementary feminine hygiene supplies in certain (public) spaces such as schools, universities and homeless shelters, and for women from low-income backgrounds, with the aim of eradicating period poverty completely across EU public bathrooms; Impact of tax evasion and avoidance on gender equality 22. Notes that tax evasion and tax avoidance are major contributors to gender inequality in the Union and globally as they limit the resources available to governments to increase equality at national and international level ( 1 ); 23. Recalls its recommendations of 13 December 2017 following the inquiry into money laundering, tax avoidance and tax evasion ( 2 ), and those from previous special committees (TAX and TAX2) drawn up with a view to fighting tax evasion and avoidance in the EU; calls on the Member States to adopt public country-by-country reporting, an EU CCCTB and a revised interest and royalties directive as soon as possible; 24. Calls on the Commission and the Member States to promote gender-equal taxation reforms in all international fora, including the OECD and the UN, and to support the creation of a UN intergovernmental tax body with universal membership, equal voting rights and equal participation of women and men; stresses that this body should be well equipped to develop specific gender taxation expertise; 25. Notes that double taxation treaties between Member States and developing countries do not usually promote source taxation, therefore benefiting multinational corporations at the expense of mobilisation of domestic resources by developing countries; notes that the lack of domestic resource mobilisation prevents fully financed public services such as healthcare or education in these countries, which disproportionately impacts women and girls; urges the Member States to mandate the Commission to review existing double taxation treaties so as to examine and address these problems, and to ensure that future double taxation treaties include gender equality provisions in addition to general anti-abuse provisions; 26. Calls on the TAX3 special committee to include a gender perspective in the formulation of its recommendations; Gender mainstreaming in tax policies 27. Calls on the Commission and the Member States to carry out regular gender impact assessments of fiscal policies from a gender equality perspective, focusing on the multiplier effect and implicit bias to ensure that neither direct nor indirect discrimination feature in any fiscal policies in the EU; 27.11.2020 EN Official Journal of the European Union C 411/45 Tuesday 15 January 2019 ( 1 ) UN \u2018Final study on illicit financial flows, human rights and the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development\u2019 of the Independent Expert on the effects of foreign debt and other related international financial obligations of states on the full enjoyment of all human rights, particularly economic, social and cultural rights, 2016.

        "28. Calls on the Member States to share best practices on the design of their labour markets and taxation systems to help reduce gender pay and pensions gaps, which may therefore promote more fairness and equality in tax treatment between men and women; 29. Reminds the Commission that since the Lisbon Treaty incorporated the Charter of Fundamental Rights into primary law, it has a legally binding obligation to promote gender equality in its policies and actions; 30. Recognises that many advocacy and civil society groups feel marginalised from discussions about taxation policy due to a lack of expertise, and that industry and financial groups are thus over-represented in budgeting consultative processes in many Member States; calls for the Member States to address this issue by providing education on budgetary processes in addition to opportunities for genuine consultation with civil society; 31.
