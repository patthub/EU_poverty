        "- 1- The Committee of the Regions HAVING REGARD TO the proposal for a Council Regulation (EC) establishing a European monitoring centre for racism and xenophobia (COM(96) 615 final); HAVING REGARD TO the decision taken by the Council on 14 February 1997, under Article 130b and the first paragraph of Article 198c of the Treaty establishing the European Community, to consult the Committee of the Regions on the matter; HAVING REGARD TO its decision on 18 September 1996 to direct Commission 8 - Economic and Social Cohesion, Social Policy and Public Health - to draw up the relevant opinion; HAVING REGARD TO to the draft opinion (CdR 80/97) adopted by Commission 8 on 7 April 1997 (rapporteur: Mr Wyn); unanimously adopted the following opinion at its 18th plenary session on 11 and 12 June 1997 (meeting of 12 June): 1. Introduction The Committee of the Regions, in order to play a significant supportive role in the European Year Against Racism wants to develop its ideas and maximize its contribution as a leader of the local and regional tiers of government in their anti-racist strategies. It considers that it is at the local and regional level that anti-racist strategies can be most effective for it is at this level that the impact of racism and xenophobia is most keenly felt. The Committee of the Regions, pushing for real empowerment on a regional and local level of government, has an important role to play in this respect in ensuring that local and regional authorities have sufficient funds and powers at their disposal to tackle such problems effectively. The responsibility of central states to allocate those responsibilities is self-evident for it is at the local level that racism is best detected and resolved. 2. Strategy 2.1 The COR will organize an exhibition of best practice (forum) of anti-racist strategies amongst regional and local authorities. 2.2 The COR will organize a conference of regional and local authorities on anti-racism.

        "2- 2.3 The COR advocates effective anti-racist strategy in the workplace. Consideration should be given to areas outside the sphere and immediate impact of education where racism is on the increase. 2.4 Consideration should be given to the problems faced by minority cultures and languages of small nations and regions threatened by the stronger dominant culture of nation states. 50 million people in the EU speak minority languages. How can these languages be protected, thus avoiding the tension and racism that their erosion entails within the communities where they are spoken? 2.5 Minorities that have settled, possibly as a result of economic factors like unemployment and migration, within nation states need to be protected and accepted as part of the diversity of the EU and Member States. The danger of demanding respect for human rights and minorities from potential entrant states into the EU whilst neglecting that responsibility inside the EU must be emphasized. 2.6 The European Convention on Human Rights needs to be respected. 2.7 The COR believes it should have the right to approach the European Court of Justice to ensure that minority rights are introduced. It should have the right to appeal to the European Court of Justice on behalf of racially abused minorities, thus facilitating anti-racist policies. 2.8 The press, media and entertainment sector have a key role to play in anti-racist philosophy. They should be encouraged to develop anti-racist strategies. 2.9 Poverty, poor housing, lack of proper social amenities are factors that cause racism to fester within communities. The COR believes that anti-racist strategies should not be viewed in isolation from social factors, particularly unemployment. 3. Objectives The COR supports the following common objectives: 3.1 to highlight the threat posed by racism, xenophobia and anti-semitism to human rights and to economic and social cohesion of the Community; CdR 80/97 fin F-E/OU/ym .../... ",
        "- 3- 3.2 to encourage reflection and discussion on measures required in order to combat racism, xenophobia and anti-racism in Europe; 3.3 to promote the exchange of experience on good practice and effective strategies devised at local, national and European level to combat racism, xenophobia and anti-semitism; 3.4 to disseminate information on such good practice and effective strategies among regions working to combat racism, xenophobia and anti-semitism and to increase the effectiveness of such action in this area; 3.5 to make known the benefits of integration policies, implemented at national level, in particular in the fields of employment, education, training and accommodation; 3.6 to turn to good account whenever possible the experience of persons actually affected or likely to be affected by racism, xenophobia and anti-semitism, and promote their participation in society. 4. The COR supports the establishment of a European monitoring centre for racism and xenophobia 4.1 General The proposed establishment of a European monitoring centre should be supported. For many years it has been recognized by public and voluntary agencies working in the field of race relations that there is a lack of objective information and statistics are required to identify precisely the level of racist and related activity. 4.2 Specific 4.2.1 Article 2 - Objectives and tasks The proposed objectives and tasks seem appropriate. In terms of the collection, recording and interpretation of information it is obviously important that a uniform approach is adopted by all agencies involved in the process. Misrepresentation of information will lead to misguided policy responses. In carrying out its tasks the monitoring centre will be successful only if CdR 80/97 fin F-E/OU/ym .../... ",
        "it contributes constructively to appropriate policy formulation. There is a need for common ownership of the centre's objectives and tasks. The production of an annual and authoritative report could be a useful barometer of the size of the perceived problem. Recognition would be given to its content and consequently the problem itself. At its widest level recognition has to be given to the \"educational\" role of the centre. 4.2.2 Article 3 - Working methods and priorities Should consideration be given specifically to the level, type and repercussions of racial harassment? 4.2.3 Article 4 - European Racism and Xenophobia Information Network (RAXEN) The establishment of an information network is crucial to the work of the monitoring centre. Care has to be taken to ensure only authoritative agencies are involved in the provision of information. Clarity is required to ensure information is presented in a mutually agreed form. At a practical level, it would make sense to tap into existing Member State networks to obtain views and access to their own information gathering processes. 4.2.4 Article 7 - Cooperation with competent organizations or bodies Like RAXEN, there should be a pragmatic approach to initiating the networking and cooperation process. It has to be recognized that existing longstanding and competent organizations have contributed much to the gathering of information and experience in relation to racism and xenophobia. 4.3 Further specific initiatives for consideration The COR advocates: a) Consultation The Committee of the Regions should be involved in all consultations concerning anti-racist activities and race relations generally. b) Multi-faith/race/cultural promotion The COR should consider ways in which to develop and promote the valuable social and economic benefit brought into the regions by minority communities. Their richness of faith, CdR 80/97 fin F-E/OU/ym ",
        "- 5- culture and heritage needs celebrating. The COR is, however, concerned at the increase in xenophobia caused by dogmatic religious beliefs. c) Equality Consideration should be given to the ways which equality of opportunity and access to local authority services can be promoted. The COR advocates equality of opportunity between men and women and different races. d) Education The COR considers education, particularly pre-school nursery education, to be an important means through which racism and xenophobia can be eliminated. It advocates foreseeing measures to develop an effective anti-racist educational strategy. e) Employment All citizens, regardless of their race, should be guaranteed equal conditions of access to decent employment, both in legislative terms and in day-to-day practice. 5. Conclusions The only way serious progress can be made in addressing the problems of racism, xenophobia and anti-semitism is initially through the common acceptance of their existence. Authoritative and independent facts are required which measure the extent of the problem as well as their precise manifestation. Without that information, inappropriate responses can be made to problems that we do not fully understand. The establishment of the proposed monitoring centre could in the long term provide a major contribution to minimizing racist, anti-semitic and xenophobic behaviour through the provision of authentic information leading to appropriate policy formulation and resource allocation in the fight against anti-social behaviour. 6. Further information The COR supports: - The broad variety of activities that will take place in the Member States and at European level under the heading of the European Year Against Racism. These will range from local grass-root projects, to regional initiatives, national campaigns and high profile events organized at Community level. There will be two main strands of activity: information and communication, which will include political events, sports and cultural events, and information and communication campaigns; and exchange of experience, which will promote local and regional CdR 80/97 fin F-E/OU/ym .../... ",
        "projects, expert seminars and European-level conferences. The COR supports the activities and declarations of the Council of Europe on anti-racism, xenophobia and anti-semitism. Throughout the European Year Against Racism, national coordination committees in each of the Member States will coordinate events and action at national level. A limited number of local and regional projects, preferably with a transnational dimension, will also be supported by the European Commission, following a call for projects early in 1997, which will set out the deadlines, application procedures, priorities and levels of funding. In addition to this, organizations already involved in anti-racism work can highlight and promote ongoing work or models of good practice under the heading of the European Year Against Racism. The official logo will be available from the national coordination committees for the purpose. Brussels, 12 June 1997.
