        "Volume 2 of the Education and Training Monitor 2021 includes 27 individual country reports. It builds on the most up-to-date quantitative and qualitative evidence to present and assess the main recent and ongoing policy measures in each EU Member State. It therefore complements other sources of information which offer descriptions of national education and training systems. Section 1 presents a statistical overview of the main education and training indicators. Section 2 briefly identifies the main strengths and challenges of the country\u2019s education and training system. Section 3 focuses on well-being in education and training. Section 4 looks at investment in education and training. Section 5 deals with policies to modernise early childhood and school education. Section 6 covers vocational education and training and adult learning. Finally, Section 7 discusses measures to modernise higher education. The Education and Training Monitor 2021 was prepared by the European Commission\u2019s Directorate-General for Education, Youth, Sport and Culture (DG EAC), with contributions from the Directorate-General for Employment, Social Affairs and Inclusion (DG EMPL); the Education and Youth Policy Analysis Unit of the European Education and Culture Executive Agency (EACEA); the Eurydice network; Eurostat; the European Centre for the Development of Vocational Training and its European network of expertise on VET (ReferNet).

        "4 FRANCE Education and Training Monitor 2021 \u2013 Country analysis December 2021 2. Highlights \uf0b7 During the pandemic, France kept schools open to mitigate an increase in inequalities in education and took measures to combat student poverty in higher education. \uf0b7 Strengthening pre-primary and primary education, improving basic skills and reducing inequalities in education, as well as improving the school climate, remain the priorities in compulsory education. \uf0b7 France is gradually transforming its education and training system for the digital and green transitions. \uf0b7 Young people affected by the COVID-19 crisis are being provided with education, training, upskilling and reskilling opportunities in sync with skills needs . 3. A focus on well-being in education and training Lack of discipline in classrooms, violence and bullying are the main obstacles to pupils\u2019 and teachers\u2019 well-being at school . French schools have the least positive disciplinary climate in the EU, according to the PISA 2018 disciplinary climate index (-0.34 vs -0.1 mean index 1 ) (OECD, 2019a). The situation is worse for disadvantaged students (-0.45 vs EU average of -0.16) and students in disadvantaged schools (-0.50 vs -0.21). The gap between disadvantaged and advantaged schools, however, is not significantly different from the EU average (-0.33 vs -0.31) (Figure 3). The majority of French teachers (58.4%) perceive monitoring classroom discipline as one of the important sources of stress, ranking third on average in the EU (41.7%) (Eurydice, 2021). They also reported being \u2018intimidated\u2019 or \u2018verbally abused by students quite a bit or a lot\u2019 (24.6% vs EU average of 14.1% \u2013 fourth in the EU). During the first half of 2019/2020, school heads reported that on average 7.9 serious incidents per 1 000 students occurred in secondary education, of which 39% were verbal and 31% involved physical violence (DEPP, 2021a). On a positive note, fewer French students than on average in the EU reported being bullied at least a few times a month (19.8% vs 22.1%). Reducing bullying and improving the disciplinary climate have the potential to significantly improve educational outcomes (European Commission, 2020). Improving the school climate and preventing violence and bullying have become top priorities. The right to education without harassment has been included in the education code (Law on a School of Trust, 2019). France has a systemic policy approach to school climate which should contribute to improving educational outcomes, students\u2019 and teachers\u2019 well-being, safety and security and reducing inequalities in education. All schools need a violence prevention plan, including an action plan against all forms of harassment (MENJS, 2021a). These should focus on co-education with parents, a team strategy ensuring coherence between stakeholders, violence prevention, cooperation between students and motivation and commitment, quality of school life, partnership practices and justice at school (MENJS, 2021b). Mobile security teams are in place to help schools. School violence prevention programmes and school climate improvement pathways through a whole school approach are available. The long-running campaign against bullying (\u2018 Non au harc\u00e8lement\u2019 ) has regained momentum since 2020 (MENJS, 2020a). The national plan against racism and antisemitism (2018-2020) includes several measures to be implemented in compulsory and higher education, including against cyberbullying. School heads and inspectors are given training by a network of trainers from regional education academies. Regular surveys to monitor the mental health of students and evaluate bullying and violence at secondary school will be extended to primary schools and education staff between 2021 and 2023. A new observatory was set up in July 2021 to monitor the remuneration and well-being of education staff, and inform policies and decision-making. 1 Table III.B1.3.1 ",
        "FRANCE 5 Education and Training Monitor 2021 \u2013 Country analysis December 2021 Figure 3 - Index of disciplinary climate by school characteristics, PISA 2018 Source : OECD, PISA 2018. Note: Based on students' reports. Higher values in the index indicate a more positive disciplinary climate. France took measures to improve the mental health of pupils and teachers during the pandemic. Schools remained mostly open in 2020/2021 (Section 5), but the pandemic has had a major impact on the mental health of young people. In early 2021, special guidelines were issued for schools on how to identify and guide students in distress and suffering from domestic violence, and how to improve information for pupils and parents (MENJS 2021c). The Ministry of Education published online toolkits for all educational staff, and strengthened the remit of the 119 hotline \u2018Childhood in danger\u2019 campaign to preventing sexual, physical and psychological violence and negligence. Since 2021, the provision of (mental) healthcare has also been stepped up for compulsory education staff, with hotline hours to give teachers psychological support extended. The pandemic has affected higher education students the most . Higher education institutions shifted to remote teaching at the end of October 2020, allowing face-to-face teaching for small groups of vulnerable students from the end of January 2021. Half of the students reported having suffered from loneliness or isolation and 31% from psychological distress during the first lockdown. Despite their need for it being greater, 23% of students could not access healthcare during the pandemic because they lacked the financial means to do so, and 27% because it took too long to get an appointment (OVE, 2021). From early 2021, an additional 80 psychologists and 60 social assistants, student mentors in university residences and tutors were hired to direct students to the right support services. Students had access to free psychological consultations as part of a broader psychological support scheme through university health services or a platform bringing together a network of 1 740 psychologists, as well as the Nightline telephone service for listening to students. A report from the National Assembly recommends, in the wake of COVID-19, strengthening school healthcare services and the system of (mental) healthcare in universities, and providing students with accessible and affordable mental healthcare services ( Assembl\u00e9e Nationale , 2020). 4. Investing in education and training Public expenditure on education increased in real terms by 8.4% between 2010 and 2019, above the average EU increase of 6.4% . In 2019, education expenditure accounted for 9.5% of total public expenditure (EU average 10.0%) and remained, as a proportion of GDP, at 5.3%, above the EU average of 4.7%. The population from 3 to 18 year olds increased by 3.8% from 2010 to 2019 (EU average -0.8%). The proportion of funding for pre-primary and primary education increased from 24.3% in 2010 to 26.6% in 2019 (EU average 33.4%). This corresponds to a real increase of 18.7% in total spending on pre-primary and primary education, while public expenditure on secondary and tertiary education has increased more moderately (6.6% and 4%). -0,6 -0,4 -0,2 0 0,2 0,4 0,6 0,8 CY FR BE ES MT NL EL FI PT PL EU IE LU BG CZ SE DE LV EE HR IT SI DK SK HU AT LT RO M e a n i n d e x Disadvantaged schools Socio-economically average schools Advantaged schools ",
        "6 FRANCE Education and Training Monitor 2021 \u2013 Country analysis December 2021 The overall increase in education expenditure is largely due to an 11% increase in compensation for employees. Further strengthening pre-primary and primary education, tackling inequalities and investing in inclusive education are budget priorities for 2021. The EUR 1.6 billion 2021 budget increase (+2.6%) for compulsory education covers various wage premiums for school staff (+ EUR 400 million), of which EUR 100/month net is for novice teachers, improving the working conditions of primary school heads, providing additional support for pupils with a disability and digital equipment for schools, as well as the planned decreases in pre-primary and primary class sizes. To do the latter, an additional 2 039 teaching posts will be created, even though the pre- primary and primary pupil population is expected to fall by 65 000 in 2021 (MENJS, 2020b). A multiannual investment plan will support the agenda for transforming higher education institutions (HEI) and education and training ecosystems, partly supported by the National Recovery and Resilience Plan (NRRP). Calls for projects for the Investment Plan for the Future (\u2018PIA 4\u2019) will help HEI strengthen excellence in one or more areas, diversify sources of funding for higher education and research institutions, and transform school education by promoting innovation in teaching practices and in school organisation and management (EUR 750 million). The acceleration strategy \u2018Education and digital strategy\u2019 covers the digital transformation of education from kindergarten to university, and will support the development of Education Technology (EdTech) and performing digital education ecosystems (EUR 350 million) (Gouvernement, 2021). Box 1: The NRRP With EUR 39.368 billion in grants under the Recovery and Resilience Facility, the plan focuses on the green transition, competitiveness, and social and territorial cohesion. It fits into the broader EUR 100 billion recovery plan \u2018 France Relance\u2019 . More than 20% will be invested in education, training and skills related measures, with a strong emphasis on upskilling and reskilling; hiring subsidies for apprenticeships; digital infrastructure, equipment and skills; and energy-saving renovations of education infrastructure (see also other Sections). 5. Modernising early childhood and school education Schools closed in spring 2020, but remained largely open during the 2020/2021 school year. To limit early school leaving, learning loss and inequalities in education, primary schools closed for only 5 days and secondary schools for only 10 days in the first 5 months of 2021, except for local school closures. Secondary schools shifted to part-time remote teaching. Measures were taken to limit learning loss and inequalities in education . In 2020/2021, primary and secondary students in their first year benefited from additional personalised and homework support (\u2018 Devoirs faits\u2019 ). Personalised support or supervision in small groups (\u2018 Je r\u00e9ussis au lyc\u00e9e\u2019 ) was then extended to upper secondary students in 2021/2022. Summer camps (\u2018learning Holidays\u2019) consolidated educational outcomes with sports, cultural and sustainable development activities (EUR 120 million). This enabled vocational secondary school students, relatively more affected by lockdown, to resume or deepen their learning. Digital resources and services were further developed and pooled to ensure teaching continuity (MENJS, 2021). In September 2020, 80% of secondary and 20% of primary students used digital work environments. The NRRP will support digital transformation projects in schools. A national digital action plan is gradually being implemented (EGN\u00e9, 2021). Since September 2019, compulsory education starts at three (2019 Law on a School of Trust) . France was the best performer in the EU regarding participation in ECE of children aged 3 to 6 in 2019 (100% vs the EU average of 92.8% and the new EU-level target of 96% by 2030). Since 2021/2022, French and maths have been strengthened in the third pre-primary year curriculum to improve outcomes in primary education. The halving of class sizes in priority areas and reducing them to 24 pupils outside priority areas aim to improve basic skills from ages 5 to 7. The latter measure, concerning ",
        "FRANCE 7 Education and Training Monitor 2021 \u2013 Country analysis December 2021 26% of all classes, will be gradually rolled out between 2020/2021 and 2022/2023. By September 2019, 300 000 pupils in disadvantaged (high) priority areas 2 (20% of the age group) in the first and second years of primary education were being taught in classes of maximum 12 pupils. By 2022/2023, an additional 150 000 children in the third year of pre-primary education will also be taught in similar conditions. A recent study showed that the halving of the classes provided positive results, with better outcomes for maths than for French, and better results in the first than in the second grade. Pupils also showed more positive learning attitudes, enjoyed more personalised support and a better class climate (DEPP, 2021b). However, 70% of disadvantaged pupils in schools outside priority areas do not benefit from this measure (MENJS, 2019). Since September 2020, compulsory education and training has been extended from 16 to 18 years, supported by different measures to prevent early school leaving in the COVID- 19 context. In 2016, France had already reached the new EU-level target for 2030 (less than 9%) for early leavers from education and training (European Commission, 2020). This figure continued to fall in 2020 (8.0% vs the EU average of 9.9%), only to be thrown into jeopardy by the pandemic. Compulsory training includes education, training, apprenticeships, employment, civic service or social or professional integration schemes (2019 Law on a School of Trust). To prevent disengagement from education and training during the pandemic, the programme \u2018 one youngster, one job\u2019 provided additional places in vocational and tertiary education and support for social and professional integration programmes. Mentoring programmes by university students to help disadvantaged young people aim to expand their horizons and define their professional ambitions (\u2018 Working together for success \u2019 ) and additional places in boarding schools of excellence are supported by the NRRP. Comprehensive standardised tests in primary education showed that the spring 2020 school closures had a negative impact on educational outcomes mostly for disadvantaged pupils (in the 2020/2021 school year). At the beginning of the school year, pupils in grade 1 and 2 performed worse in French and maths than in the previous year, and the performance gap between pupils from priority and non-priority education areas was also higher. The mid-term evaluation of grade 1 in January 2021 showed better results overall in maths and French than in January 2020 (before COVID-19). However, the performance gap in French between priority and non-priority education areas had further increased. In contrast to the younger pupils at the beginning of the school year, pupils in year 6 performed better overall in French and maths, despite the school closures. But again, pupils in disadvantaged schools and in priority education areas made relatively less progress in maths, with their respective gaps remaining significant. While 71.5% of all pupils showed sufficient or very good mastery of maths, only 39.6% and 54% did so in high priority and priority education areas respectively (DEPP, 2021c, 2021d and 2021e). Education for sustainable development and the green transition has been reinforced in school education. Since September 2020, sustainable development and the green transition have been integrated into all school curricula from pre-primary to upper secondary level (MENJS, 2020c) and complemented by practical projects. Eco-delegates from each secondary school class implement school projects, play an ambassador\u2019s role and keep their peers informed. Elected eco- delegates are part of the school steering committee, which aims to involve all stakeholders. The green transition is being integrated into both initial and continuous teacher training. About 10% of schools currently have an \u2018 E3D\u2019 label (school with a global approach to sustainable development). But for that to be the case, buildings and their maintenance, as well as the school environment, also need to match up to ecological standards. The \u2018 Grenelle de l\u2019\u00e9ducation \u2019 plan should make the teaching profession more attractive by January 2022. France has a shortage of teachers and students in initial teacher training (Eurydice, 2021). Planned measures include better staff compensation, especially for young teachers (EUR 1.1 billion in 2021-2022) and more promotion possibilities; flexible career paths with mobility options for all staff; for secondary school heads, a financial premium and for primary school heads more teaching discharges to create room for management tasks; more autonomy in 2 REP(+): R\u00e9seaux d\u2019\u00e9ducation prioritaire (renforc\u00e9s) .

        "8 FRANCE Education and Training Monitor 2021 \u2013 Country analysis December 2021 recruitment for secondary schools; and more modern and decentralised management (MENJS, 2021e). Box 2: European Social Fund (ESF) project: \u2018 ARPE \u2019 (Support for the reintegration of students expelled multiple times) This project provided 930 young people with individual support to reintegrate into school. A whole school approach, involving mediators, an education support team at school, support for the student\u2019s family and outside partners for career guidance and apprenticeships, was developed. The project has provided valuable insights into the complex challenges faced by these young people and their families and significantly improved the reception and quality of intervention of the schools that reintegrate them. About half of the students concerned were reintegrated successfully without significant incidents in the first 3 months of the project. The EUR 1.75 million project (35% from the ESF) ran from September 2017 to June 2020. https://projet-arpe.fr/ 6. Modernising vocational education and training and adult learning At 39.3%, the proportion of upper secondary students in vocational education and training (VET) remained stable in 2019. This was 9.1 pps below the EU average. In 2020, 68.5% of VET graduates (ISCED 3-4, age 20-34) found employment between 1 and 3 years after graduating, representing a continuous decrease since 2018 (-3.7 pps). Given the rising skills mismatch in the French labour market, access to initial and continuous VET is crucial. In the 2020/2021 school year, implementation of the 2018 reform of the vocational training and apprenticeship systems to improve their efficiency and adequacy in meeting skills needs continued. A new quality label, \u2018 Qualiopi \u2019, has been implemented for initial training. A new service, \u2018Inserjeunes\u2019 , has also been set up, to develop indicators for the purpose of monitoring the professional integration of initial VET students. The set-up of the revamped individual learning account and the associated career guidance ( conseil en \u00e9volution professionnelle ) offered made it easier for workers to access continuous VET. The Skills Investment Plan (PIC) (2018-2022), complemented by other sources of EU funding, further helps unemployed people and job seekers access continuous VET. A first evaluation of this plan identified positive results overall despite a lack of adequate guidance, during and after the completion of training courses, on labour market (re)integration. COVID-19 has had a negative impact on the labour market integration of VET graduates. In July 2020, 65% of apprentices and 44% of school-based VET students were in employment, 12 months after graduation. This is respectively 3 and 6 pps less than the employment rates of students who graduated in 2018 (Dares, 2021a). Measures were also taken to improve the VET system\u2019s ability to weather a crisis. To ensure continuity, teaching material and digital equipment was provided for learners from disadvantaged areas; teaching staff could make use of digital workspaces and final assessments were based on continuing assessment instead of final exams. Career guidance services were ensured thanks to the digital support and infrastructure already in place. Despite these efforts, students from a disadvantaged background were more deeply affected. Education and training centres had to shift from on-site to online and hybrid training courses. Overall, jobseekers\u2019 access to training was affected by the crisis, with the courses of only one third of unemployed people fully maintained during the first lockdown. However, the system appears to have become more resilient, with this number growing up to 79% during the October 2020 lockdown (Dares, 2021b). The move towards online teaching has however highlighted existing social inequalities: people without IT equipment or a good quality internet connection at ",
        "FRANCE 9 Education and Training Monitor 2021 \u2013 Country analysis December 2021 home and digitally illiterate people are, by force of circumstances, excluded from these training opportunities. Access to upskilling and reskilling opportunities is particularly important for workers affected by the crisis, notably the less qualified, unemployed and people on short-term contracts. At 13.4% (on par with the EU average), unemployment of low-skilled people remained particularly high in 2020 3 , with skills mismatches presenting a persistent challenge. Although France had the strongest drop in adult participation in learning in the EU between 2019 and 2020 (-6.5 pps vs the EU average of 1.6 pps), it still was the seventh best performer in the EU. Only 13.0% of adults participated in learning, compared to 19.5% in 2019, ending the continuous increase since 2015. While adult learning is still higher in France than the EU average (9.2%), it is comparatively lower for less skilled people, the unemployed and people on short-term contracts. In 2020, low-skilled adults (4.6%) participated 2 times less than medium-skilled adults (9.5%) in learning, and 4 times less than highly skilled adults (20.5%) 4 . The share of unemployed people participating in learning stood at 11.1% in 2020, 3.4 pps less than in 2019. However, the main Public Employment Service, P\u00f4le Emploi , reported that more unemployed people started training courses in 2020 than in 2019 (+13%). This was also due to the rapid take-up of individual learning accounts ( CPF Autonome ). To mitigate the negative impact of the COVID-19 crisis, significant investments were made to increase employment, through skills acquisition and VET, with a particular focus on young people. The recovery plan strongly supported the VET and apprenticeship systems by providing additional places in VET to meet current and future skills needs, and by hiring subsidies (EUR 3.15 billion). Upskilling and reskilling adults is a priority in the French NRRP. The plan will support EUR 1.6 billion worth of investments for the skills acquisition of workers and unemployed people. Workers in partial (un)employment are able to attend training courses and participate in professional reconversions (EUR 1.07 billion); top-ups are provided on individual learning accounts for those wishing to develop their digital skills (EUR 25 million); training materials are being digitalised (EUR 304 million); unemployed people will be provided with distance training courses (EUR 160 million); and organisations supporting professional transitions will be given more resources (EUR 100 million). 7. Modernising higher education In 2020, 49.4% of adults between 25 and 34 held a tertiary education degree (vs the EU average of 40.5% and the new EU-level target of 45%) and this long-term increase is set to continue. France\u2019s gender gap (6.9%) is the lowest among the countries that have reached this target in the EU and both men (45.9%) and women (52.8%) have reached this target. However, the employment rate of recent graduates (81.1% in 2020 5 ) was the sixth lowest in the EU (EU average 83.7%). Here too, women perform better than men (83.5% vs 78.4% (EU average)). Between 2014 and 2019, 12.4% more students enrolled in higher education. The progress was stronger at Bachelor (+12.6%) and Master\u2019s levels (+16.5%) than at short-cycle tertiary level (+7.1%) and doctoral level (-3.0%) (Figure 4). French data show that more students enrolled again in 2020/2021 (+2.1%), as a result of higher success rates in the Baccalaureate (+ 7 pps) (DEPP, 2020), linked to the COVID-19 crisis (MESRI, 2020a). For 2021/2022, 34 000 new places will be funded in public higher education. Several measures were taken to address student poverty, ensure teaching continuity and give access to employment. Several measures introduced in 2020/2021 will be continued, including different financial support schemes for students (food aid, access to healthcare, exceptional scholarship top-ups); the extension of the student loan scheme (an NRRP measure); EUR 1 meals for students in precarious situations and scholarship students, as well as the freezing of enrolment and student accommodation fees.

Higher education institutions used their learning management systems platforms and support services for digital teaching methods to roll out further remote teaching. Digital resources have been pooled together at national level for the benefit of all HEI. The NRRP will finance additional projects for the development of online modules, nationwide platforms to offer these modules and digital infrastructure (EUR 35 million). Support for employers to recruit apprentices will also be continued until 30 June 2022. Dual learning in higher education has considerably increased in the past year. Figure 4 - Students enrolled in tertiary education by ISCED level, 2014-2019 Source : UOE, educ_uoe_enrt02. Universities are relatively less well funded per student than other higher education institutions. In 2019, France spent around EUR 10 110 per year on a student at university compared to the average annual spending of EUR 11 530 for a higher education student (EESRI, 2021). The National Consultative Commission for Human Rights believes that the chronic underfinancing of universities should stop. It recommends strengthening public student guidance services, especially for disadvantaged students, and mentoring and tutoring schemes. In higher education, places on highly popular programmes and related resources should be increased, taking employment opportunities into account (CNCDH, 2021). Adults whose parents have completed tertiary education are 13.6 times (Programme for the International Assessment of Adult Competencies (PIAAC) average 11.1) more likely to complete tertiary education than those whose parents have not completed tertiary education (OECD, 2018). Policies are being developed to integrate environmental sustainability into higher education. The Research Programming Law 2021-2030 (LPR) has included awareness of ecology and sustainable development in the missions of HEI ( L\u00e9gifrance , 2020). A 2020 interim report (MESRI, 2020b) recommended integrating the green transition into all higher education programmes, training all students on transition issues, and developing training programmes for higher and compulsory education staff. A working group was then mandated to develop further by September 2021 the recommendations on how to support and facilitate the implementation of these training and awareness actions within HEI (MESRI, 2021a). The NRRP will also finance energy-saving renovations of 1 054 higher education, research and student housing buildings (EUR 1.3 billion). 8.

        "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 15 Education and Training Monitor 2021 \u2013 Executive summary December 2021 Executive Summary Well-being in the context of disruption The COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted education and training in an unprecedented way, but this disruption has also presented opportunities for innovation. The pandemic has brought about major challenges to teaching and learning, but countries across Europe were able to rapidly mobilise resources. Teachers, school leaders, families, students and schools have showed determination, adaptability, resilience and creativity to ensure the continued provision of education. The crisis has accelerated change and has provided massive insights into how digital technology and innovative teaching can help strengthen our education and training systems. On the other hand, the crisis has exposed and, in some cases, magnified existing weaknesses and inefficiencies, and not least inequalities. As schools and universities have gradually re-opened and restarted their operations, their major task has been to remedy interruptions to learning and to address the negative impacts on students\u2019 well-being. The debate about well-being in education predates the pandemic and well-being has attracted increasing attention of education policy makers in recent years. However, the pandemic has brought challenges to well-being to the fore. Well-being covers both mental and physical health and is closely connected to students\u2019 performance at school and in other aspects of their lives. Students\u2019 life satisfaction, the ability to develop decision-making skills and psychological coping mechanisms are crucial for lifelong learning and for individuals to lead meaningful lives. They lay the foundations for self-awareness, relationship building and forming resilience, enabling individuals to adjust and to overcome personal adversity, long-term life challenges and societal shocks. While the disruption to learning resulting from the pandemic is difficult to measure at this stage, data available from the Netherlands indicates substantial learning loss, which might soon turn to the one of the biggest challenges for education policy. A survey carried out among primary and secondary school pupils shows that their learning progress dropped in all year groups. However, while the children of highly skilled parents showed no significant disruption to their progress, the children of low-skilled parents made only about 85% of the progress expected for their year group. Most countries address well-being partially or implicitly in their education policies and practices . Competences related to mental health are generally incorporated in the curricula of specific subjects or as cross-cutting issues. The majority of Member States implement targeted programmes to tackle bullying and violence. A number of initiatives are focused on physical activity and healthy lifestyle, discrimination and racism, mental health, school climate and equal opportunities. Most of these, however, remain fragmented and few evaluations are available on their impact. A few Member States have taken steps towards a comprehensive approach on well-being in education. Approaches include concepts and policy objectives linked to well-being, monitoring mechanisms collecting data on the well-being of students and concrete requirements and guidance on the implementation of well-being policies at the institutional level. For instance, the well-being of pupils is regularly monitored through surveys in Denmark, Finland and Estonia. In Ireland, every school is required by 2023 to use a self-evaluation tool to promote well-being and they are supported in this process by a Well-being Practice Framework and online resources. In Spain, an observatory of school life disseminates good practices, monitors and provides guidance on how to improve school climate. Very timely, the dedicated working group on well-being launched under the European Education Area (EEA) framework will help shed light on new trends following the pandemic and support Member States in learning from each other in a policy area, which is relatively new for most countries. ",
        "16 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY Education and Training Monitor 2021 \u2013 Executive summary December 2021 Surveys show that the pandemic has led to feelings of isolation, anxiety and depression among students of all ages. Data from nine EU Member States indicates that around a quarter of pupils felt \u201chelpless\u201d during remote classes and when completing homework. Experiences during the pandemic confirmed that education fulfils an essential societal role. Well-functioning, inclusive and supportive education systems are important for families and are key to support the well-being, including the mental health, of pupils and teachers. Already before the pandemic, nearly half of all students in the EU reported feelings of sadness, one third reported feelings of fear and almost 40% reported feeling miserable. Phenomena, such as bullying and a low sense of belonging in school, are strongly linked to academic performance. Students with a stronger sense of belonging in school are less often truant and show stronger academic performance. In many EU Member States, students who skipped a day of school in within the past two weeks had a lower score on the sense of belonging index. Positive relationships between teachers and pupils emphasising respect and empowering students can foster performance improvements, especially among high-risk youth groups. In as many as 19 EU Member States, over 50% of students report bullying at least a few times a year. Investment in education In recent years, public expenditure on education in EU Member States was fairly steady. However, variations between countries are considerable. In 2019, on average, the EU dedicated 4.7% of its GDP to education, accounting for around 10% of total public expenditure. Education spending varied from over 6% in Estonia, Belgium, Denmark and Sweden to 3.1% of GDP in Ireland. The largest share of public investment is directed to secondary education (38.7%), followed by pre-primary and primary education combined (33.4%) and tertiary education (16.2%). Public expenditure in education is predominantly allocated to teaching staff (64%), followed by intermediate consumption (14%), which consists of the purchase of goods and services needed to provide education services. The third-highest allocation was gross capital formation (7%), which comprises capital investments, for example on buildings, followed by social benefits (6%) and other current transfers (6%). Several Member States increased investment linked to the move to online and blended learning during the pandemic. Investments included digitalisation projects, as well as hiring additional teachers or the additional training of teachers, funding for counselling and assistance for students and bonuses for teachers. Some countries also compensate schools for the additional costs of preventative measures, for example buying protective equipment or additional disinfection products. The Recovery and Resilience Facility will, together with the European Structural and Investment Funds, increase the EU funds directed to education and training in an unprecedented way. The Recovery and Resilience Facility (RRF) is the centrepiece of NextGenerationEU, the European Union\u2019s instrument to support recovery from the coronavirus crisis. It makes up to \u20ac675 bn available \u2013 \u20ac312.5 bn in grants and \u20ac360 bn in loans. The RRF supports sustainable and growth-enhancing reforms and investments in Member States to help recovery and build institutional capacity, essential to reduce inequalities and divergences in the Union. Investments and reforms in education and training play an important role in national RRPs. To benefit from support under the Facility, Member States had to submit their Recovery and Resilience Plans (RRP), including a comprehensive set of reforms and investments to be implemented by 2026. While the adoption process is still ongoing, according to provisional calculations, education and skill-related reforms and investments are expected to make up about 13 % of total RRF expenditure. Investment and reforms cover all education levels and sectors. They aim to modernise education and have the potential to make a long-lasting impact. For instance, the RRF will support the move to a one-shift system in Croatia, the consolidation of the school network in Lithuania and a broad reform of school education in Slovakia. In almost all countries, it is expected to give a major boost to the digital transformation of education and enhance the digital skills and competences of the workforce \u2013 a prerequisite to boost growth and ",
        "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 17 Education and Training Monitor 2021 \u2013 Executive summary December 2021 the competitiveness of the economy. Measures to boost digital education include the adaptation of the school curricula, developing digital resources and content, teacher training on digital education and the modernisation of the training offering in VET institutions, among others. For instance, in Belgium, the Flemish Community has included in its plan the ambition to set up a knowledge and support centre for digital school education. Germany aims to support the digitalisation of education by investing in digital devices for teachers, learning materials and digital skills, as well as a single digital education platform. EU-level targets for European cooperation in education and training towards a European Education Area and beyond During the last decade, considerable steps have been taken to improve the participation of children in early childhood education and care (ECEC) throughout the EU. In the past 5 years, most countries have seen the participation of children between the age of 3 years and the mandatory schooling age in ECEC increase, with Ireland, Croatia, Cyprus, Luxembourg and Poland recording the fastest improvements. On average in the EU, ECEC participation (3+) stood at 92.8% in 2019. This is an increase of 1 percentage point compared to the preceding five years. In 2019, five Member States (Belgium, Denmark, Ireland, Spain and France) reached the target level and Sweden came very close to reaching 96% participation. Improving access to quality ECEC has been high on the agenda in most Member States during recent years. The Recovery and Resilience Facility may provide further impetus to investment in ECEC across the EU, with about half of Member States making use of it to expand ECEC capacities. Some Member States have set ambitious targets to increase participation under the RRF. For example, Croatia aims to raise the participation rate of the 3+ age group from 76.3% to 90% by 2026. Czechia plans to increase the number of childcare facilities by 40% by the end of 2025. 90 000 places will be created in Germany and 60 000 in Spain (for children aged 0-2). Investments are also accompanied by reforms in a number of countries. For instance, the compulsory pre-school age is being lowered in Bulgaria and Cyprus (to four years), Belgium and Slovakia (to five years). Croatia and Slovakia are reviewing the financing model of ECEC. Portugal is reducing participation fees. Greece plans to improve early diagnosis and support for children with disabilities and special needs. Slovakia aims to review the recruitment system and support the professionalisation of ECEC staff. A legal entitlement to ECEC will be introduced in Croatia and Slovakia. Romania envisages the further development of an integrated ECEC framework and a large-scale teacher training programme. Denmark is working towards improving quality by introducing minimum standards and increasing staffing. Estonia is defining learning outcomes and learning support needs. The share of early leavers from education and training decreased steadily over the past decade, but the pandemic risks reversing this positive trend. In 2020, the rate stood at 9.9% on average across the EU \u2013 which while below the old target of less than 10%, is now 0.9 percentage points above the new and more ambitious target of below 9%. However, progress of close to 4 percentage points over the past 10 years masks pronounced differences between and within countries. Therefore, sustained efforts are required. At the EU level, the average share of early leavers from education and training is 3.8 percentage points higher among young men (11.8%) than it is among young women (8.0%). There are striking disadvantages for foreign-born young people and regional discrepancies are wide in many Member States. There are also considerable differences between countries, with more than 15% of the young population leaving school early in Spain and Romania. On the other end of the spectrum, in 18 Member States the share of early leavers from education and training is less than 9%, with Croatia having the smallest proportion (2.2%). Some Member States renewed their efforts to prevent early school leaving in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. For example, in France compulsory education and training was extended from 16 to 18 years and supported by different measures to mitigate the negative ",
        "18 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY Education and Training Monitor 2021 \u2013 Executive summary December 2021 implications of school closures. In Ireland, further support was allocated to schools catering for students experiencing the highest levels of educational disadvantage to reduce class size and to extend the school completion programme to more schools. The attainment rates in tertiary education have been increasing steadily over the past decade, but there is still considerable variation between countries and sub-groups within countries. In 2020, the tertiary educational attainment rate stood at 40.5% in the EU, with eleven countries already reaching the target set for 2030. The difference between countries is pronounced, spanning from 24.9% in Romania to 60.6% in Luxembourg. The average share of 25\u201334-year-olds with tertiary educational attainment is 10.8 percentage points higher among women (46%) than it is among men (35.2%). Moreover, there is a clear urban-rural divide, with the average rate in cities (50.9%) being substantially higher than it is in rural areas (28.9%). To increase tertiary educational attainment, several countries aim to enhance the access of disadvantaged students to higher education. For example, in Romania some dedicated places are reserved for Roma and 40% of newly created or modernised places in student accommodation will be allocated to disadvantaged students with support from the RRF. Portugal is planning to create an additional 15 000 places in student accommodation by 2025 with support from the RRF. In France, 30 000 new places in study programmes will be created and 100 000 students could benefit from state-guaranteed student loans. Slovakia is launching a new scholarship programme for students, in particular for those from disadvantaged backgrounds. More than half of the countries will use the RRF to support transformation in higher education. Actions will include the modernisation of study programmes expanding study places, launching new study courses, among which micro-credentials, the review of the funding model, the development of quality assurance and governance mechanisms, developing graduate tracking mechanisms and supporting the internationalisation of higher education. For example, with support from the RRF Latvia is implementing a comprehensive higher education reform, which envisages complex structural changes across three pillars: governance, funding, and human resources. Portugal will foster careers in science, technology, engineering, the arts and mathematics (STEAM), while Finland will support a programme to attract and retain national and foreign talent. The basic skills proficiency of the younger generation has not improved during the past decade. This is not only a worrying social issue, but also has a braking effect on the EU\u2019s future economic competitiveness and resilience. Unfortunately, the EU has not met its target to reduce underachievement in basic skills to less than 15% and little progress has been made over the past 10 years. The underachievement rate stood at 2 2.5 % in reading, 22. 9 % in mathematics and 2 2.3 % in science, the last time the PISA test was conducted (2018). Despite progress in some countries throughout the period 2009-2018, performance in science and reading deteriorated at the EU level, while it remained stable in mathematics. PISA results suggest that countries tend to obtain similar results across the three domains. Countries such as Estonia, Finland, Ireland and Poland have low underachievement rates in all three domains. By contrast, in Bulgaria, Romania, Cyprus and Malta, more than one in five pupils underachieve across all three domains, significantly reducing their future opportunities in professional and private life. Some Member States launched targeted programmes to compensate for the interruption to learning, but considerable further efforts are likely to be needed in most countries. In the Netherlands, \u20ac282 m was made available in 2020 for schools to assist students to reduce the negative impact on their education due to the pandemic. In Ireland, a COVID Learning and Support Scheme (CLASS) has been put in place for the 2021-2022 school year to help schools mitigate the adverse impacts of the pandemic on the interruption of students\u2019 learning and negative effects on their well-being. In Slovakia, additional tutoring was provided to pupils in need and further measures are planned under the Recovery and Resilience Facility (RRF). In Romania, REACT-EU will support additional remedial measures. Despite compensatory measures taken by Member States, inequalities are likely to increase following the pandemic. It is, therefore, important that Member States reinforce their efforts to promote inclusion and to enhance access to quality education for all. France continues its ",
        "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 19 Education and Training Monitor 2021 \u2013 Executive summary December 2021 reform aiming to improve the basic skills of disadvantaged pupils by reducing class size. In Malta, between 2021 and 2024 about 1 000 underachieving pupils aged 6 will join the 20 week Reading Recovery Programme. Ireland is piloting a School Inclusion Model to fully comply with the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities regarding participation in mainstream education. In Ireland, the 2021 supplementary programme provided for additional hours of in- home support for children with special educational needs and to those at risk of educational disadvantage during periods of school closures and reopenings. At tertiary level, socioeconomic inequalities were addressed by: doubling the Student Assistance Fund, providing funding to support Traveller students\u2019 access to universities, a laptop loan scheme and funding for HEI (Higher Education Institution) access services. Digital skills are becoming crucial for all citizens to participate in an increasingly digital world. Over the past two years, the COVID-19 crisis has further emphasised the importance of both basic and advanced digital skills for sustaining our economies and societies. Digital skills became a prerequisite for participation in learning, working and socialising, thereby accelerating the digital transformation. With only partial data available on the digital skills of pupils and based on the International Computer and Information Literacy Study (ICILS), the share of underachievement in digital skills only approached the EU level target value in Denmark in 2018 (16.2%), while it reached a high of 50.6% in Luxembourg (in 2018). The data from 2018 suggest that a significant effort is necessary to reduce the share of underachievement in digital skills across all EU Member States for the EU-level target to be achieved by 2030. The Recovery and Resilience Facility will be a major source of funding for digital education, making up approximately one third of RRF spending on education and skills. Most countries will invest in the digital infrastructure and connectivity of schools, often with a focus on disadvantaged and rural schools. In Italy, 100 000 classrooms will be transformed into flexible and connected learning environments. Slovakia aims to increase the share of schools with highly equipped and connected classrooms from 30% to at least 90%. A number of Member States will equip learners and teachers with digital devices to reduce the digital divide. For instance, in Austria 80 000 pupils per year will receive digital equipment funded under the RRF. A broad range of measures will aim to improve the digital competences of pupils through the adaptation of the school curricula, developing digital resources and content, teacher training, as well as modernising the training offer in VET institutions. In Belgium, the Flemish Community is setting up a knowledge and support centre for digital school education. In higher education, significant investments are planned for the development of digital infrastructure and digital teaching resources, the adaptation of study courses and digital training for academic staff. Funding will also be devoted to the development of digital skills of the adult population in the majority of Member States. For example, in Latvia, all employees that were placed on short-time work schemes between January and March 2021 may have access to e-learning courses to improve digital skills, using vouchers worth up to \u20ac500. The COVID-19 pandemic has interrupted already-slow progress in adult learning across the EU . Member States have agreed on an EU-level target of at least 47% adult learning by 2025 and 60% by 2030. Both targets apply the improved measurement of adult learning to be applied in 2022. Many Member States are taking action to increase the share of adults participating in learning and most have envisaged to use RRF for upskilling and reskilling measures. In particular, several countries are planning to introduce or develop measures to provide direct financial support to individuals for learning purposes to be complemented by non-financial measures enabling adults to engage in learning. For instance, in the Netherlands, a public individual learning and development account ( STAP \u2013 Stimulans Arbeidsmarktpositie ), will enter into force as of 1 January 2022. Anyone with a link to the Dutch labour market will be able to receive a subsidy up to \u20ac1 000 to cover their training costs for personal development and employability. ",
