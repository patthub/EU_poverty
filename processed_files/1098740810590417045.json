        "The European Foresight Monitoring Network November 2009 Collection of EFMN Briefs Part 2 C A S E S T U D I E S EU 23095 EN The \u2018EFMN briefs\u2019 is part of a series of publications produced by the European Foresight Monitoring Network (EFMN project, 2004-2008). EFMN is an initiative inspired and fi nanced by the European Commission in the framework of the Foresight Knowledge Sharing Platform implemented under the Research Framework Programme (FP7). The EFMN approach is based on the continuous process of monitoring and collecting data on foresight exercises conducted not only in Europe, but in other regions of the world as well. This information is collected using experts within the international foresight community. One of the tasks of the network is the production of Foresight briefs. These are short descriptions of interesting, recent, or ongoing foresight exercises and forward looking studies. The present publication is Part 2 of the collection of EFMN briefs and presents the last 40 briefs written in 2008. The fi rst 120 briefs were published in April 2008 and met a large success (EUR 23095 EN). Both publications are a very useful information and dissemination tool addressed not only to the Foresight community but also to policy-makers.

        "6 Foreword The European Foresight Monitoring Network Mapping Report is going from strength to strength and, if this reflects the vitality of the foresight field itself, it is a very good sign. More foresight exercises are being mapped, with around 1 000 mapped in detail. The descriptive data are now being used to support a range of quanti- tative analyses, which are beginning to go beyond simple counts and bar charts of what topics are being addressed, where, and for whom. The \u201cforesight ark\u201d is a striking visual representation of the application of such analytic methods. Hopefully, we will be develop- ing tools that will let us examine the contours of foresight work, and how they are changing, in evidence-based ways, from a variety of perspectives. Of course this sort of work is academically interesting, but it should also be of value for foresight practitioners, pointing to what has and has not been attempted in the field: redundancy can be avoided, and fruitful avenues for further exploration suggested; benchmarks and guides to good practice may be established. Such broad- brush data cannot substitute for in-depth accounts of the lessons that can be drawn from designing and implementing foresight exercises: the approaches should yield complementary insights. What is particularly encouraging about the present moment is that we are simultaneously seeing the major steps in foresight map- ping that this report embodies \u2013 and the move away from self-promoting accounts of how one or other expert conducted foresight, towards better-explicated \u201cwarts and all\u201d accounts of actual cases of foresight practice. The cases mapped in this report show that foresight is very much an international activity, with Africa remain- ing somewhat underrepresented here. In part this may be because \u201cForesight\u201d is frequently understood as Technology Foresight, and Africa\u2019s roles in technologi- cal innovation remain rather limited (and perhaps in some respects invisible). In part, we may see Africa included in some international organisation activities (and even in some national exercises in industrialised countries \u2013 there was strong and valuable participation of African teams in the UK Foresight Programme exer- cise on Detection and Identification of Infectious Diseases, for example). Possibly the technological con- notations of \u201cForesight\u201d mean that work in some particular topics, where there are strong communities of forecasters, modellers, even scenario-builders, is underrepresented \u2013 the examples of skill and employ- ment analyses, and of environmental and climate research, come to mind. We are likely to have under rep- resented foresight exercises undertaken by enterprises, too \u2013 much of this is likely to remain controversial, or \u201cunder the radar\u201d. EFMN continues to seek to bridge these gaps, and the foresight community in general needs to be aware of the scope for fostering improved linkages across these varied activities. This report is being published at a time when the world economy is suffering major turbulence, and new chal- lenges are being thrown at the foresight field. Foresight exercises that were not designed to address economic and financial trends explicitly have been criticised for failing to stress the potential for such developments to be disruptive to their topics \u2013 which is a fair enough criticism. However, a more serious charge has to be laid against economic policy-makers and modellers, who failed to apply real foresight and to question \u201cbusiness-as-usual\u201d assumptions. We now know that many commentators were apprehensive about cycles of credit and debt, but these concerns were not built into mainstream analysis. The foresight world could and probably should have done more to challenge such complacency. We can only speculate that participants in exercises were unwilling to burden their reports with warnings that could have led to the whole report being dismissed as clearly the work of people who did not respect the boundaries of their own expertise. The solution is more, rather than less, foresight \u2013 foresight that accepts the interrelated nature of socio-economic and socio-technical systems, rather than treating them as somehow compartmentalised. The other necessary response is for foresight to be employed to help identify and examine alternative and desirable ways of moving beyond the current impasse. Exploring the emerging opportunities that can create new markets and/or help meet critical social and envi- ronmental needs, creating visions of plausible solutions to emerging challenges, helping to bridge professional, disciplinary, and cultural boundaries: these are vital roles. Keeping an eye on the longer term is no luxury; EFMN_Mapping_091223.indd 6 EFMN_Mapping_091223.indd 6 22/10/07 11:28 22/10/07 11:28 ",
        "7 Mapping Foresight Foreword history tells us that crises like the present one can easily spiral downward into international and intercom- munal violence when seductive short-term \u201cfixes\u201d are the focus of political debate. Foresight can provide platforms for the creation of aspirations for a better future, and for debating how cooperation, knowledge creation, and broader participation may be brought into play to realise these aspirations. This is liable to mean a whole new generation of foresight exercises \u2013 a very ambitious vision. But one bit of good news is that practitioners will be able to draw upon various resources accumulated in recent years, to demonstrate the scope for applying foresight and the tools and prac- tices that have been employed successfully in recent exercises. The mapping work of EFMN will certainly be one of the main resources that will be used. Ian Miles EFMN_Mapping_091223.indd 7 EFMN_Mapping_091223.indd 7 22/10/07 11:28 22/10/07 11:28 ",
        "8 Preface This is the final deliverable of the \u201cMapping Foresight\u201d work package of the European Foresight Monitoring Network (EFMN) \u2013 a Europe-wide network inspired and financed by the European Commission within the framework of the Foresight Knowledge Sharing Plat- form implemented under the Research Framework Programme (FP7). This report is the result of the first large international effort aimed at understanding the nature of foresight practices in Europe and other world regions, including Latin America, North America, Asia and Oceania. The large number of foresight exercises mapped between 2004 and 2008 (over 2 000 initiatives) is clear evidence of the rising of the \u201cforesight wave\u201d. This is mainly because foresight has become more than just a tool to support policy or strategy development in Science, Technology, and Innovation (STI). Our results show that the scope of foresight, as prac- tised in the early years of the twenty-first century, involves a wider range of objectives, including: analysis of the future potential of STI, promoting network build- ing, priority setting for STI, supporting methodology and capacity building, and generating shared visions towards, for example, a strong European Research Area. The report shows that \u201cmulti-scope foresight\u201d is not a Euro- pean phenomenon but a global one. It also shows that foresight practice is not a matter of fashion but instead a systematic effort to promote effective processes to proactively think about the future. These processes can be applied to a variety of research areas or knowledge domains. The wide range of domains where foresight can usefully be applied extends across the natural sciences (e.g. biological science or chemical science), engineering and technology (e.g. environmental engi- neering or communications technologies), medical sciences (e.g. public health and health services), agricul- tural sciences (e.g. crop and pasture production), social sciences (e.g. policy and political science), and the humanities (e.g. language and culture). One of the most challenging parts of the mapping activ- ity was the implementation of procedures to ensure that mapped exercises comply with the definition of foresight as a process which combines three fundamental elements: prospective (long-term or forward-looking) approaches, planning (including policy-making and pri- ority-setting) approaches, and participative approaches (engaging stakeholders and knowledge sources). We recognise that we have not been able to fully implement such a \u201cfilter\u201d. This is mainly because, due to the inclu- sive nature of our international effort, we had to be more flexible; we allowed the EFMN Correspondents to map what they considered were the most relevant fore- sight exercises in their countries. Nevertheless, most analyses are based on the \u201cfully-mapped\u201d exercises (some 1 000 cases) and these quite often meet our working definition. The amount of data collected made the writing of this report more difficult than anticipated. There were so many interesting findings to include, but space limitations constrained the discussions. The limited time available also forced us to leave out of the analysis some interest- ing but more complex findings. Annex 5 of this volume is a good example of such a finding. The image, which resembles a boat, shows a fascinating result of the use of network visualisation tools to interconnect 871 \u201cfully- mapped\u201d exercises. To use a metaphor, the image could well be described as a \u201cforesight ark\u201d revealing how Europe and other world regions navigate into the future. In fact, to be more precise, it shows the \u201cbig picture\u201d of the type of futures research captured by the mapping activity. The nodes represent the socio-economic sectors used in the EU\u2019s NACE taxonomy, while the links repre- sent the interconnections that the mapped exercises have with these sectors. Although this and other findings are not explained in this report, the selected chapters provide a good account of the most important results. There were many \u201cfavourable winds\u201d helping us to nav- igate the seas where we could collect foresight exercises. First of all, we should acknowledge the active engage- ment and commitment of all members of the EFMN Mapping Team as well as the technical support of the TNO (Netherlands), which played a pivotal role in the way the data was captured and hosted. We should also thank EFMN Correspondents and many other colleagues for the mapping of exercises worldwide. Two specific factors facilitated our work. The first was the possibility to use the results of a previous EU-funded EFMN_Mapping_091223.indd 8 EFMN_Mapping_091223.indd 8 22/10/07 11:28 22/10/07 11:28 ",
        "9 Mapping Foresight Preface pilot project, EUROFORE, which was explicitly aimed at mapping foresight competences and experiences in 15 European countries. This pilot built and tested a number of mapping indicators that were later bor- rowed and further developed by the EFMN. The second factor was the possibility to access the results of another EU-funded project, SELF-RULE, which built a sister database in Spanish to map foresight practices in Latin America. These two projects have played a key role in increasing the volume and geographical reach of the EFMN mapping. The report has been organised in such a way as to high- light several different perspectives of analysis. After the introductory chapter, the objectives perspective is pre- sented in Chapter 2, where the analysis of a number of specific objectives helps us define a broader set of gen- eral objectives. Here we analysed qualitative data and the created families of more general objectives. These are based on the analysis of around 200 specific objectives from a sample of 50 exercises. The chapter includes adapted fragments of a paper titled \u201cFTA for Research and Innovation Policy and Strategy\u201d where the authors considered a slight reclassification of our findings. The geographical perspective is included in Chapter 3. This basically updates and reclassifies selected EFMN results presented in a paper titled \u201cComparing foresight \u2018style\u2019 in six world regions\u201d. This chapter required the inte- gration of the abovementioned databases and the mapping of more than 1 000 cases. Most of the cases were from Europe but we also tried to achieve a reason- able number of cases from Latin America, North America, Asia, Oceania and international organisations. This is followed by Chapter 4 which includes the coun- try perspective. This is a completely new analysis (not included in previous reports) presenting key features of foresight practices in ten European countries: nine EU member states (Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Spain and the United Kingdom) and one associate country (Norway). We selected these countries because they have the largest number of cases in the database (ranging from 17 cases in Belgium and Italy to 144 and 181 in the UK and the Netherlands respectively). We then continue with the methodological perspec- tive in Chapter 5. The results here are again based on selected EFMN findings published in a paper titled \u201cHow are foresight methods selected?\u201d. The discussion here could have been longer but we preferred to leave more space for other chapters. The methodological perspec- tive played a stronger role in previous reports and was the main subject of the aforementioned academic publication. Next is the knowledge domain or content perspective. The analyses here are based upon the characterisation of exercises by the OECD classification for research areas (Frascati Manual) and the EU standard for socio-eco- nomic sectors (NACE). Here is where we regret the space and time limitations. The discussions about the so-called \u201cknowledge hubs\u201d, \u201cknowledge junction\u201d and \u201cknowl- edge clusters\u201d in foresight have raised several questions that will have to be addressed in future publications. Nevertheless the chapter still captures the most relevant findings of the content perspective. Finally, a brief look at the recommendations perspec- tive is presented in Chapter 6. This includes minor updates of an analysis prepared for the 2007 Mapping Report. Here 559 recommendations produced by 83 foresight panels and task forces are analysed. The chapter assesses the extent to which panels of foresight exercises conducted at different levels (national, subna- tional, and supranational) are suggesting particular types of recommendations. To conduct this analysis, we devel- oped a taxonomy of recommendations. The chapter includes a discussion about the challenges of making recommendations at the EU level and presents some practical examples. The present publication is meant to be used by the fore- sight community and policy-makers. By revealing how Europe and other world regions navigate into the future, the report fulfils two main objectives: first, to increase the foresight knowledge base and, second, to raise the level of discussions. The second objective is met by pro- moting a more structured debate around the different perspectives that are adopted in each chapter.

        "10 Who should read this report? What does this report deliver? This report is the result of a major four-year project to assemble useful information about foresight exercises worldwide. It examines the aims and characteristics of more than 1 000 and identifies more than 2 000 exercises. To describe these aims and characteristics in a meaning- ful way, the work undertaken by the University of Manchester and the TNO \u2013 with information collected from more than 250 Correspondents from the EC-funded EFMN and SELF-RULE networks \u2013 has required the devel- opment of a new conceptual framework that will both help policy-makers, foresight practitioners and foresight users, and advance foresight mapping methodologies. The project team has carefully considered and deter- mined how a foresight exercise should be described. The members have also provided a detailed description and typology of the patterns of use and the distribution and frequency of use of foresight methods in different indus- tries, by subjects, challenges and sponsorship. Much of the information and how it is structured will appeal to bibliometric and scientometric specialists, but it is accessible to managers, consultants and policy advisers including those who have no prior experience of foresight. But the document is more than a project report and the project has delivered more than was originally anticipated. There is now a reference handbook which shows different types and styles of exercises, propen- sities to conduct foresight exercises, and a list of subject areas and exercise titles. The last of these makes the content of exercises more easily accessible worldwide. The value of the information in this reference docu- ment depends on the professional interests and responsibilities of the reader: \u2022 Policy-makers may appreciate the geographical or spatial analysis, so as to decide if a new style of exercise should be encouraged in a particular region or policy area. \u2022 Organisations planning a new exercise may appreci- ate the information about different types of exercise, so as to choose more intelligently for a specific topic area and more easily decide which designers and organisers of previous exercises they should contact. \u2022 Sponsors or potential users of foresight results can scan the document to see where previous or related work has been done and learn how that work may be adapted by using different methods. \u2022 Researchers and practitioners interested in the evo- lution of foresight exercises can now more easily recognise where, how, when and, to some extent, why a particular approach has been used. If desired, they can begin to put this into an economic, cul- tural or political context. \u2022 R&D, innovation and technology managers can consider how foresight might contribute to the analysis of trends and patterns of investment in their industry or domain. \u2022 Local, regional, national and international and supranational perspectives can be supported. From all these perspectives new insights can be found and foresight capabilities enhanced. The state of the art in foresight methodology, planning and application is advanced. Beyond the project report and the reference handbook, this document inspires the further development and implementation of foresight through user-friendly visual- isation and participant engagement systems. It provides a picture (via social network analysis) of the role of fore- sight in a globally connected world of knowledge, experience, information and uncertainty.

        "11 Mapping Foresight About this report Without a method of communication for emergencies, such as radio, poor quality navigation can be danger- ous. But reasons to travel may nevertheless exist. This book not only provides a compass and a map for fore- sight, neither of which previously existed; it shows how future maps can be produced more easily, including by users. It also shows how the world that is being mapped is already changing. At the same time it suggests how an Internet-based (i.e. wiki rather than radio) network can be established and how it can be tuned to the spe- cific needs of foresight advisers and foresight users. The range and scope of purposes to which foresight can be applied is impressive and powerful, as is illus- trated by this document. Purposeful connectivity across regions and disciplines can now more easily be facili- tated and nurtured.

        "12 Executive summary An important role for the European Foresight Monitor- ing Network (EFMN) has been the identification and mapping of foresight-type studies as a continuous activity. Then, on an annual basis, the data gathered from this mapping process has been analysed and pre- sented in a stand-alone report \u2013 this Mapping Foresight (MF) report is the final deliverable following three pre- vious reports produced in 2005, 2006 and 2007. Since its inception in 2004, the EFMN has identified and mapped more than 2000 foresight-type exercises. Identification of suitable exercises relies upon a net- work of 232 Correspondents (see Annex 3) from around the world. Identified exercises are mapped into a database \u2013 known as Dynamo \u2013 against a set of var- iables, including the geographical and domain coverage of the exercise, its sponsor and target audiences, the time horizon adopted, the methods used, and the out- puts generated. The purpose of collecting such data is, essentially, two-fold. First, it enables policy-makers, foresight practitioners and others with an interest in foresight to easily identify exercises according to their particular areas of interest. So, for example, if a policy-maker is interested in identifying foresight-type exercises that have addressed the topic of \u2018energy\u2019, a web-based search interface allows him/her to identify the appro- priate exercises, to read about them in more detail, and to download reports produced by the exercises. Such information should, in the medium term, improve understanding of foresight processes and products, and hopefully lead to better foresight practice in the longer term. The second purpose for collecting such data is to ena- ble the EFMN to monitor developments in the foresight field more generally and to map these on an annual basis. Not all exercises entered into the database are fully characterised, due to the time required for collecting such data. During the life of the project more than 1000 exercises have been sufficiently mapped to be included in the analysis reported here. This has improved the already significant figures of 846 exercises achieved in last year\u2019s Global Foresight Outlook report and has allowed the EFMN to conduct a more sophisticated anal- ysis. In particular, the larger dataset provides the basis for a great deal of cross-tabulation, which allows the EFMN to begin to investigate the dependencies between different variables. For example, it is now possible to interrogate the data to begin to answer questions such as \u201cTo what extent does the geographical perspective influence the time horizon adopted?\u201d and \u201cDo foresight exercises in some countries focus more on some topics than in other countries\u201d. The Mapping Foresight report begins with a general introduction of the EFMN and the mapping activity. This is followed by a short description of the evolution of the mapping and the different levels in which exer- cises have been characterised in the database. These levels required the development of the \u2018mapping dimensions\u2019 (i.e. the above-mentioned set of variables). In Chapter 1 definitions are provided for each of these dimensions. The introductory remarks end with a few comments about data potential and limitation, and a short summary of the mapping process. The examination of foresight objectives required the selection of 50 exercises and the grouping of their spe- cific objectives (around 200 in total) into much broader objectives. The results show that among the most com- mon foresight objectives we can find: fostering cooperation and networking; orienting policy develop- ment; recognising barriers and drivers of STI; encouraging futures thinking; supporting STI strategy and priority-setting; identifying research and invest- ment areas; generating shared visions; handling Grand Challenges; and triggering actions and discussions. Chapter 2 expands each of these categories to discuss more specific objectives related to the general ones. Moving into the geographical perspective, this chap- ter compares foresight practices in Europe (713 cases), Latin America (120 cases), North America (109 cases), Asia (89 cases) and Oceania (15 cases). A sixth category was added to include international exercises (67 cases) sponsored or carried out by international agencies such as OECD, FAO, UNESCO, UNIDO and the World Bank. Nine dimensions were used in the comparisons, includ- ing types of sponsorship, types of audience, the time horizon, the scale of participation, territorial scale, methods used, types of outputs, the most common EFMN_Mapping_091223.indd 12 EFMN_Mapping_091223.indd 12 22/10/07 11:28 22/10/07 11:28 ",
        "13 Mapping Foresight Executive summary research areas and the most commonly targeted socio- economic sectors. Staying with the geographical perspective, the results for the type of sponsorship show that the government is the main sponsor of foresight in all regions, although we can see a few differences. For example, the North American figures reflect the high number of industrial- sector studies in our sample, many of which are funded by the business sector. Indeed, the business sector is a far more prominent sponsor in this region than in any other, perhaps reflecting an Anglo-Saxon laissez-faire tradition, as a similar pattern is seen in the sponsorship data for Oceania, as reported elsewhere. In terms of target audiences, there are no great varia- tions, and government agencies and departments are the main target groups, regardless of the region. One remarkable result is the range of research and business targets \u2013 far more than there are sponsors. As for the time horizon, most exercises are looking 10 to 20 years ahead. The results also show that Europe, North America, Asia and Oceania have a more strate- gic attitude towards the far future (e.g. 30, 50, 100 years ahead) than Latin America. The participation dimension shows that between 75-85 % of mapped exercises in Europe, Latin Amer- ica and North America involved fewer than 200 participants. Among these regions, Latin America shows the highest level of participation \u2013 although it also has the lowest number of exercises with more than 500 participants. Asia has the largest proportion of exercises with more than 500 participants. This can be explained by the fact that virtually all foresight exer- cises mapped in this region are either national or international; exercises at this level usually involve higher numbers of participants. The analysis of the territorial scale shows that for all world regions, the national level is by far the most com- mon. As policy-making is still mostly carried out at this level, this result should come as little surprise. The remaining foresight initiatives are more or less equally distributed over the other territorial scales, although there are some significant differences between regions. The methodological choices of the regions show that some methods are very widely used across the world; such is the case with expert panels, literature review, scenarios and trend extrapolation. But the more inter- esting findings are those that can tell us more about differences in regional foresight practices. The first of these methods is (futures) workshops, which figure notably in Europe and North America, but are much less important in Asia and Oceania and are out of the top ten in Latin America. The second method of inter- est is the Delphi technique, which is most often used in Latin America, Asia and Europe, but is absent from the top ten in North America. Finally, it may be useful to look at the average number of methods used by each region: International (4), Europe (5), Latin Amer- ica (8), North America (4), Asia (4), and Oceania (3). The outputs analysis mainly focuses on those that are normally codified. This means that process-related out- puts such as new working practices or new networks were not included. The results, however, still show an interesting picture. For example, the most common outputs are: policy recommendations (evident in all regions); analysis of trends and drivers (frequently in Latin America, followed closely by the pan-European and international studies); scenarios (less frequently present in the North American and Asian studies mapped to date); research and other priorities (found relatively more frequently in Latin America and Oce- ania, closely followed by North America); forecasts (most popular in Asia); key technologies (the third most important output in Asia); and technology roadmaps (generated most frequently in North America). The research areas dimension shows an interesting result. Foresight exercises in North America and Oce- ania are often carried out with more defined target research areas than similar exercises in Europe, Latin America and Asia. The main reason for targeting mul- tiple research areas, for example, in international, European, Latin American and Asian foresight studies may be related to the diversity of sponsors in these regions. Finally, results show that the most common socio-economic sectors in Europe are: manufacturing; health and social work; electricity, water and gas sup- ply; public administration and defence; and transport, storage and communication.

        "14 citizen panels, relevance trees, multi-criteria and gaming. While the data suggests that this group of methods is rarely used, some figures are lower than might be expected and could possibly be attributed to biases aris- ing from the mapping. For example, methods such as structural analysis and relevance trees have been occa- sionally applied in Spain and France at the subnational level. But because mapping at this level has been weaker than at the national level, the data does not do justice to the likely higher frequency of their applications. The content perspective shows that there are very strong linkages between Engineering and Technology, Natural Sciences, and Social Sciences. These three research areas can be considered as the main \u2018knowl- edge hubs\u2019 of foresight work and these results simply confirm the interdisciplinary nature of foresight. An analysis of interconnections between areas shows that, while 58% of the Engineering and Technology studies are interconnected with areas of natural sci- ences, the proportion of Natural Sciences studies that are interconnected with areas of Engineering and Technology is considerably higher (79 %). The pattern is different when we look at the interconnections between Engineering and Technology areas and Social Sciences, as they both show similar interdependencies (32 % versus 35 %). By contrast, projects on Medical Sciences and Agricultural Sciences show high linkages with Engineering and Technology areas (56 % each), but only 20 % of Engineering and Technology projects are linked to areas in Medical Sciences and Agricultural Sciences. This interdisciplinary nature of foresight means that fore- sight exercises often behave as \u2018knowledge junction\u2019 between different research areas and sub-areas. This leads to a number of interesting results. For example, foresight exercises on Biological Science often synthe- size data from multiple sources thus creating a very interesting \u2018triangulation effect\u2019. In particular, we see two well defined triangles: the first suggests that fore- sight work in this sub-area is the strongest knowledge junction between Engineering and Technology and Nat- ural Sciences; while the second triangle shows that foresight studies on Biological Science provide a less strong but certainly important link between Social Sciences and Natural Sciences. Turning to the countries , this chapter shows key fea- tures of foresight practices in ten European countries: nine EU member states (Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Spain and the United Kingdom) and one associate country (Norway). We have selected these countries because they have the largest number of cases in the database. The descrip- tions of all the dimensions and their detailed results have been compressed into two pages per country. This section also involved the mapping of the most common sponsors in the selected countries, as well as the mapping of common objectives and their classifi- cation using the various groupings discussed in Chapter 2. For example, in Belgium, the government is clearly the main supporter of foresight followed by non-state actors. Sponsors include: the Belgium Fed- eral Office for Scientific, Technical and Cultural Affairs (BELSPO); the Royal Belgian Academy Council of Applied Sciences (BACAS); the Walloon Ministry of Economy; and the Flemish Institute for Science and Technology Assessment (viWTA), among other actors. Not so different is the typology of sponsors in France where the most common supporters of the mapped foresight exercises are DATAR; the French Ministry of Economy, Finance and Industry; the Ministry of Defence; and CESR-Centre, among others. However, in Germany, we found a wider pool of sponsors, with actors from national and regional government agencies, the research community and the private sector (e.g. the Federal Min- istry of Education and Research; the Bavarian State Ministry of Sciences, Research and the Arts; and the government of Rheinland-Pfalz; German Landkreis L\u00f6bau-Zittau; MFG Stiftung Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg; and companies like Janssen Cilag GmbH and Siemens AG). The results on methods clearly indicate three groups: First, the widely used methods are literature review, expert panels and scenarios, all of which are qualitative; second, the category of commonly used methods includes extrapolation/megatrends, futures workshops, brainstorming, other methods, interviews, Delphi, ques- tionnaire/survey, key technologies, scanning, essays and SWOT; and finally, the third group includes less frequently used methods, such as road-mapping, mod- elling and simulation, backcasting, stakeholders mapping, structural analysis, bibliometrics, morphological analysis, EFMN_Mapping_091223.indd 14 EFMN_Mapping_091223.indd 14 22/10/07 11:28 22/10/07 11:28 ",
        "15 Mapping Foresight Executive summary A second group of recommendations includes the incorporation of foresight findings into ongoing debates and strategies; suggested actions for the pri- vate sector and non-governmental organisations to pursue; and the need for further research. A third group includes the development of human resources; improvements in academia-industry links; increases in public spending; and greater cooperation across the innovation system, including international cooperation. Over the coming years, we expect to see further growth of the \u2018foresight wave\u2019. This basically means that the European Commission will increasingly need to advance knowledge and tools related to events and trends poten- tially shaping the future of science, technology and innovation in Europe. In this context, synergies between research projects like iKNOW (aimed to interconnect knowledge and communities to explore emerging issues, wild cards and weak signals) and the new Euro- pean Foresight Platform (EFP), which integrates the EFMN and ForLearn, will contribute to the Commission\u2019s goals of consolidating the information and knowledge base on foresight and as well supporting forward look- ing decision making. We are sure that the complexity of the issues that will be addressed in these projects, together with the complexity of their interconnections, would benefit from the type of analysis that has been carried out in this report, as well as from the next gen- eration of mapping activities in EFP (2009-2012). Another finding is the identification of two equally important sub-areas linking Engineering and Technol- ogy with Social Sciences; these are Environmental Engineering and Communications Technologies. Although these linkages may be obvious for some, their recognition as fundamental knowledge junction in the relationship between Engineering and Technology and Social Sciences is a significant result of this report. More findings like the above can be found in Chapter 6. Looking at the socio-economic sectors analysis, we can see that Engineering and Technology, Social Sciences, Manufacturing and Natural Sciences are by far the most popular subject areas to be covered in the initiatives mapped by the EFMN. The second group includes: Electricity, gas and water supply; Health and social work; Transport, storage and communication; Public administration and defence; Agriculture; Educa- tion; Fishing; Construction; and Other community, social and personal services activities. Less popular areas in foresight, but still significant, are: Financial intermediation; and Real estate, renting and business activities. This is an interesting result given that these two sectors have been seriously shaken by the so-called credit crunch (or credit crisis) linked to the sub-prime housing crisis in the United States, which has serious implications for Europe and other world regions. Therefore, we believe that foresight work in these areas will soon experience considerable growth. As a result, we can conclude that it is equally impor- tant to identify those areas where more foresight work may be needed. In other words, we should not only map those \u2018hot\u2019 areas where plenty of strategic think- ing and policy options can be found on the table \u2013 which was, indeed, our initial question. A more traditional analysis of socio-economic sectors required us to look at the proportion of foresight work carried out in each \u2018grand\u2019 economic sector (primary, secondary and tertiary). This generated a clear mes- sage: \u2018Foresight on Services\u2019 is really dominant! Finally, the analysis of recommendations shows the most common recommendations to be those which call for policy shifts and those that call for the creation of new projects, programmes, strategies or discussion fora.

        "18 Mapping more than 2 000 foresight exercises About the EFMN In 2004 the European Commission (EC) supported the creation of the European Foresight Monitoring Net- work (EFMN) \u2013 an international consortium of research organisations \u2013 with one general goal: To monitor ongoing and emerging foresight activities and disseminate relevant information to policy-makers and foresight practitioners In order to achieve this goal the EFMN had six specific objectives: \u2022 Network: To create a Correspondents\u2019 network of foresight practitioners and users. \u2022 Data collection : To collect foresight exercises and other related activities, as a \u201clibrary\u201d of infor- mation. \u2022 Mapping: To analyse key features and characteris- tics of the collected foresight exercises, and describe relevant issues about foresight practices in Europe and other regions of the world. \u2022 Briefs production: To produce \u201cbriefs\u201d on specific foresight studies, in order to inform a wider community. \u2022 Issue analysis: To analyse the collected foresight exercises in terms of emerging issues, and to organ- ise annual workshops addressing specific issues. \u2022 Dissemination: To disseminate the collected infor- mation and analyses through the Internet and annual reports. About the mapping The mapping has been lead by the PREST Manchester Institute of Innovation Research of the University of Man- chester (UK) and the TNO (Netherlands). In the four years the EFMN has been operational, more than 2 000 exer- cises have been collected using an electronic database to facilitate systematic structuring of information. The mapping of foresight exercises has been a major activity of the EFMN, mainly because it has effectively contributed towards the achievement of the network\u2019s goal and its more specific objectives. The mapping required the development of a database with indicators capable of capturing the different dimensions of an exercise (e.g. territorial scale, geographical coverage, sponsors, target audiences, time horizon, methods, out- puts, research areas, industries, etc.). The use of more or less \u2018measurable\u2019 indicators helped, on the one hand, to unlock information on what is going on in the world of foresight, and, on the other, enabled us to carry out different kinds of analyses to provide foresight practi- tioners and organisers with more detailed insight into methodological and practical issues. In this volume we update the most important results presented in our three previous reports (see Popper et al., 2005, 2007; Keenan et al., 2006). While some of the findings are based on recent academic papers pub- lished in Foresight (see Volume 10, Issue 6), we also include new analyses using 3D visualisation tools. Chapter 2 updates our previous results about common rationales and objectives in foresight. Chapter 3 updates our previous benchmarks of foresight practices in five world regions: Europe, Latin America, North America, Asia, and Oceania (see Keenan and Popper, 2008). Chapter 4 presents a new analysis of major features characterising foresight practices in ten European coun- tries: Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, Spain, and the UK. Chapter 5 includes a discussion about the attributes and features of the most popular foresight methods. These results are based on findings that one of the authors published in a paper with the title \u201c How are foresight methods selected? \u201d (Popper, 2008a). In Chapter 6 we use 3D visualisation tools to analyse results about the coverage (i.e. research areas and socio-economic sectors) of more than 800 fore- sight exercises. Finally, Chapter 7 updates our previous results about recommendations resulting from foresight. Evolution of the mapping The basic structure of the EFMN database (i.e. map- ping dimensions and indicators) is a significant elaboration of a previous EC-funded initiative called EUROFORE and aimed at mapping foresight compe- tence in Europe (see Keenan et al., 2003). This pilot EFMN_Mapping_091223.indd 18 EFMN_Mapping_091223.indd 18 22/10/07 11:29 22/10/07 11:29 ",
        "19 Mapping Foresight 1 | Introduction to the EFMN mapping process project mapped 100 studies which were later included in the EFMN database. Having agreed on the final set of mapping indicators, the TNO adapted its online platform (Dynamo) to be used by PREST/MIoIR, other partners and EFMN Correspondents, to capture information about foresight exercises. The mapping tool was operational in 2005 and, by the end of the year, the database had already more than 800 cases (100 from the EUROFORE initiative plus some additional 700 cases mapped by the EFMN). Here we should emphasise that, although a limited number of people are involved in the data analysis and the writing of reports, we could not have done this without the help of numerous experts who assisted in gathering initiatives. On average, three to four people per country were actively involved in the mapping activity. The mapping has also benefited from a sister EC initiative carried out in Spanish by the SELF-RULE network. These two mapping activities have built up databases of studies that offer tremendous opportu- nity to increase our understanding of foresight practices in Europe and the rest of the world. Figure 1.1 shows the evolution of the number of cases in the EFMN database; from more than 800 cases in 2005 to more than 2 000 cases in 2008. Of course, as in any database, some cases are better mapped that others, so the number of fully-mapped cases (levels 2 and 3, as explained below) was actually around 1 000. Levels of mapping Given that mapping has been an ongoing activity, the data has been collected gradually using four levels : \u2022 Level 0 (cases that are only nominated), \u2022 Level 1 (basic mapping), \u2022 Level 2 (detailed mapping), and \u2022 Level 3 (fully mapped). Level 0 is only the nomination of the exercise (i.e. pro- viding the name, a short description, a short comment, and the time horizon). Level 1 includes basic information, such as the year in which the exercise was created, the duration, contact person, name of the sponsor, amount of funding, exe- cuting organisation, website, number of participants, territorial scale and objectives. Level 2 moves into more detailed mapping (e.g. types of audiences, types of sponsors, types of methods, countries and regions involved and types of outputs). Level 3 provides mapping against a number of research areas (using the internationally accepted classification system based on the Frascati Manual ), industries (using the NACE Classification of Economic Activities), and the description of policy impacts, other impacts, as well as results and limitations. Figure 1.2 shows the data input structure. The data- base was divided into two screens, one on the left with text fields and single-choice drop-down boxes (mainly Figure 1.1: Evolution of the EFMN database Source: Popper \u2022 The EFMN mapping has produced a vast amount of information on foresight unprecedented in the world \u2022 The mapping has been useful to understand foresight practices in Europe and other regions of the world 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 437 L2 & L3 (Total > 800 cases) 1 000 L2 & L3 (Total > 2 000 cases) 767 L2 & L3 (Total > 1 400 cases) 846 L2 & L3 (Total > 1 600 cases) 100 cases EFMN_Mapping_091223.indd 19 EFMN_Mapping_091223.indd 19 22/10/07 11:29 22/10/07 11:29 ",

For example, if a project was linked with a wider national programme or a government strategy. \u2022 Time horizon \u2013 to state the time horizon of the exercise.

Thus, the positioning of mapping dimensions on either the left or right hand side has been deter- mined by whether textual information is needed (left side), and whether the dimension can have only one value (left side) or multiple values (right side). Data fields (mapping dimensions) Now let us look at the mapping dimensions: \u2022 Name of exercise (in own language and/or in Eng- lish). However, if a single panel or thematic area was mapped, the full name of the exercise was given first, followed by the name of the panel or thematic area.

        "21 Mapping Foresight 1 | Introduction to the EFMN mapping process This area was also used to describe the impacts it had had, if any, on the policies and strategies of oth- ers, such as firms, universities, NGOs, etc. \u2022 Other impacts \u2013 to map, besides influencing pol- icies and strategies, what other discernible impacts the exercise had had. Correspondents were asked to also include unexpected impacts here. \u2022 Benefits and limitations \u2013 to make an overall assessment of the benefits of the exercise. And what were its limitations? In other words, if such an exercise were to be repeated, what would be done differently? Dimensions on the right-hand side of the database are mainly those where multiple choice was possible. These dimensions have potentially multiple values, which is why tick boxes were provided. Given that some dimensions had several levels of drop-down boxes, Correspondents were encouraged to tick only the boxes at the lowest level at which they wished to map. Here we present short descriptions of these mul- tiple-choice dimensions: \u2022 Countries \u2013 to map which countries or continents the exercise covered. If an exercise was at EU level, this was also captured by the database. \u2022 Methods \u2013 to map the methods that had been used in the exercise. Here Correspondents were provided with a comprehensive list of techniques (including qualitative, quantitative and semi-quantitative meth- ods) from which they could make their choices. \u2022 Sponsor \u2013 to map the type(s) of organisation(s) providing formal financial and/or political support for the exercise. \u2022 Audience \u2013 to map the primary target audience of the exercise. In other words, which groups did the exercise explicitly set out to inform and influence? \u2022 Research \u2013 to map what S&T fields, as defined by the Frascati Manual, did the study explicitly address. Contributors were advised to map at least to the second level, otherwise the information was too general. \u2022 Number of participants \u2013 to map the estimated number of people that were been engaged in the exercise. This number often referred to (a) those individuals who were intimately tied to the conduct of the exercise, e.g. members of steering groups and expert panels, and (b) those individuals who might have been engaged more loosely, for exam- ple, as participants in a scenario workshop or as respondents to a Delphi questionnaire. \u2022 Period \u2013 to map how long did/will the exercise last. This estimate needed to reflect official statements or research contracts linked to the exercise. \u2022 Contact \u2013 to map the name, affiliation, and e-mail of somebody who was willing and able to provide further information on the exercise, if requested. \u2022 Executor \u2013 to map the name(s) of the organisation(s) responsible for the day-to-day management and organisation of the exercise. \u2022 Exercise web address \u2013 to map the website or home page of the exercise. \u2022 Funding (\u20ac) \u2013 to map the estimated cost of the exercise in euro. This figure often reflected the offi- cial budget of the exercise. If the activities of a panel or thematic area from within a wider study were mapped, an estimate of the costs of that panel or thematic area was given. \u2022 Territorial scale \u2013 to map the territorial scale of the exercise. Was it subnational, i.e. covering an organi- sation that lies below the level of a nation state, e.g. federal region, city region, etc.? Was it national, i.e. bounded by the national borders of a nation state? Was it supranational, i.e. EU-wide or covering at least two nation states? \u2022 Territory name \u2013 to capture the name of the ter- ritory being covered in the exercise. \u2022 Objectives \u2013 to map the stated overall objectives, based on official statements about the exercise. \u2022 Policy impacts \u2013 to map the discernible impacts the exercise had had on public policies and strategies.

        "22 times as the scope of monitoring and mapping has substantially expanded. Of more significance are three biases ( ibid . p.19). First, some countries and regions are much better covered than others. This is apparent when looking across regional data, with more than half the mapped exercises carried out in a number of European countries (i.e. Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Iceland, Ireland, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland and the United Kingdom). Latin America is also quite well-mapped on account of the efforts of one of this report\u2019s authors in the context of the SELF-RULE project (Popper and Villarroel, 2006). But also, within regions, there is some imbalance in coverage. Taking Europe as an example, the Netherlands \u2013 a mid-sized European country \u2013 would seem to be very active in foresight, while France and Germany \u2013 much larger countries \u2013 appear to have far fewer activities. The question here is whether the data collected simply reflects the amount of foresight activity in the region/ country and can therefore be considered as rep- resentative; or whether monitoring activities have been stronger in some regions/countries than in others, leading to biases in the data. It would seem to be a mix of the two: on the one hand, there is strong evidence that much French and German activity has been insufficiently mapped, while researchers at the Dutch organisation, TNO \u2013 a lead partner in the EFMN consortium \u2013 have ardently mapped activities in their home country; on the other hand, foresight practice is much more common in some countries, e.g. Finland, than in others, e.g. Italy, and the mapping data simply reflects this. Second, activities at the subnational level have been difficult to detect through monitoring for a variety of reasons (e.g. lack of international visibility, lan- guage barriers, etc.), which means they are very likely to be under-represented in the database. This is the case for North America and for certain parts of Europe and Asia. \u2022 Sectors \u2013 to map the socio-economic sectors, as defined in NACE, that the exercise explicitly addressed. Mapping at least at the first level was advised, though Correspondents were free to map at deeper levels if they preferred. \u2022 Outputs \u2013 to map the sorts of codified outputs produced by the foresight exercise. Contributors could select from the following: policy recommen- dations; analysis of trends and drivers; scenarios; roadmaps; research and other priorities; lists of key technologies; forecasts; and others. Data potential and limitation Between 2004 and 2008 we have managed to pro- duce a vast amount of information on foresight, unprecedented in the world. Talking to experts and foresight practitioners, assisted by Correspondents, looking at existing reports, browsing the Internet, all led to the collection of 2 211 initiatives: \u2022 890 cases are nominated (level 0), \u2022 208 cases are mapped at level 1, \u2022 750 cases are at level 2, and \u2022 363 cases are at level 3. The original EC target of 400 cases mapped in detail (levels 2 and 3) was achieved in 2005; the second tar- get of 800 was reached in 2007 and the last target of 1 000 cases has now been exceeded (see Figure 1.3 below).

For example, there is an S&T foresight bias in the EFMN database, reflecting the interests of the Directorate-General for Research of the European Commission \u2013 although this has lessened in recent EFMN_Mapping_091223.indd 22 EFMN_Mapping_091223.indd 22 22/10/07 11:29 22/10/07 11:29 ",
        "23 Mapping Foresight 1 | Introduction to the EFMN mapping process \u2022 Third , selected data were scanned and (if neces- sary) considered for quality control. This task involved sending automated emails with a direct link to the database so that national Correspond- ents could update and improve the quality of mapped cases. This approach had mixed results, meaning that some exercises are much better mapped than others. \u2022 Finally , the fourth task required data processing, analysis and experimentation. These analyses have been used to prepare annual mapping reports which have been openly shared with the foresight community. Third, some future-oriented activities have been mapped into the EFMN database as foresight exercises when, in fact, they fall some way short of meeting the necessary criteria for inclusion, particularly around participation levels, for example. These factors are likely to account for the observable patterns in this report. Summing up the mapping process To sum up, the EFMN mapping consisted of four major tasks: \u2022 First , foresight initiatives were identified by dedi- cated network partners who continuously searched the Internet, public reports, etc. In addition, national Correspondents were mobilised and invited to sug- gest studies on an annual basis. \u2022 Second , initiatives were entered into the EFMN database using a set of indicators to capture the different elements of a foresight process (such as methods, country, territorial scale, time horizon and type of sponsorship, among others).

        "26 Figure 2.1: Common foresight objectives Policy development Cooperation and networking STI strategy/priority-setting Shared visions Actions & public discussions Barriers and drivers of STI Research/investment areas Futures thinking Grand Challenges 0 25 50 75 100% Cooperation and networking One of the most common general objectives of fore- sight is to foster cooperation and networking in science, technology and innovation (STI). This implies: \u2022 the creation of a common space for open thinking; and \u2022 the engagement of key STI stakeholders at various levels (international, European, national, subnational). Policy development An important objective of foresight is to orient policy development. This often includes the provision of meth- odological support and advice on policy directions. Such orientation often requires the development of: \u2022 new perspectives into existing agenda-setting and prioritisation mechanisms; \u2022 new consensus-based frameworks to explore pol- icy options; and \u2022 new guidelines to assist government and other actors in policy design and decision-making processes. Barriers and drivers of STI Barriers often refer to issues inhibiting the development of a country or a particular sector for example. These barriers could be: \u2022 social (e.g. undeveloped collaborative culture, insuf- ficient human capabilities) The EFMN mapping of foresight objectives has been done with open-ended questions. Therefore the anal- ysis of results required the selection of 50 exercises and the grouping of their specific objectives (around 200 in total) into much broader objectives. These can be classified into nine groups (see figure 2.1): \u2022 fostering cooperation and networking \u2022 orienting policy development \u2022 recognising barriers and drivers of STI \u2022 encouraging futures thinking \u2022 supporting STI strategy/priority-setting \u2022 identifying research/investment areas \u2022 generating shared visions \u2022 handling Grand Challenges \u2022 triggering actions and discussions. We spell out what each of these categories means below. Typically, the mapped exercises had three to four spe- cific objectives, spread across two or three of the families above. However, the situation was different when we looked at large national foresight initiatives. For example, the Finnish FinnSight2015 exercise featured ten \u2018studies\u2019 \u2013 on (1) materials; (2) global econ- omy; (3) well-being and health; (4) environment and energy; (5) infrastructures and security; (6) bio- expertise and bio-society; (7) learning and learning society; (8) services and service innovations; (9) infor- mation and communications; and (10) understanding and human interaction \u2013 each having three or four spe- cific objectives. This means that FinnSight2015 as a whole targeted most, if not all, of the nine families of objectives listed above. The same applies to other large technology foresight programmes (TFP) such as the UK Foresight Pro- gramme, the German Futur Programme, the Hungarian TEP Programme, the Swedish TFP, the Colombian TFP and the Japanese TFP, among others.

        "27 Mapping Foresight 2 | Mapping foresight objectives developments in specific sectors (e.g. agriculture, envi- ronment, health, etc.) as well as the development of framework conditions in industrial production and pos- sibilities for commercialisation of goods and services capable of enhancing competitiveness in key sectors. In doing so, research and technology milestones are defined with the objective of achieving medium-to- long-term industry goals. However, the setting of STI priorities is not an easy objective. It requires the combination of many chal- lenging activities, for example: \u2022 analysis of qualitative and quantitative data about STI developments; \u2022 evaluation of existing RTD policies and innovation priorities; \u2022 identification of future technological needs, risks and opportunities; \u2022 identification of desirable and undesirable impacts of modern technologies (e.g. biotechnology); Here we would like to highlight that one of the most significant challenges of priority-setting in foresight exercises is to ask stakeholders to set their priorities on the basis of experts\u2019 assumptions about the future, instead of their existing views on current conditions and realities. Research/investment areas The identification of research and investment areas often involves: \u2022 identification of promising technologies, successful research and business models, and major infrastruc- ture requirements; \u2022 identification of promising markets and business directions; \u2022 translation of key STI barriers and driving forces into opportunities for both public and private industries; \u2022 adaptation of innovative industrial policies and strategies into the national and regional contexts; \u2022 exploration of impacts of potential changes in con- sumer demand, production capacity or market share, and so on. \u2022 technological (e.g. lack of infrastructures) \u2022 economic (e.g. limited funding) \u2022 environmental (e.g. climate change) \u2022 political (e.g. inappropriate regulation, lack of political engagement), or \u2022 ethical (e.g. unjust business models). In contrast, drivers are factors enabling the develop- ment of a country, organisation, sector, etc. Drivers are also classified into STEEPV categories for example. Futures thinking Foresight is also about futures thinking. This often includes: \u2022 the assessment of existing medium-to-long-term visions; \u2022 the assessment of desired, possible and alternative scenarios; \u2022 the identification of future applications and/or implications of new technologies; \u2022 the exploration of future development trends in sectors (e.g. energy) and sub-sectors (e.g. biofuels); \u2022 the identification of opportunities, threats and chal- lenges for the future; \u2022 the connection of research to business and govern- ment goals; \u2022 the identification of new paradigms; \u2022 the assessment of possible impacts of policy rec- ommendations and decisions derived from foresight; \u2022 the creation of a foresight culture through meth- odology and capacity building. An important contribution of futures thinking in fore- sight exercises is the timely identification of issues that should alert and support decision-making, especially when it comes to priority-setting. STI strategy/priority-setting The mapping results show that European foresight exer- cises tend to mobilise key stakeholders to set and/or strengthen strategic STI areas connected to public and private industries. Such activities normally assess STI EFMN_Mapping_091223.indd 27 EFMN_Mapping_091223.indd 27 22/10/07 11:29 22/10/07 11:29 ",
        "28 Experience suggests that participants in foresight can often be effective carriers of the message about the results of the activity, and may play roles in implement- ing (or monitoring the implementation of) the conclusions in their own organisations. A considerable number of cases recognise that fore- sight outputs have informed decisions, but they are cautious at the time of measuring the extent to which the process has lead to actions. The general percep- tion is that, on the whole, foresight only triggers the actions that need to be taken, and that further steps, such as formalising and implementing the action (e.g. policy recommendations), are almost entirely depend- ent on the willingness, room for manoeuvre, and power of the sponsoring organisations. Further reflections on objectives Figure 2.2 uses Georghiou and Cassingena Harper (2008) to reclassify the above objectives. This rearrangement shows a slight evolution away from the traditional pur- pose of broad-based technological priority setting to a much more focused and adapted set of applications. In so doing, the STI strategy/priority-setting family was dissolved in order to leave STI priority-setting alone and merge strategy with policy development. In addition, the notion of methodology and capacity building has been taking out from the policy development category and a new category has been created under that name. Finally, strategic thinking has been relabelled as ana- lysing the future potential of technologies. So, the new results show that: \u2022 The most popular category is the one called analysing the future potential of technologies. This refers to stud- ies which preselect one or more areas of science or technology and use foresight approaches to assess their potential and the actions needed to take them forward. \u2022 The second group is distinguished by a focus on a par- ticular policy domain, economic or otherwise, and using foresight to develop policy (or business strategy). Shared visions The creation of a shared vision is implicit in most Euro- pean exercises. It is closely linked to the above-mentioned objective of encouraging strategic thinking: both require the evaluation of existing visions and the assessment of desired, possible and alternative scenarios. However, the most important aspect of this objective is the actual cre- ation of shared visions, enabling the development of new scenarios with their related strategies and recommenda- tions. While many studies develop visions, they are less often successful in \u2018sharing\u2019 them. This is mainly due to, on the one hand, poorly designed participatory processes and, on the other, unsuccessful dissemination strategies. Grand Challenges A shared feature across many foresight exercises is the presence of ambitious objectives or \u2018Grand Challenges\u2019. Some examples of European Grand Challenges include the Lisbon Objectives, the European Research Area (ERA) and, more abstractly, the European Knowledge Society. Exer- cises focused on such objectives may have also contributed to the creation and consolidation of the European identity in new EU Member States and Candidate Countries. At the international level there have been exercises with reference to the United Nations Millennium Goals, and a few exercises focused on global problems such as climate change, natural disasters, terrorism and pov- erty. As for the national and subnational levels it is possible to find some exercises targeting \u2018traditional\u2019 Grand Challenges, for example: social equity, sustain- able development, regional integration, social cohesion and sustained economic growth. Actions and discussions Of course foresight is meant to inform decisions. But ensuring that foresight actually does trigger action can also be an objective built into exercises. For example, a panel in a foresight project might develop demon- strator proposals, and the panel members engage in recruitment of support for such projects during the life of the foresight exercise. EFMN_Mapping_091223.indd 28 EFMN_Mapping_091223.indd 28 22/10/07 11:29 22/10/07 11:29 ",
        "29 Mapping Foresight 2 | Mapping foresight objectives \u2022 The third group is almost always associated with the verb \u201cto foster\u201d and reflects the aims of many exercises to promote networking between actors in research and innovation. It is noteworthy that the specific remit of prioritisation is present in 46 % of the selected studies. Many exercises have an explicit goal of developing foresight methodologies, or the capacity to use these methodologies, and this forms the next grouping. \u2022 With a similar frequency there is a group of objec- tives which seek to articulate supply and demand for technology or innovation. These almost always make reference to market opportunities or societal demand. \u2022 The last and distinct category is that of public engagement in foresight. The \u201cOther\u201d category consists of some objectives which are very general, and others which address various aspects of R&D strategy or policy. From this analysis we may conclude that the objective of foresight has moved on from the typical objective found in the large national foresight programmes during the 1990s.

Given the early focus on European exercises, as well as the fact that the project team is EU-based, it is perhaps unsurprising to see a \u2018Eurocentric\u2019 view in the project. However, we should not assume that European coun- tries have a monopoly on innovative approaches to foresight. The number of entries for North America is also sig- nificant, possibly reflecting an English language bias in the database (and in the literature and Internet in gen- eral). The language barrier was one of the reasons for the creation of a similar mapping platform in Spanish, from which the current report borrowed 114 cases to improve the Latin American data (see http://www.self- rule.org). Language barriers may also account for the lower number of Asian cases captured. During 2008, the EFMN team employed more resources in an attempt to get better coverage of these and other regions. Future efforts to improve the data should try to increase the numbers in Oceania and Africa. As for the latter, a total of 29 cases were collected but most dimensions remained unmapped. There are several dif- ferences in the way foresight is adopted and used. Hence, this section uses EFMN data to describe the cur- rent \u2018status\u2019 of foresight in each region: \u2022 International \u2013 a number of inter-governmental organisations (IGOs), such as the EC, OECD, IPTS, UNIDO, APEC, FAO, for example, have been active promoters of foresight, using a mix of training, methodological support, case studies, and even providing seed funding to set up foresight pro- grammes and cross-national projects. For example, the EC\u2019s Seventh Framework Programme for RTD Figure 3.1 shows the distribution of mapped exercises in six regions: \u2022 International : this includes OECD, FAO, UNESCO, UNIDO and World Bank initiatives, for example; \u2022 Europe : this includes EU-related studies as well as cross-national, national and subnational studies car- ried out by European countries, including Iceland, Norway, Switzerland, Turkey, Ukraine and Russia; \u2022 Latin America : this includes Argentina, Bolivia, Bra- zil, Chile, Colombia, Cuba, Ecuador, Mexico, Panama, Paraguay, Peru and Venezuela; \u2022 North America : Canada and USA; \u2022 Asia : this includes China, India, Japan, Singapore and South Korea; \u2022 Oceania : Australia and New Zealand.

The left hand column shows 1 098 other cases \u2013 in levels 0 and 1 \u2013 that are not analysed here. As originally planned and shown in Table 3.1, the vast majority of L2 and L3 cases are from Europe ( 713 ). These are followed by cases from Latin America ( 120 ), North America ( 109 ), Asia ( 89 ), international exercises ( 67 ) and studies from Oceania ( 15 ).

        "33 Mapping Foresight 3 | Mapping foresight in world regions Note that the data for the US is very much domi- nated by industry-sector technology roadmapping exercises (see also Porter and Ashton, 2008). \u2022 Asia \u2013 Japan pioneered the development of national technology foresight, using the Delphi method since 1970 to forecast and shape future technological trajectories. Besides having an influ- ence on Europe, the Japanese experience has also inspired similar exercises in other parts of Asia, par- ticularly Korea and China. Within the context of the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC), a Tech- nology Foresight Centre was set up in the late- 1990s to conduct region-wide studies and to develop capabilities in member countries. This work has been largely influenced by practices in Australia, North America, Japan and North-West Europe (see Johnston and Sripaipan, 2008). \u2022 Oceania \u2013 activities in this region have been shaped by the futures community linked to the World Future Society and the World Futures Studies Fed- eration. However, we should point out that the studies currently available in the EFMN database do not do justice to the level of activity in this region. For example, 36 of 51 studies (i.e. 70 %) in the data- base are only nominated or mapped in level 1 (at the time of writing this report). This is the case for various Australian exercises such as the ones organ- ised by the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO), and for most exer- cises from New Zealand, especially those organised by the Ministry of Research, Science and Technol- ogy (MoRST) and the Ministry of Housing. has built in a unique research line devoted to Fore- sight Activities. Thus, under its Socio-economic Sciences and Humanities (SSH) research efforts, the EC is interested on: (1) wide socio-economic fore- sight on key challenges; (2) focused thematic foresight; (3) research systems and research policies in Europe; and (4) the so-called Blue Sky research on emerging issues (see FarHorizon, SESTI (www. sesti.info) and the iKNOW (www.iknowfutures.com) projects). \u2022 Europe \u2013 the level of foresight activity in the region has increased significantly over the last decade. This has been influenced by a number of well-posi- tioned traditions, such as technology foresight, sustainability planning and territorial prospective. Some countries, e.g. France, have several decades in the business of futures thinking and that still influ- ences practice today. Others, e.g. the UK and Ireland, have a shorter history where practice has been more influenced by technology foresight programmes and sustainable futures traditions. In Eastern Europe fore- sight activities mapped by EFMN have been heavily influenced by the European Union\u2019s enlargement process and UNIDO efforts to introduce foresight as a support tool for technology transfer and learning. \u2022 Latin America \u2013 foresight in the region has evolved slowly but gradually. Countries like Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia and Venezuela have launched pro- grammes and projects incorporating concepts and techniques from a wide range of international exer- cises, mainly from Europe. However, the region has also managed to develop its own way of doing fore- sight, often due to the creative use of limited resources, thus leading to effective innovations in practices and tools (see Popper and Medina, 2008). International organisations like UNIDO, the Andres Bello Agree- ment (CAB), ECLAC and more recently the EC have played a key role in supporting national foresight pro- grammes and capacity-building activities. \u2022 North America \u2013 some of the most popular fore- sight methods, such as Delphi, were developed in the United States during the 1950s and 1960s. There are many studies at both state and federal levels in the US and Canada, but these are either missing from our database or mapped in levels 0 and 1 only.

        "35 Mapping Foresight 3 | Mapping foresight in world regions Tables 3.1 and 3.2 have shown the number of cases mapped in each of these groups. Here we should say that figures for Europe bring together EU-related cases (including EU27 and previous EU15 studies, New Mem- ber States, Candidate Countries and other Europe-wide initiatives) with national and subnational studies car- ried out in 33 European countries , namely: Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Russia, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Turkey, Ukraine and the United Kingdom. However, given that the mapping of individual dimen- sions (e.g. sponsors, audience, time horizon, etc.) was not compulsory, the number of cases per dimension often varies. For example, from a total of 1 113 cases mapped in levels 2 and 3, some 1 078 cases have been mapped against the methods dimension, some 1 077 against the audiences dimension, 1 003 against the sponsors dimension. Other dimensions like the number of participants or funding levels, however, proved to be more difficult to map, showing some 528 and 320 cases respectively. Comparing practices in world regions The mapping of foresight experiences is not limited to the European region. All over the world, experts and national Correspondents have contributed to the devel- opment of the EFMN database. This has allowed us to analyse and compare European exercises against those carried out in other world regions. The collection of data at the global level enables us to look at geographical differences in foresight practices. Responses to questions like who are the main spon- sors and target audiences, what are the typical time horizons, how many people are involved, what are the main differences in territorial scale, what are the main outputs, and what are the top methods used in differ- ent world regions provide the reader with valuable information about the diversity of foresight practices.

        "36 Sponsors The sponsors of foresight exercises can be very diverse \u2013 involving a wide range of stakeholders, including government, research, business and non-state actors. The specific reasons for sponsoring a foresight study can be different but the overall rationales may be sim- ilar (e.g. building visions, setting agendas for research, action or investment, mobilising key actors). As Figure 3.3 shows, government agencies and depart- ments (or simply \u2018government\u2019) are the main sponsors of foresight in all regions, although we can see a few differences. For example, government sponsorship is present in nearly all European and Latin American cases mapped, but is to some extent less dominant in North America, Asia and Oceania. In Asia, the results are somewhat influenced by the inclusion of APEC-funded projects in our database, whereas the North American figures reflect the high number of industrial sector studies in our sample, many of which are funded by the business sector. Indeed, the business sector is a far more prominent sponsor in this region than in any other, perhaps reflecting an Anglo-Saxon laissez-faire tradition. A similar pattern is also seen in the sponsorship data for Oceania, as reported elsewhere (see Popper et al., 2007; Keenan and Popper, 2008). The results show that other \u2018non-state actors\u2019 includ- ing NGOs and inter-governmental organisations (IGOs), but excluding business and research organisations, are more likely to be foresight sponsors in Latin America and Asia. There are two major explanations here. First there is a prominence of IGO sponsorship in Latin America and Asia, contrasting with the situation in North America and Europe. Secondly, more detailed examination of the sample shows that studies in some regions often have more than one sponsor. This is particularly evi- dent in Latin America, where the sponsorship bars add up to around 150 %. By comparison, the sponsorship bars for Oceania add up to around 100 %, pointing to a strong inclination for single sponsorship. The main reason for multiple sponsors in Latin America is likely to be insufficient funding from government; foresight practitioners often need to assemble a pool of sponsors before an exercise becomes viable. In some countries (e.g. Colombia and Peru) this has some undoubted benefits (e.g. new initiatives emerging in the \u2018new\u2019 sponsoring institutions. But it also has disadvan- tages, including a potential loss of focus, and the need for compromise to meet the demands of all sponsors. Audiences Sponsorship data tells only part of the story and it is also interesting to look at the target audiences of fore- sight exercises. Figure 3.4 shows the variety of audiences for each region. In general, foresight exercises have a primary set of target groups, whose selection tends to reflect the objectives of the exercise and the interests of the sponsor(s). Broadly speaking, there is no great varia- tion, government agencies and departments are the main target groups, regardless of the region. The most remarkable results are the relatively large num- bers of research and business community targets \u2013 far more than there are sponsors. This basically indicates that public administrations often sponsor studies targeted at E u r o p e L a t i n A m e r i c a N o rt h A m e r i c a A s i a O c e a n i a I n t e r n a t i on a l Figure 3.3: Sponsors by region 1 003 cases mapped 60 643 108 98 80 14 Government Research Business Non-state actors 0 100 % 0 100 % 0 100 % 0 100 % 0 100 % 0 100 % EFMN_Mapping_091223.indd 36 EFMN_Mapping_091223.indd 36 22/10/07 11:29 22/10/07 11:29 ",
        "37 Mapping Foresight 3 | Mapping foresight in world regions Time horizon Figure 3.5 shows the time horizon of some 1 351 cases, related to their initiation period. Most exercises are looking 10 to 20 years ahead into the future. With the majority of mapped exercises being initiated in the late 1990s or early 2000s, our analyses are focusing on early 21st Century foresight practices. The figure also shows that Europe, North America, Asia and Oceania have a more strategic attitude towards the far future (e.g. 30, 50, 100 years ahead). Participation An important feature of foresight exercises is their potential to become a \u2018space\u2019 for opinion-gathering and reflection among a wide-ranging group of stake- holders. For this reason, the diversity and scale of participation are expected to go beyond what is usu- ally attainable in more standard agenda-setting arenas. Consequently, participation often contributes towards the value-added and shared ownership goals of these other groups. But also governments are among target groups more often than they are among sponsors, suggesting that other sponsors could be using foresight exercises to shape public policy agendas ( ibid , p. 26). While there may be no great variation between regions, it is possible to observe three interesting features. \u2022 First, in most regions the research and the business communities are more or less equally targeted. The exception here is Latin America, where the research community is targeted with the same intensity as governmental bodies. This result may reflect the strong linkages that Latin American TF programmes have established with the academic sector, especially as a tool for research agenda setting. \u2022 Second, North America is clearly the region where foresight activity is more likely to target trade unions and industrial federations . \u2022 Finally, figures for Asia show that this region has the highest number of studies targeting other audi- ences . According to our data, these audiences are mainly (NGOs, trade unions and intermediary organisations).

        "38 However, the most startling feature of this data is the apparent low levels of participation across all regions, with around half the mapped exercises indicating lev- els of participation below 50 people. These figures are rather unexpected, given the high participation claims often made on behalf of foresight. But, as Keenan and Popper (2008) suggest, the result may be explained, at least in part, by the inclusion in the EFMN database of future-oriented activities that are outside the usual definitions of foresight as used, for example, by the European Commission; the latter may tend to empha- sise high levels of participation. Another possible factor could be that some of the larg- est national exercises have been broken down into their constituent parts for the purposes of mapping, creating a measurement effect. Yet another explanation may simply be that large-scale, multi-participant exercises are too challenging, expensive and time-consuming to organise so that, in many situations, the ideal of deep and wide participation remains just that \u2013 an ideal. Territorial scale Foresight exercises are carried out at a variety of terri- torial scales, ranging from subnational exercises to foresight. There have been, however, a couple of dif- ficulties with the mapping of this dimension. First, while the scale of participation can be more or less measured, diversity is more difficult to assess and the EFMN has not attempted to collect this data. This means our analysis is only focused on the scale of par- ticipation, which is a less than satisfactory proxy. Second, it has been hard to collect information about the number of people involved in the various activities and the methods used in the exercise (e.g. workshop participants, conference attendants, survey respond- ents, etc.). As Figure 3.6 shows, between 75-85 % of mapped exercises in Europe, Latin America, and North America involved 200 participants or less. Of these regions, Latin America shows the highest level of participation \u2013 although it also has the lowest number of exercises with more than 500 participants. Asia has the largest proportion of exercises with more than 500 partici- pants. This can be explained by the fact that virtually all foresight exercises mapped in this region are either national or international, which tends to normally imply higher numbers of participants.

        "39 Mapping Foresight 3 | Mapping foresight in world regions Methods The number and type of methods used in a foresight exercise normally depends on a variety of factors. Some of these factors are linked to the intrinsic attributes of methods , namely their nature (qualitative, quanti- tative or semi-quantitative) and their capabilities (i.e. the ability to gather or process information based on evidence, expertise, interaction or creativity). Other factors are more linked to fundamental elements and conditions influencing a foresight process , including available resources (time and funding), the geo- political context, expected outputs, participation scale and the interconnections between methods \u2013 or \u2018meth- ods mix\u2019, among others (see Popper, 2008a). Figure 3.8 shows the use of some 25 methods (the top ten methods in each world region appear in red). Its results indicate that some methods are very widely used across the world; such is the case for expert panels, lit- erature review, scenarios and trend extrapolation. But the more interesting findings are those that tell us more about differences in regional foresight practices. The first of these methods is (futures) workshops , which figure notably in Europe and North America but are used much less in Asia and Oceania and are below the top ten in Latin America. The second method of interest is Delphi , which is most often used in Latin America, Asia and Europe, but is absent from the top ten in North America. As the author of this report highlighted in the 2008 special issue of Foresight Journal (about EFMN): In the more established democracies of Europe and North America, actors more at ease with openly discussing contested futures come together in face-to-face forums offered by workshops. By con- trast, in newer democracies, or in Japanese society, where there is less tradition of open debate, the more anonymous method of Delphi is preferred. Furthermore, Delphi generates a lot of codified output that is more amenable to analysis and assessment than workshop \u2018talk\u2019 and is therefore preferred by states with a \u2018strong\u2019 tradition of orchestrating socio-economic activity. international ones. But given that foresight is often conducted to inform and support policy, we would expect exercises to be carried out at those territorial scales where policy responsibilities reside, particularly at national level. However, for those regions where there is extensive autonomy at the subnational level (for example, in fed- eral political systems) or where national sovereignty has been pooled (as in the European Union), we might expect to see substantial foresight activity on these scales as well. Figure 3.7 shows that for all world regions, the national level is by far the most important. As policy-making is still predominantly carried out at this level, this result should come as little surprise. The remaining foresight initiatives are more or less equally distributed over the other territorial scales, although there are some signif- icant differences between regions. Subnational exercises are found most frequently in Europe \u2013 possibly reflecting long-term trends of region- alisation in many European countries \u2013 closely followed by Latin America. In contrast, they seem to be less com- mon in Oceania and are non-existent in Asia. The mapping process might play a part in explaining some of these results. For example, the relatively high figures for Europe and Latin America might be explained by more intensive monitoring efforts in these regions, compared with North America where a larger number of subnational exercises might have been expected, given federal political arrangements. On the other hand, the low number of exercises for Asia is not surprising, since subnational governance is weakly developed in the countries covered in this region (ibid, p. 22). In terms of supranational studies, Europe shows significant figures (20 %), certainly owing to the activi- ties of the European Commission and its agencies. A large proportion of Asian studies are also suprana- tional. This is mainly due to the activities of the APEC Technology Foresight Centre, which has been support- ing region-wide studies. In Latin America and North America there has been limited international activity. In the former, UNIDO and the EC have become important players in recent years.

        "40 more popular in international cases than Delphi, SWOT analysis and interviews. \u2022 Despite being created in North America, Delphi appears to be more popular in Latin America, Europe, Asia and Oceania. \u2022 North America seems to be the region with the most emphasis on technology roadmapping and key technologies activities. \u2022 Structural analysis is in the top ten for Latin Amer- ica \u2013 probably reflecting the strong influence that French strategic prospective practices had in the late 1980s and early 1990s. Results also show technology roadmapping and key technologie s as two of the most popular methods in North America and Asia. This can be explained by the importance of the business sector as a target audience (and as a sponsor in the case of North America) which favours these particular techniques. Other interesting findings include: \u2022 Backcasting, citizen panels and interviews are among the most common methods in Oceania (these fig- ures might change as more cases from that region are examined). \u2022 Trend extrapolation and megatrend analysis, mod- elling and simulation, and questionnaires/surveys are Figure 3.8: Methods by region 1 078 cases mapped 65 691 116 106 86 15 Backcasting Bibliometrics Brainstorming Citizens panels Cross-impact/Structural analysis Delphi Environmental scanning Essays Expert panels Futures workshops Gaming Interviews Key technologies Literature review Modelling and simulation Morphological analysis Multi-criteria analysis Questionnaire/Survey Relevance trees Scenarios Stakeholder mapping SWOT analysis Technology roadmapping Trend Extrapolation/Megatrends Other methods E u r o p e L a t i n A m e r i c a N o rt h A m e r i c a A s i a O c e a n i a I n t e r n a t i on a l 0 100 % 0 100 % 0 100 % 0 100 % 0 100 % 0 100 % EFMN_Mapping_091223.indd 40 EFMN_Mapping_091223.indd 40 22/10/07 11:29 22/10/07 11:29 ",
        "41 Mapping Foresight 3 | Mapping foresight in world regions Therefore, Figure 3.9 only shows the popularity of some common codified outputs. Policy recommendations are the most frequent out- puts in all regions, principally in Europe, Latin America and Oceania. Analysis of trends and drivers has been reported as an output most frequently (relatively speaking) in Latin America, followed closely by the Europe and Interna- tional studies. Scenarios are less present in the North American and Asian studies mapped to date. Research and other priorities are reported as out- puts relatively more frequently in Latin America and Oceania; closely followed by North America. Key technologies are the third most important out- puts of Asian cases. They are not very common in other groups. Forecasts are most popular in Asia. On the whole across all regions, forecasts appear to be one of the least reported outputs. Technology roadmaps are generated most frequently in North America, while they do not feature at all in Latin American output. \u2022 Asia uses modelling and simulation in about 25% of the mapped studies. Finally, it may be useful to look at the average number of methods used by each region: International (4 meth- ods), Europe (5), Latin America (8), North America (4), Asia (4) and Oceania (3). Outputs Are there regional differences in the production of fore- sight outputs? Our own experience as practitioners tells us that such differences do, indeed, exist. These tend to become more apparent in the relative importance that some regions give to the production of codified outputs versus the generation of process-related intangibles (such as networks and shared visions). Unfortunately, the EFMN data does not allow us to con- firm these views, since mapping efforts have been exclusively concerned with collecting data on the codi- fied outputs of foresight exercises and have not attempted to capture intangible process benefits as well. The sister SELF-RULE initiative included some of these intangibles in the mapping of Latin American experi- ences, for example, the emergence of new networks, new actors and new funding schemes, among others. However, these were not used by the EFMN, so can- not be compared with other regions.

        "42 Figure 3.10 shows the regional distribution of results (note that the highest level of FRASCATI categories are shown in red). The first interesting result is that foresight exercises in North America and Oceania are carried out with more defined target research areas than similar exercises in Europe, Latin America and Asia. This is particularly obvious in Oceania, where the higher level bars of research areas add up to around 100 %. Research areas The EFMN database used the research areas indicator to map those science and technology fields, as defined by the Frascati Manual, which have been explicitly addressed by foresight. To do so, Correspondents were advised to select categories at least to the second level of research areas; otherwise the information gathered was too general.

        "43 Mapping Foresight 3 | Mapping foresight in world regions related to the already mentioned diversity of sponsors in these regions. Multiple sponsorships often require a much broader conceptual and methodological scope. In other words, if a study is sponsored by a government agency in cooperation with, for example, an international organ- isation (such as the European Commission, UNIDO or APEC), then the study is often expected to promote By comparison, the research areas bars for North America add up to around 115 %, pointing to a strong inclination for single research area studies. But how can we read these results?

        "44 which have considered cultural issues (such as, for exam- ple, the EUFORIA ( 1 ) project) are more likely to be mapped as studies of human societies within the social sci- ences category. Also striking is the lack of sufficient European foresight on agricultural sciences . This is surprising in the light of the number of regulatory and socio-economic challenges and opportunities of the Common Agricultural Policy pro- moted by the European Union, but also because of market-related challenges , such as higher food prices driven by the use of crops to produce biofuel, the grow- ing demand for food products in Asian countries (mainly China and India), and environmental challenges such as water scarcity and climate change, among other factors. Socio-economic sectors Figure 3.11 shows the regional distribution of sectors using the NACE classification system (i.e. Nomencla- ture g\u00e9n\u00e9rale des Activit\u00e9s \u00e9conomiques dans les Communaut\u00e9s europ\u00e9ennes). basic research (e.g. by developing theoretical analysis of the factors determining potential changes in a sec- tor, quite often targeting sub-areas of social sciences ) and applied research areas (e.g. by exploring the poten- tial of technologies and thus generally, though not always, targeting sub-areas in the engineering and technology category). The second interesting result, considering the large pro- portion of exercises targeting areas of social sciences, is the almost non-existence of foresight exercises on areas of humanities in our database. One possible explana- tion here is the fact that our mapping process was originally focused on technology foresight programmes. Another explanation, based on our own experience as practitioners, is that major foresight sponsors (i.e. govern- mental bodies, such as offices of science and technology, ministries of economy, departments of trade and indus- try, and equivalents) tend to have limited capacity to shape the future of those areas included in the Frascati taxonomy under the humanities category. One possible exception could be languages and culture .

        "45 Mapping Foresight 3 | Mapping foresight in world regions Two other sectors addressed by a large number of fore- sight studies concern \u2018infrastructures\u2019 \u2013 namely, healthcare (including health and social work ), utili- ties ( electricity, gas and water supply ) and transport. These are among the top five domain areas in Europe, North America and Asia. But Latin America and Oce- ania show slightly different interests. Figure 3.11 shows that both Europe and Latin America have a consider- able number of studies on public administration and defence issues. Finally, it is possible to observe the lack of foresight (espe- cially in Europe but also in other regions) on the sectors hit by the recent economic crisis, namely the financial intermediation and the real estate sectors. The results show that the top five target socio-economic sectors in Europe are: \u2022 Manufacturing \u2022 Health and social work \u2022 Electricity, water and gas supply \u2022 Public administration and defence \u2022 Transport, storage and communication. Overall, manufacturing is one of the top socio- economic sectors in all regions, with Asia, North America, Oceania and Europe focusing on this area and Latin America giving it a little less consideration. While some countries in this region have an important manu- facturing base (e.g. Brazil), lower levels of interest in this domain area may reflect the region\u2019s continuing strong emphasis on agriculture , which is by far the most common sector covered in its foresight activities. However, if we think about the recent food crisis, we could conclude that Latin America has been targeting the right sector, while other countries have sometimes neglected this sector and have preferred to study more \u2018glamorous\u2019 topics such as the communications indus- try (including ICTs).

In addition, we have selected a sample of project objectives in order to provide a \u2018flavour\u2019 of the types of cases mapped in each country.

Due to space limitations we have restricted our descrip- tions and indicator boxes to one page each. Despite this compression, we hope enough detail is available to illustrate and justify our synthesis about national practices in the ten selected countries. The frequency and nature of foresight initiatives varies significantly across Europe. Some countries, especially where foresight has traditionally been used as an instrument to support government and business deci- sions, show a higher frequency of case studies than others. In this chapter we have mapped practices in nine EU Member States (Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Spain, and the United Kingdom) and one associate country (Norway). We have selected these countries because they have the largest number of cases in the database, ranging from 17 cases in Belgium and Italy to 144 and 181 in the UK and the Netherlands respectively. For each country we have made summary boxes with the mapping results of eight dimensions: time horizon, sponsors, audiences, territorial scale, methods, research EFMN_Mapping_091223.indd 48 EFMN_Mapping_091223.indd 48 22/10/07 11:29 22/10/07 11:29 ",

Sponsors include: the Belgium Federal Office for Sci- entific, Technical and Cultural Affairs (BELSPO); the Royal Belgian Academy Council of Applied Sciences (BACAS); the Walloon Ministry of Economy; and the Flemish Institute for Science and Technology Assess- ment (viWTA), among others. As for the audiences (users), the figures show that more than 80 % of the studies target government agencies and departments, around 50 % target the research community, around 40 % target the business community, some 25 % of cases target trade bodies and industrial federations, while other actors (e.g. trades unions and intermediary organisations) are tar- geted in 10 % of the studies. Figures on outputs indicate that policy recommenda- tions and scenarios are present in half of the studies, followed closely by the analysis of trends and drivers. The territorial scale of the studies is mainly national (50 %), with the other half equally distributed between subnational and supranational studies. The most common foresight methods are: literature review; futures workshops; scenarios ; and expert pan- els . We should also point out that the \u2018other methods\u2019 option was selected in half of the sample, indicating the existence of very diverse methodological frame- works in the country. Popular foresight research areas focus on social sci- ences (i.e. studies in human society; education; economics and policy and political science) and engi- neering and technology (mainly chemical, resources, environmental and materials engineering). The most often targeted socio-economic sectors are manufacturing; electricity, gas and water supply; con- struction; transport storage and communication; and education. Finally, we selected a limited number of objectives and clustered them using the categories presented at the end of Chapter 2: \u2022 About analysing the future potential of technolo- gies: (1) analysing qualitative data about the socio-economic impact of technologies in the future; (2) elaborating future perspectives in the area of energy; and (3) understanding the meaning of nanotechnology for improving the competitive- ness of the country. \u2022 About supporting policy or strategy development: (1) developing alternative scenarios for the future, which can serve as tools for strategic discussion and planning not only on a European level but also on a national level; (2) elucidating the use and func- tion of the sustainability concept in different contexts, and mapping the diverging views on sus- tainability; (3) promoting technology and innovation policies; and (4) developing a long-term vision on the opportunities and threats for the Flemish region (broad socio-economic orientation). \u2022 About network building: organising a network of competent suppliers fitted to the companies\u2019 needs and a framework for innovation. \u2022 About methodology and capacity building: (1) com- paring different sets of methods and indicators used to put sustainability into practice; and (2) developing methodologies and tools to assess the impact of flood risk reduction measures. \u2022 About articulating supply and demand: (1) develop- ing strategies and action plans to be undertaken by different actors, including the private and public sec- tors as well as civil society (e.g. acquiring a better knowledge of the innovation potential in Wallonia; promoting partnerships and synergies by creating innovation clusters: etc.); (2) offering a basis to busi- nesses to make innovation strategies; (3) providing a larger share of innovative products and services in the total economic output of the region; (4) investi- gating which energy system the Flanders region would need in 30-50 years and how such a system could be achieved.

        "52 Foresight in Denmark Our database includes 40 exercises linked to Denmark. 25 of these can be considered fully mapped. Box 4.2 shows that Denmark has projects targeting a variety of time horizons with a considerable number looking at more than 15 years ahead. In terms of sponsors , the government is clearly the main supporter of foresight. Sponsors include: the Min- istry of Science, Technology and Innovation (VTU); the Ministry of Trade and Industry; the Ministry of Environ- ment; the Environmental Protection Agency; the Ris\u00f8 National Laboratory for Sustainable Energy; and the Nordic Innovation Centre, among others. As for the audiences (users), the figures show that almost 100 % of the studies target government agen- cies and departments , more than 75 % target the research community , and more than 50 % target the business community. Figures on outputs show that policy recommenda- tions , research and other priorities and analysis of trends and drivers are the key outputs of most studies. The territorial scale of the studies is mainly national (75 %), while the other 25 % constitute supranational studies. The most common foresight methods include: expert panels; futures workshops; literature review; scenarios; key technologies and technology roadmapping . Popular foresight research areas focus on engineering and technology (especially manufacturing engineering and industrial biotechnology and food sciences) fol- lowed by medical sciences (mainly public health and health services; and pharmacology and pharmaceutical sciences). The most often targeted socio-economic sectors are manufacturing, electricity, gas and water supply; and health and social work. Finally, we selected a limited number of objectives and clustered them using the categories presented at the end of Chapter 2: \u2022 About analysing the future potential of technologies: (1) analysing the environmental effects of wind tur- bines during production and decommissioning of wind turbines in a long-term view; (2) enabling a stra- tegic understanding of the possibilities and implications of the use of biomedical sensors for healthcare pur- poses by establishing likely scenarios for technology, applications and markets; (3) analysing future possi- bilities for the application of ICT within the whole value chain in the next 5-10 years; (4) analysing envi- ronmental potentials and risks related to three generic technologies (nanotechnology, biotechnology and ICT) within the coming 15-20 years; (5) presenting some scenarios of future developments in sensor tech- nology with respect to the technology, its applications and market issues in a timeframe of 2000-2015; (6) generating, selecting and presenting a number of scenarios illustrating the prospects for possible future applications for ICT technologies; and (7) providing a wide knowledge base in regards to possible inno- vation related to the development of robot technology. \u2022 About supporting policy or strategy development: (1) promoting strategies for sustainable development in coastal areas; (2) providing a sound basis for cohe- sive, long-term Danish policy on research, education and innovation; and (3) providing a well-established knowledge base about an ageing society in 2030 in regards to valuing the needs for new concentrated strategic research efforts. \u2022 About network building: creating a framework for an open debate between experts, politicians and stakeholders in the energy sector. \u2022 About priority setting for S&T: (1) providing decision support for companies and research institutes in defining R&D priorities and assisting governmental decision-makers in making effective framework pol- icies for the introduction of hydrogen energy; and (2) putting forward a number of long-term energy goals, serving as a guideline for this year\u2019s work and for the end of year.

        "54 Foresight in Finland Our database includes 76 exercises linked to Finland. 50 of these can be considered fully mapped. Box 4.3 shows that Finland has projects targeting a vari- ety of time horizons . Most look at more than 10 years and a few go beyond 50 years. In terms of sponsors , the government is clearly the main supporter of foresight. Sponsors include: the National Fund for Research and Development (SITRA); the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry; the Ministry of Education; the Parliament; and the National Tech- nology Agency of Finland (TEKES), among others. As for the audiences (users), the figures show that more than 80 % of the studies target government agencies and departments, around 60 % target the business community, around 50 % the research com- munity, and some 25 % of cases target trade bodies and industrial federations, while other actors (e.g. trades unions and intermediary organisations) are tar- geted in 10 % of the studies. Figures on outputs indicate that policy recommenda- tions and the analysis of trends and drivers are present in more than half of the studies, followed by scenarios. The territorial scale of the studies is mainly national (75 %) and the other half is more or less equally dis- tributed between subnational and supranational studies. The most common foresight methods are: expert pan- els; literature review; scenarios; futures workshops; SWOT and Delphi . Popular foresight research areas focus on social sci- ences (especially policy and political science and the studies in human society) and engineering and tech- nology (mainly on communications technologies; environmental engineering; and industrial biotechnol- ogy and food sciences). The most often targeted socio-economic sectors are manufacturing; public administration and defence; health and social work ; and education. Finally, we selected a limited number of objectives and clustered them using the categories presented at the end of Chapter 2: \u2022 About analysing the future potential of technolo- gies: (1) foreseeing the future technology needs of Finnish industry until the year 2015; (2) facilitating a multifaceted discussion about the potential of new technologies in supporting the independent living of elderly people; (3) mapping promising technologies, new business models and qualification requirements; (4) presenting a summary of the production possi- bilities of renewable energy sources in Finland by 2030; (5) identifying, with a 10 to 15 years perspec- tive, the areas where competitiveness and wellbeing of Finland is best advanced by means of STI. \u2022 About supporting policy or strategy development: (1) providing long-term vision for the energy sector; (2) forming three scenarios (business as usual, threats and future in making and opportunities) for food industry, in order to gather one joint scenario and a proposal for a strategy; (3) exploring the future development trends in knowledge intensive business services (KIBS) as a whole and by sub-sectors; and (4) assisting governmental decision-makers in making effective framework policies for the introduction of hydrogen energy. \u2022 About network building: generating information on long-term development views for decision- making by regional, sub-regional and local actors, promoting networking among cluster firms. \u2022 About priority setting for S&T: (1) helping regional bodies to prioritise innovations about knowledge society developments; and (2) providing decision support for companies and research institutes in defining R&D priorities. \u2022 About methodology and capacity building: influ- encing the educational system by promoting the capabilities for reacting to qualifications needs. \u2022 About articulating supply and demand: developing an action model for regional organisations in order to understand future development of the regional labour market and several business areas (e.g. agriculture, software industry, food industry, environmental tech- nology, biotechnology, etc.).

        "56 Foresight in France Our database includes 198 exercises linked to France. Of these, 119 can be considered fully mapped. Box 4.4 shows that France has projects targeting a wide range of time horizons , but most look 10 or 20 years into the future. In terms of sponsors , the government is the main supporter of foresight. Sponsors include: D\u00e9l\u00e9gation \u00e0 l\u2019Am\u00e9nagement du Territoire et \u00e0 l\u2019Action R\u00e9gionale (DATAR); the Ministry of Economy, Finance and Indus- try; the Ministry of Defence; the Conseil \u00c9conomique et Social R\u00e9gional (CESR-Centre), among others. As for the audiences (users), the figures show that more than 80 % of the studies target government agencies and departments , around 50 % target the research community, around 30 % target the business community , and some 15 % of cases target trade bod- ies and industrial federations , while other actors (e.g. trades unions and intermediary organisations) are tar- geted in 25 % of studies. Figures on outputs indicate that p olicy recommenda- tions and the analysis of trends and drivers lead, followed by scenarios . The territorial scale of the studies is mainly subna- tional (59 %), with some national cases (37 %) and only 4 % supranational. The most common foresight methods are: scenarios; trend extrapolation/megatrends, literature review ; and expert panels . We were expecting to see more use of the French versions of cross-impact (i.e. structural anal- ysis, MACTOR and SMIC) as we were expecting to see more use of Delphi in the United States (see Figure 3.8 ). An interesting question here is whether foresight methods eventually become less popular in the coun- tries where they have been developed. Popular foresight research areas focus on social sciences (especially policy and political science, studies in human society and economics) and engineering and technology (in particular environmental engineering, among others). The most often targeted socio-economic sectors are public administration and defence; health and social work; manufacturing; electricity, gas and water supply; and education. Finally, we selected a limited number of objectives and clustered them using the categories presented at the end of Chapter 2: \u2022 About analysing the future potential of technologies : (1) detecting weak signals of disruptive events, to fore- cast next technological breakdowns and to provide a continuous technical watch on key subjects for the micro/nanotechnology community; and (2) identify- ing key technologies for industry in order to guide government policy to foster appropriate technologi- cal solutions and inform companies about the future direction of technological changes. \u2022 About supporting policy or strategy development : (1) exploring the possible futures for French agricul- ture by building scenarios; (2) exploring possible futures of French society and the issues that might arise because of an ageing population; (3) obtaining an analysis based on evidence of the socio-economic challenges and trends that will face Europe in the next 10-15 years; and (4) determining how France can dis- tinguish itself and stay among the most competitive and attractive countries through technology. \u2022 About priority setting for S&T: building a clear vision of middle- and long-term issues in the field of trans- port, housing, town planning, to establish priorities and incentives for research programmes. \u2022 About methodology and capacity building : develop- ing, piloting and demonstrating the value of \u2018light\u2019 and flexible regional foresight methods. \u2022 About articulating supply and demand: analysing sup- ply and demand of technologies, and identifying key technologies for France in order to help firms to have a better vision of their technological preferences and to anticipate evolutions to come. \u2022 About public engagement : (1) helping decision-mak- ers in French regions make choices clarifying the regional situation for inhabitants and for the public at large; and (2) reviewing and launching a national debate on the challenges of the French Research and Innovation System.

        "58 Foresight in Germany Our database includes 132 exercises linked to Germany. Of these, 57 cases can be considered fully mapped. Box 4.5 shows that most German projects have time horizons below 20 years. Also interesting is the number of projects with less than a 10-year time hori- zon (40 %). This could be explained by the proportion of subnational exercises in the database (see below). In terms of sponsors , the government is the main sup- porter of foresight (75 %). Sponsors include national and regional bodies such as the Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF); the Bavarian State Ministry of Sciences, Research and the Arts; the gov- ernment of Rheinland-Pfalz; Landkreis L\u00f6bau-Zittau; MFG Stiftung Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg; and companies like Janssen Cilag GmbH and Siemens AG, among others. As for the audiences (users), the figures show that more than 80 % of the studies target government agencies and departments, around 50 % target the business community, around 40 % the research community, and some 15 % of cases target trade bodies and industrial federations, while other actors (e.g. trades unions and intermediary organisations) are targeted in 30 % of the studies. Figures on outputs indicate that policy recommenda- tions lead, followed by the analysis of trends and drivers and scenarios. The territorial scale of the studies is mainly subnational (72 %), with some national cases (17 %) and 11 % supra- national. The most common foresight methods are: literature review; scenarios; Delphi; and other methods (possibly benchmarking, wild cards and patent analysis among others). Popular foresight research areas focus on social sci- ences (especially policy and political science, studies in human society, education and economics) and engi- neering and technology (in particular environmental and civil engineering; and communications technolo- gies, among others). The most targeted socio-economic sectors are edu- cation; health and social work; and transport, storage and communications. Finally, we selected a limited number of objectives and clustered them using the categories presented at the end of Chapter 2: \u2022 About analysing the future potential of technologies: (1) identifying desirable and undesirable impacts of modern biotechnology in the agricultural and food sector in five EU countries; (2) evaluating the poten- tial of decentralised generation technologies in the liberalised European energy markets; and (3) analys- ing the relevance of some applications and innovations of nanotechnology in the health sector. \u2022 About supporting policy or strategy development: (1) assessing science and technology developments in biotechnology as well as the development of framework conditions in food production; (2) ana- lysing the strategies that regions should implement to become future-oriented; (3) promoting strategies for sustainable development in coastal areas by shar- ing experiences; (4) enhancing understanding of the forces (colloquially called \u2018drivers\u2019) shaping the evo- lution of the EU as a Knowledge Society, thus anticipating its potential impact on living conditions. \u2022 About priority setting for S&T: introducing new per- spectives into the research agenda of the Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) by add- ing to the traditional mechanisms for agenda-setting and prioritisation. \u2022 About methodology and capacity building: develop- ing methodologies and tools to assess the impact of flood risk reduction measures and scenarios. \u2022 About public engagement: (1) promoting a broad public discussion on socio-economic future issues; (2) picking up values and ideals of the population and implementing concrete measures in order to over- come gaps due to different mentalities within the country; and (3) studying the impacts of demographic change (i.e. ageing population on economy and soci- ety) and making both population and decision-makers aware of the problems, impacts, challenges and like- lihood of demographic change.

Box 4.6 shows that all the Italian projects we mapped have time horizons below 20 years. In terms of sponsors , the government is the main sup- porter of foresight (80 %). Sponsors include: the Ministry of Defence; the Lombardia Regional Govern- ment; the Milan Regional Government; the Regional Government of Trentino; and the Chamber of Com- merce, among others. As for the audiences (users), the figures show that more than 80 % of the studies target government agencies and departments, around 60 % target the business community, around 60 % target the research community, and some 30 % of cases target trade bod- ies and industrial federations, while other actors (e.g. trades unions and intermediary organisations) are tar- geted in 30 % of studies. Figures on outputs indicate that policy recommenda- tions lead, followed by the analysis of trends and drivers. The territorial scale of the studies is mainly subnational (68 %), with some national cases (9 %) and 23 % supra- national. The most common foresight methods are: literature review; key technologies; expert panels; interviews and brainstorming . What is rather interesting here is the pro- portion of cases using other methods (around 80 %). Unfortunately, the EFMN database cannot provide fur- ther information on these methods. Popular foresight research areas focus on natural sci- ences (especially ICT); social sciences (especially studies in human society, and economics) and engineering and technology (in particular electrical and electronic engi- neering; and interdisciplinary engineering). The most often targeted socio-economic sectors are manufacturing; and public administration and defence. Finally, we selected a limited number of objectives and clustered them using the categories presented at the end of Chapter 2: \u2022 About analysing the future potential of technolo- gies: evaluating the national interest and the scientific and industrial feasibility of developing new emerging technologies in selected areas. \u2022 About supporting policy or strategy development: (1) developing a broad picture of the state-of-the- art of Sicily in terms of knowledge-based economic and technological development; (2) developing a SWOT analysis of the Trentino region, its poten- tial and future vision; and (3) providing formal and informal visions of regional socio-economic devel- opment. \u2022 About network building: identifying objectives, needs and the allocation of funds within the national research plan of the Ministry of Education, universi- ties and research institutions. \u2022 About priority setting for S&T: helping public deci- sion-makers set priorities in a rational way. \u2022 About methodology and capacity building: pro- viding socio-economic perspectives using foresight techniques. \u2022 About articulating supply and demand: (1) looking at the upcoming changes for manufacturing indus- try in various regions in order to prepare SMEs for the future; and (2) identifying a more focused research public policy for large industrial firms, aimed at concentrating funds in the most relevant areas for industrial requirements.

The territorial scale of the studies is mainly national (87 %), with only a few subnational cases (6 %) and 7 % supranational. The most common foresight methods are: literature review; scenarios; expert panels and trend extrapolation . Popular foresight research areas focus on social sci- ences (especially policy and political science, studies in human society, education and economics) and engi- neering and technology (i.e. environmental engineering and communications technologies). The most often targeted socio-economic sectors are health and social work; public administration and defence and electricity, gas and water supply.

Box 4.10 shows that the UK has projects targeting a vari- ety of time horizons , especially beyond 15 years into the future. In terms of sponsors , the government is the main supporter (around 75 %). Sponsors include: the British Council; Defra; the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI); the Department of Transport; the Government Office for Science (former OST); and the UK Royal Acad- emy of Engineers; among others. As for the audiences (users), the figures show that around 90 % of the stud- ies target government agencies and departments, while the research and the business communities are equally targeted by around 60 % of the projects; followed by trade bodies (30 %), and other actors (20 %).

The territorial scale of the studies is mainly national (80 %), with around 15 % of subnational cases and only 5 % supranational studies. Here we should note that EC-funded projects in which the UK has been a major partner or coordinator have not been sufficiently targeted in our mapping. The most common foresight methods are: expert pan- els; literature review; trend extrapolation; scenarios and surveys . Popular foresight research areas focus on engineering and technology (including environmental, manufactur- ing, material and chemical engineering; communications technologies; and industrial biotechnology; among oth- ers) social sciences (especially policy and political science; education; and studies in human society) and natural sci- ences (mainly biological sciences; earth sciences; chemical sciences; and information and communication sciences). As for the socio-economic sectors , our results show that the UK focuses on a wide range of areas, most nota- bly manufacturing; electricity, gas and water supply; and health and social work. Finally, we selected a limited number of objectives and clustered them using the categories presented at the end of Chapter 2: \u2022 About analysing the future potential of technologies: (1) increasing the competitive standing of regional industry and society through improved appreciation, anticipation and exploitation of future developments in science and technology; (2) providing a vision of how S&T advancement may impact on understand- ing of addiction and drug use in the next 20 years; (3) exploring the implications of future science and identifying key drivers and trends in current foresight reports; (4) exploring the implications of future infor- mation technologies in areas such as identity and authenticity, surveillance, system robustness, security and information assurance; and (5) producing a vision for the development of cognitive systems through recent advances in neuroscience, computer science and related fields, and their interaction. \u2022 About supporting policy or strategy development: (1) producing a challenging and long-term (30-100 years) vision for the future of flood and coastal defence; and (2) identifying drivers, issues and tech- nologies associated with key sectors, for example aerospace; packaging; clothing and footwear; transport; building and construction; medical; elec- tronic; etc. \u2022 About network building: creating new productive networks between industry, academia and govern- ment. \u2022 About priority setting for S&T: identifying priorities for public and private R&D spending. \u2022 About methodology and capacity building: (1) iden- tifying where foresight could add the greatest value, and helping generate a foresight culture; and (2) improving Defra\u2019s capacity to identify and pre- pare for new risks and opportunities. \u2022 About articulating supply and demand: identifying key areas of long-term opportunity, assessing these against UK capabilities, and agreeing a plan of action to exploit these areas.

        "72 Types of methods This chapter presents the results of the mapping of foresight methods which, for the purpose of this chap- ter, have been structured around three categories. The first category comprises qualitative methods. These are often used to provide meaning to develop- ments and observations. Such interpretations tend to be based on particular views, beliefs and knowledge which may be difficult to corroborate since methods provide a lot of room for creative and subjective think- ing. In the EFMN mapping, 15 qualitative methods have been included in this category: backcasting; brain- storming; citizen panels; environmental scanning; essays; expert panels; futures workshops; simulation gaming; interviews; literature review (LR); morpho- logical analysis; questionnaires and surveys; relevance trees; scenarios; and SWOT analysis. The second category comprises semi-quantitative methods, applying mathematical principles to quantify the opinions experts for example. The database includes 6 such methods: cross-impact/structural anal- ysis; Delphi surveys; key/critical technologies; multi- criteria analysis; quantitative scenarios/SMIC; stake holder mapping and (technology) roadmapping. The third category of methods comprises quantita- tive techniques. These are often used to monitor measurable variables and apply statistical techniques to process and analyse the often called \u201chard data\u201d or indicators. EFMN mapping considered 3 quantitative methods: bibliometrics; modelling and simulation; and trend extrapolation. Finally, a category labelled \u2018other methods\u2019 was also included in the mapping. This was used when an exer- cise applied methods like benchmarking and patent analysis, for example (Note grey colour in Figure 5.1 ). Figure 5.1: Foresight methods in the Foresight Diamond Source: Popper (2008a) Attributes of methods Another useful way to classify methods is by consider- ing their ability to gather or process information based on evidence, expertise, interaction or creativity . These attributes are the building blocks of the Foresight Dia- mond (see Figure 5.1 above). The reader should note that the attributes are not meant to be exclusive; in fact, they often overlap and combine in different proportions or sequences in each method and so can be regarded as the \u2018genetic\u2019 com- ponents of a method. There can be value in \u2018footprinting\u2019 the components of an activity according to the methods deployed. So, for example, an activity carried out using brainstorming could be estimated to comprise: (cid:129) 10 % expertise + 10 % evidence + 70 % creativity + 10 % interaction While the same activity carried out using trend extrapolation could comprise: (cid:129) 10 % expertise + 70 % evidence + 10 % creativity + 10 % interaction Evidence Creativity E x p e r t i s e I n t e r a c t i on Wild cards Science fictioning Simulation gaming Essays / Scenarios Genius forecast Acting / Role play Backcasting SWOT Brainstorming Relevance trees / Logic diagrams Futures workshops Roadmapping Delphi Surveys Citizen panels Expert panels Morphological analysis Conferences / Workshops Key / Critical technologies Multi-criteria Volting / Polling Quantitative scenarios / SMIC Stakeholders analysis Interviews Cross-impact / Structural analysis Indicators / SA Patent analysis Bibliometrics Benchmarking Extrapolation Scanning Literature review Modelling Qualitative (15) Semi-quantitative (6) Quantitative (3) Other methods (9) EFMN_Mapping_091223.indd 72 EFMN_Mapping_091223.indd 72 22/10/07 11:32 22/10/07 11:32 ",
        "73 Mapping Foresight 5 | Mapping foresight methods Most common methods Having these classifications and attributes in mind will help us present some interesting results based on 886 case studies. Figure 5.2 shows the number of times each method was used. For example, Scenarios was applied 372 times. The results clearly indicate three groups: The widely used methods are literature review, expert panels and scenarios, all of which are qualitative. The category of commonly used methods includes extrapolation/megatrends, futures workshops, brain- storming, other methods, interviews, Delphi, questionnaire/survey, key technologies, scanning, essays and SWOT. The third group includes less frequently used methods, such as roadmapping, modelling and simulation, back- casting, stakeholders mapping, structural analysis, bibliometrics, morphological analysis, citizen panels, relevance trees, multi-criteria analysis and gaming. While the data suggests that this group of methods is rarely used, some figures are lower than might be expected and could possibly be attributed to biases arising from the mapping. For example, methods such as structural analysis and relevance trees have been occasionally applied in Spain and France at the subna- tional level. But because mapping at this level has been weaker than at the national level, thus the data does not do justice to the likely higher frequency of their applications. Box 5.1: Key attributes of foresight methods Creativity refers to the mixture of original and imaginative thinking and is often provided by artists or technology \u2018gurus\u2019, for example. These methods rely heavily on the inventiveness and ingenuity of very skilled individuals, such as science fiction writers or the inspiration that emerges from groups of people involved in brainstorming sessions. Expertise refers to the skills and knowledge of individuals in a particular area or subject and is frequently used to support top-down decisions, provide advice and make recommendations. These methods rely on the tacit knowledge of people with privileged access to relevant information or with accumulated knowledge from several years of working experience in a particular domain area. Interaction recognises that expertise often gains considerably from being brought together and challenged to articulate with other expertise (and indeed with the views of non-expert stakeholders). So, given that foresight studies often take place in societies where democratic ideals are widespread, and legitimacy is normally gained through \u2018bottom-up\u2019 and participatory processes, it is important that they are not just reliant on evidence and expertise. Evidence recognises that it is important to attempt to explain and/or forecast a particular phenomenon with the support of reliable documentation and means of analysis of, for example, statistics and various types of measurement indicators. These activities are particularly helpful for understanding the actual state of development of the research issue.

        "75 Mapping Foresight 5 | Mapping foresight methods Source: Popper (2008b) Average number of methods The above results show that qualitative methods are the most popular ones \u2013 all the top ten methods in use in Europe are qualitative. But this observation also leads to another question: how many methods are used in an \u2018average\u2019 foresight study? Figure 5.3 shows that the average is around five or six methods. However, the variation is high, so it might be concluded that the diversity of methods used is also high. But, these numbers should not be taken for granted. As mentioned above, subnational exercises, for example, tend to use multiple methods in their methodological designs and these have not been well captured in the EFMN database. \u2022 Literature review (LR) represents a key part of scanning processes (see below). Good reviews generally use a discursive writing style and are structured around themes and related theories. \u2022 Expert panels are groups of people dedicated to discussion and analysis, combining their knowledge concerning a given area of interest. They can be local, regional, national or international. Panels are typically organised to bring together \u201clegitimate\u201d expertise, but can also attempt to include creative, imaginative and visionary perspectives. \u2022 Scenarios refer to a wide range of approaches involving the construction and use of scenarios \u2013 more or less systematic and internally consistent visions of plausible future states of affairs. They may be produced by means of deskwork, workshops, or the use of tools such as computer modelling. \u2022 Futures workshops are events lasting from a few hours to a few days, in which there is typically a mix of talks, presentations, and discussions and debates on a particular subject. The events may be more or less highly structured and \u2018scripted\u2019: participants may be assigned specific detailed tasks. \u2022 Brainstorming is a creative and interactive method used in face-to-face and online working sessions to generate new ideas around a specific area of interest. Aiming at removing inhibitions and breaking out of narrow and routine discussions, it allows people to think more freely and move into new areas of thought, and to propose new solutions to problems. \u2022 Trend extrapolation is among the longest-established tools of forecasting. The method provides a rough idea of how past and present developments may look in the future \u2013 assuming, to some extent, that the future is a kind of continuation of the past. There may be large changes, but these are extensions of patterns that have been previously observed. \u2022 Delphi is a well-established technique that involves repeated polling of the same individuals, feeding back (sometimes) anonymised responses from earlier rounds of polling, with the idea that this will allow for better judge- ments to be made without undue influence from forceful or high-status advocates. Delphi surveys are usually con- ducted in two rounds. \u2022 SWOT analysis is a method which first identifies factors internal to the organisation in question (e.g. particular capabilities, brands, etc.) and classifies them in terms of Strengths and Weaknesses. It similarly examines external factors (broader socio-economic and environmental changes, for example, or the behaviour of opponents, competitors, markets, etc.) and presents them in terms of Opportunities and Threats. \u2022 Interviews are often described as \u201cstructured conversa- tions\u201d and are a fundamental tool of social research. In foresight they are often used as formal consultation instru- ments, intended to gather knowledge that is distributed across the range of interviewees. This may be tacit knowl- edge that has not been put into words, or more documented knowledge that is more easily located by discussions with experts and stakeholders than by literature review. Other methods \u2022 Benchmarking is commonly used for marketing and business strategy planning and has recently become more popular in governmental and inter-governmental strategic decision-making processes. It focuses on what others are doing in comparison to what you are doing by comparing similar units of analysis in terms of common indicators (e.g. research capabilities of key sectors, market sizes of industries, etc.). \u2022 Patent analysis often resembles bibliometrics, but uses patents rather than publications as its starting point. It provides strategic intelligence on technologies, and can be used to indicate \u201crevealed competitive advantage\u201d based on leadership in technological development.

        "76 Source: Popper (2008a) Figure 5.4 positions the most commonly used meth- ods inside the Foresight Diamond framework. The shading reflects the ability of methods to gather or process information based on evidence, expertise, inter- action or creativity respectively. The interaction dimension is most closely associated with methods like futures workshops and brainstorming; in addition expert panels are designed to promote participation and inter- action between groups of stakeholders. The \u2018popularity\u2019 of these methods is fifth and sixth in Figure 5.2 whereas an \u2018average\u2019 study may use five or six methods. Allow- ing for data bias, as previously mentioned, we can conclude that the mapped foresight work is aligned with the concepts which are accepted by the community of practitioners. Foresight is seen in this community as a way to encourage more structured debate with wider participation and leading to the shared understanding of long-term issues (Georghiou et al ., 2008). Figure 5.4 shows that most projects using more than five methods tend to select them, albeit unintention- ally, to exploit all four fundamental dimensions or capabilities. We would also like to highlight that the techniques which most exploit the creativity dimension are not commonly used. Such techniques include gaming, the identification of wild cards and weak signals, and the exploitation of science fiction literature. They may only be used infrequently because they are not well sup- ported by conceptual and methodological frameworks. These results allow us to conclude that the influence of the capabilities of methods is high but not balanced. However it would be unrealistic to expect all foresight studies to give an equal weighting to all four vertices of the Diamond.

        "78 The initial question we asked ourselves when we began the mapping of foresight activities was: \u2022 Which research areas and socio-economic sectors can be considered \u2018hot\u2019 or highly targeted in fore- sight work? Over the years hundreds of subjects have been tar- geted. The choice of target tends to depend on and reflect the concerns and interests of sponsors, who \u2013 as shown in Chapter 3 \u2013 are most likely to be from the government. However, governments differ in size and complexity. Thus, foresight can be sponsored by a wide range of actors and studies can be carried out at any level \u2013 local, regional, national or international. The geographical coverage of areas is presented in Chapter 3 ( Figure 3.10 and Figure 3.11 ). Chapter 4 dis- cusses the most common areas covered by ten European countries. The content characteristics of these preferences are indicated using the six aggregated areas of the Frascati taxonomy and the 17 aggregated areas of the NACE taxonomy. While we have commented on popular sub-levels we recognise that the overall aggregation does not provide sufficient information about the real coverage of exercises. The truth is that it has been really difficult to prepare and discuss results using the 490 fields of these classifica- tion systems (224 from Frascati and 266 from NACE). Having this in mind, we have divided this chapter into three major sections: \u2022 The general results section presents major findings about highly aggregated coverage of foresight studies ( Table 6.1 ). \u2022 The analysis of research areas section uses 841 cases to look at the interconnection between 62 research areas. Here we identify knowledge hubs, knowledge junction and key sub-areas . \u2022 The analysis of socio-economic sectors section uses a slightly larger sample (871 cases) to map the inter- connections between 71 sectors . Here we look at foresight on \u2018grand\u2019 economic sectors and we recognise Knowledge Clusters .

        "79 Mapping Foresight 6 | Mapping foresight research areas and sectors General results In total, the EFMN mapped 841 cases against the Frascati taxonomy and 871 cases against the NACE classification. Table 6.1 (above), Figures 6.1 and 6.2 (below) show basic results about highly aggregated areas (N.B. the sum of percentages is higher than 100 and the total sum of cases is higher than 871 because some projects were linked to more than one area or sector). Looking at the results, we can see that Engineering and Technology (44 %), Social Sciences (40 %), Manu- facturing (34 %) and Natural Sciences (32 %) are by far the most popular categories characterising the initia- tives mapped by the EFMN. The second group includes: Electricity, gas and water supply; Health and social work; Transport, storage and communication; Public administration and defence ; Medical Sciences, Agriculture; Education; Fishing; Con- struction ; and Other community, social and personal services activities. Less popular areas in foresight, but still significant, are: Real estate, renting and business activities and Financial intermediation . This is an interesting result (a) given that these two sectors have been seriously shaken by the credit crunch (or credit crisis) and more specifically by the sub-prime housing crisis in the United States and (b) given the severity of the effects on Europe and other regions worldwide. We believe that foresight work in these areas will soon experience considerable growth. Likewise, there are other major challenges related to extra-territorial organisations and bodies which might benefit from foresight activities. These include social, economic, political and environmental challenges. One example might be to inform debates about the future role and relevance of existing security and civil defence systems including international agencies such as the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) and North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO). In addition we can expect more foresight studies to generate visions and recommendations about new organisations, international partnerships and interna- tional or global problems. Defence, energy, security, food, water, pollution, poverty, infectious diseases and other areas provide key opportunities to exploit fore- sight more extensively. We can conclude that it is as important to iden- tify where more foresight work may be needed as it is to map the contemporary \u2018hot\u2019 areas for fore- sight application. There is ample scope to use foresight more widely and effectively in strategic thinking and policy options \u2013 and to consider this was in fact an important part of our initial question. The following two sections will go deeper into the identified \u2018hot\u2019 areas as well as less popular areas. They also identify interesting links and interdependencies. 74 79 213 117 370 335 117 270 213 140 79 132 74 26 0 100 200 300 400 500 600 700 800 900 Humanities Agricultural sciences Medical sciences Natural Sciences Social sciences Engineering and technology Engineering and technology Social sciences Natural sciences Medical sciences Agricultural sciences Humanities Figure 6.1: Mapping interconnections between research areas EFMN_Mapping_091223.indd 79 EFMN_Mapping_091223.indd 79 22/10/07 11:33 22/10/07 11:33 ",

        "81 Mapping Foresight 6 | Mapping foresight research areas and sectors Table 6.2: Proportion of interdependence Analysis of research areas In Figure 6.1 ( above ) and Table 6.2 ( below ) we can see the interconnections and potential interdependencies between the research areas covered by 841 foresight exercises. The results show that while 58% of the Engineering and Technology studies (213 out of 370) are interconnected with areas of Natural Sciences , the proportion of Natu- ral Sciences studies that are interconnected with areas of Engineering and Technology is considerably higher (79 % or 213 out of 270). The pattern is different when we look at the interconnections between Engineering and Technology areas and Social Sciences. They both show interdependencies of similar proportions (32 % versus 35 %). By contrast, projects on Medical Sciences and Agricultural Sciences show high linkages with Engi- neering and Technology areas (56 % each), but only 20 % of Engineering and Technology projects are linked to areas in Medical Sciences and Agricultural Sciences . A not very surprising finding is the low proportion of Engi- neering and Technology studies interconnected with areas of Humanities (5 %). However, it was indeed rather unexpected to find that 65 % of the Humanities studies are linked to Engineering and Technology areas (17 of 26). These results reveal the existence of uneven or asym- metric interconnections between research areas at an aggregated level. However, they do not provide enough information about the lower levels. In order to make sense of the linkages at a much deeper level we decided to borrow visualisation tools traditionally used in Social Network Analysis (SNA). In particular, our aim was to visualise research areas in network maps and to explain and understand more clearly the links between them. We expected this to be useful to pinpoint important issues that the EC may want to consider when designing future policies and which might impact upon the dynamics of know- ledge production in the European Research Area. Figure 6.3 shows the interconnections between 62 research areas (see codes description in Annex 1). Areas often link one to another with different \u2018weight\u2019. The \u2018stronger\u2019 the link that connects two areas, repre- sented by a bolder line, the higher the number of reciprocal reference between those two areas. Simi- larly, the more links a research area gets, the more important it is. For example, in Figure 6.3 : B ( Engineering and Technology ) and E ( Social Sciences ) share a darker and thicker line than the one shared between E ( Social Sciences ) and C ( Medical Sciences ). Here the \u2018weight\u2019 of the lines is consistent with the results presented in Table 6.2 : 32 % of Engineering and technology studies are linked to Social sciences ( B \u2013 E ), while only 22 % of the Social sciences studies are linked to Medical sciences ( E \u2013 C ). Identifying \u2018knowledge hubs\u2019 Figure 6.3 shows very strong linkages between Engineer- ing and Technology, Natural sciences , and Social sciences . These three areas can be considered as the main \u2018 knowl- edge hubs \u2019 of foresight work and these results simply confirm the interdisciplinary nature of foresight. There are less strong linkages between Engineering and Technology studies and the Medical sciences and Agricultural sciences areas. This result has also been captured in Table 6.2 which shows that while 56 % of the projects in Medical sciences and Agricultural sci- ences are linked to Engineering and Technology , these sectors are only targeted by 21 % and 20 % of projects concerned with Engineering and Technology areas.

        "82 Identifying \u2018knowledge junctions\u2019 The interdisciplinary nature of foresight means that foresight projects can be described as \u2018knowledge junction\u2019 between different research areas and sub- areas. With this in mind, we have identified a number of interesting results: (cid:129) First, foresight exercises on A06 ( Biological sci- ence ) often synthesise data from multiple sources, thus creating a very interesting \u2018triangulation effect\u2019. In particular, we can observe two well defined triangles: the first suggests that foresight work in this sub-area is the strongest knowledge junction between Engineering and Technology and Natural sciences ; while the second triangle shows that foresight studies on Biological science provide a less strong but certainly important link between Social sciences and Natural sciences . (cid:129) Second, there are two equally important sub-areas linking the Engineering and Technology and Social Sciences areas : B09 ( Environmental engineering ) and B13 ( Communications technologies ). The importance of these linkages may be obvious for some, but their recognition as fundamental know- ledge junctions in the relationship between Engineering and Technology and Social sciences is a significant result of this report. (cid:129) Third, foresight studies on sub-area C12 ( Public health and Health services ) provide important linkages between Medical sciences and Social sciences. (cid:129) Fourth, foresight work on the sub-area D01 ( Crop and Pasture production ) provides important link- ages between Agricultural sciences and sub-areas of Social sciences on the one hand, and Natural sciences on the other. (cid:129) Last but not least, we would like to highlight the cohesive role of foresight on sub-areas of Social sciences . This is mainly because foresight projects are designed in such a way that, at some time in the process, linkages are established with the pol- icy dimension or (using the Frascati terminology) with sub-area E04 ( Policy and Political science ). Figure 6.3: Mapping linkages between research areas in foresight Source: Popper (2009) EFMN_Mapping_091223.indd 82 EFMN_Mapping_091223.indd 82 22/10/07 11:33 22/10/07 11:33 ",
        "83 Mapping Foresight 6 | Mapping foresight research areas and sectors Recognising \u2018key sub-areas\u2019 Before entering into the \u2018key\u2019 territory we would like to remind the reader that, in our previous analysis ( Figure 6.3 ), research areas were placed in a spatial arrangement showing optimally the relationships between variables. This, which required the definition of correlations among areas and the assignment of scores to each area, facili- tated representation of the degree of correlation with lines of different weights. By contrast, in this section we use network tools in a more \u2018flexible\u2019 way. By flexible we mean \u2018adapted to specific needs\u2019. In other words, instead of creating another fancy (and possibly unreadable!) pic- ture showing the interconnections between 224 variables, we have clustered the six Frascati areas in Figure 6.4 and manually positioned those sub-areas with the highest number of foresight exercises. The methodological impli- cation of our adaptation is that the \u2018spatial arrangement\u2019 (i.e. distance between areas and sub-areas) does not automatically provide meaningful information. However, this information is not relevant for our analysis of key sub- areas. Therefore, we have used network visualisation tools but only to retain the areas and sub-areas that \u2018share\u2019 more than 25 studies in our dataset. Moving to Figure 6.4 , we have used red lines to show interconnections among the six main areas and the link- ages between areas and the \u2018key\u2019 sub-areas, while the black line only shows the linkages among sub-areas. This analysis leads us to a number of interesting results. (cid:129) First, nearly all the sub-areas in Natural Sciences are well interconnected. These include A02 (Infor- mation, computing and communication science); A03 (Physical Science); A04 (Chemical Science); A05 (Earth Sciences); and A06 (Biological Sciences). The \u2018key\u2019 ones are A04 and A06. We did not find much work on Mathematical Sciences (A01). Does this show a weakness of European science in this area? Or a lack of foresight about opportunities and threats that innovations here may bring to Europe and the world? (cid:129) Second, most sub-areas in Engineering and Tech- nology are well interconnected. However seven of those can be labelled as \u2018key\u2019: B02 (Industrial Bio- technology and Food Sciences); B04 (Manufacturing Eng.), B09 (Environmental Eng.), B10 (Materials Eng.), B11 (Biomedical Eng.), B12 (Electrical and Electronic Eng.), and B13 (Communication Technologies).

        "84 (cid:129) Third, only three of the fifteen sub-areas in Medical Sciences are considered \u2018key\u2019. These are: C01 (Medicine general); C05 (Pharmacology and Phar- maceutical Sciences); and C12 (Public Health and Health Services). There are two other areas which we did not include in the figure, given that our data- base has less than 25 studies on these sub-areas. These are C03 (Medical Biochemistry and Clinical Chemistry) and C04 (Medical Microbiology). They both have significant links with the Engineering and Technology and Natural Sciences areas. (cid:129) Fourth, Agricultural Sciences as an area seems to have several connections with Social Sciences and Engineering and Technology. Although weakly connected (in various weights), only one of the eight sub-areas (Crop and Pasture Production) has a salient link to other sub-areas, i.e. A06 and E04. (cid:129) Fifth, almost all of the Social Sciences areas seem to be interconnected with most areas. Except for E06 (Behavioural and Cognitive Sciences) and E07 (Law, Justice and Law Enforcement), all topics are highly interconnected. Research topics within Social Sci- ences also share equally important connections with other research topics within Agricultural Sciences, Medical Sciences, Engineering and Technology, Nat- ural Sciences and Humanities. In a way, research in Social Sciences is the \u2018binder\u2019 of all research topics in the foresight exercises. This is quite the opposite with research within Humanities, which have the least sali- ent links to other research topics in the exercise. \u00a9 V a n P a r y s M e d i a EFMN_Mapping_091223.indd 84 EFMN_Mapping_091223.indd 84 22/10/07 11:33 22/10/07 11:33 ",
        "85 Mapping Foresight 6 | Mapping foresight research areas and sectors Analysis of socio-economic sectors Could the global financial crisis or the 2008 US housing and credit crisis have been prevented? Maybe\u2026 Maybe not! But we would have certainly been better prepared to deal with such events if \u2018better\u2019 fore- sight had been the norm in the Financial intermediation (J) and Real estate, renting and business activities (K) sectors. Because these two sectors are services, we decided to devote this section to the analysis of fore- sight activities in the so called \u2018grand\u2019 economic sectors: the primary, secondary and tertiary sectors. Mapping \u2018grand\u2019 economic sectors Figure 6.5 presents the proportion of foresight work carried out in each \u2018grand\u2019 economic sector. The pic- ture shows a clear message: \u2018 Foresight on Services \u2019 is really dominant! Figure 6.5: Foresight on \u2018grand\u2019 sectors Primary Sector Foresight 15% Tertiary Sector Foresight 54% Secondary Sector Foresight 31% Table 6.3 shows the overall results for the Primary Sec- tor . We can see that slightly more than half of the mapped activities are focused on Agriculture, hunting and forestry . But the figures are not surprising. If we look, for example, at the Eurostat figures for employ- ment in Agro, we can see that the number of workers is five times higher than in the Fishing and Mining sec- tors combined, and the gross value added (GVA) almost twice as high. Therefore, we believe that the existing Agro-bias in primary sector foresight is mod- est and reasonable. Table 6.3: Primary Sector Foresight Primary Sector Cases % A Agriculture, hunting and forestry 167 53 % B Fishing 101 32 % C Mining and quarrying 45 14 % Table 6.4 shows the overall results for the Secondary Sector . We can see a similar pattern here. This time nearly half of the studies are focused on Manufactur- ing . Such figures are reasonable given the primary importance of the sector in this group \u2013 it accounts for almost 20 % of employment in the EU27, and is also the second largest contributor in terms of GVA. However, we were not expecting such a low number of studies on the Construction sector, mainly for two reasons: (cid:129) First, the figures do not reflect the importance of this sector in terms of employment and GVA; and (cid:129) Second, this sector has some special characteristics. Trends show an escalation of knowledge-intensive activities in the sector (e.g. integrating ICT systems and digitalisation into parts of the construction process). This may explain why our cluster analysis results (see \u2018Knowledge Clusters\u2019 section below) \u2013 and recent studies of Australian scholar Perry Forsythe (2008) \u2013 suggest that the Construction sector should be considered a service industry. But given that most literature refers to it as a second- ary sector, we have left it as such in this section. Nevertheless, in the next section we included Con- struction within the Knowledge-Intensive Private Services cluster. Similarly, growing concern about the energy market, and in particular Europe\u2019s increasing efforts to promote renewable energies and to address the technical and socio-economic challenges of water distribution, may explain why there has been such a large number of foresight initiatives favouring research on the Electric- ity, gas and water supply sector. Table 6.5 shows the results for the Tertiary Sector . We see that 68 % of the studies target four sectors: Health and social work (22 %); Transport, storage and communication (18 %); Public administration and defence (16 %); and Education (6 %). The remaining 32 % is shared between seven sectors. EFMN_Mapping_091223.indd 85 EFMN_Mapping_091223.indd 85 22/10/07 11:33 22/10/07 11:33 ",
        "86 This uneven \u2018distribution\u2019 of foresight in the services sec- tor becomes apparent when we look at the low proportion of studies in two sectors recently branded in the 2008 Eurostat Regional Yearbook as \u201cthe most important\u201d for the growth of the EU economy: Real estate, renting and business activities ( K ) and Wholesale and retail trade ( G ). The Eurostat report also highlights the fact that K contributes more than 20 % of the total GVA created in the EU27 and is responsible for 12 % of total employment, thus showing an extremely high GVA per person employed. By contrast, the same report states that G is the second most important sector in terms of employment, covering 15 % of employment. This sector\u2019s share of GVA, at 11 %, is considerably lower than its share in employment, leading to a GVA per per- son employed of 75 % of the average for all sectors. Now, looking back at the proportion of studies research- ing the future of sectors K and G , we can indeed conclude that (1) the foresight coverage of these sectors does not do justice to their significance for Europe and (2) the com- plexity of issues characterising these sectors (for example, productivity per capita) may well be good subjects for futures research. Recognising \u2018Knowledge Clusters\u2019 Let us briefly highlight two interesting findings from the use of network visualisation tools (see Figure 6.7 ). The first result is that Manufacturing should be con- sidered a \u2018 critical sector \u2019, given that changes here would have an important influence on most socio-eco- nomic sectors. This can be observed in the number and the strength of the linkages that this sector shares with others. The second result is the recognition of three distinctive Knowledge Clusters : (cid:129) Engineering Intensive Industries (EII), including: Manufacturing; Transport, storage and communi- cation ; and Electricity, gas and water supply . (cid:129) Knowledge-Intensive Public Services (KIPubS) sectors, such as: Public administration and defence ; Education ; and Health and social work . (cid:129) Knowledge-Intensive Private Services (KIPriS) sectors: Construction; Financial intermediation ; and Real estate, renting and business activities . These Knowledge Clusters are virtual environments created by a significant number of research projects associated with complex cognitive processes (including exploration, interpretation and reasoning) and regular exchanges of knowledge about key issues shaping the future of two or more socio-economic sectors.

        "90 This chapter presents an analysis of 559 recommenda- tions resulting from a sample of 83 foresight panels and task forces. The main purpose of this analysis is to meas- ure the extent to which panels of foresight exercises conducted at different territorial levels (national, subna- tional, and supranational) lead to particular types of recommendations. But given their action- orientation, foresight panels often (though not always) explicitly make recommendations in the light of their analyses and deliberations, most of which are targeted at actors in international, national and regional innovation systems. Even where recommendations are not stated explicitly, often they can be detected implicitly. For the purposes of the current analysis, it is important to be clear as to what is meant by \u2018recommendations\u2019, otherwise confusion could result. Points to bear in mind include: (cid:129) Recommendations are not the same as \u2018priorities\u2019. The latter refers to topics and areas that have been identified as important. By contrast, recommenda- tions refer to actions that should be taken to address priorities. Care should therefore be taken not to con- fuse the two. (cid:129) Recommendations also tend to be wide-ranging in terms of what they cover and who they target. Pol- icy recommendations are normally directed at the likes of ministries and other funding agencies, but recommendations from foresight panels and task forces often tend to be broader in scope and refer to a wider group of targets, including companies and researchers, for example. So mapping efforts have to be focused upon a broader set of recommenda- tions than those that simply refer to public policies. Taxonomy of recommendations With the aforementioned points in mind, we identified twelve types of recommendations: Policy shift : refers to shifts in public policy recom- mended by a foresight exercise. This could include a very wide range of topics, essentially covering all areas of public policy. Note that we mean \u2018policy\u2019 rather than \u2018programmatic\u2019 shifts, i.e. the recommendation should refer to a shift at a higher strategic level than simply programme planning, e.g. to include regulation and legislation. Creation of a new initiative (e.g. project/program me/ strategy/discussion forum) : the es ta blish ment of new initiatives in response to the findings of a foresight exer- cise. This will certainly include things like new (research) projects and programmes, but might also cover the estab- lishment of new working groups, committees, associations and networks, and other similar hybrid fora. Incorporation of findings into ongoing debates and strategies : recommendations that specify the use of foresight results in defined policy and existing deci- sion-making processes. For example, this category might include recommendations to include foresight results in ongoing policy reviews or to integrate results into strat- egy documents. Private sector and NGO action : actions that should be taken by the private and NGO sectors in the light of the priorities identified in a foresight exercise. A wide variety of actions are possible, including new invest- ments in technologies, and the development of new services to meet emerging needs. Further research : situations where a foresight exercise makes a general call for further research in a particular area without specifying the need for new projects or centres. Human resource development : initiatives to enhance development of human resources, particularly through education and training. Improved academia-industry links : the improvement of academia-industry links, for example, through greater R&D collaboration, joint training schemes, and so on. Increased public spending : the need for increases in public spending in areas identified in a foresight exercise. Applies in situations where spending increases are proposed without specifying the need for new projects or centres. Greater cooperation, including international cooperation : calls for greater cooperation between actors in the innovation system around the priorities EFMN_Mapping_091223.indd 90 EFMN_Mapping_091223.indd 90 22/10/07 11:33 22/10/07 11:33 ",
        "91 Mapping Foresight 7 | Mapping foresight recommendations and issues highlighted by a foresight exercise. Also refers to calls for greater international cooperation. Establishment of new centre : the setting-up of a new group or institute dedicated to addressing priorities identified in a foresight exercise. This can be either a bricks-and-mortar or a virtual centre. Further foresight : the need for further foresight exer- cises, possibly at different locations or levels, but also in the future. Dissemination of findings : concrete proposals for dis- seminating the findings of a foresight exercise to various groups and communities. The data used for this analysis has been collected from 83 panels and task forces, in most cases associated with \u2018flagship\u2019 national programmes in 15 countries (see Figure 7.1 ). Such large-scale programmes are often col- lections of smaller foresight \u2018exercises\u2019, with \u2018panels\u2019 or task forces focused upon a particular sector or topic. For the purpose of our analysis, these \u2018panels\u2019 are treated as distinct exercises, which they often are (for example, national foresight programmes carried out in Denmark, Germany, Spain and the UK are \u2018rolling\u2019 exercises, in that they constitute a series of exercises focused upon differ- ent topics at different times). Many of the selected panels or exercises have been recently completed, although a small number are more than five years old (e.g. the Hungarian Foresight Pro- gramme completed in 2000). Recommendations from Greece, for instance, are based on the results of 12 pan- els of the national foresight programme: agricultural development and fishery; biotechnology; culture; defence technologies; energy; environment; governance and e-Government; industrial production and manufac- turing; information, technology, communications and e-Business; materials; tourism and transport. The total number of recommendations per country is shown in Figure 7.2 below. More than 50 recommenda- tions have been collected from four countries: Finland, Spain, Portugal, and Hungary. A second group of coun- tries (Denmark, Germany, France, Austria, UK and Ireland) has between 20 to 50 recommendations mapped. The remainder have less than 20 recommendations mapped.

        "92 General analysis Following the proposed taxonomy, Figure 7.3 below shows that recommendations calling for policy shifts , together with those that call for the creation of new projects, programmes, strategies or fora are the most common. A second group of recommendations, each with 50-70 proposals includes the incorporation of foresight findings into ongoing debates and strategies ; suggested actions for the private sector a nd non-governmental organisa- tions to follow , and the need for further research. A third group (each with 30-40 suggestions) includes the development of human resources, improvement in academia-industry links, increases in public spending and greater cooperation across the innovation system (including international cooperation). A few points are worth highlighting here: (cid:129) First, of the recommendations calling for greater cooperation, very few refer to international coop- eration but instead point to the need for greater cooperation between different areas of science, dif- ferent regions in a country, different industrial sectors, and so on. (cid:129) Secondly, taken together with the figures for improved academia-industry links, calls for improved coopera- tion between innovation system actors constitute an important concern for foresight exercises. A final group of recommendations (i.e. establishment of new centres, further foresight, and the dissemina- tion of foresight findings) represents a very small proportion of the total. Here we should mention that recommendations about the dissemination of findings and calls for further foresight often come from outside the panels and task forces. Thus the low figures may be due to our own mapping procedures.

        "93 Mapping Foresight 7 | Mapping foresight recommendations Territorial analysis The consideration of the territorial scope of an exercise is particularly important when drawing conclusions about recommendations. The following analysis sup- ports this argument by comparing the most common types of recommendations at different levels (national, subnational and supranational). Since most of the recommendations in this study come from national exercises, it is to be expected that this bias will be reflected in the territorial level distribution. This argument is further supported by considering the subnational cases, where the majority of recommen- dations refer to the subnational level. Given the low number of supranational (including EU) level exercises in our sample, it is hardly surprising to see so few recommendations addressing these two levels. With these points in mind, Figure 7.4 shows the distribu- tion of recommendations around the twelve typologies. The position of the types of recommendations reflects the overall ranking resulting from the general analysis above. Not surprisingly, we see that the distribution of the national recommendations across the twelve typologies indicates a practically identical sequence to the one of general results above (note that they account for 84 % of the sample). Interestingly, the results show that policy shift and new initiatives are \u2018equally\u2019 impor- tant types of recommendations at this level (85 in each grouping). Another significant type is further research, which represents the third most important group. The subnational recommendations show a different distribution pattern with private sector and NGO action as the most common type, followed closely by the cre- ation of new initiates, policy shift and human resource development , while further research, dissemination of findings and increasing public spending show little or no presence in the selected subnational exercises. The supranational recommendations show the incor- poration of findings in debates and strategies, policy shifts and the creation of new initiatives as the three dominant groups followed by increased public spend- ing, human resource development and improved academia-industry links.

        "95 Mapping Foresight 7 | Mapping foresight recommendations EU level recommendations Although few in number, it is nevertheless interesting to consider more closely the recommendations that refer to the European level. To begin with Table 7.1 (above), which shows the countries originating EU-level recommendations, is dominated by Portugal (8 of 21). These recommendations come from various compo- nents of the Portuguese technology foresight exercise carried out in 2000-01. Somewhat further behind are the figures for Spain, France, and Ireland. It would be easy to jump to conclusions here: with its relatively underdeveloped research and innovation sys- tem, Portugal has been a major beneficiary of the Framework Programmes and other European funding schemes. Thus, it is perhaps of little surprise to see the European dimension featured so prominently in the rec- ommendations of its national technology foresight programme. In this respect, it will be interesting to ana- lyse the data for Greece \u2013 which has been in a similar situation \u2013 to see whether this hypothesis holds. How- ever, the data is not as startling as it first seems when we consider the proportion (as opposed to the actual numbers) of recommendations from the different coun- tries that refer to the European dimension. Portugal still comes out on top, with 8 of 64 recommendations at the European level. But it is closely followed by France (3 of 33), Czech Republic (1 of 10), Ireland (2 of 24), Spain (3 of 68) and the UK (2 of 48). We can also consider the types of recommendations that refer to the European level \u2013 though as highlighted above, the small numbers involved should be borne in mind. The table shows the distribution of recommen- dations across types, with policy shift accounting for almost a third of the total. Half as many recommenda- tions refer to each of two needs: greater (international) cooperation and incorporation of findings into debates and strategies. It is often difficult to understand the meaning that lies behind some recommendations when they are taken out of context \u2013 for example, what is meant by \u201cfulfil European research policy\u201d could imply radically differ- ent things in the context, say, of discussions about overall R&D expenditure or discussions about conver- gent technologies. But the broad picture is that five recommendations refer to European-level R&D and innovation policies, whilst nine recommendations refer to other aspects of European cooperation and regula- tion (concerning areas like transport, agriculture, trade, etc.). These numbers are very low, particularly for R&D and innovation, even if we accept the argument above regarding the national framing of foresight exercises. It is almost as if the Framework Programme does not exist. How to explain and address this, if at all? Addressing the EU dimension The first question to ask is whether the figures above really indicate a problem that needs to be addressed? If it is felt that there is indeed a problem, then how to go about solving it? We will deal with each of these questions in turn. As we have seen, of 559 recommendations, only five clearly refer to R&D and innovation actions to be taken at the EU level \u2013 about one per cent of all recommen- dations. This low number is well below the proportion of public funding made available for R&D through the Framework Programmes. Such figures would seem to suggest that recent efforts to establish a European Research Area (ERA) have had little impact on the mapped foresight exercises. Foresight exercises should be pointing to areas where future developments \u2013 and formulating future visions around which agendas are or should be set \u2013 will be important. Should we be surprised or concerned that so few of their recommendations address the European dimension? At this point, it is perhaps worth considering the signif- icance of foresight exercises in national and regional R&D and innovation landscapes. Whilst more research is undoubtedly needed on their role and impacts, it is known that they can and do have impacts on spending priorities, on agenda-formation, and on the networking of disparate actors into new working communities. Nevertheless, it is all too easy to overestimate the effects of these exercises, particularly when you con- sider the rhetoric surrounding some of them. Closer examination shows that their impact on research and EFMN_Mapping_091223.indd 95 EFMN_Mapping_091223.indd 95 22/10/07 11:33 22/10/07 11:33 ",
        "96 innovation systems is typically rather marginal, and they tend to lead to incremental, evolutionary changes, often at the edges. This is not to cast doubt on their value. Foresight exer- cises can and do play an important role in highlighting cross-cutting opportunities that are often missed in the compartmentalised worlds of disciplinary science, socio- economic sectors, and administrative bureaucracy. But to claim that they sit centre-stage in research and inno- vation systems is, in most instances, wishful thinking. Furthermore, it could be argued that myopia where the European dimension is concerned is hardly unex- pected, given that national and subnational exercises are typically framed in such a way as to address local- ised settings, while EU exercises are likely to give greater emphasis to the EU level. Since problems and solutions match the territorial lev- els in which exercises are being carried out, it would be unrealistic to expect another territorial level to fea- ture prominently, unless deliberate efforts were made to cover it. In practice, EU funding is complementary to national sources of funding, particularly in the big- spending science countries. It is therefore natural for recommendations to focus mostly upon the national level where there are more resources to bid for. Most recommendations made in national or regional foresight exercises are considered achievable in the short-to-medium term and tend to be within the power of local actors to implement. Actions to be taken at the EU level or in coordination with other countries often fall outside this definition. Thus, recommenda- tions difficult to enact locally are rarely made, unless it is obvious or inevitable that another (often higher) pol- icy level must be the source of action and change. The bulk of research and innovation system support available at EU level is restricted to research funding, with some further support for networks and mobility. Our data showed that recommendations that call for new research funding account for only 10 per cent of the total mapped. Therefore, if the scope for action at the EU level is largely limited to research funding, it should hardly be surprising to find so few recommendations referring to this level. There is simply much more scope for shaping policies, programmes, and even institutions at national and regional levels than at the European level. Thus, there are some powerful arguments why the European dimension is not very evident in the recom- mendations of national and regional foresight exercises. While some of these reflect factors that are difficult for the EC to address, some might be tackled. For example, the EC could encourage national govern- ments to incorporate a European dimension into their national exercises \u2013 the ForSociety ERA-Net has been attempting to do this, to some extent. The EC could also provide useful information resources for national or regional foresight exercises to use \u2013 for example, databases of megatrends or wildcards \u2013 and these could reflect a European flavour (though they would need to retain national relevance!). Another option would be for the EC to carry out its own foresight exercises that address issues at the Euro- pean level. If done well, these would not only inform EU policy, but could also provide information inputs for national and regional foresight exercises (such a phenomenon is already apparent in subnational exer- cises that often make use of the tools and results of national exercises). These and other ideas would need to be discussed fur- ther with the foresight community in Europe. But they would be unlikely to overcome all the structural fac- tors, highlighted above, that underpin myopia about the European dimension.

        "98 This final mapping report has shown the potential of monitoring the way in which we navigate into the future. The large amount of foresight initiatives collected and mapped, and the quality of the data that has been examined, have allowed us to undertake more interest- ing comparisons of the main practices and outputs. We have also learned from the difficulties of covering so many world regions; even within Europe the infor- mation base should be broadened. The experience shows that more initiatives can be identified by the map- ping team, but also that another strategy of developing a \u2018wiki-mapping\u2019 environment could be valuable. With this in mind, we would like to reflect on the purpose and style of future mapping activities. First, it is important to develop distinctive mapping protocols to monitor foresight practices, outcome and players . Our work within the EFMN has been mainly focused on the first (practices). Yes, we have developed an indicator to map codified outputs and we have had an open-ended category where contrib- utors could include policy impacts, results and limitations of the studies. But this was not always cap- tured and, from our own experience as practitioners and evaluators of national foresight programmes, we believe that the mapping of foresight outcomes should also try to capture the process benefits, such as the number of new networks, new working and decision- making procedures, new skills and capabilities in dealing with uncertain and longer-term issues, and other factors. Therefore, any similar initiative should try to explore new and better ways of mapping foresight players and their competences (including major stake- holders, sponsors, project coordinators, work package leaders, panel members, sub-contractors, practition- ers, thematic and methodological experts, etc.). Second, the mapping should be able to analyse key features and findings of foresight exercises . We have used a set of generic indicators which have helped us to recognise the depth and density of the waters in which we navigate, but so far we are not able to per- form more rigorous meta-analysis of the data, because we need more relevant, powerful and user-friendly IT infrastructures to capture key features and findings. Third, we need to put in place an interactive Map- ping Environment capable of user-friendly data input, validation and analyses . As the reader of this report can see, we managed to collect over 2000 exer- cises and more than half have been fully mapped. This is good for the purposes of this report but it raises ques- tions about if and how to fully characterise all the initiatives and how to cope with an increasing number of future initiatives? Or, another valid question, are these really foresight exercises or just foresight-like projects? Should we bother about these conceptual definitions? If so, how can we better filter and validate the data. Furthermore, the different ways in which this mapping information might be used suggests the need to develop an information system that can be customised. This leads us to our fourth lesson for the future. We need to provide a common space to share and discuss foresight findings and documents . This space could be the same mapping infrastructure, in which case it is likely to be best served by a wiki-type platform. Alter- natively, the mapping activity should explore the possibility of engaging real foresight players (i.e. spon- sors and project leaders) in workshops to discuss the pro\u2019s and con\u2019s of ongoing foresight processes. Such a face-to-face forum would also play a key role in build- ing and strengthening foresight capacities, as well as expanding the space for mutual learning (something which the EC has been trying to promote via an elec- tronic format within the ForLearn initiative). Fifth, any future EC-funded foresight mapping initiative should try to link up with other EC projects and net- works, such as the ERAWATCH . The EFMN has benefited from similar associations with ongoing initia- tives and networks such as ForSociety, the biannual FTA conference, the SELF-RULE network, among others. The regular exchange of information and support that the EFMN mapping has received from the more than 200 Cor- respondents shows that \u2018voluntary commitment\u2019 can be achieved if the contribution is later on rewarded with informative reports such the ones prepared by the EFMN. Finally, future mapping efforts should try to generate more appealing and up-to-date information about practices and findings for different readerships . This could be achieved through the exploitation of the Internet and web 2.0 tools aimed at creating an inter- active space for different stakeholders\u2019 involvement.

        "125 Mapping Foresight 10 | Annexes Annex 5: The foresight ark The image above, which resembles a boat, shows a fascinating result of the use of network visualisation tools to interconnect 871 \u2018fully-mapped\u2019 exercises. To use a metaphor, the image could well be described as a \u201cforesight ark\u201d revealing how Europe and other world regions navigate into the future. In fact, to be more precise, it shows the \u2018big picture\u2019 of the type of futures research captured by the mapping activity. The nodes represent the socio-economic sectors used in the EU\u2019s NACE taxonomy, while the links represent the interconnections that the mapped exercises have with these sectors.
