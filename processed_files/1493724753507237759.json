        "Country of origin information report | Somalia: Key socio-economic indicators 8 Introduction The purpose of this report is to provide relevant context information in view of the assessment of international protection status determination, including refugee status and subsidiary protection. Among others, the report is intended to inform the development of Country Guidance on Somalia (2022). The report provides background information and details on key socio-economic indicators in three Somali cities, namely Mogadishu, Garowe, and Hargeisa. These represent the main urban centres in Somalia, including Puntland and Somaliland. The report builds upon the preceding EASO COI report on Somalia: Actors (July 2021) and belongs to the same Somalia COI project along with the EASO COI report on Somalia: Targeted profiles and EASO \u2019s COI report on Somalia: Security situation (September 2021). This report provides an overview as well as details about demographic/clan composition, humanitarian issues, mobility and accessibility, socio-economic indicators, and social-protection networks in the above-mentioned cities. Methodology The reference period is from 1 January 2020 to 30 June 2021. The information gathered is a result of research using public, specialised paper-based and electronic sources until 30 July 2021. Some limited additional information was added during the finalisation of this report in response to feedback received during the quality control process, until 13 August 2021. This report is produced in line with the EASO COI Report Methodology (2019) 2 and the EASO COI Writing and Referencing Style Guide (2019). 3 Defining the terms of reference The terms of reference of this report build on the input received from policy experts from EU+ countries 4 within the context of country guidance development on Somalia. Terms of reference for this report can be found in Annex 2. Collecting information The information gathered results from two main sets of sources: on the one hand extensive desk research using predominantly public, specialised paper-based, and electronic sources until 13 August 2021; on the other hand on a number of oral sources and experts interviews that were conducted for the purposes of the report between 23 June and 29 July 2021. All these sources, including when restricted or non-public information has been used to cover specific details, were duly referenced and described. 2 EASO, EASO Country of Origin Information (COI) Report Methodology, June 2019, url 3 EASO, Writing and Referencing Guide for EASO Country of Origin Information (COI) Reports, June 2019, url 4 EU Member States plus Norway and Switzerland ",

Wherever information could not be found within the timeframes for drafting this report after carefully consulting a range of sources, this is stated in the report. The main sources consulted are included in the bibliography. Quality control To ensure that the authors respected the EASO COI Report Methodology and that the Terms of Reference were comprehensively addressed, a review was carried out by COI specialists from the countries and organisations listed as reviewers in the Acknowledgements section. All comments made by the reviewers were taken into consideration and almost all of them were implemented in the final draft of this report, which was finalised on 13 August 2021. EASO also performed the final quality review and editing of the text. Sources In accordance with EASO COI methodology, a range of different published documentary sources have been consulted on relevant topics for this report. These include: COI reports by governments; national and international think tank reports and specialised sources covering Somalia; information from civil society, humanitarian organisations, and NGOs; international and NGO human rights reports; reports produced by various bodies of the United Nations; Somali and regionally-based media; academic publications and books. At the same time the report relies extensively on experts interviews that were carried out for the purpose of the report between 23 June and 29 July 2021 (see the Bibliography for additional details). Structure and use of the report The report is divided into three parts, each one of them addressing specifically the socio-economic situation in the three selected Somali cities: Mogadishu, Garowe, and Hargeisa. Each part provides an overview as well as details about demographic/clan composition, humanitarian issues, mobility and accessibility, socio-economic indicators, and social-protection networks in the above-mentioned cities. Note on Transliteration A national orthography for the Somali language was codified relatively late by adopting a Latin script (21 October 1972). Nevertheless, even today, Somali lacks a commonly applied and binding orthography. In this text, Somali places, clans and personal names usually follow Somali orthography: \u2018 long vowels are indicated by doubling them \u2019 , as in Darood or Abbaan , \u2018the Latin \u2018c\u2019 stands for a sound close to the Arabic \u0639 (ayn), while \u201c x \u201d denotes the strongly aspirated \u062d (ha) \u2019. 5 However, given the fact that other sources adopt different conventions, the reader will sometimes find other forms of places, clans, and personal names in the text, including where direct citations are used or in references. 5 Hoehne M., Between Somaliland and Puntland, 2015, url , p. 7 ",

Mogadishu 1.1 Mogadishu\u2019s overview Mogadishu is the capital city of both Somalia and the administrative region of Benadir (Banadir) and covers the same territory. 7 The terms \u2018Municipality of Mogadishu and Benadir Regional Administration are used interchangeably\u2019. 8 The city is divided into 17 districts. 9 A reference map of the Benadir region dated March 2012 published by the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (UNOCHA) lists the following 16 districts: Dharkeynley, Deyninle, Hodan, Wadajir (Medina), Waberi, Hawl-Wadag, Wardhigley (renamed as Warta Nabadda) 10 , Yaqshid, Bondhere, Hamar Jajab, Hamar- Weyne, Shingani, Shibis, Abdi-Aziz, Huriwa and Karan. 11 Kaxda (Kahda) district was formed in 2012 and became Mogadishu\u2019s seventeenth district. 12 The mayor of Mogadishu is also the governor of the Benadir Regional Administration. 13 As of May 2021, these positions are held by Omar Filish. 14 For further general information on Benadir and Mogadishu, on relevant dynamics and the governance structure, please see sections 7.3 and 7.3.1 of EASO\u2019s COI report Somalia: Actors, published in July 2021. 1.1.1 Demographics and clan composition/distribution 1.1.1.1 Population In 1975 Somalia conducted its first population and housing census, publishing fragmented results. The findings from the following census, carried out in 1986, were not published officially, \u2018as they were considered to suffer from significant biases\u2019. 15 Owing to the unfolding civil war and state decay in 1991 16 , no subsequent census was conducted. In 2014, the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) and the Ministry of Planning published the Population Estimation Survey of Somalia (PESS), the most recent nationwide population estimation. 17 The survey estimated the total population at 12 316 895 18 and noted that the population was growing relatively fast. 19 7 Global Shelter Cluster, Ababa - Overview, June 2021, url; BRA, About Benaadir, n.d., url 8 Somalia, MPWR, RAP Ex-Post Audit Report For Sharif Abow Road: Shangani District, Mogadishu, 3 February 2021, url, p. 1, footnote 2 9 Global Shelter Cluster, Banadir - Overview, June 2021, url 10 AMISOM, Somali district name changed to symbolize peace [source: Radio Bar-kulan], 9 April 2012, url; some sources still refer to the district as Wardhigley, e.g. Global Shelter Cluster, Banadir - Overview, June 2021, url 11 UNOCHA, Banadir Region - Mogadishu City [Map], 16 March 2012, url 12 Bonnet, C. et al., Inclusive Shelter Provision in Mogadishu, 28 July 2020, url, p. 457 13 Somalia, MPWR, RAP Ex-Post Audit Report For Sharif Abow Road: Shangani District, Mogadishu, 3 February 2021, url, p. 1, footnote 2; RVI and HIPS, Land Matters in Mogadishu - Settlement, ownership and displacement in a contested city, February 2017, url, p. 8, footnote 5 14 East African (The), Somalia election certain, now the focus is women seats, security, 31 May 2021, url 15 Somalia and UNFPA, The Somali Health and Demographic Survey 2020, April 2020, url, p. 2 16 Bakonyi, J., telephone interview, 13 July 2021.

        "Country of origin information report | Somalia: Key socio-economic indicators 12 According to a World Bank report published in 2021, existing population numbers were \u2018the result of projections or estimations, both of which suffer from large error margins given the scale of uncertainty regarding population movements.\u2019 20 The PESS of 2014 estimated the population of the Benadir region at 1 650 227, including 369 288 IDPs. 21 49.3 % of the non-IDP population was male, while 50.7 % was female. 22 The above-mentioned 2021 World Bank report noted that Mogadishu had a population \u2018between 1.7 million and 2.6 million people, depending on estimates\u2019. 23 According to UN d ata referring to \u2018the urban agglomeration\u2019 of the capital city, Mogadishu\u2019s population numbered 2 179 900 as of 2019 24 , while the CIA World Factbook lists 2 388 000 people as Mogadishu\u2019s inhabitants as of 2021. 25 As of 2016, \u2018at least 400,000 IDPs lived in Mogadishu, 55 percent of whom lived in Daynile and Kaxda on the city outskirts.\u2019 26 According to the UNHCR Operational Data Portal as of 9 April 2020 Mogadishu\u2019s IDP population at sites assessed by the Global Camp Coordination and Camp Management (CCCM) Cluster 27 was estimated to be 497 000 persons. 28 An overview on the website of the Global Shelter Cluster notes that \u2018estimates of IDPs in Mogadishu range between 500,000 and 700,000\u2019. 29 1.1.1.2 Religion The majorit y of the population of Somalia is Sunni Muslim, traditionally following the Shafi\u2019i school of jurisprudence and practicing Sufism. 30 However, before the civil war, most other Islamic schools of thought also existed in the country. 31 Non-Islamic religious groups combined are estimated to constitute less than one percent of the population. 32 In April 2021 Vatican News published an articl e mentioning \u2018a very small Christian community which [\u2026] continues to move forward with its faith.\u2019 33 WorldAtlas mentioned in 2018 a small Christian community of approximately 1 000 persons. 34 Bishop Giorgio Bertin, the Apostolic Administrator of Mogadishu and president of Caritas Somalia 35 , leads the community.

        "Country of origin information report | Somalia: Key socio-economic indicators 13 Traditionally, the majority of Somalis were organised in Sufi orders. 37 However, since the 1970s the Salafi schools of thought gained prominence. 38 Some Salafi groups (like Al-Ittihaad, Raas Kambooni, Hisbul Islaam or Al-Shabaab) propose a violent solution while others opt for the use of non-violent means (like the Somali Muslim Brotherhood -Al-Islaah- whose members also held a significant influence on the consecutive Federal Governments and Parliaments). Al-Shabaab showed no tolerance for non-Salafi Islam interpretations and practices, and actively targeted Sunni-Sufi practices and Sufi leaders. 39 The latter were labelled as \u2018non - believers\u2019 and therewith presented as \u2018legitimate targets for attacks\u2019. 40 In reaction to destructions of Sufi shrines and tombs by Al-Shabaab in 2008, Ahlu Sunna wa Jama\u2019a, a loose coalition of Sufi orders , took up its fight against Al-Shabaab. 41 However, beyond the so-called Jihadist groups, the rise of Muslim Brotherhoods (al-Islaah, Damul Jadid) and their deep-seated influence in contemporary political affairs also attests to a transformation of religious practices and a tendency towards Salafist Islam interpretations. The country, however, also sees attempts to re-emphasize Sufi practices. 42 An article by Al Jazeera published in March 2016 described a religious parade by a group of Sufi in Mogadishu, \u2018making a short but a symbolic slow walk to a nearby mosque in the Bakara area of the seaside city to continue their afternoon prayer programme.\u2019 43 Cultural Atlas, a website that provides information on the cultural background of the migrant community in Australia, states in 2019 that \u2018 Sufism is having a resurgence as some Somalis are becoming disaffected with Salafism over the actions of offshoot militant groups such as Al- Shabaab. Some see Sufism as a non- political spiritual alternative\u2019. 44 A local radio station reported in September 2020 that officials from the Benadir regional administration, among others, visited tombs of Sufi clerics and saints buried in Warsheekh, a town about 90 km north of Mogadishu. 45 According to the US Department of State (USDOS) report on International Religious Freedom in 2020 there is also \u2018an unknown number of Shia Muslims, Hindus, Buddhists, Jews, a nd those not affiliated with any religion\u2019 in the country as a whole. 46 1.1.1.3 Clan distribution Mogadishu is dominated by the Hawiye, in particular the Abgaal, Habar Gidir 47 and the Murasade sub- clans. 48 According to sources interviewed for a report on a Finnish fact-finding mission in March 2020, members of the Abgaal are living in Karan, those of Haba r Gidir mostly \u2018in districts that were occupied 37 ACCORD, Anfragebeantwortung zu Somalia: Allgemeine Informationen zum Sufismus in Somalia; Informationen zur Behandlung von Sufi-Angeh\u00f6rigen in Mogadischu seitens der Gesellschaft und al-Schabaab, Vertretung von Sufis in politischen \u00c4mtern [Query Response on Somalia: General Information on Sufism in Somalia; Information on the treatment of Sufi members in Mogadishu by society and al-Shabaab, political representation of Sufis], a-11388-1, 16 October 2020, url 38 Marchal, R. and Sheikh, Z., Salafism in Somalia: Coping with Coercion, Civil War and its own Contradictions, 2015, p. 137 39 Bakonyi, J., telephone interview, 13 July 2021 40 Al Jazeera, Somalia\u2019s Sufi revival, 29 March 2016, url 41 Marchal, R. and Sheikh, Z., Salafism in Somalia: Coping with Coercion, Civil War and its own Contradictions, 2015, p. 157; Stanford University, Mapping Militant organizations - Ahlu Sunna Wal Jama, url, 18 June 2016 42 Bakonyi, J., telephone interview, 13 July 2021 43 Al Jazeera, Somalia\u2019s Sufi revival, 29 March 2016, url 44 Cultural Atlas, Somali Culture, 2019, url 45 Radio Dalsan, Officials visit Warshsheekh Somalia\u2019s Popular Tour Destination, 2 September 2020, url 46 USDOS, International Religious Freedom Report 2020 - Somalia, 12 May 2021, url, p. 2 47 Norway, Landinfo, Somalia: Security challenges in Mogadishu, 15 May 2018, url, p. 12; see also International Crisis Group, Why Somalia\u2019s Electoral Crisis Has Tipped into Violence, 27 April 2021, url; IOM and Altai Consulting, Youth, Employment And Migration In Mogadishu, Kismayo And Baidoa, 9 February 2016, url, pp. 70, 87 48 Finland, FIS, Somalia: Fact-finding mission to Mogadishu in March 2020, Security situation and humanitarian conditions in Mogadishu, 7 August 2020, url , p. 38; see also International Crisis Group, Why Somalia\u2019s Electoral Crisis Has Tipped into Violence, 27 April 2021, url ",

In addition, there is an unknown, but not small number of Somali Bantu and other minorities. 51 In a May 2018 report Landinfo not ed that \u2018there is no survey of the clan or group affiliation of Mogadishu\u2019s residents, but according to local resource persons, \u201cmost\u201d clans are represented in the city\u2019. 52 Members of (sub-)clans tend to settle in the same neighbourhoods 53 and certain (sub-)clans dominate over others, 54 however \u2018people come together across clan boundaries in terms of work, trade, schooling and other social settings.\u2019 55 According to the Finnish fact-finding mission report of August 2020, the population from most districts in Mogadishu \u2018has a heterogeneous clan background and there are people from many different communities.\u2019 However, the old neighbourhoods such as Hamar-Weyne, Bondhere, Shibis, Shingan, Abdi-Aziz, and Hamar-Jaj ab are \u2018regarded as more cosmopolitan\u2019. 56 A report by the World Bank from 2020 stated that inhabitants in most urban districts, including Mogadishu, \u2018are treated locally as the domains of their most numerically and politically dominant sub-clans. Others may live and do business there, but the dominant clans of these districts invoke the right to govern and enjoy most of whatever \u201crents\u201d accrue from control of the district, such as local taxes, jobs, and contracts.\u2019 57 In 2016 IOM stated in a report that the largest companies and most of the district administrations in Mogadishu are managed by members of the Hawiye. 58 A World Bank report published in 2021 noted that the different water companies constituting Mogadishu\u2019s water sector are owned by sub -groups of the Hawiye. The report mentioned that Xamer Water Development is owned by Murusade members, the Banadir Water Development Co. by members of the Habar Gidir, and the Somali Water Development Union by members of the Abgaal. 59 With regard to district administrations, the Finnish fact-finding mission report of 2020 further noted that the \u2018administration of districts is usually the responsibility of the powerful clan in the district\u2019, which \u2018emphasises the position of the Hawiye/Abgaal and Hawiye/Habr Gedir clans\u2019. Bantu do not hold influential positions, although a significant number of members live in Mogadishu. 60 The governor of the Abdiaziz district stems from 49 The FIS report notes that \u2018the north side of the capital city and its districts of Kaaraan, Yaaqshid, Bondheere, and the Bermuda area, as well as the district of Madina in the south, were manned by the Hawiye/Abgaal clan. The rest of the city centre and the southern sections were controlled by Hawiye/Habr Gedir.\u2019 Finland, FIS, Somalia: Fact-finding mission to Mogadishu in March 2020; Security situation and humanitarian conditions in Mogadishu, 7 August 2020, url, p. 38; see also RVI and HIPS, Land Matters in Mogadishu - Settlement, ownership and displacement in a contested city, February 2017, url, pp. 42-44 50 Finland, FIS, Somalia: Fact-finding mission to Mogadishu in March 2020; Security situation and humanitarian conditions in Mogadishu, 7 August 2020, url, p. 38 51 Bakonyi, J., telephone interview, 28 July 2021 52 Norway, Landinfo, Somalia: Security challenges in Mogadishu, 15 May 2018, url, p. 13 53 Finland, FIS, Somalia: Fact-finding mission to Mogadishu in March 2020, Security situation and humanitarian conditions in Mogadishu, 7 August 2020, url, p. 40 54 RVI and HIPS, Land Matters in Mogadishu - Settlement, ownership and displacement in a contested city, February 2017, url, p. 65 55 Norway, Landinfo, Somalia: Security challenges in Mogadishu, 15 May 2018, url, p. 13 56 Finland, FIS, Somalia: Fact-finding mission to Mogadishu in March 2020; Security situation and humanitarian conditions in Mogadishu, 7 August 2020, url, p. 39 57 World Bank (The), Somalia Urbanization Review: Fostering Cities as Anchors of Development, 2020, url, p. 90 58 IOM and Altai Consulting, Youth, Employment And Migration In Mogadishu, Kismayo And Baidoa, 9 February 2016, url, p. 70 59 World Bank (The), Somalia Urbanization Review: Fostering Cities as Anchors of Development, 2020, url, p. 101 60 Finland, FIS, Somalia: Fact-finding mission to Mogadishu in March 2020; Security situation and humanitarian conditions in Mogadishu, 7 August 2020, url, p. 40 ",
        "Country of origin information report | Somalia: Key socio-economic indicators 15 the Darood-Majeerteen clan, Hamar-Weyne and Shangani district is governed by a Reer Hamar (minority clan) and the Hamar-Jajab district has a governor from the Dir-Biyomaal. 61 Members of marginalised groups mostly live in the districts of Wadajir, Hamar-Jajab, Hamar-Weyne, Dharkenley, Medina, Bondhere, Shibis, and Shingani. Members of the Bantu are predominantly living in the districts of Bondhere and Waberi. 62 Alongside the Bantu, the report further mentions the Reer Hamar/Benadiri and the Tumal as marginalised groups living in Mogadishu. 63 Most, if not all, minority groups are likely residing in Mogadishu. Their numbers are, however, not known. 64 Regarding fighting that erupted on 25 April 2021 in the context of the postponed indirect elections, 65 the International Crisis Group noted that it mostly took place in \u2018 neighbourhoods where pro- opposition Abgaal, Haber Gedir and Murosade sub-clans of the Hawiye are dominant. \u2019 66 1.1.2 Humanitarian situation overview People in Somalia face continuous socio-economic challenges due to high poverty and highly precarious conditions regarding employment, housing, food and water supplies. Violent conflicts and climatic shocks, among which droughts and floods, lead to displacements and contribute to vulnerabilities. 67 Since no formal social protection program exists, vulnerable households mainly rely on remittances, community-based safety nets and international aid. 68 Somalia\u2019s malnutrition rates are high, and health outcomes poor. 69 By mid-2020, almost 70 % of the population was reported to live in poverty, and one-third of the population was in need of humanitarian assistance. 70 In general, wage labour employment and remittances are better accessible in cities. Only land and housing are easier accessible in rural areas. 71 Within this context, Mogadishu stands out with a poverty incidence above average. However, access to basic services such as electricity, water, sanitation, improved housing, education, and health is better than in other cities in south and central Somalia. 72 The Finnish Immigration Service published findings of their fact-finding mission to Mogadishu undertaken in March 2020. They concluded that \u2018the humanitarian conditions in the capital city are severe\u2019. Ongoing instability and a troublesome security situation prevented people in need from seeking assistance and services.

The expert added that malnutrition affects IDPs most but also applies to other urban poor, and thus to a large part of the city\u2019s population. 73 From information by NGOs, the Finnish mission learned that Mogadishu has poor food security and relies heavily on food imports because of insufficient food production in the country. Therefore, food prices are high. 74 In 2020, the largest locust swarms in 25 years hit So malia\u2019s agriculture and drove Somalia into severe food insecurity. 75 In November 2020, they invaded farmlands at Mogadishu\u2019s outskirts putting farmers\u2019 livelihoods at risk. 76 According to a 2018 article by the Norwegian Refugee Council (NRC), fast urban growth and high numbers of arrivals of people fleeing crises in rural areas have made Mogadishu the most crowded city in Africa and the second-most densely populated city in the world. 77 This development increases the scarcity of already overstretched resources and challenges urban infrastructure and service facilities. 78 UNHCR related the three main challenges with regard to the humanitarian conditions in Mogadishu to education, health care, and housing. 79 Access to safe water is equally challenging and water-borne diseases are common across the city. 80 1.1.2.1 Floods Mogadishu is located in an area affected by recurrent flash floods. 81 The Inter Tropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) moves across Somalia twice a year, creating the major rain season, the gu, from April to July in its northerly movement and the minor rain season, the deyr, from September to November in its southerly movement. The two rain seasons alternate with the dry spells jilaal from January to March and hagaa from July to September. 82 In Mogadishu, heavy rainfall leads to floods because the drainage system cannot intercept the water. Houses can collapse, or the water seeps in. Many dwellings of internally displaced people lack adequate protection from rain. Strong rainfall and floods caused severe problems again in the first rainy season of 2021. 83 Between January and April 2021, Benadir district (in Benadir region) recorded the highest number of internal displacements due to 73 Finland, FIS, Somalia: Fact-finding mission to Mogadishu in March 2020, Security situation and humanitarian conditions in Mogadishu, 7 August 2020, url, p. 30 74 Finland, FIS, Somalia: Fact-finding mission to Mogadishu in March 2020, Security situation and humanitarian conditions in Mogadishu, 7 August 2020, url, p. 30 75 BBC News, Somalia declares emergency over locust swarms, 2 February 2020, url; Welthungerhilfe, Heuschreckenplage in Ostafrika und S\u00fcdasien, 12 May 2020, url; 76 Independent (The), Locusts swarm into Mogadishu\u2019s pasture land amid resurgence in Horn of Africa, 10 November 2020, url; Reuters, Outside Mogadishu, locusts turn farmland into desert, 13 November 2020, url 77 NRC, As Somalis flee to cities, Mogadishu becomes most crowded city in Africa, 11 Dec 2018, url; see also IDMC, UnSettlement: Urban displacement in the 21st century - City of flight: New and secondary displacements in Mogadishu, Somalia, November 2018, url, p. 2 78 NRC, As Somalis flee to cities, Mogadishu becomes most crowded city in Africa, 11 Dec 2018, url; UNOCHA, Humanitarian Needs Overview - Somalia, 9 March 2021, url, p. 16; Bakonyi, J., communication, 7 July 2021.

Armed conflict between the Somali government, and non-state groups, primarily Al-Shabaab, is ongoing. 94 Al-Shabaab commits terrorist attacks, regularly causing dozens of civilian casualties in Mogadishu. 95 UNOCHA reported that 15 humanitarian workers had been killed, 12 wounded and 24 kidnapped between 1 January and 31 December 2020. 96 The UN compound in Mogadishu was hit by mortar bombs six times, and four aircrafts carrying humanitarian aid and humanitarian workers crashed, were hit by ground fire or were being shot down in the first half of 2020. 97 As of February 2021, Al-Shabaab continued to hold three international staff members. 98 For more details, please see the sections 4.1 and 4.3 of EASO\u2019s COI report Somalia: Actors (July 20 21) as well as EASO\u2019s COI report Somalia: Security situation (September 2021).

It caused people to rather stay indoor, and transportation efficiency to worsen. 100 Security issues were also a major reason for limitations and barriers in terms of internal mobility, which hampered humanitarian organisations\u2019 ability to provide their services. 101 1.1.2.3 Displacement and humanitarian assistance IDP populations, inflows and outflows A qualitative study undertaken in 2020 in Baidoa and Mogadishu, investigating the impact of COVID-19, showed that Mogadishu is hosting the largest IDP population in the country. The study concluded that the city is \u2018host to respectively 497 000 IDPs \u2019 . 102 UNHCR numbers for April 2021 indicate 198 000 IDPs arriving in and 186 000 departing from the Benadir region; the number due to floods is particularly high. 103 According to the World Bank, Mogadishu was hosting 20 % of the approximately 2.6 million IDPs in Somalia in 2018, and one-third between 2016 and 2019. 104 IDP sites in Mogadishu and general conditions The number of IDP sites is fluctuating due to ongoing evictions and establishments of squatter settlements and camps across the city and at its outskirts. Estimates range between 500 and 1 500 IDP sites in Mogadishu. 105 Displaced people often join overcrowded IDP camps at Mogadishu's outskirts. 106 According to UNOCHA, as of January 2021, 1.6 million IDPs in Somalia are in humanitarian need. A high number of them lives in the Benadir region. 107 The safety and protection situation in IDP camps is generally weak and unsanitary conditions prevail. 108 Many women in Mogadishu are affected by gender-based violence (GBV). 109 Distance to water points and firewood collection sites constitutes a safety risk for women and girls in IDP camps at the outskirts of the city. 110 IDPs face severe risks of exclusion, discrimination, and evictions. Most evictions are enforced without adequate previous notice. UNOCHA reported that 139 000 people were evicted in Mogadishu from January to October 2019. 111 For more information on IDP sites in Mogadishu, please see sections 1.3.2.3 Informal settlements and IDP sites and 1.3.2.4 Evictions. 100 Bakonyi, J., communication, 7 July 2021 101 Braam, D.

The low need for health services might be explained by a hesitance of people to seek medical support in the context of chronic exhaustion and inability to pay fees. 113 Humanitarian assistance has been disrupted by prevalent violence and insecurity. 114 Based on data collected between November 2019 and February 2020, REACH and the CCCM Cluster assessed \u2018severe\u2019 and \u2018extreme\u2019 severity of humanitarian needs of residents in IDP camps in three districts in Mogadishu. 115 For more information on this topic, please see sections 1.3 Socio-economic indicators and 1.4.2.2 Returnees, vulnerable groups. Access to humanitarian assistance Several districts in Mogadishu are inaccessible to humanitarian operations. As of May 2021, people who were displaced to Garasbaly and Kahda districts have not yet received humanitarian assistance. 116 Under the prevalent circumstances, IOM scaled-up its cooperation with the Somali government regarding COVID-19 response in order to access hard-to-reach locations and communities in 2020. 117 Furthermore, IOM established a new Migrant Response Centre (MRC) in Mogadishu, which was handed over to the Benadir Regional Administration in November 2020. The MRC serves the purpose of \u2018providing direct assistance, information, counselling, and referrals, to returnees, host communities and migrants in the city\u2019. 118 According to UNOCHA, COVID- 19 restrictions in 2020 resulted \u2018in the reduction, suspension or cancellation of humanitarian projects and programmes\u2019. 119 Humanitarian actors, state, local governmental, and other actors have responded to displaced people\u2019 s needs with \u2018unprecedented or exceedingly rare actions\u2019 during the pandemic response measures. 120 1.1.2.4 Diseases Moreover, the Benadir region is affected by outbreaks of cholera following floods \u2013 the current outbreak had started in December 2017 \u2013 , 121 counting 102 cases between January and April 2021 as reported by the Food Security and Nutrition Analysis Unit (FSNAU) and the Famine Early Warning System Network (FEWS NET).

Regarding HIV, she further noted that infections are not being tested on a regular basis because HIV is highly stigmatised. Therefore, estimates vary greatly. 125 1.1.2.5 COVID-19 In March 2020, the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic reached Somalia, adding another dimension to the overall situation of humanitarian need. 126 The government implemented rapid measures to curb the spread of the pandemic as soon as the first COVID-19 cases were detected, such as the closure of border crossings and schools, restrictions of in-country movements and group functions. 127 With 1 593 cases and 57 deaths, the Benadir region recorded more than 36 % of the total number of reported cases as of 21 November 2020. 128 Mogadishu had high infection rates.

People who can afford it prefer travelling by plane to travelling by bus, since it is considered safer and domestic flights are not overly expensive. 161 1.2.2 Internal mobility, including checkpoints The Finnish Immigration Service published findings of their fact-finding mission to Mogadishu undertaken in March 2020. The report mentioned several hundred checkpoints in Mogadishu manned by security forces that were meant to ensure the safety of the city. Most of them were in the city centre, where political institutions are situated, and in the northern section around the military headquarters. All main roads leading to the city \u2013 two from the coastline: one from the south and another one from the north; two from the west towards Ethiopia: one towards west from Baidoa and Buurhakaba and one from the northwest from Beled-Weyne, Jowhar and Afgooye \u2013 had checkpoints. 162 According to Bakonyi, their number has not decreased since, on the contrary, the number of checkpoints has increased. It happened in 2020, under prime minister Mahdi Mohammed Gulaid, that whole streets were closed. This led to protests, particularly by businessmen, who said they were not able to transport and trade their goods anymore. His successor, Mohamed Hussein Roble did not continue this practice. 163 According to sources interviewed by the Finnish Immigration Service, the checkpoints were partly temporarily, partly permanently installed to stop traffic. Responsibility for maintenance was divided between police, the Somali National Intelligence and Security Agency (NISA) and the military. Sometimes clan affiliations were considered. For example, members of the subclans Habar Gidir and Abgaal (both from the Hawiye clan) who belonged to the security forces, were posted at checkpoints in areas populated by the respective clan communities. 164 UNHCR in Mogadishu confirmed in an 154 Freedom Airline Express, Nairobi \u2013 Mogadishu, n.d., url; Blue Sky Air, Flights, n.d., url 155 Salaam Air Express, Home, n.d., url; Salaam Air Express [Facebook], posted on 11 July 2021, url 156 Mandeeq Air [Facebook], posted on: 5 August 2018, url; Mandeeq Air [Facebook], posted on: 15 August 2018, url 157 Saacid Airline, Home, n.d., url 158 USDOS, 2020 Country Reports on Human Rights Practices - Somalia, 30 March 2021, url, p. 19; FAO, Somalia: Agricultural livelihoods and food security in the context of COVID-19, January 2021, url, p. 7 159 FAO, Somalia: Agricultural livelihoods and food security in the context of COVID-19, January 2021, url, p. 7 160 UNOCHA, Somalia: Situation Report, as of 6 September 2020, url, p. 4 161 Bakonyi, J., communication, 7 July 2021 162 Finland, FIS, Somalia: Fact-finding mission to Mogadishu in March 2020, Security situation and humanitarian conditions in Mogadishu, 7 August 2020, url, p. 22; Bakonyi, J., telephone interview, 28 July 2021 163 Bakonyi, J., communication, 7 July 2021 164 Finland, FIS, Somalia: Fact-finding mission to Mogadishu in March 2020, Security situation and humanitarian conditions in Mogadishu, 7 August 2020, url, pp. 21-22 ",

One expert said that security forces sometimes extorted money from people passing through checkpoints; one said that drivers of vehicles always had to pay a fee and only pedestrians were exempt; and others said that fees applied to everyone; or that no fees applied to passers-by but that identities were checked and that it was necessary to indicate a contact person on the other side of the checkpoint that would take responsibility for them. Regarding the amount charged by security forces at checkpoints experts and NGO members stated a range between 0.25 and 5 US Dollars. 166 Iman Elman, former Director of External Affairs at Somalia's Ministry of Internal Security and Head of Programs and Security for Committed to Good (CTG), a private company in international development, stated in January 2019 that security checkpoints in Mogadishu were commonly located every one to two kilometres, and that one should make sure to provide an ID card at checkpoints. 167 However, Bakonyi stated in July 2021 that a majority of people in Mogadishu does neither possess IDs nor other identity documents. Official fees are not levied at checkpoints, but bribes may be requested and especially so if identity documents are missing. People without IDs are more likely to be body checked. Also, cars are checked for explosives at checkpoints, which is among the reasons for the popularity of motorbike taxis. Sometimes, people have to leave taxis behind at checkpoints, pass on foot and look for alternative means of transportation. 168 Bakonyi, as well as the Finnish report, stated that residents were often irritated by the restrictions of movement through checkpoints in the city. 169 For members of marginalised groups, passage was not always possible even though they had the required identity certificates. People reported fear going through checkpoints because of corrupt police officers or the risk of terrorist bomb attacks. Violent incidents at checkpoints causing death included shootings at three-wheel mopeds and other vehicles for not obeying security forces\u2019 orders to stop, clashes between different units of security forces and terrorist attacks by armed groups (the majority of which perpetrated by Al-Shabaab). 170 In addition, harassments by NISA or other security agents at checkpoints have been reported. 171 Yet terrorist attacks happen not only at city checkpoints but in all kinds of infrastructure used by government officials, politicians and security forces in Mogadishu, including restaurants, hotels and shopping malls. 172 This is why generally, \u2018moving about in the city causes fear and anxiety among city residents\u2019. 173 165 Canada, IRB, Somalia: Entry and exit requirements at land borders and airports, including documentation required; whether there are checkpoints for domestic and international travel; whether there are travel agencies that facilitate travel within and outside Somalia (2018-August 2020), 3 September 2020, url 166 Finland, FIS, Somalia: Fact-finding mission to Mogadishu in March 2020, Security situation and humanitarian conditions in Mogadishu, 7 August 2020, url, pp. 22-23 167 CTG, Staying Safe in Somalia: 9 Top Security Tips For Humanitarian Aid Workers, 22 January 2019, url 168 Bakonyi, J., communication, 7 July 2021 169 Bakonyi, J., communication, 7 July 2021; Finland, FIS, Somalia: Fact-finding mission to Mogadishu in March 2020, Security situation and humanitarian conditions in Mogadishu, 7 August 2020, url, p. 24 170 Finland, FIS, Somalia: Fact-finding mission to Mogadishu in March 2020, Security situation and humanitarian conditions in Mogadishu, 7 August 2020, url, p. 24 171 Bakonyi, J., communication, 7 July 2021 172 AI, Amnesty International Report 2020/21: The State of the Worlds Human Rights, 7 April 2021, url, pp. 19, 323; Finland, FIS, Somalia: Fact-finding mission to Mogadishu in March 2020, Security situation and humanitarian conditions in Mogadishu, 7 August 2020, url, p. 25; AA, Suicide bomber strikes near Somali mall, police station, 23 February 2021, url; Reuters, At least 8 killed in Mogadishu by suicide bomb targeting government convoy, 10 July 2021, url 173 Finland, FIS, Somalia: Fact-finding mission to Mogadishu in March 2020, Security situation and humanitarian conditions in Mogadishu, 7 August 2020, url, p. 25 ",
        "Country of origin information report | Somalia: Key socio-economic indicators 24 According to scholar Jutta Bakonyi, Mogadishu is an unsafe place for everyone living there. Particular challenges of accessibility are faced by the wealthiest, by those working for the government and the UN and by well-known businessmen who refuse to pay taxes to Al-Shabaab. These people often use bulletproof cars and move around the town as little as possible. Private cars are used only by the wealthiest to go about the town, the rest relies on the chaotically functioning bus system, three-wheel vehicles ( bajaj ) originally from India, motorbikes, motorbike taxis, taxi cars and a taxi app via mobile application. The number of motorbike taxis has increased in the last years due to the proliferation of checkpoints and subsequent traffic jams in the city. 174 For additional details see section 6 of EASO\u2019s COI report Somalia: Targeted profiles (September 2021). In Mogadishu, the \u2018airport zone\u2019, 175 which is also known as Halane, 176 is a high security zone hosting the UN offices, most European and the Kenyan embassies. Access to the walled airport zone is only provided through three gates with heavy security checks. Surrounding Mogadishu\u2019s highly secured airport zone is the \u2018green zone\u2019 , where further international organisations and government officials reside and where hotels are located which are used by international and national experts who are not able or willing to move into the segregated airport zone. The green zone has a high number of checkpoints and is heavily patrolled by Somali security forces. Nonetheless attacks could not be entirely prevented. 177 COVID-19 related dusk-to-dawn curfews in Mogadishu between April and August 2020 restricted people\u2019s movements and the government banned assemblies and large gatherings, closed schools and academic institutions. 178 Physical isolation and movement restrictions imposed by the government sometimes caused limited access to food and medical supplies. 179 Two people who had violated the curfew in April 2020 were shot dead by a police officer in Mogadishu. Later, the officer was sentenced to death by a military court. 180 The government\u2019s response to a consequent COVID -19 wave in 2021 was \u2018more lax\u2019 and , with markets, mosques and football stadiums remaining open, life \u2018continued relatively normally\u2019. 181 For more information on mobility, please see section 3.1 of EASO\u2019s COI report Somalia: Actors (July 2021). 1.2.3 Accessing and settling in the city Yahya Amir, professor in Mogadishu, explained to the Finnish fact-finding mission that there was a division of the city between zones controlled by the Abgaal and Habar Gidir from the Hawiye clan during the civil war in the 1990s. Northern, some central and the southern Madina district were under the control of the Abgaal, the remaining central and southern zones under the control of the Habar Gidir. According to Yahya Amir, in March 2020 this clan setting still had an impact and the Abgaal and 174 Bakonyi, J., communication, 7 July 2021 175 Bakonyi, J., communication, 7 July 2021 176 GardaWorld, Somalia: Explosions reported in the vicinity of Halane compound, Mogadishu, March 9, 9 March 2021, url 177 Bakonyi, J., communication, 7 July 2021 178 TNH, Who\u2019s afraid of COVID - 19?

        "Country of origin information report | Somalia: Key socio-economic indicators 25 Habar Gidir clans held strong positions. 182 UN-Habitat and JPLG follow the same line when saying that the city\u2019s \u2018economy, politics and power structures are dominated by geographical clan groups\u2019. 183 For more information on the influence of clan affiliation on settlement patterns, please see section 1.1.1.3 Clan distribution. But \u2018in principle, people can move freely within the capital city regardless of their clan background, and there are no clan-based restrictions on movemen t\u2019, local experts told the Finnish mission. 184 UNHCR informed the mission that \u2018P eople with means can buy a residence and settle in the best areas of the city, even if they are not members of the capital city\u2019s powerful clans\u2019. 185 Still, the clan background often determines where people feel it is safest for an individual to live. When clan conflicts turn violent, it seems safest to move into the districts where the own clan dominates or at least more people from the same clan live. The clan can also provide a safety net in case of hardship. 186 The rural-urban dynamic of movement of the internally displaced population in Somalia is a major driver of cities\u2019 growth in Somalia and in many cities IDPs are meanwhile a large percentage of urban residents. But also returnees and refugees from neighbouring countries tend to settle in and around Somalia\u2019s urban centres, among which Mogadishu. 187 A study by Charlotte Bonnet et al. indicated that, in the Somali context, the label IDP was not used in the same way as by the international community but rather as a generic term for poor urban residents that had settled in the city in the past 20 years. Therefore, the line between newly displaced and urban poor residents of Mogadishu was blurred. 188 Bakonyi explains in her study on displacement that in the common Somali understanding, someone is considered an IDP when he or she settles on land particularly designated for displaced people. \u2018The alignment of places of settlement to status as \u201cdisplaced\u201d was common in a ll Somali cities, excluding those who join relatives or live in rented accommodations across the city.\u2019 In Mogadishu, the majority of residents at IDP sites do not belong to one of the clans that hold political power. 189 The perception of being an IDP depends particularly on the place where an individual settles (e.g. IDP camps, relocation areas, squatter settlements) and on the clan affiliation. Bakonyi notes that urban poor newcomers to the city are not generally considered IDPs. If they move in with relatives, for instance, or if they are able to rent a place, they are not considered IDPs even if they technically are. 190 Likewise, they are not represented in the IDP numbers. 191 Together with her co-authors, Peter Chonka and Kirsti Stuv\u00f8y, she explains in their study on Mogadishu and Bosass o from August 2019 that \u2018displaced people without social networks and prior knowledge of the city often ended- up on the city\u2019s streets where they turned to begging for their survival\u2019. 192 Newcomers would eventually find shelter in one of the 182 Finland, FIS, Somalia: Fact-finding mission to Mogadishu in March 2020, Security situation and humanitarian conditions in Mogadishu, 7 August 2020, url, p. 38 183 UN-Habitat and JPLG, Towards Mogadishu: Spatial Strategic Plan, Urban Analyses / Urban Development Challenges / Urban Strategic Planning, 2019, url, p. 3 184 Finland, FIS, Somalia: Fact-finding mission to Mogadishu in March 2020, Security situation and humanitarian conditions in Mogadishu, 7 August 2020, url, p. 39 185 Finland, FIS, Somalia: Fact-finding mission to Mogadishu in March 2020, Security situation and humanitarian conditions in Mogadishu, 7 August 2020, url, p. 39 186 Bakonyi, J., telephone interview, 13 July 2021 187 World Bank (The), Somalia Urbanization Review: Fostering Cities as Anchors of Development, 2020, url, p. 36; see also UN-Habitat and JPLG, Towards Mogadishu: Spatial Strategic Plan, Urban Analyses / Urban Development Challenges / Urban Strategic Planning, 2019, url, p. 21 188 Bonnet, C. et al., Inclusive Shelter Provision in Mogadishu, 28 July 2020, url, pp. 451-452 189 Bakonyi, J., The Political Economy of Displacement: Rent Seeking, Dispossessions and Precarious Mobility in Somali Cities, 15 October 2020, url, p. 18 190 Bakonyi, J., telephone interview, 13 July 2021 191 Bakonyi, J., communication, 7 July 2021 192 Bakonyi, J. et al., War and City-Making in Somalia: Property, Power and Disposable Lives, August 2019, url, p. 36 ",
        "Country of origin information report | Somalia: Key socio-economic indicators 26 camps and erect a buul (makeshift hut) on goof (uninhabited, unused land), which belongs to a goof- leh (owner of unused land). 193 Especially in Mogadishu, informal settlement managers (ISMs), also referred to as \u2018gatekeepers\u2019 play an important role in the process. 194 They \u2018preside over a lucrative industry providing space for shelter and protection for IDPs\u2019, sometimes buying up land and then actively filling it up with IDPs. Such new camps attract humanitarian aid, from which gatekeepers take a share. 195 In this way, as the national or local state fails to provide shelter and security to the vulnerable, an informal industry has arisen in Mogadishu that \u2018negotiate[s] access to plots from local landlords\u2019 and \u2018facilitate[s] access to shelter, principally for internally displaced persons (IDPs) but also for long-term urban poor residents, refugees and returnees.\u2019 196 Meanwhile, one has to pay a fee to the gatekeeper for a place to settle in one of the camps with good humanitarian support. 197 In 2017 a study suggested that approximately 140 gatekeepers operated in Mogadishu. 198 Most of them belong to the dominant Hawiye clan and sometimes to the Darood. 199 Their number has most probably increased since 2018 and 2019 saw a higher influx of IDPs, many of them settling in Kaxda district. 200 The International Institute for Environment and Development (IIED), Econvalue Consult, SDI Kenya, Social Development Direct (SDDirect) and Tana Copenhagen noticed that clan concentration diminished and the city developed a greater diversity in some locations. Still, relatives\u2019 support and clan networks remain important to IDPs upon and after their arrival to the town. This is why they \u2018usually move to areas where they have relatives and networks\u2019. 201 It is not uncommon that, if landowners wish to develop their land, they clear it through forced evictions. 202 For mor information, please see sections 1.3.2.3 Informal settlements and IDP sites and 1.3.2.4 Evictions. IDPs from minority clans and ethnic groups, particularly those of Bantu origin from southern Somalia, face stronger discrimination and a higher risk of evictions compared to members of majority clans or to non-displaced clan members, who also reside in informal settlements in Mogadishu. 203 For more information on minori ty clans and ethnic minorities, please see sections 4.2 and 4.3 of EASO\u2019s COI report Somalia: Targeted profiles (September 2021). 193 Bakonyi, J. et al., War and City-Making in Somalia: Property, Power and Disposable Lives, August 2019, url, pp. 85, 87 194 IIED et al., Access to shelter and services for low-income groups: lessons from Hawassa, Mogadishu and Nairobi on the politics of informal settlements and shelter access, October 2019, url, p. 5 195 Menkhaus, K., Non-State Security Providers and Political Formation in Somalia, in: CSG Papers, No. 5, April 2016, url, p. 32 196 IIED et al., Access to shelter and services for low-income groups: lessons from Hawassa, Mogadishu and Nairobi on the politics of informal settlements and shelter access, October 2019, url, p. 5 197 Bakonyi, J., communication, 7 July 2021 198 IIED et al., Access to shelter and services for low-income groups: lessons from Hawassa, Mogadishu and Nairobi on the politics of informal settlements and shelter access, October 2019, url, p. 5 199 Bakonyi, J., communication, 7 July 2021a 200 IIED et al., Access to shelter and services for low-income groups: lessons from Hawassa, Mogadishu and Nairobi on the politics of informal settlements and shelter access, October 2019, url, p. 5, p. 5, footnote 3 201 IIED et al., Access to shelter and services for low-income groups: lessons from Hawassa, Mogadishu and Nairobi on the politics of informal settlements and shelter access, October 2019, url, p. 8 202 Bertelsmann Stiftung, BTI 2020 Country Report \u2014 Somalia, 2020, url, pp. 28-29; IIED et al., Access to shelter and services for low-income groups: lessons from Hawassa, Mogadishu and Nairobi on the politics of informal settlements and shelter access, October 2019, url, p. 12 203 IIED et al., Access to shelter and services for low-income groups: lessons from Hawassa, Mogadishu and Nairobi on the politics of informal settlements and shelter access, October 2019, url, pp. 6, 8 ",
        "Country of origin information report | Somalia: Key socio-economic indicators 27 1.3 Socio-economic indicators 1.3.1 Economic overview and food security 1.3.1.1 Economic overview Somalia\u2019s economy is dominated by subsistence agriculture and fishing. 204 According to data from Statista, the agriculture sector produced 80.3 % of the country\u2019s total GDP in 2019. 205 The majority of the population lives at the subsistence level. People engage as petty traders or small-scale producers of livestock and other agricultural products. 206 Somalia is heavily dependent upon imports. In 2020, household final consumption expenditure accounted for 144 % of the Gross Domestic Product (GDP), imports of goods and services amounted to 84 % of the GDP. 207 According to 2020 data the GDP per capita in Somalia was 309.4 US dollars. 208 Private consumption is the main driver of the Somali economy and, according to the Somali Ministry of Planning, Investment and Economic Development, relies to a large extent on remittance inflows, 209 which contribute up to 40 % to the Somali economy. 210 Transport, communication and construction are major drivers of growth on the supply side, for which Mogadishu serves as a major hub. 211 Still, the city\u2019s economy remains largely informal and is not regulated by the government. 212 Domestic revenues are mainly derived from customs duties collected at the Mogadishu sea- and airport, amounting to 5.5 million to 8.5 million US dollars monthly. Furthermore, sales taxes on khat 213 are collected at the sea- and airport, and income tax is imposed on salaries and government wages. 214 Apart from that, the country is dependent on international aid. 215 Somalia\u2019s co astal areas, among them Mogadishu, have access to one of the richest fishing grounds in the world. However, illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) fishing activities as well as piracy challenge the fishing sector, contributing to the environmental destruction of Somalia\u2019s marine resources and undermining the ability of the state to generate legitimate revenue from fisheries. 216 The federal government issues fishing licences beyond a 24 nautical mile limit from the shoreline and other permissions. The management of fishing within this limit is in the responsibility of the federal member states.

Fish is also being distributed to the hinterland. Fishers can come from all major clans, while labourers who slaughter, distribute or carry the fish are often from minority groups, such as Bantu or Madiban. In a recent bilateral initiative, Ethiopia and Somalia agreed on the exchange of khat with fish. 218 On Mogadishu\u2019s outskirts, pastoralists and farmers engage in agricultural production and animal husbandry. 219 Since January 2020, goat prices have declined and cereal prices risen. For instance, in January 2021, the sale of a goat bought 158 kilogrammes of maize, which is 24 % less than in January 2020. 220 In 2016, FSNAU reported that from Mogadishu\u2019s Bakara market . locally produced cereals were being traded to central Somalia. 221 In the past 10 to 15 years, agriculture saw an increase in cash crops production. Lemon, bananas and sesame are produced in the south and along the Shebelle river and then transported to Mogadishu for the local or the export markets. 222 Markets in Mogadishu are the main destination for livestock, such as camel trade and other local agricultural products from surrounding regions. 223 Annual inflation has been in single digits between 2012 and 2019 based on inflation rates derived from data on consumer prices obtained in Mogadishu. 224 The World Bank projects a stagnation of private consumption in 2021 and a steady international poverty rate of 71 % in 2022 and 2023 for Somalia. 225 Recent gains in economic growth have been lost due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. 226 Current information on average income in Mogadishu is not available, since many people engage in the trade sector that is highly dependent on business success, such as import, export, wholesale, kiosk, or otherwise handicraft trade. 227 Mogadishu is the country\u2019s most vibrant commercial and the state\u2019s administrative centre . 228 Despite its chronic insecurity, it is the main eco nomic hub, where approximately a third of Somalia\u2019s urban population lives. 229 A report by the Bertelsmann Stiftung described an ongoing building boom and the reopening of restaurants, supermarkets and shops in Mogadishu as \u2018signs of economic recovery\u2019 in the time between January 2017 and January 2019.

Therefore, the majority of urban households make their living on wage labour. In Mogadishu with 64 %, the proportion of households engaged in wage labour is the highest. 237 In June 2020, the Somali Public Agenda published an article on the impact of COVID-19 on the informal economy on Mogadishu. The article states that due to COVID-19-related restrictions and a night curfew in Mogadishu from April 2020, many businesses were closed. Informal businesses such as roadside cafes, milk and tea vendors, hawkers, vegetable and fruit sellers, restaurants, teashops, shoe shiners, travel agencies, khat traders/sellers, remittances, bajaj drivers, school and university teachers, clothes businesses and other imported goods businesses were heavily impacted by the restrictions. To cushion the economic impact, the Somali government rolled out a 100 % tax exemption for rice and dates and a 50 % tax waiver for wheat flour and cooking oil in April 2020. 238 Due to the COVID-19 crisis remittance flows were interrupted causing a decline of consumption in local markets in Mogadishu. 239 1.3.1.2 Food security The majority of the population in Mogadishu is affected by food insecurity with highest malnutrition rates among IDPs (for more information on IDPs, please see section 1.1.2.3 Displacement and humanitarian assistance). 240 FEWS and FSNAU provide an outlook on the food security situation in Mogadishu.

The cluster reported an all-time high with regard to food security complaints and information requests in April 2021. This relates to the elevated number of new displacements and coincides with increases of IDP numbers. 243 In March 2021, FSNAU reported a monthly number of 125 000 recipients of food assistance in Mogadishu since July 2018. 244 FSNAU stated in December 2020 that a persistently critical level of acute malnutrition prevailed among IDPs in Mogadishu since 2019 deyr due to high morbidity and effects on household incomes. 245 UNOCHA reported a global acute malnutrition (GAM) rate of 16 % in some IDP sites in Mogadishu for the year 2019. 246 Data collected in the course of the World Bank\u2019s Somali High Frequency Survey Wave 2 in December 2017 shows that 72 % of the population in Mogadishu were poor and almost 50 % suffered from food poverty. 247 As the local food product ion cannot sustain the city\u2019s demands, Mogadishu relies mostly on food imports from abroad. 248 Moreover, the city\u2019s supply from local producers is vulnerable to climate change, from which food security suffers in time of droughts. 249 According to UN-Habitat, \u2018facilitation of trade is therefore of vital importance to increase food security\u2019. 250 Somalia imports much of its basic food items including rice, pasta, sugar, flour or cooking oil. 251 Markets fulfil central supply functions in the town. Bakaara market in Mogadishu is the largest of such open markets in all Somalia and one of the largest in East Africa. Another wholesale and supply market is the Zeybiano market in Hodan district. From there, food stuffs are being traded to other districts via retailers, who, as well, form wholesale markets within their districts like Suuq Bacad and Hamar Weyne or Medina markets. Suuq Bacaad in Yaqshid district and Hamarweyne are Mogadishu\u2019s second and third largest markets. 252 In neighbourhoods and IDP camps in Weydow and Tabella smaller emerging markets serve the specific needs of the urban poor and IDPs.

Local cereal prices, specifically white maize prices, increased in Benadir by 6 % between June 2021 and May 2021, and also wheat prices slightly increased between June 2020 and June 2021. 254 1.3.2 Housing and shelter The different types of housing and shelter in Mogadishu include: huts ( buush ), jingaad (a basic housing structure of only metal sheet), bacweyne (iron sheet house, but better decorated than jingaad ). Bacweyne are often erected in a first phase by people owning a small plot of land before they can afford to build a brick or stone structure house for their families. All of these types of houses have outside toilets (pit-latrines). Brick or stone houses have several rooms, iron sheet roofing and indoor bathrooms. 255 In Mogadishu, informal housing is widespread. The federal government is unable to meet the shelter needs of the most vulnerable residents. Therefore, an informal industry has arisen maintaining and, sometimes, exploiting IDP populations, urban poor, refugees and returnees. \u2018Gatekeepers\u2019 are the informal power holders, who provide access to land or shelter and basic services against a fee. 256 Access to land enables people to build their own houses to live or to become landlords (even if only petty landlords allowing other people to establish huts or metal sheet houses). If people can afford it, they can also rent land, rooms, apartments or houses. 257 UNHCR informants to the Finnish fact-finding mission stated in March 2020 that housing conditions in Mogadishu were challenging. 258 The Internal Displacement Monitoring Centre (IDMC) related the challenges to \u2018the informal nature of the housing sector in Somalia\u2019 lacking \u2018clear laws to regulate transactions\u2019 . 259 Similarly, in a 2017 fact sheet by the Global Shelter Cluster rental agreements were described as being often informal. 260 The World Bank\u2019s assessment of major socio -economic parameters from 2019 showed that due to scarcity of land, access to land and housing was constrained in urban areas and people\u2019s chances of owning property were smaller than in rural areas. Mogadishu had the highest proportion of renters (71 %) and the highest land values in Somalia. 261 The World Bank saw the need for \u2018a proper land administration system\u2019 together with \u2018effective land use planning\u2019 and accompanied by \u2018coordinated infrastructure investments\u2019 in order to keep the growth of the city under control and provide security of tenure to IDPs. 262 The growing influx of IDPs as well as of returnees from neighbouring countries (please see section 1.2.3 Accessing and settling in the city has further constrained access to land in Mogadishu. 263 According to Bakonyi, an ongoing building boom could trigger speculation with urban land and the expansion of rent economy.

Prices in districts on the outskirts, such as Huriwaa and Suuqa Hoolahan, were \u2018more affordable\u2019. 267 A room of 25 square metres with no fittings or fixtures and a concrete floor in best quality location could cost up to 100 US dollars per month. People, who could not afford rents in better regions, were forced to live in less secure areas. 268 Apartments for rent in the different residential areas are available from monthly rates of about 100 US dollars for a one room apartment in less safe areas up to 400 Us dollars in the safe area (Green Zone) around the airport, Maka Al-Mukarama Road that connects airport and statehouse. In recent years, high rise buildings of up to 10 floors were being constructed in Mogadishu, where one can buy apartments with three to four bedrooms and a bathroom for about 100 000 US dollars or more. A maisonette house, if not located in the city centre, costs about 150 000 US dollars. A new suburb at Mogadishu\u2019s outskirts is under construc tion by the telecom company Hormuud. The project offers gated maisonettes for sale at about 300 000 US dollars. 269 Markus Hoehne 270 said in an interview in March 2021 prices for housing varied significantly between safe and unsafe areas. On the outskirts, where Al-Shabaab was still active and which were partly in their sphere of influence, housing was much cheaper. The safer districts in the centre were secured by the African Union Mission in Somalia (AMISOM) and monthly costs for a studio in these areas were at minimum 150 US dollars. The same amount applied on the outskirts of Mogadishu for villas with four or five rooms. 271 The Finnish report remarked that it happened that people coming from outside were charged a higher rent than Mogadishu locals. 272 The July 2020 study by Charlotte Bonnet and her colleagues contained a table on housing types, costs and locations in Mogadishu: buul (pl. buush ), self-built temporary shelters which are mainly located at the periphery and inhabited by IDPs and other Mogadishu residents who are locked out of the city\u2019s formal housing market. If rent applied at all, it amounted on average to about 13 US dollars per month. Corrugated iron sheet housing accommodated usually low-income and lower-middle class households in central and peripheral areas. Average rent amounted to 140 US dollars per month.

In apartments one could find middle-class and upper middle-class households, who paid monthly rents of about 350 to 500 US dollars on average. Many of those were located within the city close to the city centre. As a last category, the table presented villas, which were detached houses with their own compound located in the older parts of the town. Villas were accessible to upper-middle class and wealthy households as well as were rented out to foreign nationals and local and international organisations. 273 Especially in Mogadishu, Somalis from the diaspora and local elites purchased land, despite the lack of a functioning land registry. 274 1.3.2.2 Discriminated groups Tenants need a local male person to vouch for them before a new rental arrangement is made. Single women encounter difficulties when renting their own apartment. Living alone is not customary and might be criticised as westernised. Leaving the parental household is only acceptable for women upon marriage. 275 Moreover, single young men are particularly disadvantaged in accessing shelter due to stereotypical views of them as drug-takers, potential Al-Shabaab members, or people likely to cause trouble. For people living with disabilities (PLWD) almost no provisions exist regarding housing. Therefore, they are generally entirely reliant on family members for support. Ethnic minorities outside of the clan system, such as so-called Bantu, experience significant discrimination and tensions surrounding security of tenure or evictions 276 1.3.2.3 Informal settlements and IDP sites Bakonyi states that displaced people were mainly living in self-established camps at the fringes of Mogadishu. 277 Numbers from 2017 counted 480 informal settlements across Mogadishu, most of them located in the north-western Hodan and Daynile districts. 278 According to World Bank data from 2017 as well as UN-Habitat and the Joint Programme on Local Governance and Decentralised Service Delivery (JPLG), 55 % of IDPs in Mogadishu resided in peripheral settlements, namely in the outskirt districts Daynile and Kahda. 279 In an analysis of their field work carried out in Mogadishu, Bonnet and her colleagues show that housing consisted predominantly of corrugated metal sheet shacks or temporary shelters made of sticks, plastic and fabric ( buul s) inhabited by IDPs. Newly established settlements at the peripheries were disconnected from urban infrastructure. 280 It happened that poverty drove also non-IDP residents into informal settlements in Mogadishu because they could 'no longer afford decent hous ing\u2019. 281 IDP and poor households in Mogadishu lack lasting tenure security agreements and face increasing difficulties to find locations to settle that do not bear the risk of eviction. 282 In IDP camps, the central figure of the \u2018camp leader\u2019 or \u2018gatekeeper\u2019 (pleas e see section 1.2.3 Accessing and settling in the city) decides \u2018who is allowed to settle in the camp, register 273 Bonnet, C. et al., Inclusive Shelter Provision in Mogadishu, 28 July 2020, url, p. 454 274 Bertelsmann Stiftung, BTI 2020 Country Report \u2014 Somalia, 2020, url, p. 28 275 Finland, FIS, Somalia: Fact-finding mission to Mogadishu in March 2020, Security situation and humanitarian conditions in Mogadishu, 7 August 2020, url, p. 32 276 IIED et al., Access to shelter and services for low-income groups: lessons from Hawassa, Mogadishu and Nairobi on the politics of informal settlements and shelter access, October 2019, url, pp. 7-8 277 Bakonyi, J., The Political Economy of Displacement: Rent Seeking, Dispossessions and Precarious Mobility in Somali Cities, 15 October 2020, url, p. 13 278 Bonnet, C. et al., Inclusive Shelter Provision in Mogadishu, 28 July 2020, url, p. 451 279 World Bank (The), Somali Poverty and Vulnerability Assessment: Findings from Wave 2 of the Somali High Frequency Survey, April 2019, url, pp. 40-41; UN-Habitat and JPLG, Towards Mogadishu: Spatial Strategic Plan, Urban Analyses / Urban Development Challenges / Urban Strategic Planning, 2019, url, p. 21 280 Bonnet, C. et al., Inclusive Shelter Provision in Mogadishu, 28 July 2020, url, pp. 454-455; see also World Bank (The), Somali Poverty and Vulnerability Assessment: Findings from Wave 2 of the Somali High Frequency Survey, April 2019, url, p. 41 281 Bonnet, C. et al., Inclusive Shelter Provision in Mogadishu, 28 July 2020, url, p. 451 282 NRC et al., Back to Square One, 12 January 2018, url, p. 11 ",

After their forced eviction many urban IDP residents moved to the cities\u2019 outskirts. 287 In May 2021, the NRC reported the eviction of 1 937 households \u2013 approximately 11 622 people \u2013 from 18 IDP settlements in Garasbaley in the Benadir region. The evicted people relocated to settlements in Igadawage in Daynile district. 288 In early 2020, an eviction moratorium was issued in response to the COVID-19 outbreak. 289 And, in 2019, new policies regarding the protection of returnees and IDPs against displacement 290 as well as land distribution for housing to returnees and IDPs, 291 social protection 292 and national eviction guidelines 293 were adopted. 294 Nevertheless, evictions by security forces and private landowners continued in 2020 295 \u2013 e.g. in December a landlord forcibly evicted nearly 7 000 IDPs from seven settlements in Benadir. 296 In 2018, a majority of more than 200 000 people affected by forced evictions in Somalia were from Mogadishu. The Bertelsmann Stiftung reported further that security forces regularly demolished settlements in Mogadishu in 2018. 297 Similarly, the NRC found that in Mogadishu 153 682 persons were evicted in 2017, 143 510 in 2016 and 123 421 in 2015. More than 11 000 IDPs were evicted each month between 2015 and 2017. 298 In Mogadishu, forced evictions by private actors were mostly executed in order to have clear land that they can develop. 299 It happens that, if the value of the land in the camp rises due to its better integration into the city\u2019s networks, the owner might wish to develop or sell the land. In this case the inhabitants will be evicted and have to move again. 300 Repeated evictions and little social upward mobility create a circle of displacement and push urban 283 Bakonyi, J. et al., War and City-Making in Somalia: Property, Power and Disposable Lives, August 2019, url, p. 87, see also Bakonyi, J., The Political Economy of Displacement: Rent Seeking, Dispossessions and Precarious Mobility in Somali Cities, 15 October 2020, url, pp. 13-14 284 CCCM, Household Satisfaction Surveys - March 2021, 18 March 2021, url, pp. 1-2 285 CCCM, Household Satisfaction Surveys - March 2021, 18 March 2021, url, pp. 2, 9 286 World Bank (The), Somali Poverty and Vulnerability Assessment: Findings from Wave 2 of the Somali High Frequency Survey, April 2019, url, p. 40 287 World Bank (The), Somali Poverty and Vulnerability Assessment: Findings from Wave 2 of the Somali High Frequency Survey, April 2019, url, pp. 40-41 288 NRC and Somalia Protection Cluster, Rapid Assessment Report \u2013 Garasbaley Evictions, 30 May 2021, url, pp. 2-3, 5 289 USAID, Somalia - Complex Emergency, 8 January 2021, url, p. 3 290 Somalia, Federal government of Somalia, National Policy on Refugee-Returnees and Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs), 2019, url 291 Somalia, Federal government of Somalia, Interim Protocol on Land Distribution for Housing to Eligible Refugee- Returnees and Internally Displaced Persons, 2019, url 292 Somalia, MoLSA, Somalia Social Protection Policy \u2013 March 2019, 31 March 2019, url 293 Somalia, Federal Government of Somalia, National Eviction Guidelines, 2019, url 294 Somalia, MoPIED, The National Durable Solutions Strategy (2020-2024), 31 March 2021, url, p. 30 295 AI, Amnesty International Report 2020/21: The State of the Worlds Human Rights, 2021, 7 April 2021, url, p. 324; USAID, Somalia - Complex Emergency, 8 January 2021, url, p. 3 296 USAID, Somalia - Complex Emergency, 8 January 2021, url, p. 3 297 Bertelsmann Stiftung, BTI 2020 Country Report \u2014 Somalia, 2020, url, p. 18 298 NRC et al., Back to Square One, 12 January 2018, url, p. 11 299 Bertelsmann Stiftung, BTI 2020 Country Report \u2014 Somalia, 2020, url, pp. 28-29; IIED et al., Access to shelter and services for low-income groups: lessons from Hawassa, Mogadishu and Nairobi on the politics of informal settlements and shelter access, October 2019, url, p. 12 300 Bakonyi, J. et al., War and City-Making in Somalia: Property, Power and Disposable Lives, August 2019, url, p. 88 ",

This number corresponds with other urban areas in Somalia. 307 According to UNOCHA, the immediate access to the port of Mogadishu ensures regular supply of humanitarian WASH support. Therefore, Mogadishu experienced only minimum supply issues in 2020. 308 ReDSS, DRC and NRC reported in 2017 that 126 boreholes in Mogadishu were privately owned. There, water was sold at a price ranging from 0.8 to 1.5 US dollars per cubic metre. Additionally, 12 privately run shallow wells existed. In the IDP settlements KM13-15 Sarkust, Tabelaha Sheik Ibrahim, Jacadda Shabelle and Waydow, water was provided for free by humanitarian organisations. 309 Additionally, there were 600 water wells in Mogadishu, but no standards or regulatory bodies involved. 310 According to the WASH Cluster Somalia, the average price of water was 0.3 US dollars per barrel (200 litres) as of 25 May 2021. In most districts in Benadir under their assessment there have not been significant price changes since February 2021. 311 In 2017, the World Bank assessed that only 2 % of households lacked access to water and even 96 % of households had access to piped water at home. The assessment concluded that Mogadishu was least deprived in access to improved drinking water, by comparison to other parts of the country.

        "Country of origin information report | Somalia: Key socio-economic indicators 36 for drinking water were boreholes and water trucks. 312 Water trucking mainly serves outskirts and IDP camps, but also in these places access to piped water is increasingly available through tanks from where residents can buy water. 313 In July 2019, REACH inquired about coping strategies of people in case of water shortages during dry season. Although relocating was stated in other cities, informants in Benadir, as well as people belonging to ethnic minorities and people living with disabilities (PLWDs), did not mention it. Among the instances which would cause water shortages were, according to the informants, aid shortages. Aid shortages reportedly affected residents in Mogadishu in particular. 314 Regarding access to water in IDPs settlements, Bakonyi experienced a different picture of IDP sites in Mogadishu lacking access to piped water. Rather, they rely on water kiosks, thus on tanks, wells or pipes established in their neighbourhood, where they can buy water from the people owning or managing the kiosks. 315 ReDSS pointed out that access to water, sanitation and level of hygiene was not adequate in IDP settlements and that for IDPs it was difficult and expensive to access water. 316 In Mogadishu, 50 % of the privately sold piped water supplied corrugated iron sheet houses, 40 % villas and 10 % multi-storey concrete buildings. IDP settlements were served by water tankers. 317 IDPs and residents of informal settlements have greater difficulties accessing clean water and are less likely to have access to sanitary or latrine facilities, which are often lacking in informal settlements. Besides, water is less affordable to IDPs. 318 Water transport to IDP settlements is provided by tankers. 319 IOM reported in February 2021 the installation of a new solar powered water borehole in the Heliwa IDP site in Mogadishu that will serve 4 200 people. 320 In May 2021, a number of newly evicted IDP households did not have access to clean water at their new location in Daynile and had to buy water at a fee of 1 000 Somali shillings [1.7 US dollars] per 20 litre jerrycan. 321 An overview of the severity of WASH needs in IDP-hosting districts from September 2018 to January 2019 provided by REACH showed \u2018critical\u2019 needs in Mogadishu\u2019s districts Abdulaziz, Hawl Wadaag, Hodan, Waaberi and Wardhiigleey. In the 12 other districts the severity of WASH needs was \u2018high\u2019. 322 With regard to sanitation, the majority of IDPs used either ventilated improved pit latrine (VIP), pit latrine with slab, or pit latrine without slab (91 %). In Mogadishu, 1 % of the population, probably IDPs, had no access to toilets but used open defecation. 323 In December 2020, shelters, latrines and water distribution points in seven settlements in Benadir were reportedly destroyed by a landlord, who forcibly evicted nearly 7 000 IDPs. According to USAID, this incident put the evicted IDPs in urgent need of shelter and WASH support. 324 The 1 937 households reportedly evicted in May 2021 (see 312 World Bank (The), Somali Poverty and Vulnerability Assessment: Findings from Wave 2 of the Somali High Frequency Survey, April 2019, url, pp. 33, 38-39 313 Bakonyi, J., telephone interview, 28 July 2021 314 REACH, Somalia: Water, Sanitation, and Hygiene Assessment, December 2019, March 2020 url, pp. 14-15 315 Bakonyi, J., telephone interview, 13 July 2021 316 ReDSS et al., Durable Solutions Framework \u2013 Local Integration Focus: Benadir Region, Somalia, March 2017, url, p. 27; ReDSS, Somalia: Solutions Analysis Update 2019, 2019, url, p. 53 317 Bonnet, C. et al., Inclusive Shelter Provision in Mogadishu, 28 July 2020, url, p. 453 318 ReDSS et al., Durable Solutions Framework \u2013 Local Integration Focus: Benadir Region, Somalia, March 2017, url, p. 30; ReDSS, Somalia: Solutions Analysis Update 2019, 2019, url, p. 53; Bonnet, C. et al., Inclusive Shelter Provision in Mogadishu, 28 July 2020, url, pp. 451, 458 319 Bonnet, C. et al., Inclusive Shelter Provision in Mogadishu, 28 July 2020, url, p. 453 320 IOM, IOM Somalia: External Updates January & February 2021, 19 April 2021, url, p. 9 321 NRC and Somalia Protection Cluster, Rapid Assessment Report \u2013 Garasbaley Evictions, 30 May 2021, url, p. 5 322 REACH, Severity of needs in IDP-hosting districts: Detailed Site Assessment Somalia, September 2018 \u2013 January 2019, May 2019, url, p. 2 323 ReDSS et al., Durable Solutions Framework \u2013 Local Integration Focus: Benadir Region, Somalia, March 2017, url, p. 27 324 USAID, Somalia - Complex Emergency, 8 January 2021, url, p. 3 ",

At the previous site, 79 latrines had existed. 325 Floods compromised sanitation and increased the number of cholera cases. 326 In times of droughts less water for hygiene and sanitation was available and water contamination increased. 327 According to the Regional Durable Solutions Secretariat (ReDSS), poor water management in Benadir was another reason for the outbreak of diseases in 2019 and before. 328 The WHO reported in May 2021 that a current cholera outbreak with active transmissions in the Benadir region started in December 2017 following floods. Flash floods in April 2020 led to the contamination of water sources, which resulted in an increase in cholera cases. In 2021, the highest attack rate of cholera was reported from the districts of Danyile, Madina, and Dharkenly and the majority of deaths were reported in Benadir. 329 1.3.4 Health care According to a baseline survey of the Somali healthcare system published in May 2020, the essential health workforce (medical doctors, nurses and midwives) per 1 000 population in Somalia in 2017 was 0.4, the health facility density per 10 000 population was 1.69. 330 While most of Somalia\u2019s health facilities are located in larger cities including Mogadishu 331 , experts have described the healthcare situation in the capital as \u2018worrisome\u2019 332 or even absolutely insufficient. 333 Markus Hoehne estimated that the six largest hospitals in Mogadishu each have a capacity of between 25 and 200 beds, except for the public Benadir Hospital 334 , which has 500 beds. 335 325 NRC and Somalia Protection Cluster, Rapid Assessment Report \u2013 Garasbaley Evictions, 30 May 2021, url, pp. 2-3, 5 326 WHO, Epidemic and Pandemic-Prone Diseases: Outbreak Update \u2013 Cholera in Somalia, 7 March 2021, 23 March 2021, url 327 World Bank (The), Somali Poverty and Vulnerability Assessment: Findings from Wave 2 of the Somali High Frequency Survey, April 2019, url, p. xxii 328 ReDSS, Somalia: Solutions Analysis Update 2019, 2019, url, p. 53 329 WHO, Epidemic and Pandemic-Prone Diseases: Outbreak Update \u2013 Cholera in Somalia, 7 March 2021, 23 March 2021, url 330 Heritage Institute and City University of Mogadi shu, Somalia\u2019s Healthcare System: A Baseline Study & Human Capital Development Strategy, May 2020, url, p. 19 331 Denmark, DIS, Somalia - Health System, November 2020, url, p. 24 332 Heritage Institute and City University of Mogadishu, Somalia\u2019s Healthcare System: A Baseline Study & Human Capital Development Strategy, May 2020, url, p. 65 333 ACCORD, Somalia: Al-Schabaab und Sicherheitslage; Lage von Binnenvertriebenen und R\u00fcckkehrer\u00b7innen; Schutz durch staatliche und nicht-staatliche Akteure [Seminar with experts Markus Hoehne and Jutta Bakonyi [source: Jutta Bakonyi]], 31 May 2021, url, p. 28 334 ACCORD, Anfragebeantwortung zu Somalia: Umgang mit psychisch kranken Personen; Zugang zu Behandlung von psychischen Erkrankungen; Umgang mit alkoholabh\u00e4ngigen Personen und Gef\u00e4hrdung; Behandlungsm\u00f6glichkeiten von Alkoholabusus [Query response on Somalia: Situation of persons with mental illness; access to treatments for the mental ill; situation and risks facing persons addicted to alcohol; treatments for alcohol abuse [source: Markus Hoehne]], a-11559, 19 April 2021, url 335 Denmark, DIS, Somalia \u2013 Health System, November 2020, url, p. 46 ",

If drugs are available, they are distributed free of charge. 349 While private healthcare facilities provide specialised and, at times, advanced treatment, several sources have emphasised that the health sector is highly unregulated and that the types of se rvices and their quality are unknown. 350 A government source added that clinics are big business in Mogadishu and people from Somalia and other countries open private clinics. The source added that their qualification is not checked and they often lack equipment and are not able to do complicated procedures. 351 According to UNHCR, patients in private healthcare centres are obliged to pay for treatment. 352 Hoehne noted that in private healthcare facilities, patients have to pay for their surgeries, quoting local doctors as saying that for a small outpatient surgery (such as removal of an ulcer from the hand) the patient is charged approx. 50 USD, in addition to a 5-10 USD admission fee and some 30 USD for post-treatment with medicines. 353 Bakonyi added that \u2018phar macies and private practices charge for medication.\u2019 354 According to findings from a study published in 2017, the cost of private healthcare was unaffordable for a large part of the population. 355 Funding for the healthcare sector (just like the delivery of healthcare) has been described as \u2018fragmented\u2018. 356 The majority of funding comes from international donors and is \u2018channelled directly to healthcare providers through a patchwork of projects and instruments, rather than through government systems and budge ts.\u2019 357 T he assistance \u2018is mostly managed and distributed according to donor priorities and does not necessarily match the needs of the Somali health authorities.\u2019 The spending of the Somali government on health in 2017, 2018 and 2019 \u2018amounted to less than five percent of the total health sector expenditure\u2019. 358 A 2020 study for which representatives of government, UN agencies, NGOs, and health facility staff were interviewed noted that the \u2018health system was primarily funded through donors including the US government, the European Commission, and the governments of the UK, Germany, Italy, Sweden, Turkey and Qatar\u2019. The respondents added that \u2018these donors played an important role in determining what health services were provided\u2019. 359 According to a government source, Turkey has invested in three hospitals.

The source believes that Qatar has invested in one hospital and knows that Kuwait has invested in another hospital (which also treats COVID-19). Another donor are the Emirates. Italy has not opened any hospitals, but the Italian government finances health programmes throughout Somalia. Among the programmes are Mother and Child clinics, donating drugs/equipment to hospitals, and supporting the Ministry of Health and general health institution building in Mogadishu and the Federal Member States. 360 An assessment conducted in September 2020 found that \u2018severe access barrier s to basic health services\u2019 contributed to high morbidity and death rates among some IDP populations in Mogadishu. 361 As for the treatment prospects for persons with mental disorders, it has been noted that there is a \u2018particularly acute\u2019 shortage of mental health specialists. 362 According to estimates by local doctors, there are only about 15 psychiatrists across the country. In a few larger cities including Mogadishu, hospitals have psychiatric wards, although their capacity is very limited. 363 It has been noted that there are no institutions authorised to verify the qualifications of hospital staff working in mental healthcare. 364 While it has been noted that minority groups such as the Bantu, Tumaal, Rerhamar/Benadiri and Madhibani suffer from exclusion, rights violations and lack of protection 365 (for further information, please sections 4.1, 4.2 and 4.3 of EASO\u2019s COI report Somalia: Targeted profiles), the researchers of local studies commissioned by the Danish Immigration Service reportedly \u2018did not observe signs of clan- based discrimination in any of waiting rooms\u2019 of health facilities included in their research sample. The DIS referred to several sources emphasising that there is no clan-based discrimination with regard to access to healthcare. 366 Another report quoted the director of the Keysaney hospital, a facility run by the Somali Red Crescent (with the support of the International Committee of the Red Cross - ICRC), as saying that the hospital \u2018admits all patients regardless of their clan, religion or political affiliations\u2019. 367 Displaced persons and humanitarian workers interviewed in IDP camps in three districts in the Mogadishu area stated that IDP\u2019s access to healthcare is limited. Moreover, healthcare services have been scaled down by nearly half as a result of night-time curfews and other restrictions linked to the COVID-19 pandemic (including measures to limit crowding in clinics). 368 Mobile health services serve some outskirt camps on weekly or bi-weekly basis, but neither these services nor diagnosis or medication are regular.

Mogadishu accounted for over a third of all COVID-19 cases reported in Somalia between March and November 2020. 374 It has been reported that in March 2021, the country received a first batch of COVID-19 vaccines and launched the vaccination rollout in Mogadishu. 375 As Bakonyi noted most recently with reference to a Somali government official, a total of 500 000 doses has been delivered to Somalia from the United Kingdom and China. 376 By late April, \u2018a total of 121,743 people in Somalia [had] received their first doses of the Oxford Astra- Zeneca vaccine\u2019. 377 There was a lack of hospitals treating COVID- 19 patients. A May 2020 report cited Mogadishu\u2019s De Martino Hospital as the only facility dedicated to the treatment of COVID-19 cases. 378 In addition, a lack of medical equipment prevails, as BBC News reported in June 2021. The article quoted Dr Ubah Farah Ahmed, director of the family health department at Somalia's health ministry, saying that \u2018no government -run hospitals have oxygen plants. Only three private hospitals in the capital, Mogadishu, have them.\u2019 379 A 2021 report noted that according to some sources, free COVID-19 testing is offered by the De Martino hospital in Mogadishu. Other sources complained about \u2018a lack of testing facilities, or a refusal to test\u2019. 380 Displaced persons and humanitarian workers interviewed in IDP camps in three districts in the Mogadishu area stated that there were no COVID-19 testing facilities within IDP camps. 381 1.3.5 Education for children In principle, children\u2019s education is free and compulsory.

The curriculum declared \u2018Somali as the language of instruction for primary school, Islamic religious instruction at all levels, and Arabic-language Islamic religion courses at the secondary level.\u2019 387 Before, the educational system in Benadir was characterised by a \u2018curriculum chaos\u2019 and an inconsistent \u2018language policy\u2019 in formal basic schooling. 388 1.3.5.1 Public establishments Primary education includes dugsi hoose (primary school), which covers the first four years of education beginning at the age of six, followed by four years of dugsi dhexe (intermediate school). Secondary education is differentiated between vocational secondary school (two years), dugsi sare (general secondary school) and technical secondary school (both four years). 389 In interviews, Bakonyi reported an amount of about 10 US dollars per month for public primary education in Mogadishu. 390 According to informants to the Finnish fact-finding mission, the few public schools charged fees ranging from 15 to 25 US dollars for part-time to 40 to 50 US dollars for full-time per month. 391 1.3.5.2 Confessional or private school Education in urban areas is primarily provided by various non-state actors. 392 Most children access education through confessional schools. Previously, the leading provider of private education was FPENS (Formal Private Education Network in Somalia), an umbrella organization formed by Islamic charities. 393 Since the integration of the edu cation into the ministry\u2019s control, FPENS has lost influence. 394 In addition to the secular school system, many madrasa s (Islamic schools) in Somali called dugsi Quran 395 (Quran school) exist in Mogadishu, and they play an important role. Most people try to send their children to both secular and Islamic schools. Those, who cannot afford secular schools, rather send their children to madrasa s. For madrasa s fees apply as well, but they are usually lower and teachers tend to be \u2018more lenient\u2019 and children will not be expelled immediately if the parents cannot pay the amount. Generally, there is a lenient attitude to a varying degree in other schools as well depending on the location and the teachers. 396 383 Federal Republic of Somalia, Provisional Constitution, 1 August 2012, url, Article 30 (1-2); World Bank (The), Somalia Education for Human Capital Development Project (P172434), 10 March 2021, url, p. 4 384 Bakonyi, J., telephone interview, 28 July 2021 385 USDOS, International Religious Freedom Report 2020 - Somalia, 12 May 2021, url, p. 5 386 World Bank (The), Somalia Education for Human Capital Development Project (P172434), 10 March 2021, url, p. 4 387 USDOS, International Religious Freedom Report 2020 - Somalia, 12 May 2021, url, p. 5 388 Gonnelli, M., The Italophone Somali Diaspora and Social Change in Somalia, PhD Thesis, 27 November 2018, url, p. 76 389 AACRAO, Somalia, n.d., url 390 Bakonyi, J., communication, 7 July 2021 391 Finland, FIS, Somalia: Fact-finding mission to Mogadishu in March 2020, Security situation and humanitarian conditions in Mogadishu, 7 August 2020, url, p. 31 392 World Bank (The), Somalia Education for Human Capital Development Project (P172434), 10 March 2021, url, p. 5 393 Gonnelli, M., The Italophone Somali Diaspora and Social Change in Somalia, PhD Thesis, 27 November 2018, url, p. 74 394 Bakonyi, J., telephone interview, 28 July 2021 395 Some sources refer to the Somali madrasa or Quran school simply as dugsi . 396 Bakonyi, J., communication, 7 July 2021 ",

There, enrolment was free at first, but uniforms and materials were not included. Later, private operators 400 or Islamic charities 401 took over and charged school attendance fees in order to maintain them. 402 1.3.5.4 Enrolment and attendance In primary schools, the net attendance ratio (NAR) 403 was 19.7 % for boys and 17.2 % for girls; at the secondary level, the NAR was 10.6 % for boys and 7.9 % for girls. 404 The NAR, literacy and enrolment rates were higher in urban than in rural areas but very low among nomadic households. 405 The gross attendance ration (GAR) 406 was 28.6 % for boys and 25.2 % for girls in primary education; at the secondary level, it was 28.1 % for boys and 19.6 % for girls. These countrywide figures showed a small gender imbalance at the primary level and a greater gender imbalance at the secondary level. 407 Oxfam and SSWC (Save Somali Women and Children) in 2021 presented data on primary enrolment in Benadir of 90.3 %, the highest rate in South Central Somalia, 408 Refugees International, however, claimed in December 2019 that only 30 % of IDP children attended school. 409 Such, numbers are often contradicting each other if one assumes that 500 000 IDPs live in Mogadishu, and a large percentage of the population in Mogadishu is considered poor. 410 A development organisation operating in Somalia told the Finnish fact-finding mission in March 2020 that many low-income families could not afford education for their children. 411 According to a document published by the Ministry of Planning, Investment and Economic Development presumably in 2019, enrolment of children aged 6-13 ranked 397 World Bank (The), Somalia Education for Human Capital Development Project (P172434), 10 March 2021, url, p. 5 398 Finland, FIS, Somalia: Fact-finding mission to Mogadishu in March 2020, Security situation and humanitarian conditions in Mogadishu, 7 August 2020, url, p. 31 399 GPE, Somalia, 30 May 2021, url; Gonnelli, M., The Italophone Somali Diaspora and Social Change in Somalia, PhD Thesis, 27 November 2018, url, p. 75 400 Bakonyi, J., communication, 7 July 2021 401 Gonnelli, M., The Italophone Somali Diaspora and Social Change in Somalia, PhD Thesis, 27 November 2018, url, p. 74 402 Bakonyi, J., communication, 7 July 2021 403 NAR = the proportion of children at school age attending school (6-13 for primary school, 14-17 for secondary school), see Somalia and UNFPA, The Somali Health and Demographic Survey 2020, April 2020, url, p. 24 404 Somalia and UNFPA, The Somali Health and Demographic Survey 2020, April 2020, url, p. 25 405 World Bank (The), Somali Poverty and Vulnerability Assessment: Findings from Wave 2 of the Somali High Frequency Survey, April 2019, url, p. 38; Somalia and UNFPA, The Somali Health and Demographic Survey 2020, April 2020, url, p. 25 406 GAR = the total number of school students relative to the official school-age population, see Somalia and UNFPA, The Somali Health and Demographic Survey 2020, April 2020, url, p. 24 407 Somalia and UNFPA, The Somali Health and Demographic Survey 2020, April 2020, url, p. 25 408 Oxfam and SSWC, Gender Gap Assessment - South Central Somalia and Puntland, 11 January 2021, url, p. 41 409 Refugees International, Durable Solutions in Somalia: Moving from Policies to Practice for IDPs in Mogadishu, December 2019, url, p. 15 410 Bakonyi, J., telephone interview, 13 July 2021 411 Finland, FIS, Somalia: Fact-finding mission to Mogadishu in March 2020, Security situation and humanitarian conditions in Mogadishu, 7 August 2020, url, p. 32 ",

The attendance rate in relation to the numbers of enrolments was particularly low in Benadir with 61 % (70 % boys and 51 % girls). Computed numbers of enrolled learners with physical disabilities were 0.07 % of the total enrolment rate at primary level in Benadir. All of them were boys. The same figures applied for hearing and visually impaired learners. 36 % of displaced boys and 30 % of displaced girls participated in an integration programme at primary level. In four surveyed primary schools in Benadir, the number of children per classroom were 36 on average. In only one out of the four schools, classroom furniture was adequate. 414 Benadir had the second highest secondary enrolment rate in South Central Somalia and Puntland. When asked about the reasons why their children did not attend secondary school, 83.3 % of the responding parents in Puntland and South Central Somalia told Oxfam and SSCW they had no money to send them to school. 415 Despite the constitutional declaration, fees apply for all secondary schools, and only few of them operate in Mogadishu. 416 1.3.5.5 Teaching quality In September 2020, secondary schools in Mogadishu reported massive failure in the national examination. In response, the Education Minister Goddah Barre spoke of poor quality of tutors. 417 The World Bank noted in March 2021 that Benadir had among the lowest number of qualified primary teachers. Results of an assessment of teachers in Benadir in 2019 showed that they lacked both pedagogical skills and content knowledge. 418 1.3.5.6 School closures Children\u2019s education was disrupted by school closures due to the COVID -19 pandemic from March 2020 with partial reopenings for examinations in July 2020. 419 Alternative learning platforms were implemented in cooperation with the Ministry of Education at the Federal level and member states, and safe return to school campaigns were undertaken together with education stakeholders across the country. 420 A teacher in Mogadishu said that children had no access to online classes for primary and secondary education during the time of the school closure. 421 In June 2021, Save the Children reported that the number of enrolled children in Mogadishu had decreased by 17.3 % compared to the time before the school closures. 422 The organisation conducted interviews with school children\u2019s 412 Somalia, MoPIED, Somalia National Development Plan 2020 to 2024: The Path to a Just, Stable and Prosperous Somalia, [2019], url, p. 262 413 World Bank (The), Somali Poverty and Vulnerability Assessment: Findings from Wave 2 of the Somali High Frequency Survey, April 2019, url, p. 39 414 Wafula, C. and Mulongo, G., Are Children in South and Central Somalia Accessing Education, and Are They Learning?

Girls, in particular, faced a higher risk of violence and exploitation by their families as well as of being forced into early marriage. 425 Similarly, Save the Children warned of children\u2019s risk of being forced into child marriage, child labour, or domestic chores when not continuing their education. 426 1.3.6 Means of basic subsistence and employment In Mogadishu, 64 % of households were engaged in wage labour in 2019, according to calculations based on the 2nd Somali High Frequency Survey conducted in 2017. 427 Sources interviewed for a report on a Finnish fact-finding mission in March 2020 stated that employment opportunities in Mogadishu were \u2018limited\u2019 and the best jobs among the few ones on offer were \u2018usually taken\u2019. 428 Reportedly, work opportunities were offered by building sites (wages can be approx. 100 USD per month), the Port of Mogadishu, NGOs, the Somali government and by security forces such as the police and the military. 429 According to Bakonyi, all following salary data are estimates only. Local sources indicated that people working with the United Nations or international NGOs are better paid and can earn between 1 000 (starting salary) and 5 000 USD, which is why these jobs are in high demand. A member of parliament currently earns 3 500 USD. The salaries of most skilled jobs such as university lecturers, professors and civil servants were estimated to range between 400 and 700 USD (senior level), a teacher earns between 200 and 400 USD per month and a housemaid (full time) between 50 and 70 USD per month. 430 There were no precise statistics on unemployment, but the figure was estimated to be high. 431 Public health measures to contain the spread of COVID-19 have severely impacted people\u2019s income and livelihoods. 432 Regarding the labour situation in the formal sector, a World Bank/UNIDO survey of private businesses across five major cities in Somalia (including Mogadishu) found that the rate of employment dropped by 30 % as a result of COVID measures. The World Bank notes that while micro-enterprises (the most common type of formal-sector business in Somalia) were generally reported to be \u2018less affected [\u2026] compared to large firms\u2019, some 31 % of these 423 Save the Children, Somalia: Coronavirus, conflict and climate crisis prevent children return to learning, Save the Children warns, 1 June 2021, url 424 UNICEF, Somalia: Humanitarian Situation Report No. 4, April 2021, url, p. 3 425 Herring, E. et al., COVID-19 Responses and Education in Somalia/Somaliland, 20 October 2020, url, p. 214 426 Save the Children, Somalia: Coronavirus, conflict and climate crisis prevent children return to learning, Save the Children warns, 1 June 2021, url 427 World Bank (The), Somali Poverty and Vulnerability Assessment: Findings from Wave 2 of the Somali High Frequency Survey, April 2019, url, p. 51 428 Finland, FIS, Somalia: Fact-finding mission to Mogadishu in March 2020, Security situation and humanitarian conditions in Mogadishu, 7 August 2020, url, p. 32 429 Finland, FIS, Somalia: Fact-finding mission to Mogadishu in March 2020, Security situation and humanitarian conditions in Mogadishu, 7 August 2020, url, p. 33 430 Bakonyi, J., telephone interview, 28 July 2021 431 Finland, FIS, Somalia: Fact-finding mission to Mogadishu in March 2020, Security situation and humanitarian conditions in Mogadishu, 7 August 2020, url, p. 33 432 Braam, D.

        "Country of origin information report | Somalia: Key socio-economic indicators 46 enterprises in Mogadishu had to suspend their activities, and over 90 % reported shortfalls in liquidity. 433 According to UNOCHA, most poor households in urban centres like Mogadishu (these include IDP households, the non-IDP urban poor and/or migrants from rural areas) have to rely on casual labour to secure an income. 434 The Finnish fact-finding mission quoted an international organisation as saying that many in Mogadishu lived from small-scale sales at markets or worked at restaurants and tea shops. UNHCR noted that women selling fruit at markets usually earn a maximum of 1-2 USD per day. 435 A 2020 study on Bajaj drivers in Mogadishu stated that more than 60 % of the 400 surveyed respondents said their average income was about 15-20 USD a day. 436 Vulnerable and uneducated persons are particularly affected by \u2018severe lack of access to the labour market in urban settings\u2019. 437 This situation is compounded by a steady influx of displaced people from the countryside that has resulted in increased competition for urban livelihoods. 438 Concerning the impact of COVID measures on the informal sector, in a recent qualitative study conducted among IDPs and host population members in Mogadishu (Daynile district) and Baidoa, respondents emphasised that it was the COVID- related lockdowns, curfews and restrictions on travel (rather than the disease itself) that had the most significant impact on their daily lives, with the studied population described by the authors as being \u2018highly dependent on daily wage labour\u2019. Nearly half of the respondents reported that they had lost their incomes and/or their jobs as a result of these measures, although \u2018the level to which people were affected economically, depended on the type of livelihood or other daily activity such as education or household responsibilities\u2019. 439 For example, as reported by the Somalia Public Agenda, small roadside businesses like small cafes or restaurants that used to operate both day and night were affected by the night-time curfews and have lost large numbers of customers. Some have been forced to close. Similarly, curfews and reduced numbers of passengers have affected the city\u2019s important rickshaw (bajaj) business, and \u2018many middle -sized hotels have either temporarily closed or reduced t heir catering capacity\u2019. 440 According to a 2020 study by IOM and the local research firm Raagsan Consulting in Mogadishu, \u2018woman -owned businesses have been especially hard- hit\u2019. Nearly 60 % of the female- led businesses surveyed said \u2018they had been forced to shut down during the pandemic, with about one third of that group closing permanently.\u2019 441 Strategies employed by residents to cope with the drop or loss of income included buying less, living off savings or relying on one\u2019s family network. 442 Remittances from family members and relatives (though not accessible for most IDPs) have been playing a significant role as a coping mechanism in Somalia. 443 However, as family members (including those living abroad) were affected by job loss, illness or inability to travel to Somalia during the pandemic, remittances decreased. 444 According to 433 World Bank (The), Coronavirus and fragility: The impact of COVID- 19 on Somalia\u2019s private sector, 13 January 2021, url 434 UNOCHA, Humanitarian Needs Overview \u2013 Somalia, 9 March 2021, url, p. 8 435 Finland, FIS, Somalia: Fact-finding mission to Mogadishu in March 2020, Security situation and humanitarian conditions in Mogadishu, 7 August 2020, url, pp. 33-34 436 SRA, A Closer Look at Bajaj Drivers in Mogadishu-Somalia, 2020, url, p. 4 437 UNOCHA, Humanitarian Needs Overview \u2013 Somalia, 9 March 2021, url, p. 8 438 UNOCHA, Humanitarian Needs Overview \u2013 Somalia, 9 March 2021, url, p. 23 439 Braam, D.

By September, at leas t half of people surveyed nationwide reported receiving less remittances.\u2019 446 1.4 Social protection networks and (lack of) support to specific groups 1.4.1 Clan-based protection In Mogadishu, the Hawiye clan, and in particular their Abgaal and Habar Gidir subclans are reported as constituting a majority influencing political processes and a significant part of the government forces. 447 Apart from these, most clans (or even all clans 448 ) are represented in Mogadishu. 449 The majority of the city\u2019s district s are heterogeneous in terms of clan affiliation, 450 but according to a World Bank report \u2018 the dominant clans of these districts invoke the right to govern and enjoy most of whatever \u201crents\u201d accrue from control of the district, such as local taxes, jobs, and contracts\u2019. 451 The Hawiye clans have been campaigning for the creation of a clan-based Benadir Federal Member State (with Mogadishu as its capital), arguing that Hawiye are the only clan family without political representation, but the Federal Government of Somalia (FGS) has so far rejected these demands according to a 2021 World Bank report. The debate whether Mogadishu should be governed by locally dominant clans like other Federal Member States (FMS) or should be considered as capital belonging to all clans, remains undecided at this point. 452 For more details, please see section 7.3.1 of EASO\u2019s COI report Somalia: Actors, published in July 2021. A report by the Finnish Immigration Service states that while there are certain freedoms for people outside the powerful lineages (e.g. regarding freedom of movement), clan networks play a very important role in Mogadishu. 453 The UNHCR confirms this in it s assessment that \u2018people without strong social networks and financially capable relatives will not be able to access financial support\u2019 454 . It has been noted that if someone wished to engage in business-related activities of any significant scale, this would require the support of the dominant clan groups that wield economic and political power. 455 Indeed, most of Mogadishu\u2019s districts are treated as the domains of their most numerically and \u2018politically dominant sub - clans\u2019 456 , while only few administration heads belong to groups other than 445 Somalia Public Agenda, The impact of Covid-19 on the informal economy of Mogadishu, 4 June 2020, url 446 Braam, D.

This, according to a World Bank report, \u2018works against the transparent, merit-based, and equitable allocation of resources that serve more marginalized groups\u2019. 458 As outlined in EASO\u2019s report Somalia: Actors from July 2021, the clan network provides protection and solidarity among its members and members of other clans with whom an arrangement has been concluded, as well as towards closely affiliated individuals outside the clan context. 459 However, a fact- finding report by the Norwegian Organisation for Asylum Seekers (NOAS) from 2014 stated that the scope of protection was only limited, particularly in Mogadishu, where many districts were generally deemed unsafe. Furthermore, protection for members of minority clans was weaker than for members of strong clans. 460 Minority groups like the Bantu, Tumaal, Reer Hamar/Benadiri, and Madhiban occupy a weak position in society, some are subjected to racist discriminations 461 or \u2018removed from the clan -based support system that gives others a safety net and protection.\u2019 462 Geographically, most IDPs live clustered in \u2018peri - urban areas\u2019, and belong to non -dominant clan groups. They are, therefore, both physically and socially excluded from network-reliant services. Moreover, many IDPs come from rural areas in southern Somalia and lack the skills needed to secure livelihoods in an urban environment, which confines them to low-paid day jobs 463 or exhausting petty entrepreneurial activities. 464 Returnees who have been absent for several years with little clan contact may also lack clan support. 465 Thus, marginalised groups lack financial means and face difficulties when it comes to acquiring land, defending land ownership rights or jobs. 466 Indeed, it has been reported that people from minority groups have much lower chances \u2018of getting a job, even if they are educated and have a university degree\u2019 and even when it comes to employment in \u2018the Somali government or international organisations\u2019. 467 Meanwhile, many people from minority groups enter \u2018into an alliance with local powerful clans in order to p rotect themselves against instability and legal infringements\u2019 468 Moreover, an expert noted that within the same clan, not every member is treated equally. People may be favoured or disadvantaged based on their wealth, specific patrilineal lineage, gender (men are advantaged in the patrilinear logic) or the morality of their behaviour. For instance, individuals who have suffered rape, committed crimes, consumed drugs or otherwise display fragility may find less support within their family networks or wider society.

Meanwhile, Bakonyi emphasised that networks of families, neighbours, and friends are highly significant for returnees. The support they may be able to muster depends, among others, on whether a person has maintained social networks (including clan-based networks) and can upon return mobilise help from it. In a similar vein, clan-based networks play a crucial role, which is why most returnees (though not all) settle in areas where they can find members of their own clan. 475 1.4.2.2 Vulnerable groups Endemic insecurity, recurrent violence and climatic shocks have left a large segment of the population vulnerable and with few coping mechanisms.

        "Country of origin information report | Somalia: Key socio-economic indicators 50 According to UNOCHA, IDPs \u2018have limited livelihood assets and options, and therefore often rely on external humanitarian assistance\u2019, adding that their situation \u2018has worsened in the COVID -19 pandemic context with declined remittances, increased food prices, and declined employment and income earning opportunities (particularly in urban areas).\u2019 477 Accordingly, \u2018IDPs are the most impoverished demographic group in urban centres\u2019, with IDP settlements often \u2018g overned by gatekeepers, and overcrowded\u2019. 478 \u2018Gatekeepers\u2018 organise IDP camps and act as middlepersons between IDPs, humanitarian organisations and landowners. 479 They play a pivotal role in the operation of IDP camps and also provide basic services for a fee (including emergency medical care 480 ), albeit \u2018usually of very poor quality\u2019 481 , thus \u2018fill[ing] a vacuum left by a weak government incapable of meeting those n eeds, and a humanitarian community limited in its operations by Mogadishu\u2019s prevailing insecurity\u2019. 482 According to a 2019 report, gatekeepers have \u2018established themselves as unavoidable actors in relation to aid delivery to IDPs, positioning themselves as intermediaries between the displaced and external actors, including the local government and the humanitarian community.\u2019 483 It has been reported that when humanitarian aid is delivered, gatekeepers and/or landowners reportedly keep a share of this delivery 484 , using them as rents for their land or services. 485 Gatekeepers have thus been criticised as being criminal and abusive, preventing humanitarian organisations from directly accessing IDPs, but others have also noted that gatekeepers may \u2018care deeply about the well - being\u2018 of the camp inhabitants 486 or at least support the IDPs initial settlement and ability to navigate the city. 487 For more information on IDPs, please see sections 1.1.2.3 Displacement and humanitarian assistance, 1.2.3 Accessing and settling in the city and 1.3.2.3 Informal settlements and IDP sites. Persons with disabilities According to UNOCHA, \u2018persons with disabilities are often excluded from humanitarian assistance either due to exploitation, pre-existing discrimination and stigma or due to a lack of adequate consideration\u2019. 488 A representative of an organisation for the rights of disabled persons in Somalia stated that international aid does often not reach Somalia\u2019s disabled community and that \u2018the UN and the international a gencies don\u2019t give much priority and attention\u2019 to persons with disabilities. 489 477 UNOCHA, Humanitarian Response Plan, Somalia, 15 February 2021 , url, p. 22 478 UNOCHA, Humanitarian Needs Overview \u2013 Somalia, 9 March 2021, url, p. 23 479 ACCORD, Somalia: Al-Schabaab und Sicherheitslage; Lage von Binnenvertriebenen und R\u00fcckkehrer\u00b7innen; Schutz durch staatliche und nicht-staatliche Akteure [Seminar with experts Markus Hoehne and Jutta Bakonyi] [source: Jutta Bakonyi], 31 May 2021, url, pp. 19-20; see also Bakonyi, J., The Political Economy of Displacement: Rent Seeking, Dispossessions and Precarious Mobility in Somali Cities, 15 October 2020, url, pp. 13-14 480 TNH, Somalia\u2019s displacement camp \u2018gatekeepers\u2019 \u2013 \u2018parasites\u2019 or aid partners?, 18 July 2019, url 481 IIED et al., Access to shelter and services for low-income groups: lessons from Hawassa, Mogadishu and Nairobi on the politics of informal settlements and shelter access, October 2019, url, p. 5 482 TNH, Somalia\u2019s displacement camp \u2018gatekeepers\u2019 \u2013 \u2018parasites\u2019 or aid partners?, 18 July 2019, url 483 IIED et al., Access to shelter and services for low-income groups: lessons from Hawassa, Mogadishu and Nairobi on the politics of informal settlements and shelter access, October 2019, url, p. 5 484 ACCORD, Somalia: Al-Schabaab und Sicherheitslage; Lage von Binnenvertriebenen und R\u00fcckkehrer\u00b7innen; Schutz durch staatliche und nicht-staatliche Akteure [Seminar with experts Markus Hoehne and Jutta Bakonyi] [source: Jutta Bakonyi], 31 May 2021, url, pp. 19-20 485 Bakonyi, J., communication, 7 July 2021 486 TNH, Somalia\u2019s displacement camp \u2018gatekeepers\u2019 \u2013 \u2018parasites\u2019 or aid part ners?, 18 July 2019, url 487 Bakonyi, J., communication, 7 July 2021 488 UNOCHA, Humanitarian Response Plan, Somalia, 15 February 2021, url, p. 20 489 ACCORD, Anfragebeantwortung zu Somalia: Mogadischu: Informationen zu Repressalien, Diskriminierung oder sonstiger Ausgrenzung gegen\u00fcber k\u00f6rperlich behinderten Personen; gesundheitliche Unterst\u00fctzung f\u00fcr k\u00f6rperlich behinderte ",
        "Country of origin information report | Somalia: Key socio-economic indicators 51 Moreover, the source adds, \u2018exc lusion leads disabled to falls further into chronic poverty with little opportunity of breaking out of the cycle. When the main family breadwinner becomes disabled the whole households risks sliding more deeply into poverty.\u2019 490 The COVID-19 pandemic, with its impact on an \u2018already fragile\u2019 healthcare system and socio -economic welfare mechanisms has further exacerbated the pre-existing dire situation of vulnerable groups. 491 Women and girls While women are not per se vulnerable, they are generally disadvantaged in the patriarchal social set up of Somalia and thus, they are more likely to become vulnerable than men. Gender disparities in education, the social obligation towards unpaid care-work, the increased risk of women to become victims of gender-based and domestic violence and their exclusion from (political) decision making contribute to their overall increased vulnerability. 492 The gendered division of labour can force women from poor urban households to take on jobs or to engage in entrepreneurial activities that bear a high risk of exploitation and even violence. It limits participation of women in better paid socio-economic activities and, in case of divorce or death of male partners, makes women more prone to poverty and precarity. The unequal access to inheritance and land ownership additionally increases their dependence on male family members and partners. 493 DIS and DRC in a report on a fact-finding mission conducted in December 2017 cite an anonymous source as saying that \u2018the situation is particularly dire for single women without a clan network and women who are internally displaced. The existence of a clan network can offer an individual, including a single woman, a level of protection.\u2019 494 The same source adds that in Mogadishu, single women without a network are particularly vulnerable to violence and that the situation in IDP camps makes them even more vulnerable to SGBV (Sexual and Gender Based Violence). 495 According to a 2019 report by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Netherlands, the lack of protection in combination with the patriarchal system results in discrimination and exclusion of single women. 496 According to Bakonyi, the position of women who are divorced or widowed depends on their social and economic situation, and to some extend on them and their children\u2019s\u2019 clan affiliation (children belong to the clan of the father) and the support network they can mobilise. Male family members (fathers, brothers of the father) are often favoured when it comes to custody of children and inheritance (here brother of the women).

Garowe 2.1 Garowe\u2019s overview Garowe city (sometimes written \u2018Garoowe\u2019) is located in the Garowe district, one of the four districts of the Nugaal region, which lies in the Nugaaleed Valley (sometimes referred to as Nogal or Nugal Valley), in Puntland, a federal member state of Somalia situated to the north-east of the country. Puntland borders Ethiopia to the southwest, the Indian Ocean to the east, the Gulf of Aden to the North, Somaliland to the northwest (disputed border area) and the Galmudug state of Somalia to the south (disputed border). 498 Garowe city is located between two riverbeds which are dry except for the rainy seasons ( Deyr from October to November and Gu from April to June). Garowe\u2019s climate is arid. 499 After Bosasso and Galkacyo (also Galkayo), Garowe is the third-largest city in Puntland and the administrative capital of the self-declared autonomous state (since 1998) of Puntland. 500 The executive, parliamentary and judiciary branches of the state are based in Garowe. 501 In January 2019, Said Abdullahi Deni and Ahmed Elmi Karash were elected respectively as President and Vice-President of Puntland. 502 Since the end of August 2018, Ahmed Said Muse holds the position of mayor of Garowe. 503 2.1.1 Demographics and clan composition 2.1.1.1 Puntland Since the establishment of Puntland as an autonomous region in 1998, Garowe\u2019s population significantly increased. 504 In 2012, Puntland became the first federal member state of Somalia. 505 497 Bakonyi, J., telephone interview, 28 July 2021 498 UN-Habitat, Garowe Urban Profile, May 2019, url, p. 6; Encyclopaedia Britannica, Nugaaleed Valley, last updated 20 July 1998, url; KAALO and OXFAM, Gender Analysis of the Impact of Recent Humanitarian Crises on Women, Men, Girls, and Boys in Puntland State in Somalia, April 2021, url, p. 10; Str\u00f8h Varming, K., The Experiential Limits Of The State: Territory And taxation In Garoowe, Puntland, 2017, url, p. 8 499 UN-Habitat, Garowe Urban Profile, May 2019, url, p. 10; BBC News, Puntland profile, 11 March 2019, url; Jama, A.

        "Country of origin information report | Somalia: Key socio-economic indicators 53 The Puntland government estimated its population at 2.4 million in 2003 506 and at 4.3 million in 2016 507 . Puntland\u2019s population is th e densest in urban areas such as Bosasso, Galkacyo, and the capital, Garowe. 508 However, in a 2017 research paper, social scientist Str\u00f8h Varming cautions that in the Somali territories, census \u2018 refore have been scarce and highly disputed since the 1980s, and the reliable figures are hard to come by \u2019. 509 According to Str\u00f8h Varming, Puntland\u2019s growth in the last decades is due in part to people from the Majeerteen clans - Darood returning \u2018from Somalia to their nd other urban areas in south Mogadishu a \u201coriginal\u201d clan territories in Puntland\u2019 attracted by the relative peace and stability in Puntland. 510 Puntland\u2019s population growth is also attributed to the influx of IDPs from the other regions and refugees from Ethiopia and Yemen, many of Somali descent. 511 The towns of Galkacyo, Bosasso, 000 IDPs based on data Garden, Goldogob, Burtinle, and Garowe hosted an estimated number of 270 from the Economic Commission for Africa from 2013. 512 A more current number for the estimated total number of IDPs in Puntland by UNHCR is 388 500. 513 For further general information on Puntland, please see section 7.6 of EASO\u2019s COI report Somalia: Actors, published in July 2021. 2.1.1.2 Garowe district and Garowe City The urban population of Garowe district, which is by and large identical with Garowe city 514 , increased steadily in the past decades. UN-Habitat compared data by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) from 2005 with an estimate by the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) from 2014 counting an urban population of almost 100 000 in Garowe district, indicating that \u2018the population has more than doubled in less than 10 years\u2019. The same source noted that these figures differ in the summer and the winter due to the influx of inhabitants from the coastal region who leave hot summer temperatures and high humidity behind. 515 Garowe experienced rapid urban growth after the central government\u2019s collapse in 1991 and partly also due to its status as political and administrative capital of Puntland. IDPs and returnees fleeing conflict in other parts of the country, as well as Ethiopian and Yemeni refugees, contributed to the growth. 516 2.1.1.3 Clans The Majeerteen \u2013 who belong to the Harti branch of the Darood clan-family 517 \u2013 constitute the vast majority of the population of Puntland, including Garowe. 518 They are the dominant group in Puntland. 506 Puntland State of Somalia, Puntland Ministry of Planning and International Cooperation, Puntland facts and figures 2003, 2003, url, p. 11 507 Puntland State of Somalia, Puntland Ministry of Planning and International Cooperation, Department of Statistics, Puntland facts and figures 2012-2017, url, p. 3 508 KAALO and OXFAM, Gender Analysis of the Impact of Recent Humanitarian Crises on Women, Men, Girls, and Boys in Puntland State in Somalia, April 2021, url, p. 10 509 Str\u00f8h Varming, K., The Experiential Limits Of The State: Territory And taxation In Garoowe, Puntland, 2017, url, p. 31, endnote 6; see also US, CIA, The World Factbook Somalia, last updated 27 July 2021, url 510 Str\u00f8h Varming, K., The Experiential Limits Of The State: Territory And taxation In Garoowe, Puntland, 2017, url, p. 10 511 UN-Habitat, Garowe Urban Profile, May 2019, url, p. 8; Str\u00f8h Varming, K., The Experiential Limits Of The State: Territory And taxation In Garoowe, Puntland, 2017, url, p. 10; see also Jama, A.

        "Country of origin information report | Somalia: Key socio-economic indicators 54 The three main sub-clans of the Majeerteen are the Osman Mahamoud (also Osman Mahmud, settled in and around Qardho and Bosasso), the Omar Mahmoud (also Omar Mahmud, settled in and around Galkacyo) and the Isse Mahmoud (also Issa Mahmud, settled in and around Garowe). Garowe District and Garowe city were established on the territory of the Isse Mahmoud. Therefore, they are the traditional inhabitants of the Garowe district, Garowe city included. Since Garowe City is the capital of Puntland, people of the other Majeerteen sub-clans have come to settle in the city, as well as people from other clans. 519 In 2017, Kristine Str\u00f8h Varming who conducted fieldwork in Garowe city wrote about clan identity: \u2018Particularly in major towns like Boosaaso and Garoowe, [\u2026] clan diversity \u2013 although still primarily within Darood, but also with the presence of other Harti clans (Dhulbahante, Warsangeli and Marehan, Isaaq from Somaliland and Rahanweyn from Baydhabo) \u2013 is becoming more prevalent due to rapid urbanization and internal migration.\u2019 520 2.1.2 Humanitarian situation overview 2.1.2.1 General information Puntland regularly faces droughts and floods, locusts, which tend to render its population vulnerable and impede its access to food, income, education, and health. According to KAALO and Oxfam Puntlanders\u2019 livelihoods, livestock, and land are \u2018decimated\u2019 by climatic shocks (general inconsistent and drastic climate variability as well as less common meteorological events like Cyclone Gati in November 2020) and recent locust infestations. 521 Puntland is notably threatened by water shortages. Pre-drought conditions have been found by local authorities, UNOCHA, and partners in Puntland and other regions of Somalia in December 2020 and January 2021. The assessment noted \u2018 widely depleted berkeds 522 and shallow wells, loss of livestock, as well as extensive critical loss of pasture \u2019. 523 Puntland has been affected by a desert locust infestation, which showed signs of decline in March 2021. However, in the plateaus of Garowe, among other locations, newly formed immature swarms were observed. 524 The Food Security and Nutrition Analysis Unit (FSNAU) in Somalia points to the risk for Gu season crop production as well as pasture availability (already impacted by previous drought conditions) posed by desert locust hatching and band formation. 525 21 settlements are home to close to 5 400 IDP households in and around Garowe, according to Shelter Cluster as of 2016. 526 Parts of this large IDP population was relocated to sites at the city\u2019s south - eastern outskirts which lack a proper integration within the city\u2019s urban fabric. 527 Sites assessments conducted by the Global Camp Coordination and Camp Management (CCCM) Cluster from December 2020 to March 2021 classified IDPs\u2019 needs in terms of protection, health and water, sanitation and ACCORD, Clans in Somalia - Report on a Lecture by Joakim Gundel, COI Workshop Vienna, 15 May 2009 (Revised Edition), 15 December 2009, url, p. 12; UNOCHA, Somalia: Clan Distribution Map, 15 February 2013, url 519 Hoehne, M.

The World Health Organization has set up three molecular COVID-19 testing laboratories that are located in Mogadishu, Garowe and Hargeisa.

The (IOM) was charged to equip the new airport with the Mig ration Information and Data Analysis System (MIDAS), IOM\u2019s border management information system, to allow Garowe International Airport to collect passenger information. 539 Somalia federal authorities banned international flights on 5 March 2020, with the exception of humanitarian flights. Among others, Somali diaspora\u2019s seasonal return to Puntland in the summer was thus disrupted. 540 As of July 2021, flights appeared to be landing in Garowe airport again. 541 2.2.2 Internal mobility, including checkpoints 2.2.2.1 Circulation within the city Garowe city is located at the crossroad of three main commercial roads: Garowe-Laascanood, Garowe- Galkacyo and Garowe-Bosasso. 542 Garowe city is cut in two by the paved National Road, which became the principal town road as the city grew and is nowadays prone to congestions affecting the transport of goods and people. UN-Habitat reported that as of May 2019 existed only a few tarmac roads inside the town. The same source reported that in the absence of walkways or parking spaces, \u2018vehicles share the streets with small vendors and pedestrians\u2019. Transportation within the city and from Garowe city to other towns is carried out by private taxis or other privately-owned means of transportation; there is no government-owned public transport system in the city. 543 The ever-growing number of private vehicles in Garowe city led to the opening of numerous gas stations throughout the town. 544 Several restrictions were put in place by Puntland\u2019s government to manage the spread of COVID -19, including a night-time curfew in Bosasso, Galkacyo and Garowe, restricting movements at night and ordering shops to close at 7pm. 545 Researchers noted in May 2020 that the enforcement of the curfew was less strict since the start of Ramadan and that restrictions on circulation within Puntland had been eased with the seasonal exodus from the coast to cooler inland areas. 546 2.2.2.2 Safety within the city Truck drivers coming from the port of Bosasso and driving to the market in Garowe are stopped at checkpoints manned by security forces, district officials or police officers from the local municipality who collect fees as well as bribes.

        "Country of origin information report | Somalia: Key socio-economic indicators 57 there were three to seven checkpoints between Bosasso and Garowe. 547 The World Bank reports 20 checkpoints based on a 2018 source. 548 According to Markus Hoehne, checkpoints are still frequent in Puntland in response to the tense security situation. According to a local source there are checkpoints between Garowe and Lasanod to the east, between Garowe and Galkacyo to the south and between Garowe and Bosasso to the north. At these checkpoints, cars importing or exporting goods are controlled. Taxes have to be paid mainly for goods coming from or exported via Galkacyo (in the south), Bosasso (in the north) or Lasanod (in the east; Lasanod is currently controlled by Somaliland). Security checks are implemented strictly around Galkacyo and Bosasso. Near Bosasso Al-Shabaab has a base and thus, vehicles in the area are checked carefully at checkpoints. Galkacyo being the \u2018gate\u2019 to the south, where Al-Shabaab is very active, ordinary passengers are checked to prevent the circulation of suspected terrorists. Finally, at all checkpoints, youngsters are controlled to prevent illegal migration (Somali: tahriib ). 549 According to Bakonyi, controls of people are regular, they don\u2019t necessarily check IDs but ask questions to determine from where one comes. Rahanweyn who often came as IDPs speak a very distinct dialect (some call it language) and can therefore easily be identified (For more details, please see sections 1 and 3.1.1 of EASO\u2019s COI report Somalia: Actors as well as section 4.2 of EASO\u2019s COI report Somalia: Targeted profiles). Mistrust against IDPs especially from the Digil and Mirifle (Rahenweyne) Clans is still high in Puntland, as they are perceived as clan groups with highest support for Al-Shabaab and are, therefore, often particularly targeted by security forces. 550 According to a town hall meeting organised in Garowe City by UN-Habitat in 2017, safety is a common concern among the population. The city is fairly secure in comparison to the rest of the country. Police patrols have contributed to a decrease of crime and violence. However, especially women\u2019s perception of safety in Garowe city is low. UN-Habitat linked this low perception to the poor illumination of the streets (even if streetlights were installed in town in 2016 551 ) and the lack of space for pedestrians. 552 For more information on mobility, please see section 4 of EASO\u2019s COI report Somalia: Targeted profiles (September 2021), section 3.1 of EASO\u2019s COI report Somalia: Actors (July 2021) as well as EASO\u2019s COI report Somalia: Security situation (September 2021). 2.2.3 Accessing and settling in the city 2.2.3.1 Accessing land and urban properties Garowe city\u2019s rapid growth (please see section 2.1.1.2 Garowe district and Garowe City ) has made land tenure highly valuable. UN-Habitat states that \u2018 land grabbing, lack of official documentation, to mismanagement and lack of tenure displacement and returnees of diaspora have contributed security\u2019. Conflicts around land ownership and use are not uncommon and Garowe city has rate of land disputes due to unauthorised occupation of public lands in parts of experienced a high 547 Str\u00f8h Varming, K., The Experiential Limits Of The State: Territory And taxation In Garoowe, Puntland, 2017, url, pp. 16- 17 548 World Bank (The), Somalia Urbanization Review: Fostering Cities as Anchors of Development, 2020, url, p. 85 549 Hoehne, M.

Power is on the one hand divided between clans, sub-clans and lineages. On the other hand, there is competition before presidential elections. Once a new Puntland president starts his term, he brings along with him people he trusts as well as his own guard, all of whom are from the same lineage. Ministers also choose their secretaries and their security guards among their close patrilineal relatives. This indicates that trust is less rooted in state institution than in kinship ties; however, institutions and kinship can complement each other. Therefore, once a new president and new ministers take office, a large part of the civil service apparatus is replaced. Access to good jobs in the government and other positions linked to public services will thus be dependent on belonging to the president\u2019s clan or the descent group of influential ministers. 560 It is different when it comes to positions within Garowe city that are not linked to the government, because the city is traditionally dominated by members of the Isse Mahmoud sub-clan. The mayor and the religious elites, and partly the intellectual elites in Garowe are from Isse Mahmoud sub-clan, regardless of who is the president of Puntland. Yet, businesspeople, traders and professionals from all other groups prevalent in Puntland can settle down in Garowe and go about their jobs. Garoowe is generally not a \u2018clannish\u2018 c ity. 561 Although people can settle in all parts of the town, they tend to settle according to clan affiliation. Clan-based settlement patterns prevail throughout Somalia, since the clan network promises physical and social security. 562 553 Puntland Post, Puntland President Sends Stern Warning Against Landgrabbing, 8 June 2021, url; UN-Habitat, Garowe Urban Profile, May 2019, url, p. 20; see also Germany, GIZ, Promoting the economic and social participation of extremely poor households, April 2021, url 554 UN-Habitat, Garowe Urban Profile, May 2019, url, p. 13 555 UNHCR, Operational Data Portal, Estimated IDPs in Somalia, last updated 1 January 2021, url 556 Germany, GIZ, Promoting the economic and social participation of extremely poor households, April 2021, url; Shelter Cluster, Mapping Exercise: Garowe, May 2016, url, pp. 4-6 557 Germany, GIZ, Promoting the economic and social participation of extremely poor households, April 2021, url 558 UN-Habitat, Garowe Urban Profile, May 2019, url, p. 23; World Bank (The), Somalia Urbanization Review: Fostering Cities as Anchors of Development, 2020, url, p. 7474 559 Majid, N., Sarkar, A., Elder, C., Abdirahman, K., Detzner, S., Miller, J. and de Waal, A., Somalia\u2019s Politics: The Usual Business?, LSE Conflict Research Programme, 2021, url, p. 42 560 Hoehne, M.

Remittance from the diaspora (mainly located in the USA) accounts for a major part of the economy of Puntland. 565 The Northern regions including Puntland received strong support from diaspora communities, also in the form of individual remittances, particularly in times of crises. 566 A 2013 report on remittances and livelihoods support in Puntland and Somaliland, which provides a comprehensive household survey on this subject, found that \u2018 in Puntland, 39 percent [of respondents] received between $ 1000 and $ 6000 [in the twelve months preceding the study]; the remainder 61 per cent of Puntland respondents received less than $1000 [in the last twelve months]. \u2019 Remittances are used for basic household expenses, and the degree of secondary distribution of remittances to other poorer households is high. 567 As detailed below, Puntland households\u2019 great economic dependence on remittances was highlighted by the decline in money transfers from the diaspora amidst the COVID-19 pandemic. 568 Between August and September 2020 the Somali shilling lost more than 30 % of its value, reaching 46 000 Somali Shilling per USD. The poor, i.e. low-income families and IDPs, as well as rural communities, are those who suffered the most from the \u2018dollarization\u2019 and deprecation of the Somali Shilling as they do not necessarily have access to e-money services and still rely on local currency for their everyday consumption and trade activities in a general context of \u2018dollarization\u2019. 569 2.3.1.2 Garowe Garowe constitutes a business hub as it profits economically from its location at the \u2018trunk road\u2019 connecting Galkacyo and Mogadishu to the south and the port city Bosasso to the north. 570 Garowe\u2019s industry is mainly composed of \u2018recently established, small -scale, privately owned manufacturing and construction enterprises\u2019 according to UN -Habitat. 571 The same source named hospitality, import and distribution of petrol, the khat market and remittances from the diaspora as other economic activities in Garowe. Most economic activities are conducted informally and the informal market is estimated to employ over 69 % of the residents. 572 A study conducted by the MoPEDIC in 2020 found that 26 % of households in Garowe reported that 563 Puntland State of Somalia, MoPEDIC, COVID-19 Socio-Economic Impact Assessment, 30 December 2020, url, p. 13 564 KAALO and OXFAM, Gender Analysis of the Impact of Recent Humanitarian Crises on Women, Men, Girls, and Boys in Puntland State in Somalia, April 2021, url, p. 10; BBC News, Puntland profile, 23 May 2013, url; UN-Habitat, Garowe Urban Profile, May 2019, url, p. 12 565 Puntland State of Somalia, MoPEDIC, COVID-19 Socio-Economic Impact Assessment, 30 December 2020, url, p. 13; Majid, N., et al., Puntland and COVID-19 : Local Responses and Economic Impact, 5 May 2020, url 566 DRC and DEMAC, Diaspora organizations and their humanitarian response in Somalia, 20 July 2021, url, pp. 27, 48 567 Hammond, L., Family Ties: Remittances and Livelihoods Support in Puntland and Somaliland, FSNAU, 5 June 2013, url, p. 2 568 Puntland State of Somalia, MoPEDIC, COVID-19 Socio-Economic Impact Assessment, 30 December 2020, url, p. 15 569 SIDRA Institute, The death knell for the mighty Somali Shilling, December 2020, url, p. 1; Garowe Online, Puntland in path of rescuing Somali Shillings against dollar, 17 January 2021, url; FSNAU and FEWS NET, Somalia Food Security Outlook, 16 March 2021, url, p. 4 570 FSNAU, Garowe Urban Baseline Report, 15 May 2012, url, p. vii, p. 4 571 UN-Habitat, Garowe Urban Profile, May 2019, url, p. 1313 572 UN-Habitat, Garowe Urban Profile, May 2019, url, p. 1313 ",

According to the same source, unemployment stood at 39 %. 574 Garowe city is the centre of many Government and Non-Government Organisations and UN agencies in Puntland which also generate employment opportunities. Livestock trade and distribution are important economic activities in Garowe, taking place mainly in Suuqa Xoolaha (the older market, outside of town) for camel and cattle trading and in Suuqa Injiga market (in the centre of town) for small ruminants. 575 Most commodities, including vegetables and eggs, are brought to Garowe city by truck, with the exceptions of unbottled drinking water and meat, which are produced locally according to Str\u00f8h Varming. 576 A FSNAU study from 2012 highlighted that many food items came from the southern parts of the countries among them \u2018cereal, pulses, fruit, vege tables and livestock products\u2019. 577 The poor state of roads affects transportation of goods to the markets. 578 2.3.1.3 Impact of COVID- 19 on Puntland\u2019s economy Puntland\u2019s revenues from trade taxes on goods imported through its port have declined following lockdowns and reduced imports due to the COVID-19 pandemic. 579 A study conducted by the MoPEDIC on the impact of COVID-19 in Galkacyo , Qardho and Garowe found that \u2018 domestic revenue declined % ue loss of 28.4 by 55 percent in this [2020] fiscal year\u2019, with a reven in the 1st quarter of 2020. The same source indicated that in the three towns where the survey was conducted, about one-third of the households\u2019 sources of income were vulnerable to the COVID -19 pandemic. After business and paid jobs, remittances were the most vulnerable primary sources of income. Livestock farming was more resilient as a source of income, according to the study. 580 Scholar Mohamed Said Samantar wrote in a study that the effects of the COVID- 19 pandemic have been unevenly distributed across Somalia\u2019s economy. In Puntland, where prices were twice as high as those in Jubaland and South West State, the food inflation rate rose from 0.5 % to 2.0 % from February to March 2020. Before the COVID-19 p andemic, Puntland\u2019s economy was forecasted to grow by 4.6 % but Puntland\u2019s Ministry of Finance estimated a 17.8 % decline during the first half of 2020 according to Samantar. 581 2.3.1.4 Food security Somali livelihoods rely predominantly on the livestock sector, 60 % of the population are pastoralists. 582 Livestock exports constitute the largest traded commodity for the country.

Puntland has been affected by climatic shocks in recent years, alternating drought and floods, as well as the Gati cyclone in Bari in November 2020. 584 Puntland is among the parts of Somalia facing critical water shortages, where pre-drought conditions were recorded in January 2021, characterised by \u2018widely depleted berkeds and shallow wells, loss of livestock, as well as extensive critical loss of pasture\u2019. 585 The Desert Locust infestation which affected Puntland (among other regions of Somalia) over the course of the year 2020 showed signs of decline in March 2021, due in part to control operations and poor rain falls which are less conducive to hatching. However, FSNAU and FEWS NET reported the presence of Desert Locust swarms and adult groups in April 2021 in Puntland (among other regions). 586 The depreciation of the Puntland Somali Shilling had an impact on food prices. Notably sorghum and maize market prices in January 2021 were 11 to 28 % higher than the previous year (2020) and the average over the five previous years. In January 2021 costs of imported rice were reported to be 29 to 53 % above the five-year average. 587 A nationwide survey of urban and displaced populations in November 2020 found that 3 of the 19 population groups surveyed were affected by acute malnutrition at a \u2018critical\u2019 level. The Global Acute Malnutrition indicator (GAM) was used for measuring, for which the critical level starts at 15 %. Of the three affected populations (IDPs and urban population) two were in Puntland with IDPs in Garowe and in Bosasso classified at a \u2018critical\u2019 level. An alert level of GAM was seen among the urban population of Garowe city with 5.2 %. 588 In January 2021 the IDP population in Garowe was still in a \u2018critical\u2019 (IPC Phase 4) state of acute malnutrition while Garowe\u2019s urban population was still classified as in \u2018alert\u2019 (IPC Phase 2). 589 Concerning acute food insecurity, IPC in March 2021 classified most displaced populations in the three largest cities of Puntland as in \u2018crisis\u2019 (phase 3 of the Acute Food Insecurity Phase Classification), while most urban populations were classified as \u2018stressed\u2019 (IPC phase 2). 590 2.3.2 Housing and shelter Generally, in urban areas houses tend to be made out of stone, brick or cement blocks with corrugated iron sheet roofs. 591 In an interview, Bakonyi lists the housing types in Garowe: huts ( buush ), jingaad (a basic housing structure of only metal sheet, which can cost from 2 000 to 4 000 USD in Garowe), bacweyne (iron sheet house, but better decorated than jingaad ). Bacweyne are often erected in a first phase by people owning a small plot of land before they can afford to build a brick or stone structure house for their families. Most privately owned brick or stone houses have several rooms, iron sheet roofing and indoor bathrooms. The other types of houses have outside toilets (pit-latrines).

A house with four to five bedrooms costs around 30 000 USD and can be rented for 300 to 700 USD per month, depending on the location, security of the area and size. The few (approximately 10) high-rise buildings and buildings out of concrete in Garowe are offices. The telecommunication company Dhabshiil is currently building a 10 storey-building. 592 In rural areas mud houses, aqal , buush , stone houses surrounded by land (in villages), iron-sheet houses can be found but no apartment blocks neither high-rise buildings. 593 CCCM Cluster and REACH indicated in a detailed site assessment of March 2021 that in IDPs sites in Garowe district, the types of shelters were either buul (88 %), out of mud and stick walls with roofs out of corrugated iron sheets (64 %), or shelters constructed using shelter kits (60 %). 594 Major Somali cities currently experience a building boom conducive to economic development. Bakonyi warned against the violent consequences of this urban reconstruction: investors and political elites seeking new economic opportunities speculate with urban land and contribute to the expansion of rent economy, thereby precipitating mass-scale evictions of the urban poor and displaced people. 595 There is a direct link between access to land and access to housing and shelter, as people with land can build their own houses to reside in or can become landlords (even if only \u2018petty landlords\u2019 ), allowing other people to establish huts or iron-sheet houses. 596 In Garowe city specifically, UN-Habitat reported that land tenure has become highly insecure and that \u2018due to the rapid urbanization and weak institutional control over land matters, disputes and conflicts around land ownership and use are not uncommon [\u2026]\u2019. 597 In a report on taxation and budgeting in Puntland for Diakonia, analyst Abdulkadir S. M. Salah explained that after the collapse of the Somali state in the 1990s, many residents of Puntland urban centres used the absence of police and formal justice system to \u2018 - demarcate or illegally occupy un owned or publicly-owned land at the perip heries of these centres\u2019. When the local government was established, it did not have the capacity to evict those who annexed land and accepted - against bribes and/or kinship privileges 598 - to regularise annexations by awarding land titles. 599 According to Salah\u2019s report, claimants who want to see their grabbed land regularised rather seek the authorisation from the Islamic court, as the procedure is less complicated than the municipality\u2019s and does not involve the obligation to retroactively pay taxes on the land for the years of occupation. 600 For more information on access to justice through formal and informal systems in Somalia, please see section 2.3 of EASO\u2019s COI report Somalia: Actors (July 2021).).

The same source indicated that most of the IDPs have settled in the east of town in the Wabari district and in the south-east part of the city, which is not well connected to the city centre. 604 In a 2017 paper based on a study conducted in an IDP settlement in Garowe, Mohamed S. Mohamed reported that illegal land expropriations were widespread in Puntland\u2019s major cities and that land grabbers present themselves as legitimate landowners to IDPs from whom they demand rent, using \u2018coercive force\u2019. 605 2.3.3 Hygiene, water and sanitation Social scientist Str\u00f8h Varming stated that in Puntland state budgets grew and tax collection increased, but basic services remained in the hands of private and international actors. 606 Her analysis confirmed Salah \u2019s which stated that public funds are disproportionally spent on security and the military rather than on basic services. 607 In Puntland, drinking water is provided by public private partnerships. Scholars A. A. Jama and K. A. Mourad presumably in 2018 conducted a study of this partnerships for water distribution in Puntland and found that roles and responsibilities were unclear between governmental and private bodies, \u2018leading to poor and over - priced domestic water quality\u2019 . A s a result \u2018 most consumers cannot afford a drinking water supply to their homes, so they are forced to walk long distances and queue for a long time in or der to access water\u2019. 608 UN-Habitat reported in 2019 that in Garowe city, Togga Garowe and Lan Alifirin seasonal streams provided water for domestic use after receiving water during the rainy season. Nugal Water Company (NUWACO) manages the piped water system (public private partnership), which covers around 90 % of the urban area. UN- Habitat additionally reported that residents \u2018also rely on hand dug shallow wells and berkads\u2019 , although the water is generally saline and does not meet World Health Organisation\u2019s standards. 609 In April 2021 UNOCHA reported that most water points across Puntland had dried due to persistent dry conditions, Garowe counting among the worst affected districts. The same source further reported that \u2018the water prices across most rural areas in Puntland are the highest across Somalia with the cost of water almost doubled in many parts since January 2020, with a 200-litre barrel of water now selling at US$ 7 to 9 up from an average of $ 3 in normal time\u2019. 610 This trend is consistent with price inflations observed on markets in this period. 611 Water shortages had led to populations displacements in 602 Puntland State of Somalia, MoPEDIC, Puntland Facts and Figures, Edition 2020, December 2020, url, p. 3 603 UN-Habitat, Garowe Urban Profile, May 2019, url, p. 66 604 UN-Habitat, Garowe Urban Profile, May 2019, url, p. 88 605 Mohamed, M.

Standard blood tests cost between 1 and 4 USD. Normal beds are free of charge. Single beds cost 10 USD per night. Care and normal services and medicine stored by the hospital are free of charge. Operations, however, have to be paid. A caesarean section, for instance, costs around 350 USD. 623 A 2012 FSNAU report also mentioned private hospitals in Garowe. Among these, Akram Hospital mainly provides orthopaedic and surgical services. 624 A local trader and a local midwife mentioned that the largest private hospital in Garowe is called Qaran Hospital 625 , and that another one is Arafat Hospital 626 They added that generally, in private hospitals, admission fees are slightly higher than in GGH. All services and overnight stays have to be paid, operations costs are similar to the costs in the public hospital. There is a psychiatry located at the outskirts of Garowe; the stay there, including food and treatment, costs 100 USD/month. 627 FSAU stressed that there are about 30 small private clinics and pharmacies including Qaran, Somali, Kismayo and Altowba, which are found in or nearby Garowe. As of 2012, \u2018consultation fees in most of the private clinics range between USD 3-5 (Sosh [Somali Shilling] 100,000- 150,000)\u2019. 628 As elsewhere in Somalia, healthcare is not free in Garowe. However, the costs in the public hospital in Garowe are lower than, for instance, in Hargeisa Group Hospital, which is also considered public, but where every service has to be paid (please see section 3.3.4 Health care below). A researcher working in Puntland mentioned that some people seek treatment abroad, e.g. in India, Malaysia or Pakistan. But this involves considerable costs (around 15.000 USD). People having these means can use their Somali passport to travel or they hold a passport from another country (e.g., Ethiopia or some country in Europe, if they lived there in the past). 629 A local source stressed that the private pharmacies in Garowe function like normal businesses. The owner and staff running them frequently do not have any specialised education. Drugs can be imported from various countries. However, many of the medications on the market in Garowe and elsewhere in Puntland have been imported from Europe. An office controlling the quality of the medications coming to Puntland has been established, albeit it is not yet fully operational. 630 2.3.5 Education for children 2.3.5.1 Puntland The out-of- school population in Somalia is one of the world\u2019s most significant. Populations\u2019 movements (60 % of the population pursues pastoralist activities) and displacements due to violent conflicts or climatic shocks are the main impediments to children\u2019s access to formal education. 631 Education provision is of low quality in Somalia due to poor education infrastructure, multiple curricula and a high number of untrained or unqualified teachers.

The formal public education sector is supported by international organisations. 632 Compared to the rest of the country, Somaliland and Puntland enjoyed a greater political stability, security and administrative development, contributing to an improvement of student enrolments over the past two decades. 633 For more general information in Somalia, please see section 1.3.5 Education for children. In a report on taxation and budgeting in Puntland, Salah noted that only a small portion of Puntland\u2019s state budget (30.7 million USD in 2014) was allocated to publi c services, with 3.46 % allocated to education that same year. 634 In 2019 the Puntland Ministry of Education and Higher Studies (MoEHS) allocated 7.5 % of its budget to education, which represented 76.2 million USD. 635 Puntland, like Somaliland, does not participate in government-administered exams. In 2020 the federal administration refused to recognise the school certificates of high school leavers from Puntland unless they sat the matriculation exam prepared by the federal government. In December 2020 the federal government and Puntland\u2019s administration reached an agreement and the students were eventually granted federal high school certificates. The underlying dispute remains: Puntland demands a federalized education system (until the end of the secondary school level) while Mogadishu is in favour of one unitary education system. According to a source in the government, an initiative aiming at convincing Puntland to join the national curriculum is under way, led by the Ministry of Education. 636 According to the MoEHS, in the scholastic year 2016-2017, the total enrolment in primary education (with Integrated Quranic Schools) in Puntland stood at 143 546 students, with a gross enrolment rate of 58.2 %. 637 The World Bank compared in 2019 the primary school survival rates to grade 5 across Somalia and noted that those of Puntland were comparatively 'at the bottom' % male, % (57.4 at 56 54.2 % female). 638 Puntland\u2019s Ministry of Planning, Economic Development and Internatio nal Cooperation (MoPEDIC) reported a primary school survival rate of 62.7 % for the scholastic year 2018- 2019 and a primary school gross enrolment rate of 63.7 % for the same year. 639 In a 2020 paper based on education statistics by Puntland\u2019s MoEHS, scholar Farah Abdiqani indicated that, as of 2019, 32 766 students were enrolled in secondary education. 640 According to the MoPEDIC, in the scholastic year 2018-2019, the gross enrolment ratio for secondary school was 19.5 % of the concerned population in Puntland. 641 632 GPE, Somalia, 30 May 2021, url; Gonnelli, M., The Italophone Somali Diaspora and Social Change in Somalia, PhD Thesis, 27 November 2018, url, p. 74 633 GPE, Somalia, 30 May 2021, url 634 Salah, A.

However, a significant percentage of children have not reported back to school, the main reasons advanced by the report being \u2018 financial constraints, fear of contracting the well as early marriages during the Corona virus and children being engaged as casual workers\u2019 as % of households in Garowe reported \u2018an increase in early marriages in 19 pandemic (45 - COVID their neighbourhoods during this period\u2019). 646 2.3.6 Means of basic subsistence and employment UN-Habitat mentioned in 2019 that Garowe has an urban population of 99 581. 647 According to an earlier study by FSNAU, poor, middle and well-off are the three wealth groups in Garowe: around 25- 35 %of the urban population are poor; around 45-55 % are middle-class; and around 15-25 % are well- off. 648 The average income of a poor household is between 1 500 and 2 550 USD a year. A middle-class family has per year 2 265 to 6 410 USD. A better-off family lives on 6 565 to 15 630 USD a year. 649 A local source working in and around Garowe mentioned that food and housing in Garowe are expensive, compared to other cities in Puntland such as Bosasso or Galkacyo. One room costs around 50 USD monthly. A whole house with four to five rooms costs between 200 and 300 USD monthly, depending on the exact location. Additionally, one needs between 20 and 50 USD for electricity and water (depending on the number of persons in the household) and another 10 USD for waste disposal costs monthly. Eating in ordinary restaurants costs around 2 to 3 USD for a breakfast, 4 to 8 USD for a lunch and around 2 USD for dinner. An adult single person needs minimum around 10 USD for eating and drinking per day, if he/she does not cook at home. Cooking at home is cheaper, but one needs additionally charcoal for the oven and water for the dishes. 650 Monthly school fees at a private school are around 20 USD per child, at a public school the costs are around 10 USD. In general, a poor household consisting of six persons (including 4 children) would survive, in a shanty without access to clean water and sanitation, on roughly 200 to 250 USD per month.

Many people work in employment, business and irregular casual labour and petty trades. 652 Employment for many is instable. Due to the oversupply of labour, wage levels are depressed. Additionally, IDPs from southern Somalia who live in Garowe or nearby, as well as natural factors like droughts, burden the local economy. Simultaneously, Garowe is the seat of the government of Puntland and this means that many relatively well-paid jobs can be found in government and administration. Also NGOs and UN agencies have offices in town, and Garowe is home to a number of universities and higher learning facilities. This has a positive effect on the local employment situation. 653 However, one source, a local trader and civil society activist, mentioned that when the president changes and new ministers are appointed, which happens normally every four years, the staff working at government offices, at least those directly working in ministries and in the presidential palace, is replaced (see also section 2.2.3.3 Impact of clan-identity). He added that the number of NGOs in Garowe has been decreasing recently. Many people work in the private sector, have little shops, work as cleaners or watchmen or in the security forces. 654 Industry is little developed in Garowe. UN- Habitat found that \u2018it is mainly composed of recently established, small- scale, privately owned manufacturing and construction enterprises.\u2019 The diaspora is investing in town, which produced a real-estate boom. There is much new construction going on, which creates jobs at least temporarily. Like in most other Somali towns, the service sector is offering considerable employment opportunities. In particular the telecommunications and financial sectors are thriving. Also, \u2018hospitality is a sector in continuous expansion, with more than twenty hotels throughout the city.\u2019 Finally, many households in Garowe receive remittances that cover parts of the essential costs. Generally, the informal sector remains \u2018the major driver\u2019 of Garowe\u2019s economy, with a share of over 69% of the district\u2019s residents. 655 The salary of a watchman is between 200 and 250 USD a month, a policeman and a soldier earn 240 USD, a qualified nurse would earn around 350 USD, an established medical doctor around 1000 USD and a lower-level government employee around 300 to 400 USD. 656 Youth unemployment is very high. Young people often find only temporary or low-level jobs as cleaners or waiters. Many search for better options elsewhere, e.g. in Mogadishu, where life is generally cheaper and the job market is larger. 657 2.4 Social protection networks and (lack of) support to specific groups As capital of Puntland State, Garowe has been targeted by Al-Shabaab. Hoehne noted already in 2014 that the militant Islamists had been fighting against Puntland since a decade. 658 Initially they threatened to conquer Puntland.

The relevant government institutions in cooperation with traditional authorities maintain the peace. The police has a visible presence in the city, which has contributed to the reduction of crime and violence; however, women are still vulnerable to harassment and attacks especially at night, due to missing street illumination and the structure of architecture in certain neighbourhoods. 660 Land conflicts are another source of insecurity. Garowe is traditionally dominated by members of the Isse Mahamud sub-clan of the Majeerteen clan (see below). A local source stressed that if someone from another patrilineal descent group buys land from a member of the Isse Mahamud sub-clan, it happens sometimes that conflicts arise after the value of the land had gone up. The current government of Puntland under President Deni issued an urban land management law in August 2020 that aims at tackling recurrent land conflicts. 661 In recent years, land conflicts erupted most frequently in Garowe, compared to other places in Puntland. 662 2.4.1 Clan-based protection The dominant patrilineal descent groups in Garowe are Majeerteen and Dhulbahante. Both clans belong to the Harti branch of the Darood clan family which is dominating in Puntland. 663 Within Majeerteen, the sub- clan Isse Mahamud claims the area of Garowe and surroundings as their \u2018clan - homeland\u2019 (Som ali: degaan , for further details see sections 3.1.1 and 7.6.1 of EASO\u2019s COI report Somalia: Actors, published in July 2021). Members of this sub-clan dominate the traditional power positions within the city, like the office of the major and the position of the sheikh of the biggest mosque. However, also members of the Omar Mahamoud sub-clan of Majeerteen have a strong presence in Garowe. Dhulbahante have many businesses in the city and also hold important positions in the government of Puntland, therefore having a sizable presence in the capital city. Besides the named groups, other Majeerteen sub-clans and lineages as well as other clans belonging to the Darood/Harti clan-collective (e.g. Warsangeli and Deshiishe), which forms the backbone of Puntland State, reside in Garowe. A local source working in Garowe since many years (but originating from the neighbouring Sool region) emphasised that the inhabitants of Garowe are more tolerant towards people from other clans. IDPs, however, who do not belong to Puntland by patrilineal descent, have a difficult stand. There is little humanitarian aid offered to them in Garowe and surroundings. 664 According to a local source interviewed for this report, there are few members of minority groups in town. Members of two occupational groups, Madhibaan and Tumal, are prevalent. They are structurally marginalised and have limited access to economic resources. In politics, they have no substantial political representation. Madhibaan have one seat in parliament of Puntland (out of 66 seats distributed between various clans, sub-clans and lineages). Only regarding social segregation, the situation is less rigid in Garowe and Puntland in general than in some other places (e.g. in Hargeisa, Somaliland). There is no specific neighbourhood for Madhibaan or Tumal; they live among other members of society, including majority group members. Moreover, Tumal and Majeerteen marry each other, not very often, but sometimes, and without resistance from the families. Also, in case of conflict 659 Mire, M.

Madhibaan, however, are facing considerable social exclusion and intermarriage with Majeerteen is not accepted. 665 2.4.2 Returnees, vulnerable groups According to data produced by Shelter Cluster from 2016, close to 5 400 IDP households are residing in 21 settlements in and around Garowe. \u2018 On average, 15 % of the households were reported to be from the host community [i.e., from Majeerteen or other clans predominantly residing in Puntland] .\u2019 More than half of these households are organised and have their own committees, which also address security issues. Shelter Cluster found that more than 70 %of the interviewed IDPs perceived their security situation as good or very good. 666 Also a local source confirmed that IDPs can have access to protection and safety. The most important source for the justice of vulnerable people is the office of the human rights defender, 667 an institution created by the government of Puntland in 2014. This office is effective and operational and defends the rights of vulnerable persons. 668 IDPs work predominantly in low-status or casual jobs, as construction workers, cleaners of offices, private homes or hotels, or shoe shiners. They also run small kiosks at IDP camps. Many come from the regions of Bay and Bakool in the south. Some are also non-Somali, e.g., Oromo from Ethiopia. 669 UN-Habitat and The World Bank noted in 2019 and 2021 respectively that IDPs in Garowe have been relocated from the city to its periphery exacerbating segregation and poverty. 670 However, the local businessmen and civil society activists emphasised that IDPs are part of the local community and they are not threatened. In the past, between 2009 and 2014, IDPs were sometimes evicted and randomly deported, e.g. to southern Somalia. This happened against the backdrop of the intensification of the fight between Puntland state and Al-Shabaab, particularly in 2010 and 2011. In the past years, since around 2015, the rights and positions of IDPs in Garowe and other places in Puntland have been strengthened. 671 For more information on IDPS, please see sections 2.1.2 Humanitarian situation overview and 2.2.3.2 IDPs. Women are, as everywhere in Somalia, particularly vulnerable to gender-based violence. FGM is widespread in Puntland, including in Garowe. 672 Yet, in June 2021, the President of Puntland, Said Abdullahi Deni, and his cabinet approved an anti-FGM-bill to be submitted to parliament. If it comes into force, it will criminalise FGM. 673 Mohamed Ahmed Mohamed, a lecturer at Puntland State University, mentioned that in Puntland \u2018impunity for rape and other forms of sexual violence is pervasive\u2019. In November 2016, the government launched the first ever Sexual Offences Law criminalizing all sexual offences in the region. \u2018Despite the low numbers of rape prosecutions, it is a common perception that incide nts of rape are increasing in the state.\u2019 The lecturer continued that in the first quarter of 2019, over 15 cases of rape were documented across Garowe, Galkacyo, Bosasso and Qardho. Officials confirmed \u2018that cases of rape have been on the rise in Puntland.\u2019 Some cases were shockingly brutal, with a twelve-year-old girl raped and filmed and with footage then posted 665 Mire, M.

In 2019, there was a brutal rape and murder of a two-year-old girl in Garowe. 674 The Sexual Offences Act (SOA) provides investigators with a set of partly advanced tools to collect evidence and persecute perpetrators. 675 Yet, more generally, societal values and norms are still often grounded in patriarchal views that habitually subject women (not just in Garowe but all over Somalia) to male rule and make them vulnerable to (sexualised) attacks. 676 For further details please see section 2 of EASO\u2019s COI report Somalia: Targeted profiles (September 2021). 3. Hargeisa 3.1 Hargeisa\u2019s overview Hargeisa (sometimes spelled Hargeysa) is a city of the Woqooyi Galbeed region in the territory of Somaliland, in north-western Somalia. The city is located in a valley of the Galdodon (also called Ogo) mountains 677 , 850 kilometres north of Mogadishu. 678 The region Woqooyi Galbeed borders Ethiopia to the South, the region of Awdal to the West and Togdheer to the East. 679 A new administrative partition adopted by Somaliland (and Puntland) places Hargeisa in the new administrative region of Marodi Jeh. 680 In May 1988 at least 70 % of the city of Hargeisa was destroyed as the result of the use of artillery and aerial shelling by Siad Barre\u2019s military government, leading to the displacement of a large part of its population, the majority of which was hailing from the Isaaq clan. 681 Over 20 years later, Hargeisa has become the biggest urban setting in Somaliland, has been almost entirely rebuilt, 682 and has expanded rapidly in both size and density. 683 Estimates of the size of the city vary from 33 square kilometres to 65 square kilometres of built-up land area. 684 674 Mohamed, M.

There are also checkpoints on all the roads leading in and out of the city. I don\u2019t believe this negatively impacts accessibility or mobility of residents.\u2019 727 Circulation within Hargeisa is reported to be difficult due to the bad quality of the roads as well as the organisation of the circulation. Sources report increasing traffic on the road connecting Hargeisa to the port of Berbera as well as in Hargeisa itself 728 Frequent congestions occur as a result of the interaction of traffic with \u2018pedestrians, donkey drawn carts, street markets, parked vehicles\u2019 as well as khat delivering trucks, in the absence of traffic signs. 729 Other paved streets in the city centre are reported to be potholed while many roads outside the business district are not paved. On occasional heavy rains, large areas of the city are reported to be flooded and roads to be \u2018impassable due to mud\u2019. 730 The construction of a highway linking Hargeisa to the port city of Berbera has begun in 2018 and is scheduled to be completed in 2022, promising to turn Hargeisa \u2018 into a major transport hub for traffic from across the Horn of Africa to Berbera \u2019. 731 2.3.2.2 Safety within the city Hargeisa is not considered to be particularly insecure by scholars conducting research in the city, when compared to other urban areas in the region. 732 According to the scholar and specialist of Hargeisa Abdifatah Tahir, Somaliland\u2019s prioritisation of security is however jeopardised in urban contexts by state-involved land conflicts. 733 Basing his analysis on an in-depth study of Hargeisa, the author argues that such conflicts \u2018induce a significant level of violence, pitting authorities against local land-owners or claimers\u2019. 734 For more information on mobility, please see section 3.1 of EASO\u2019s COI report Somalia: Actors, published in July 2021. 726 Canada, IRB, Somalia: Entry and exit requirements at land borders and airports, including documentation required; whether there are checkpoints for domestic and international travel; whether there are travel agencies that facilitate travel within and outside Somalia (2018 \u2013 August 2020), 3 September 2020, url 727 Tahir, A., email, 23 June 2021.

        "Country of origin information report | Somalia: Key socio-economic indicators 77 3.2.3 Accessing and settling in the city Abdifatah Tahir stated that Hargeisa\u2019s population has a history of settling in the city according to a clan-based segregation (please see section 3.1.1 Demographics and clan composition). Newcomers settled where members of their clan lived, because they knew this network would facilitate their access to a range of institutions and services which the state failed to provide: ' [\u2026] segregation in Hargeisa can be understood as a response to historical political, economic, and security problems in the city, persisting because of the state's incompetence in managing public services as well as the key roles the customary institutions continue to play in mediating access to services, conflict resolution, and political participation.\u2019 735 Hargeisa\u2019s urban landscape has however experienced rapid changes with the return in the late 1990s of people who had resided in refugee camps in neighbouring countries (please see section 3.1.2 Humanitarian situation overview). In Hargeisa they settled in buush 736 aside and in ruins and/or government-owned vacant land. These settlements (often referred to as camps, for example Statehouse and Stadium) 737 have nowadays become more densely populated, often overlapping with other areas of the city, even if they are separated from districts \u2018with more affluent housing and business.\u2019 738 Kirsti Stuv\u00f8y et al., a group of researchers who conducted a research project in these settlements from 2017 to 2019 pointed to the higher level of social diversity among their inhabitants, complicating the settlement patterns described by Abdifatah Tahir 739 : \u2018\u201coriginal\u201d returnees, later displaced people, rural to urban migrants from Somaliland or Somalia, other low-income residents of Hargeisa, who were pushed out of other neighbourhoods in the city by rising rents, and non-Somali migrants, particularly ethnic Oromo from Ethiopia.\u2019 740 These researchers reported that interviewees admitted to follow clan-based settlement practices (preferring to settle where relatives lived) but \u2018rejected practices of clan - based exclusion.\u2019 741 Both Stuv\u00f8y et al. and Abdifatah Tahir converge in their analysis of an increasing competition over access to land in Hargeisa, 742 whose \u2018current mechanism of access to land in urban areas marginalises the poor.\u2019 743 Land disputes are on the rise, opposing low- income land claimants and the state who threatens to evict them. 744 The scholar Tahir, who was consulted for this report on the subject of accessibility and settlement in Hargeisa stated: 735 Tahir, A., The production of clan segregation in urban Somalia: Historical Geographies of Hargeisa, April 2021, url, pp. 61- 62 736 Buush (singular buul ) are makeshift huts, see UNHCR, Somalia Settlement Typologies, 2017, url, p. 10 737 Bakonyi, J., telephone interview, 13 July 2021 738 Stuv\u00f8y, K. et al., Precarious spaces and violent site effects: experiences from Hargeisa\u2019s urban margins, May 2021, url, p. 154 739 Stuv\u00f8y, K. et al., Precarious spaces and violent site effects: experiences from Hargeisa\u2019s urban margins, May 2021, url, p. 163 740 Stuv\u00f8y, K. et al., Precariou s spaces and violent site effects: experiences from Hargeisa\u2019s urban margins, May 2021, url, p. 161 741 Stuv\u00f8y, K. et al., Precarious spaces and violent site ef fects: experiences from Hargeisa\u2019s urban margins, May 2021, url, p. 163 742 Stuv\u00f8y, K. et al., Precarious spaces and violent site effects: experiences from Harg eisa\u2019s urban margins, May 2021, url, p. 164 743 Tahir, A., Urban Governance, Land Conflicts And Segregation In Hargeisa, Somaliland: Historical Perspectives And Contemporary dynamics, PhD Thesis, 1 October 2016, url, p. 1818 744 Tahir, A., Urban Governance, Land Conflicts And Segregation In Hargeisa, Somaliland: Historical Perspectives And Contemporary dynamics, PhD Thesis, 1 October 2016, url, pp. 18, 17518, 175 ",
        "Country of origin information report | Somalia: Key socio-economic indicators 78 \u2018Yes, the settlement in the city is organised along clan lines. But this does not mean people cannot reside in a neighbourhood populated by a clan different than theirs. One way in which this may have a negative implication is when conflict over land arise. In such cases, returnees and displaced people may feel insecure and unsafe in areas populated by clans other than theirs. Gatekeepers or camp managers may exist in some circumstances i.e when a displaced camp is initiated on private land, speculators or by a closely knit group.\u2019 745 In Hargeisa, many of the people who squat today on governmental land or reside in informal settlements across the town are returnees from refugee camps in Ethiopia. Over the years they have improved their living conditions, huts ( buush ) were replaced by houses made of corrugated iron sheets, lands were fenced off and an informal property and housing market developed. The squatters have started to rent out land to newcomers, people who were displaced in other parts of the country, fled from Ethiopia or could not afford rising rents in Hargeisa. 746 3.3 Socio-economic indicators 3.3.1 Economic overview and food security 3.3.1.1 General information Animal husbandry and livestock export constitute the cornerstone of Somaliland\u2019s economy and a consequent tax income for Somaliland authorities. 747 This sector contributes to 85 % of export earnings and 30 % of the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and employs 70 % of the population. 748 A 2012 World Bank survey estimated that the wholesale and retail trade in the formal and informal sector represented 20 % of GDP, while 8 % was derived from crops and 6 % from real estate activities. 749 Remittances from the diaspora are considered to be the largest contributor to Somaliland\u2019s GDP. 750 The 2012 estimated GDP per capita of 347 USD would have placed Somaliland in the fourth lowest place in the world ranking, with urban poverty estimated at 29 % and rural poverty at 38 %. 751 Still according to the World Bank, the deficit between the value of goods imported to Somaliland and the value of goods exported from Somaliland amounted to approximately 496 million USD in 2012. 752 745 Tahir, A., email, 23 June 2021.

        "Country of origin information report | Somalia: Key socio-economic indicators 79 Remittances to Somaliland dropped in 2020 due to Covid-19 before picking up again at the end of the year. 753 Hargeisa is the largest economic centre of Somaliland. 754 UN-Habitat reported that the city revenue dropped from March 2020 onwards (a decrease of 11 % in 2020 as compared to the previous year) due to the closure of businesses during the lockdown. Moreover, the intergovernmental fiscal transfer that Hargeisa receives from Somalia\u2019s central government has decreased by 53 % in 2020 as compared to the previous year. 755 Kilcullen wrote in 2019 based on an interview with Somaliland\u2018s Ministry of Finance that much of the 700 million USD worth of remittances sent by Somalilanders in the diaspora flew through Hargeisa. 756 The COVID-19 pandemic led to a fall in the level of remittances sent to Somaliland, \u2018a concern to local people in Hargeisa\u2019 according to UN -Habitat. 757 In a context of decline in remittances, the Food Security and Nutrition Analysis Unit (FSNAU) and the Famine Early Warning Systems Network (FEWS NET) reported that, between April and June 2020, 28 % of urban and IDP households in Hargeisa received external remittances. 758 Somaliland imports most of its foodstuffs, as David Kilcullen noted in 2019, adding that: \u2018less than 13 per cent of land is suitable for agriculture, only half of this is cultivated for local consumption and the national market, and only 10 per cent of arable land is based, with the - fed.

All of these types of houses have outside toilets (pit- latrines). Most privately owned brick or stone houses have several rooms and iron sheet roofing, their price varies with their location and size (a house with four bedrooms, kitchen, inside toilet can be rented for 180 to 200 USD/month; a house with five bedrooms, kitchen, one toilet inside, one toilet outside, garage for one car can be rented for 200 to 250 USD/month; a \u2018bangalo\u2019 i.e. a hous e with seven bedrooms, a kitchen, two toilets inside, one outside, a garage for two cars can be rented 250 to 350 USD/month). Houses out of concrete ( fooq) are 2- or 3-storey-houses which can be rented or 800 USD to 2 500 USD depending on the location. This type of house is often rented by government agencies, international NGOS or UN agencies. 773 Returnees and IDPs settled on large patches of uninhabited private or public land since the late 1990s. 774 Their so-called camps or settlements are nowadays located at the outskirts of the city but also within the city centre. 775 They attracted large numbers of people over the years, not only forcedly displaced people but also residents of Hargeisa who could not afford rising rents. 776 Settlements named Statehouse, Cakaaro, Daami, Mohamed Mooge, and Digaale are neighbourhoods commonly associated with a population of displaced people, but they inhabited in reality by people with quite different socio-economic profiles. 777 The Migrants on the Margins project carried out between 2016 and 2019 in Hargeisa (among other cities) compared three urban settlements, showing the diversity of housing types and living conditions. 778 Camp A is two hours walk away from the city centre and the land is privately owned, others not.

Major Somali cities currently experience a building boom conducive to economic development. Bakonyi warned against the violent consequences of this urban reconstruction: Investors and political elites seeking new economic opportunities speculate with urban land and contribute to the expansion of rent economy, thereby precipitating mass-scale evictions of the urban poor and displaced people. 785 There is a direct link between access to land and access to housing and shelter, as people with land can build their own houses to reside in or can become landlords (even if only \u2018petty landlords\u2019, allowing other people to establish huts or iron-sheet houses. 786 Hargeisa experienced a rapid urbanisation 787 in the past decades and saw land prices increase as well as the competition for access to land and housing. 788 A plot of land of approximately 12m2 (large enough for a four-bedroom house) can be bought for approximately 15 000 USD, while a slightly larger plot (for a five-bedroom house with a garage) can be bought for 22 000 to 30 000 USD depending on the location, and a plot on which a seven- bedroom \u2018bangalo\u2019 can be built would cost between 40 000 to 50 000 USD. 789 In an article published in the Somaliland Peace and Development Journal in October 2018, Suleiman Ismail Mohamed listed different ways of acquiring land in Hargeisa: purchase from a private owner, from the government, inheritance of land after a close relative\u2019s death, but also illegal grabbing. He described the latter as the process through which \u2018individuals claim ownership of a large area of land as their own farms\u2019. Land -grabbers can subsequently obtain a title deeds for their land, with the support of local government authorities via bribes or kinship networks. 790 Tahir referred to this phenomenon as a malpractice resulting is some cases in the \u2018multiple allocation and issuance of title deeds for the same pieces of lands\u2019. According to his analysis, such malpractice resulted in a lack of faith in the land management system, leading people to build on land without permit. 791 The absence of strong government and governing laws contributed to the problem. 792 782 Stuv\u00f8y, K. et al., Precarious spaces and violent site effects: experiences from Hargeisa\u2019s urban margins, May 2021, url, p. 167 783 Hammond, L., Ibrahim, M., 2019.

        "Country of origin information report | Somalia: Key socio-economic indicators 83 According to Stuv\u00f8y et al.\u2019s estimate, several thousand people from squatter settlements in the city centre have already been relocated by the Somaliland government, an approach which is supported by international governmental and non-governmental organisations. 793 Taking the example of a conflict over the land surrounding the Hargeysa Egal International airport (HEIA), Tahir analysed that public officials have a \u2018dual strategy\u2019, seeking to negotiate relocation of land claimants, while doubting the legitimacy of local people\u2019s land ownership by threatening with forceful evictions. 794 In April 2020 the House Land and Property Working Group (HLPWG) in Somaliland reported that 61 refugee households had been evicted by the Hargeisa municipality and received shelter grants through local NGOs. 795 3.3.3 Hygiene, water and sanitation According to the Joint Market Monitoring Initiative (JIMMI) which conducted interviews in February 2021 with vendors in Hargeisa and other locations in Somalia, 50 % of vendors interviewed in Hargeisa reported having difficulties to stock trucked water in the three months prior to data collection. 796 One result of the data collection conducted by JIMMI in November 2020 was that in Hargeisa 100 % of the vendors who participated in the study reported having difficulties to stock menstrual hygiene management (MHM) items in the three months prior to data collection. It was also the case for plastic gloves for 50 % of vendors and of water for 33 % of them. 797 In its 2019 working paper, Kilcullen described the water supply system in Hargeisa as follows: \u2018 s to running water, with access Fewer than one in 100 households in Hargeisa has acces class - es out from the city centre.

        "Country of origin information report | Somalia: Key socio-economic indicators 84 Kilcullen referred to water as a \u2018critical commodity\u2019 for Hargeisa, as droughts in the hinterland due to uncertain rain- fall drive farmers to the city, increasing the demand on \u2018already stressed water supply systems\u2019. 800 The World Bank and the International Finance Corporation noted in 2012 that the \u2018limited water and electricity networks and lack of sewage\u2019 in Hargeisa lead to high costs of access to such utilities. 801 3.3.4 Health care Medical doctor Djibril Ibrahim Moussa mentioned that in Hargeisa around 200 medical doctors are offering services for a population of roughly one million people or more which amounts to an estimated ratio of one medical doctor per 5 000 inhabitants or more. 802 The desirable doctor- population ratio, according to the World Health Organization (WHO), is 1:1 000. 803 A study of Fatumo Abdi Abdillahi et al. mentioned that in Somaliland, the \u2018healthcare system has never developed beyond providing the most basic functions, which leave it ill-equipped to deal with any significant challenges\u2019. 804 Moussa added that health care in Hargeisa is essentially private. 805 Although the largest hospital, the Hargeisa Group Hospital (HGH) 806 , which is the national referral hospital in Somaliland 807 , is called \u2018public\u2019 or \u2018state\u2019 hospital due to partly public funding, patients have to pay there for services. 808 There is an admission fee of around 10 USD, a single bed costs around 20 USD/night, a bed in a shared room is around 10 USD/night. 809 Operations cost, depending on the type and kind of operation, between 350 and more than 1 000 USD. A caesarean, which is a frequently performed operation, costs around 400 USD, an appendix operation slightly less; orthopaedical surgery or neuro-surgery are more expensive. Additionally, patients have to cover the costs for medication and other services. 810 HGH consists of six main departments and has nearly 700 employees including specialised personnel, administrative support staff and auxiliaries. It serves over 260 patients daily in average 811 and has a capacity of around 500-600 beds 812 . Medication costs may vary, depending on type and quantity, between 5 and 50 USD for a monthly dose. The smaller manual services cost between 2 and 5 USD per service. In the other (\u2018private\u2019) hospitals in Hargeisa, costs for admission and beds are around 30 percent higher than in HGH, costs for operations and other services are roughly the same. 813 800 Kilcullen, D., Hargeisa, Somaliland \u2013 Invisible City, 2019, url, p. 17 801 World Bank (The) and IFC, Doing Business in Hargeisa 2012, 2012, url, p. 3 802 Moussa, D.

The admission fees and bed-costs in these private hospitals are around 30 per cent higher than in HGH; the costs for operations are roughly the same. Costs for laboratory tests can be higher, depending on the available equipment. 820 Furthermore, there exist numerous smaller clinics focussing on a special field, such as maternal health or internal medicine, and doctors have private offices all over town. Some have a degree from abroad, others, particularly the younger generation, has been educated in medicine at Hargeisa University or at Amuud University near Borama in the past 15 years. 821 A study based on interviews found that during the recent COVID-19 pandemic, treating patients in Hargeisa was a problem, with a lack of trust in the health care offered. An interviewee stressed that health care was poor, especially in HGH. Reported death tolls were due to negligence of nurses and lack of ventilators 822 Structural problems with health care in hospitals in Hargeisa and elsewhere in Somaliland were addressed in discussions at Edna Adan University, a leading institution for training health professionals in Hargeisa. Among the central problems of the health system in Somaliland that were identified in the discussion were: the low preparedness for emergency, the lack of personal protective equipment and life-saving equipment, the lack of proper training and experience of health workers and the lack of standard operation procedures and guidelines. 823 Pharmacies are private businesses often run by people without medical or pharmacological training. The medication is imported from Asia (India and Pakistan) and, more recently, predominantly from Turkey, but also occasionally from the UK and Germany. 824 Until recently, no state institution regulated the import of drugs to Somaliland. In 2019, the National Medicines Regulatory Authority 825 was established to oversee drug imports. However, it is not yet fully functional as of July 2021. 826 The medical fields which exhibit the biggest gaps respectively, in which no health services are offered, are oncology, dermatology and various specialised forms of surgery (e.g., paediatric surgery, spine surgery, heart surgery). Those who can afford it can obtain a visa, sometimes seek medical treatment in these medical fields abroad, e.g. in Turkey, India, or on the Arab Peninsula. 827 The field of mental health care is underdeveloped in Somaliland. However, in Hargeisa there are some services. HGH has 100 beds in the psychiatric warden. \u2018All public psychiatric care is free of charge, and all departments offer limited in-patient (approximately 250 beds nationally) and out-patient services.\u2019 828 The main problem is the lack of qualified staff.

Normally, family members support each other regarding these costs. Typically, more substantial costs are paid by family members in the diaspora. If someone is completely destitute, he or she can turn to a mosque and ask the community of believers for help. Sometimes, as an exception, they can ask some better off businesspeople belonging to the community to help out. 831 Hardly anyone in Somaliland has health insurance. According to the Somaliland Central Statistics Department there is less than 1 % of households that have at least one member with health insurance. For urban settings like Hargeisa it is 1 %, while in the countryside it is even less. 832 3.3.5 Education for children The out-of- school population in Somalia is one of the world\u2019s most significant. Populations\u2019 movements (60 % of the population pursues pastoralist activities) and displacements due to violent conflicts or climatic shocks are the main impe diments to children\u2019s access to formal education. 833 Education provision is of low quality in Somalia due to poor education infrastructure, multiple curricula and a high number of untrained or unqualified teachers. Education at primary and secondary level is predominantly confessional, with school establishments being mostly under the management of private-sector umbrellas, community-owned or run by Islamic charities. The formal public education sector is supported by international organisations. 834 Compared to the rest of the country, Somaliland and Puntland enjoyed a greater political stability, security and administrative development, contributing to an improvement of student enrolments over the past two decades. 835 For more general information in Somalia, please see section 1.3.5 Education for children. The Republic of Somaliland\u2019s ministry of education and higher studies (MoEHS) reported in 2017 that the budget for its Education Sector Strategic Plan for the period between 2017 and 2021 would be 275 million USD. 836 In its 2019 Somalia Economic Update, the World Bank reported that the government of Somaliland allocated 7 % of its total spending to education, commenting that it would be \u2018insufficient ctions of an effective public education system that include payment to support core fun for teachers and school construction\u2019. 837 Somaliland has its own Education Sector Strategic Plans and does not take part in the Somalian government-administered exams. 838 According to the director of the Institute for Peace and Conflict Studies in Hargeisa, several education systems coexist in Somaliland.

The numerous Madrasas or Quranic schools are regulated by the Somaliland Ministry of Religious Affairs and Islamic Endowment as well as by the Department of Informal Education within the MoEHS. Private schools, private universities and Madrasas are also owned by local people and/or by members of the Somaliland diaspora. The source analysed that \u2018because of this plurality of school systems, multiple rival curricula have emerged, promoting competing views of history and identity, often promoting competing perspectives and different languages of instruction depending on their funders and administrators\u2019. 839 The school enrolment rate in Somaliland in 2014/15 was 48 % 840 , with a 53.4 % enrolment rate among boys and 44.2 % among girls. 841 Based on data from the Ministry of Education and Higher Education of the Republic of Somaliland from 2014/2015, Gandrup reported that 44.3 % of the total number of school age population was enrolled in school in this period. 842 The same source added that the number of enrolled students in private schools increased between 2013 and 2014 while it stagnated in public primary schools. 843 The Republic of Somaliland indicated that 50 % of children of both sexes were enrolled as primary students in the scholastic year 2015/2016. 844 Quantitative data about school enrolment in Somaliland should be taken with caution as different sources present different figures. Gandrup wrote that it could be in part due to some schools slipping through data collection due to the difficulty to classify them as either public or private and to the difficulty to account for private schools which do not take part in government-led testing. 845 Based on a survey he conducted in Hargeisa in 2016, the scholar Abdirizak Mohamoud Osman reported that 45 % of children who had access to education dropped out from schools before intermediate or secondary school level. He added that \u2018primary and intermediate school children also attend at least one formal or informal Quranic school known as Madarasa \u2019. 846 The vast majority of all children in Somaliland gets at least a basic Islamic education, learning parts of the Koran by heart and getting some additional religious education. For many ordinary people in Somaliland, Islamic education clearly precedes learning in schools. 847 Children living in households receiving remittances in Hargeisa had relatively good school attendance rates, because families could pay school fees but also because members of the diaspora encouraged families in Hargeisa to send their children to school. 848 Members of the diaspora who returned to Hargeisa with financial means tended to favour private education, \u2018 encouraging providers to offer smaller class sizes and English or Arabic medium teaching\u2019. 849 Gandrup reported that the private sector was rapidly expanding and that in Hargeisa \u2018there were 53 public primary schools and 75 private 839 Ali, N.

In schools attended both by children from majority and minority clans, the latter were sometimes bullied and/or discriminated against by teachers and other students. 854 3.3.6 Means of basic subsistence and employment The government of Somaliland found in a survey from 2012, that still constitutes the most recent government-produced available information on the matter, that in Hargeisa employment-to- population ratios were at 23.4 % for males and 14.8 % for females. 855 A more recent blogpost by Oxfam reported that unemployment rates hovered around 65 % among Somaliland\u2019s youth, which itself represents 70 % of Somaliland\u2019s population. 856 UN-Habitat reported in a 2021 analysis of the impacts of COVID-19 on Hargeisa\u2019s economy (among other cities) that local employment had decreased by more than 50 % in Somaliland. The source further reported that the local lockdown, lockdowns in other countries and \u2018disruptions in international supply chains\u2019 affected diverse sectors of Somaliland\u2019s economy, particularly hurting small businesses. 857 In Hargeisa, the private sector is providing for health, education, electricity, domestic water supply and urban waste disposal. 858 Generally, doing business in Hargeisa is rather expensive, in global comparison. Particularly business licenses are expensive. This contributes to a boom of the informal sector. Taxes are often a matter of negotiation, this benefits particularly larger businesses. Legal security for businesses is often guaranteed through customary legal mechanisms. One central problem for start-ups and also for established businesses is getting credit; no international banks are operating in Hargeisa and \u2018there is no public or private credit registry or bureau.\u2019 859 A researcher from 850 Gandrup, T., Making Schools: Primary Education, Governance And The State In Somaliland, PhD Thesis, 21 September 2020, url, p. 33 851 Gandrup, T., Making Schools: Primary Education, Governance And The State In Somaliland, PhD Thesis, 21 September 2020, url, p. 35; Osman, A.

        "Country of origin information report | Somalia: Key socio-economic indicators 89 Burao University found in 2020 that the reasons for small business failure in Somaliland were: \u20181. Poor economic conditions 2. High operating expenses like rents and wages 3. Competition\u2019. 860 In 2017 a group of scholars found that the informal economy continued to be a key source of livelihoods in Somaliland 861 and that a \u2018laissez faire approach from government and lack of restrictive regulation has helped growth\u2019. 862 Some religious leaders held the view that women should stay at home to take care of household responsibilities. The view of religious leaders is generally respected in Somali society. Therefore, women engaging in businesses might enter unsafe spaces and encounter structural barriers. 863 Women are more often confined to the informal sector than men. On the one hand, they enjoy relative freedom in Somaliland, including Hargeisa, to trade in the market, open small or also bigger businesses, travel and, e.g. import goods for resale. On the other hand, Somali women in general (also in Hargeisa) frequently have less education than men. 864 Additionally, they are supposed to marry early (as teenagers already), deliver many children and take care of them and of the household. 865 In order to support each other, women traders engage in savings and credit associations. In Hargeisa, some NGOs have been working with groups, particularly women, \u2018to associate, organise and accumulate capital together which alleviates to some degree, the economic variables of business and the lack of acce ss to credit of IE [informal economy] workers.\u2019 866 The government of Somaliland found in a survey from 2012, that still constitutes the most recent available information on the matter, that Hargeisa\u2019s unemployment rate was 22.3 % in total, with the youth unemployment rate being 37.6 %. 867 The report also found that the main occupations in Hargeisa for men were in service and sales (28 %), followed by elementary occupations (17 %) and professionals (16 %). Almost half of women were employed in services and sales (42 %) followed by clerical workers (11 %) and technicians (10 %). 868 Abdifatah Tahir emphasised the crucial role that clan identity plays in the social and economic life of residents in Hargeisa: \u2018For instance, employment opportunities are to a significant degree influenced by kinship. Justifications for this include that there are social expectations which bind business owners, shareholders and or senior officials to take part in their clan\u2019s economic empowerment in order to benefit from its protection. Others point out that businesses require prospective employees to have some sort of a guarantor who could be held responsible in case of a theft and other forms of misappropriation. This makes the employment of people from one\u2019s kinship networks much easier to trace and settle cases.\u2019 869 A local source provided information on monthly incomes. Accordingly, a cleaner earns around 70- 80 USD per month, a watchman around 80-100 USD, a policeman or a soldier earns 110 USD, a mid- level military or police officer around 300 USD and a teacher in a public school earns 110 USD.

        "Country of origin information report | Somalia: Key socio-economic indicators 90 teacher in a private school gets 100 USD per class and can earn around 300-400 USD per month, depending on the number of classes. A nurse earns 150-200 USD per month, a worker in a government office 200-300 USD, depending on the educational level. A general or a minister earns 1 500- 2 000 USD per month. 870 With regard to costs for living, the same source reports that a house (four rooms) in Hargeisa costs 200-250 USD per month. Additionally, a household of six persons needs around 35 USD for electricity and around 30 USD for water and 5 USD for waste disposal monthly. Monthly school fees in public school are 5 USD and in private schools between 15 and 70 USD, including bus fair and depending on the school. A poor family (parents plus 4 to 6 children) in Hargeisa would need between 300 and 350 USD monthly; a middle-class family of the same site would need some 500-600 USD monthly. The normal income of the family head (e.g. the salary of the father who is a teacher or soldier on government payroll) is often not enough to cover the family expenses; poorer families need regular contributions from relatives (either those having a good job in Hargeisa or elsewhere nearby, or those living in the diaspora). 871 Another local source living for the past ten years in Hargeisa, but originating from Sanaag region, mentioned that someone without relatives or family in Hargeisa would have to spend around 3 USD per night for a cheap hotel room, 2 USD for breakfast, 3 USD for lunch and 2 USD for dinner. The minimum expenses would be 10 USD daily, which means this person would need 300 USD a month to survive in Hargeisa without having a local family connection. This does not include any extra-costs, e.g., for health care 872 As mentioned above, it is estimated that in 2012 % of urban households\u2019 remittances constituted 40 quarter of - income in Hargeisa and that remittances constituted the main source of income for one these households. 873 A study published by the Cardiff University in 2017 also found that the economy remained highly dependent on diaspora remittances. 874 In April 2021, the Guardian found that, according to Somaliland\u2019s central bank, between early 2020 and ea rly 20 21, \u2018remittances increased from $1.1bn to $1.3bn\u2019. 875 3.4 Social protection networks and (lack of) support to specific groups Hoehne, who lived several years in the region, including Hargeisa, mentioned that generally, society in Hargeisa is clan-based. The dominant groups all belong to the Isaaq clan-family. The dominant groups in Hargeisa are Habar Awal towards the north and the west of the city, Habar Jeclo to the northeast, Habar Yonis towards the west and Idagalle (also Aidagalle) and Arab towards the south and south-east of the city. Some neighbourhoods of Hargeisa are dominated by one clan or sub-clan; others are \u2018mixed\u2019 (p articularly the centre and neighbourhoods close to it, like \u2018Statehouse\u2019). Certainly, also non-Isaaq live, work and have property in Hargeisa (please see also section 3.1.1 Demographics and clan composition). Since the city is the capital of Somaliland, members from all groups represented in government have a residence in the city. Businessmen from all over Somaliland are 870 Osman, A.

However, the strongest and most influential group are Isaaq. 876 3.4.1 Clan-based protection A local source in Hargeisa mentioned that the city has become peaceful over the past 20 years. Government institution are firmly established, the police is working effectively, and also the court system is well-established. 877 If a person has a conflict or a problem in Hargeisa, he or she can go to the police. If there are credible allegations that a crime has happened, the police start investigations and if evidence was found, the matter is handed over to the courts. Simultaneously, family elders still play a role. In case of theft, injury or even a killing, they can step in and start negotiations about compensation. If an agreement is reached between the elders of the perpetrator and the ones of the victim, the case is normally dropped by the police and/or the court and a compensation is paid to the family of the victim, which is notified officially by the local government (at least if the parties involved wish that). If a killing was intentional, the state does usually not accept to drop the case. In case of murder, normally a mandatory prison sentence of around 10 years is issued. The source added that inside Hargeisa, clan protection is not necessary, unless a person is involved in an active conflict and thus is a potential target in a revenge attack. Members of different patrilineal descent groups can go about their business, own property, buy land etc. without disturbance by others on clan basis. 878 Another local source emphasised that generally, security in the city was stable. Even those from non- Isaaq groups feel secure in everyday life in Hargeisa. However, in conflict situations, clan-belonging usually becomes important. If a member from a group whose \u2018clan - homeland\u2019 (Somali: degaan ) is in Hargeisa, clashes with a person who is an incomer originating from, e.g., the far east or far west of Somaliland, the local person has an advantage. He or she may have acquaintances and relatives in the police, in court or in other relevant positions. The source added that government institutions in Hargeisa do often not work effectively and they are also not neutral. Particularly courts were frequently prone to bribery and corruption. Additionally, and as a second way to defend one\u2019s position in a conflict situation, a member of a subaltern group would have to mobilise his/her elders to support him/her. Yet, also in regulation procedures under customary law (Somali: xeer ), the local groups in Hargeisa would still have an advantage over others. 879 This is in accordance with the findings of Schlee, who mentioned in his discussion of conflict settlement among Somalis under customary law that \u2018the outcome is largely determined by the differential in bargaining power.\u2019 880 3.4.2 Returnees, vulnerable groups Regarding IDPs in Hargeisa, a local source mentioned that they live in several locations, one camp is in \u2018Statehouse\u2019 area. Many IDPs are from the region (Somaliland). Many are impoverished country - side dwellers/nomads who are Isaaq or from another dominant group in Somaliland. They get free space or housing; their survival is guaranteed by relatives who pay for food etc. or through donations from international or local NGOs. Some IDPs are from southern Somalia. They are dependent on humanitarian aid. Some also can work as construction workers, as watchmen or cleaners. In case of 876 Hoehne, M. V., telephone interview, 12. July 2021 877 Osman, A.

They try to mobilise their own elders to negotiate with the elders of the other conflict party. 881 The same source adds that IDPs in Hargeisa are sometimes accused by the majority population to be behind crimes. 882 A recent example is reported with regard to refugees in Hargeisa who belong to the Oromo group. In July 2021, they demonstr ated in the city, \u2018saying that they were afraid to be deported [back to Ethiopia] because of rumours accusing Oromo to have abducted children from houses [in Hargeisa].\u2019 883 For more information on IDPs in Hargeisa, please see sections 3.1.2 Humanitarian situation overview, 3.2.3 Accessing and settling in the city and 3.3.2 Housing and shelter. Returnees from the diaspora generally connect with their local relatives (predominantly from the Isaaq clan-family) to get re-integrated into the local society. Hoehne observed that also diaspora Somalis who have been away for decades, e.g. in Europe or North America, normally retain ties to their patrilineal descent groups and some (distanced) relatives on the ground. Upon return to Hargeisa, these relatives would prepare the ground and assist the returnee in the first weeks or even months to establish herself/himself. However, if a returnee would be problem-loaden, e.g. mentally ill, a drug addict or \u2018 penniless \u2019, kinship solidarity could be short -lived. Some relatives might offer a place to stay and some food, but eventually, it is expected that returnees fend for themselves. Those returnees persistently violating basic cultural or religious norms are not tolerated; they have to reform themselves, otherwise they are excluded from family solidarity. Furthermore, those who have lived abroad, especially in the \u2018g l obal north\u2019, for a longer time are expected to bring back economic and other resources and invest back home. Those who cannot do so are looked down upon and mocked by local relatives and others. 884 Vulnerable groups in Hargeisa are, besides IDPs, minority groups. Minorities residing in Hargeisa are mainly occupational minorities belonging to the Gabooye collective (consisting of Madhibaan and Muse Diriye) and also Yibir and Tumal (for more information on this groups, please see section 4.1 of EASO\u2019s COI report Somalia: Targeted profiles). They are marginalised regarding access to education and political and economic resources. 885 881 Yusuf, A. S., telephone interview, 12 July 2021 882 Yusuf, A.
