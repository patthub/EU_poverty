        "III (Preparatory acts) EUROPEAN CENTRAL BANK EUROPEAN CENTRAL BANK OPINION OF THE EUROPEAN CENTRAL BANK of 7 April 2011 on a proposal for a Regulation establishing technical requirements for credit transfers and direct debits in euro (CON/2011/32) (2011/C 155/01) Introduction and legal basis On 28 January 2011, the European Central Bank (ECB) received a request from the Council of the European Union for an opinion on a proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing technical requirements for credit transfers and direct debits in euro and amending Regulation (EC) No 924/2009 ( 1 ) (hereinafter the \u2018proposed regulation\u2019). The ECB\u2019s competence to deliver an opinion is based on Articles 127(4) and 282(5) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union since the proposed regulation contains provisions affecting the basic task of the European System of Central Banks (ESCB) to promote the smooth operation of payment systems, as referred to in the fourth indent of Article 127(2) of the Treaty. In accordance with the first sentence of Article 17.5 of the Rules of Procedure of the European Central Bank, the Governing Council has adopted this opinion. General observations The ECB welcomes and supports the European Commission\u2019s proposal to impose end-dates for migration to the Single Euro Payments Area (SEPA) credit transfers and SEPA direct debits by means of a Union regulation. The ECB and the Eurosystem have repeatedly drawn attention to the need for ambitious but realistic end-dates to be set for migration to SEPA credit transfer and SEPA direct debit, in order to reap the full benefits of SEPA. Although the potential benefits of the SEPA project are substantial, the primarily market-driven approach currently used cannot be characterised as being entirely successful. The prevailing market uncertainty caused by the generally difficult economic climate, the disadvantages for first movers in a network business, and the duplicate costs of operating SEPA and legacy payment systems in parallel are reasons that have led many market players, especially on the supply side, to call for the establishment of an end-date for SEPA migration by means of legislation at the Union level. A Union act of general application, binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States, is therefore considered essential for successful migration to SEPA, as the project would otherwise face a serious risk of failure. Specific observations The ECB has on several occasions pointed out the need for clear guidance regarding interchange fees for direct debits ( 2 ). Articles 6 and 7 of Regulation (EC) No 924/2009 of the European Parliament and of the EN 25.5.2011 Official Journal of the European Union C 155/1 ( 1 ) COM(2010) 775 final. ( 2 ) See the Joint statement by the European Commission and the European Central Bank clarifying certain principles underlying a future SEPA direct debit (SDD) business model, March 2009, and the Single Euro Payments Area, seventh progress report, \u2018Beyond theory into practice\u2019, October 2010, page 17, both available on the ECB\u2019s website at http://www.ecb.europa.eu ",
        "Council of 16 September 2009 on cross-border payments in the Community and repealing Regulation (EC) No 2560/2001 ( 1 ) introduced a temporary default interchange fee for cross-border direct debits, together with a temporary endorsement of national interchange fees for direct debits. Both of these Articles will no longer apply on 1 November 2012; in order to avoid a legal vacuum hampering migration to SEPA direct debit, it is important that a long-term solution for interchange fees for direct debits is established. Article 6 of the proposed regulation concerning interchange fees for direct debits contributes to achieving such legal certainty. Where the ECB recommends that the proposed regulation is amended, specific drafting proposals are set out in the Annex accompanied by explanatory text to this effect. Done at Frankfurt am Main, 7 April 2011. The President of the ECB Jean-Claude TRICHET EN C 155/2 Official Journal of the European Union 25.5.2011 ( 1 ) OJ L 266, 9.10.2009, p. 11. ",
        "ANNEX Drafting proposals Text proposed by the Commission Amendments proposed by the ECB ( 1 ) Amendment 1 First sentence of recital 2 of the proposed regulation \u2018The success of SEPA is very important economically, monetarily as well as politically.\u2019 \u2018The success of SEPA is very important economically, monetarily as well as politically.\u2019 Explanation SEPA is important economically and politically but does not play a role in monetary policy; therefore the word \u2018monetarily\u2019 should be deleted . Amendment 2 Third and new fourth sentence of recital 6 of the proposed regulation \u2018Money remittance, internally processed payments, large- value payment transactions between payment service providers and payments via mobile phone should not fall under the scope of those rules since these payment services are not comparable to credit transfers and direct debits.\u2019 \u2018Money remittance, internally processed payments, large- value payment transactions between payment service providers and payments via mobile phone should not fall under the scope of those rules since these payment services are not comparable to credit transfers and direct debits as defined in this Regulation. Payment transactions processed and settled through large value payment systems should also not fall under the scope of this Regulation. \u2019 Explanation The ECB suggests to add \u2018as defined in this Regulation\u2019 to clarify the message that money remittance, internally processed payments, etc., are not credit transfers and direct debits in the sense of the proposed regulation. As for the explanation of the new fourth sentence suggested by the ECB see Amendment 5 . Amendment 3 Second sentence of recital 9 of the proposed regulation \u2018In order to create an integrated market for electronic payments systems in euros, it is essential that the processing of credit transfers and direct debits are not hindered by technical obstacles and are carried out under a scheme whose basic rules are adhered to by a majority of payment services providers from a majority of Member States and be the same both for cross-border and for purely national credit transfer and direct debit transactions.\u2019 \u2018In order to create an integrated market for electronic payments systems in euros, it is essential that the processing of credit transfers and direct debits are not hindered by technical obstacles, and are carried out under a scheme whose basic rules are adhered to by a majority of payment services providers from a majority of Member States whose currency is the euro, and be are the same both for cross-border and for purely national credit transfer and direct debit transactions.\u2019 Explanation Interoperability is essential to ensure that payments can be processed efficiently across the Union. The dual requirements, i.e. that the rules apply on a national and cross-border basis and the required majority participation, in recital 9 and Article 4(1) of the proposed regulation, are important measures to ensure that payment schemes become pan-European. However, taking into account the development of new payment services, adherence by payment service providers in Member States whose currency is not the euro might not be considered a priority, considering the low number of euro transactions in some of these Member States. It is therefore suggested to limit the condition in Article 4(1)(b) (see Amendment 14) and accordingly recital 9 to a majority of payment service providers in a majority of Member States whose currency is the euro. This should on the one hand, avoid insurmountable impediments at the launch of the innovative credit transfer and direct debit services and, on the other hand, ensure a pan- European character . EN 25.5.2011 Official Journal of the European Union C 155/3 ",
        "Text proposed by the Commission Amendments proposed by the ECB ( 1 ) Amendment 4 First sentence of recital 16 of the proposed regulation \u2018In some Member States, there are certain legacy payment instruments which are credit transfers or direct debits but which have very specific functionalities, often due to historical or legal reasons.\u2019 \u2018In some Member States, there are certain legacy payment instruments which are classified as credit transfers or direct debits but which have very specific functionalities, often due to historical or legal reasons.\u2019 Explanation This suggestion is aimed at clarifying that certain legacy payment instruments are classified as credit transfers or direct debits irrespective of their very specific functions . Amendment 5 Article 1(2)(b) of the proposed regulation \u20182. This Regulation shall not apply to the following: [\u2026] (b) payment transactions processed and settled through large value payment systems for which both the original initiator and the final recipient of the payment is a payment service provider\u2019 \u20182. This Regulation shall not apply to the following: [\u2026] (b) payment transactions processed and settled through large value payment systemsfor which both the original initiator and the final recipient of the payment is a payment service provider\u2019 Explanation Payments made through large value payment systems have never been within the scope of SEPA and should therefore be excluded from the scope of the proposed regulation. In this respect, the proposed regulation should clearly focus on bulk retail payments as an inclusion of large value payment systems would require a separate more complex Union act due to very different service levels. Considering the complexity of large value payment systems, the technical challenges the banking industry would face for such a migration, and that retail payments settled within large-value payment systems constitute less than 1 % of the total number of retail payments in the euro area, the ECB does not see any need for such a Union act . However, in their role under the fourth indent of Article 3.1 and Article 22 of the Statute of the ESCB as operators of the component systems of the Trans-European Automated Real-time Gross settlement Express Transfer system (TARGET2), the ECB and the national central banks (NCBs) currently consider the introduction of ISO20022 XML standards in TARGET2 is an issue of strategic importance . Amendment 6 Article 1(2)(c) of the proposed regulation \u20182. This Regulation shall not apply to the following: [\u2026] (c) payment transactions through a payment card, including cash withdrawals from a payment account, if they do not result in a credit transfer or direct debit to or from a payment account identified by the basic bank account number (BBAN) or the international banc account number (IBAN)\u2019 \u20182. This Regulation shall not apply to the following: [\u2026] (c) payment card transactions through a payment card, including cash withdrawals from a payment account, if they do not result in a credit transfer or direct debit to or from a payment account identified by the basic bank account number (BBAN) or the inter\u00ad national banc account number (IBAN)\u2019 Explanation The ECB agrees that card payments and cash withdrawals should be exempt from the proposed regulation; however card payments, with the exception of cash withdrawals from a payment account, always result in a credit transfer or direct debit to or from a payment account identified by its BBAN or IBAN. In addition card payments are not covered by the Commission\u2019s impact assessment accompanying the proposed regulation and it follows that they fall outside the scope of the proposed regulation. Accordingly, the ECB suggests deleting the reference to the use of BBAN and IBAN to avoid an interpretation of card payments as being included de facto in the proposed regulation, which is contrary to the intention underlying this provision .

        "Text proposed by the Commission Amendments proposed by the ECB ( 1 ) Amendment 7 Article 1(4) of the proposed regulation (new) No current text. \u2018 4. This Regulation shall not apply to the European Central Bank and the national central banks when acting in their capacity as monetary authorities or other public authorities. \u2019 Explanation Activities performed by the ECB or a national central bank in accordance with the fourth indent of Article 127(2) of the Treaty, and Article 3 of the Statute of the ESCB, should be excluded from the scope of the proposed regulation with a view to central bank independence (see Article 130 of the Treaty). In this respect, the ECB suggests that the same exemption as contained under Article 1(1)(e) of Directive 2007/64/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 13 November 2007 on payment services in the internal market amending Directives 97/7/EC, 2002/65/EC, 2005/60/EC and 2006/48/EC and repealing Directive 97/5/EC ( 2 ) is inserted in the proposed regulation . Amendment 8 Article 2 of the proposed regulation (new definition) No current text. \u2018 \u201cpayment card\u201d means a device that allows the payer (i) to perform payment transactions, either at a card accepting device or remotely, including by mail, telephone or through the Internet; or (ii) to access cash at an automatic teller machine\u2019 Explanation The ECB understands that the aim of Article 1(2)(c) of the proposed regulation is to exclude traditional card transactions from its scope of application while including transactions in which a payment card is used primarily to identify the payer when they initiate a direct debit or credit transfer transaction. Since a majority of card payments are finally settled either via a credit transfer or a direct debit transaction, the current drafting could be interpreted as including also card transactions in general. To ensure legal certainty, the ECB suggests introducing a definition of payment card and redrafting Article 7(2) of the proposed regulation, waiving direct debit transactions initiated by a card at a point of sale (see Amendment 17). In addition, Article 1(2)(c) of the proposed regulation exempts from the scope of application payment transactions through a payment card without defining the latter . Amendment 9 Article 2 of the proposed regulation (new definition) No current text. \u2018 \u201clarge-value payment systems\u201d means payment systems whose main purpose is to process, clear and/or settle single payment transactions of high priority and primarily of a large amount\u2019 Explanation The suggested new Article 1(2)(b) of the proposed regulation (see Amendment 5) contains the term \u2018large-value payment systems\u2019, which should be defined . Amendment 10 Article 2 of the proposed regulation (new definition) No current text. \u2018 \u201cretail payment systems\u201d means payment systems whose main purpose is to process, clear and/or settle payment transactions, which are bundled together for transmission and are primarily of a small amount and low priority\u2019 . EN 25.5.2011 Official Journal of the European Union C 155/5 ",
        "Text proposed by the Commission Amendments proposed by the ECB ( 1 ) Explanation Article 4(2) of the proposed regulation introduces the concept of interoperability between payment systems, which should only apply to retail payment systems (see Amendment 15). In view thereof, the term \u2018retail payment systems\u2019 should be defined . Amendment 11 Article 2(1) of the proposed regulation \u2018(1) \u201ccredit transfer\u201d means a payment service for crediting a payee\u2019s payment account, where a payment trans\u00ad action or a series of payment transactions is initiated by the payer on the basis of the consent given to his payment service provider\u2019 \u2018(1) \u201ccredit transfer\u201d means a payment service for crediting a payee\u2019s payment account, where a payment trans\u00ad action or a series of payment transactions is initiated by the payer based on an instruction on the basis of the consent given to his payment service provider\u2019 Explanation Since a credit transfer requires concrete action, which is more than mere consent on the part of the payer, its definition should be made more specific . Amendment 12 Article 2(2) of the proposed regulation \u2018(2) \u201cdirect debit\u201d means a payment service for debiting a payer\u2019s payment account, where a payment transaction is initiated by the payee on the basis of the payer\u2019s consent\u2019 \u2018(2) \u201cdirect debit\u201d means a payment service for debiting a payer\u2019s payment account, where a payment transaction is initiated by the payee on the basis of the payer\u2019s consent given to the payee, to the payee\u2019s payment service provider or to the payer\u2019s own payment service provider\u2019 Explanation In order to ensure consistency with other relevant secondary Union acts and for reasons of legal certainty, it is suggested to align the definition of \u2018direct debit\u2019 contained in the proposed regulation with the definition contained in Article 2(14) of Regulation (EC) No 924/2009 and in Article 4(28) of Directive 2007/64/EC . Amendment 13 Article 2(7) of the proposed regulation \u2018(7) \u201cpayment scheme\u201d means a set of rules, practices and standards for making payments between the scheme participants, and which is separated from any infra\u00ad structure or payment system that supports its operation across and within Member States\u2019 \u2018(7) \u201cpayment scheme\u201d means a common set of rules, practices and standards agreed for making payments between the scheme participants, and which is separated from any infrastructure or payment system that supports its operation across and within Member States service providers for the execution of payment transactions\u2019 Explanation To ensure consistency with other relevant secondary Union legislation and for reasons of legal certainty, the definition of \u2018payment scheme\u2019 contained in the proposed regulation should be aligned with the definition of \u2018direct debit scheme\u2019 contained in Article 2(15) of Regulation (EC) No 924/2009, taking into account the common elements of a scheme contained in the two definitions . Amendment 14 Article 4(1) of the proposed regulation \u20181. Payment service providers shall carry out credit transfers and direct debits under a payment scheme which complies with the following conditions: \u20181. Payment service providers shall carry out credit transfers and direct debits under a payment scheme which complies with the following conditions: EN C 155/6 Official Journal of the European Union 25.5.2011 ",

Amendment 15 Article 4(2) of the proposed regulation \u20182. Payment systems and, where applicable, payment schemes shall be technically interoperable through the use of standards developed by international or European standardisation bodies.\u2019 \u20182. Retail P p ayment systems and, where applicable, payment schemes shall be technically interoperable through the use of standards developed by international or European standardisation bodies.\u2019 Explanation Article 4(2) of the proposed regulation requires technical interoperability of payment systems and payment schemes (where applicable) without defining concretely what is meant by such technical interoperability. Ideally, more precise drafting addressing the implications of the term would be warranted. In the absence of this, the ECB suggests deleting the reference to payment schemes as technical interoperability between such schemes is not regarded as operationally feasible. More importantly, retail payment systems and large- value payment systems are very different in nature from a processing, clearing, and settlement perspective, despite the fact that both types of systems can be used to process retail payment transactions. Generally speaking, retail payment systems make use of large- value payment systems for settlement of their balances. It should be made clear that interoperability can only be expected among payment systems of the same type. Demanding interoperability between retail payment systems and large-value payment systems would not only raise question of proportionality, since retail payments processed via large-value payment systems like TARGET2 and EURO1 constitute less than 1 % of the total number of retail payments in the euro area, but could also have unintended side effects from a risk and stability perspective . Amendment 16 Article 5(1) and (2) of the proposed regulation \u20181. By [ insert concrete date 12 months after entry into force of this Regulation] at the latest, credit transfers shall be carried out in accordance with the technical requirements set out in points 1 and 2 of the Annex. 2. By [ insert concrete date 24 months after entry into force of this Regulation] at the latest, direct debits shall be carried out in accordance with Article 6 and the technical requirements set out in points 1 and 3 of the Annex.\u2019 \u20181. By 31 January 2013 [ insert concrete date 12 months after entry into force of this Regulation] at the latest, credit transfers shall be carried out in accordance with the technical requirements set out in points 1 and 2 of the Annex. 2. By 31 January 2014 [ insert concrete date 24 months after entry into force of this Regulation] at the latest, direct debits shall be carried out in accordance with Article 6 and the technical requirements set out in points 1 and 3 of the Annex.\u2019 Explanation The ECB agrees that the requirements for credit transfers and direct debits should enter into force within a rather short timeframe, especially considering that SEPA credit transfer was launched in January 2008 and SEPA direct debit in November 2009. Taking into consideration the payment industry\u2019s need for sufficiently long lead times, the ECB suggests setting concrete dates, which could preferably be at the end of January 2013 for credit transfers and the end of January 2014 for direct debits .

Where imperative grounds of urgency so require, Article 15 shall apply.\u2019 \u20181. The powers to adopt the delegated acts referred to in Article 5(4) shall be conferred on the Commission for an indeterminate period of time. The Commission shall prepare draft delegated acts in close cooperation with the Eurosystem and where relevant, with the other members of the ESCB and in consultation with service providers and user representatives. Where imperative grounds of urgency so require, Article 15 shall apply.\u2019 Explanation To avoid hampering the development of new and innovative payment instruments, it is of the utmost importance that the technical requirements set out in delegated acts can be amended in a smooth and efficient way. When exercising its delegated powers, the Commission should do so in close cooperation with the Eurosystem and where relevant, with the other members of the ESCB and also based on a consultation of the payments industry and other stakeholders, to ensure, inter alia, that amendments are scheduled taking into account the payment industry\u2019s business cycles . Amendment 19 Point 1(d) of the Annex to the proposed regulation \u2018(d) The remittance data field shall allow for 140 characters.

Payment schemes may allow for a higher number of characters, except if the device used to remit information has technical limitations related to the number of characters, in which case the technical limit of the device shall apply.\u2019 Explanation Payment schemes should not be restricted in the number of characters which can be provided, for which reason it is suggested to set 140 characters as a minimum . Amendment 20 Point 3(f) of the Annex to the proposed regulation \u2018(f) Consent shall be given both to the payee and to the payment service provider of the payer (directly or indirectly via the payee) and the mandates, together with later modifications and/or cancellation, shall be stored by the payee or by a third party on behalf of the payee.\u2019 \u2018(f) Consent shall be given both to the payee and, directly or indirectly via the payee, to the payment service provider of the payer, (directly or indirectly via the payee) and the mandates, together with later modifi\u00ad cations and/or cancellation, shall be stored by the payee or by a third party on behalf of the payee.\u2019 EN C 155/8 Official Journal of the European Union 25.5.2011 ",
        "Text proposed by the Commission Amendments proposed by the ECB ( 1 ) Explanation The drafting in point 3(f) of the Annex to the proposed regulation could be incorrectly interpreted as meaning that existing mandates that do not explicitly address both the payee and the payment service provider of the payer are void and must be re-signed. This could be a very burdensome exercise considering the vast number of existing direct debit mandates. It should therefore be made clear, for the avoidance of any possible doubt, that consent to the payer\u2019s payment service provider may be given indirectly via the payee .

Equality between women and men is a fundamental value of the European Union enshrined in the Treaties and is one of the objectives and tasks of the European Union, and mainstreaming the principle of equality between women and men in all its activities represents a general aim for the Union ( 1 ); 2. Gender equality is enshrined in Article 23 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union; 3. While the European Union possesses a significant body of legislation promoting compliance with the principle of equal treatment of men and women in areas such as employment and access to goods and services ( 2 ), successive annual reports on \u2018Equality between Women and Men\u2019 ( 3 ) adopted by the European Commission demonstrate that progress is slow and that de facto gender equality has yet to be attained; 4. \u2018Europe 2020\u2019, the European Union's new strategy for jobs and smart, sustainable and inclusive growth ( 4 ), will help the Member States and the European Union to deliver high levels of competitiveness, productivity, growth, social cohesion and economic convergence; 5. The Europe 2020 Strategy includes the headline target of aiming to raise to 75 % the employment rate for women and men aged 20-64, which means it is necessary to give priority to addressing barriers to women's participation in the labour market when implementing the Strategy; 6. The Employment Guidelines, which form part of the \u2018Europe 2020 integrated guidelines\u2019 ( 5 ) and are monitored within the Joint Assessment Framework ( 6 ), underline, in this regard, the importance of the implementation, assessment and follow-up of employment policies that promote gender equality and work-life balance; 7.

        "ANNEX European Pact for Gender Equality (2011-2020) THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION acknowledges that equality between women and men is a fundamental value of the European Union and that gender equality policies are vital to economic growth, prosperity and competitiveness. Five years after the adoption of the first European Pact for Gender Equality, a new impetus is needed, particularly in order to reaffirm and support the close link between the Commission\u2019s Strategy for equality between women and men 2010- 2015 and \u2018Europe 2020: the European Union's Strategy for jobs and smart, sustainable and inclusive growth\u2019. THE COUNCIL therefore reaffirms its commitment to fulfil EU ambitions on gender equality as mentioned in the Treaty and in particular to: 1. close the gender gaps in employment and social protection, including the gender pay gap, with a view to meeting the objectives of the Europe 2020 Strategy, especially in three areas of great relevance to gender equality, namely employment, education and promoting social inclusion in particular through the reduction of poverty, thus contributing to the growth potential of the European labour force; 2. promote better work-life balance for women and men throughout the life-course, so as to enhance gender equality, increase women's participation in the labour market and contribute to meeting the demographic challenges; and 3. combat all forms of violence against women in order to ensure the full enjoyment by women of their human rights and to achieve gender equality, including with a view to inclusive growth. THE COUNCIL urges action at Member State and, as appropriate, Union level in the following fields: Measures to close gender gaps and combat gender segregation in the labour market: (a) promote women's employment in all age brackets and close gender gaps in employment, including by combating all forms of discrimination; (b) eliminate gender stereotypes and promote gender equality at all levels of education and training, as well as in working life, in order to reduce gender segregation in the labour market; (c) ensure equal pay for equal work and work of equal value; (d) promote women's empowerment in political and economic life and advance women's entrepreneurship; (e) encourage the social partners and enterprises to develop and effectively implement initiatives in favour of gender equality and promote gender equality plans at the workplace; and (f) promote the equal participation of women and men in decision-making at all levels and in all fields, in order to make full use of all talents. Measures to promote better work-life balance for women and men: (a) improve the supply of adequate, affordable, high-quality childcare services for children under the mandatory school age with a view to achieving the objectives set at the European Council in Barcelona in March 2002, taking into account the demand for childcare services and in line with national patterns of childcare provision; (b) improve the provision of care facilities for other dependants; and (c) promote flexible working arrangements and various forms of leave for both women and men. Measures to tackle all forms of violence against women: (a) adopt, implement and monitor strategies at national and Union level with a view to eliminating violence against women; (b) strengthen the prevention of violence against women and the protection of victims and potential victims, including women from all disadvantaged groups; and (c) emphasise the role and responsibility of men and boys in the process of eradicating violence against women. EN C 155/12 Official Journal of the European Union 25.5.2011 ",
        "Governance, implementation and monitoring: The relevant aspects of this Pact, and of the Commission's annual reports on \u2018Equality between Women and Men\u2019, should be taken into account in the mechanisms of the Europe 2020 Strategy as appropriate. THE COUNCIL reaffirms its commitment to reinforce governance through gender mainstreaming by integrating the gender perspective into all policy areas including external EU actions, also taking into account the critical role of men and boys in the promotion of gender equality, and by ensuring that gender equality effects are taken into account in impact assessments of new EU policies. THE COUNCIL encourages the Member States and the Commission, in particular through Eurostat, to further develop existing statistics and indicators disaggregated by sex and to fully utilise the capacities of the European Institute for Gender Equality. When developing and implementing their national reform programmes, the Member States are encouraged to apply a gender equality perspective and to promote gender equality policies, especially concerning the employment guidelines, and invited to make appropriate use of agreed gender equality indicators developed within the Joint Assessment Framework and within the follow-up of the Beijing Platform for Action in all relevant policy areas and processes. The Commission and the Council are also invited to incorporate a gender equality perspective into the Annual Growth Survey, the country opinions and the country specific recommendations. The progress made on the implementation of the European Pact for Gender Equality should be discussed by ministers annually, at the Council level.
