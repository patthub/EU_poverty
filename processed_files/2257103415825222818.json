Despite the fact that these countries differ significantly from the EU, they attach great importance to territorial policies and provide useful suggestions. Strategic priorities are supported by flexible territorial concentration and competition rules in their regional policies, and cooperation among regions and administrative capacity building are key components of policy implementation.

        "European Cohesion Policy and regional development policies in other parts of the world _____________________________________________________________________ 9 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY The study compares the main features of the EU\u2019s Cohesion Policy with similar policies in other parts of the world. The review focuses on two important emerging countries, China and Brazil, as well as on two international organisations, ASEAN and MERCOSUR. The study makes recommendations to feed into the policy debate concerning the future of the EU Cohesion Policy after 2020. The analysis is mainly a survey of the relevant institutional and academic literature. The literature review focuses in particular on the institutional framework and multilevel governance, redistribution and geographical targeting of resources, budget, main objectives and implementation systems. To broaden and update the analysis a small number of interviews were carried out with representatives of institutions and experts. The examined countries and international organizations pursue different regional policies which are not directly comparable to the EU Cohesion Policy. For this reason in the text the expression \u201cCohesion Policy\u201d refers only to the EU, while \u201cregional policy\u201d or \u201cregional development policy\u201d are used for the other countries/organizations. China and Brazil - China and Brazil are emerging countries which to a different extent have experienced important economic and social growth in the past two decades. They differ greatly as to size, institutional arrangements, spatial organization and development models. These differences affect their strategic choices but both countries have made an enormous effort to improve economic, social and territorial cohesion in recent years. Fighting poverty and promoting social cohesion according to a territorial approach are common strategic priorities which have attracted increasing political attention and resources in both countries. This political attention aims to create the pre-conditions for development and competitiveness policies. Behind this effort there is a common need for diminishing disparities between rural and urban areas, which are increasingly less acceptable in the presence of growing levels of income. Environmental sustainability is also an important priority especially in China where some areas are being preserved exclusively for tourism. In both countries territorial policies for growth and competiveness are based on a broad range of incentives for attracting foreign investments. In China the utilisation of a large range of fiscal, financial and use of soil instruments allows local authorities to adapt competitiveness policies to territorial features. The re-localisation policies, which foster the transfer of activities to the Central provinces, is facilitated by the large Chinese industrial basis. Mutual assistance is a specific instrument for territorial policies that promotes bilateral economic solidarity and technical support between two provinces: one strong \u201cdonor\u201d and a weaker \u201crecipient\u201d. In Brazil, the fact that federal regional policy mix is limited to financial instruments makes the definition of an integrated territorial policy difficult. However, the recent changes in the eligibility of the national funds moved the focus to endogenous potential and increased the role of SMEs, local productive systems and disadvantaged border areas. In these countries territorial development is a consolidated component of national development policies. In addition, in China political stability has led to a constant adaptation of the territorial policies to the national economic strategy. In Brazil the more frequent political changes have generated a stop-and-go process in regional policy and hampered its reform and modernisation. It is difficult to estimate the resources devoted to territorial policies, especially in China, where the scope of regional policy is more ",
        "Policy Department for Structural and Cohesion Policies _____________________________________________________________ 10 fuzzy. In Brazil resources specifically devoted to federal regional policy amount to around 0.5% of GDP, without considering federal fiscal de-contribution and expenditure made by individual states. China and Brazil adopt a small scale territorial approach in policy implementation and the way areas are targeted. This common approach suggests that great importance is given to the local dimension of development and functional areas are necessary to define consistent and effective interventions. In this respect, the Chinese experience seems more flexible and adaptable, as it can change fiscal rules for a specific and limited area. The two countries have different governance models for regional policy. China merges regional policy into national development policies and its governance reflects the governance of the whole public expenditure system: largely decentralised in the implementation but strategically oriented from the centre. In Brazil, regional policy is separated from the other development policies, based on specific funds and very centralised; it may be assimilated to a development bank business model. Two reforms for a more decentralised approach have been rejected by Parliament, but there have been significant and positive experiences of multi-level and decentralised governance in anti-poverty and rural development policies. Regional policy implementation deserves special attention, especially in China, because there competition between local authorities is an important way to promote efficiency and proactive attitudes. This competition pushes policy implementation, but sometimes negatively affects coordination and collaboration between officials. In general, both countries suffer from weak coordination between institutions and the inadequate definition of the roles and the powers of the different actors. ASEAN and MERCOSUR - ASEAN and MERCOSUR are carrying out their integration processes with different approaches. ASEAN has adopted a gradual and multispeed approach, where bilateral and differentiated agreements prevail; the institutionalisation of ASEAN is limited and just in recent years a more structured organization has been established. In MERCOSUR there is a relatively advanced institutional organization but this does not correspond to an intense integration process while bilateral contrasts often break out. Despite these different approaches both organizations focus on economic disparities and cohesion. In principle, they recognise that trade and economic integration, their prime objective, cannot occur if disparities are too large and integration benefits are not distributed. The same preoccupation motivated the radical reform of the European Structural Funds in 1989 and the following revisions to make EU enlargements possible. The specific geo-political features of ASEAN need to be taken into consideration and affect its objectives and organization: the proximity of China, the second largest economy in the world, significantly influences the economic and infrastructural organization of member countries and their association facilitate relationships and exchanges with China. MERCOSUR has to deal with a different context. Even if the US influence on Latina America is significant, differences in the size of the countries and the predominance of Brazil do not facilitate balanced progress. The regional policies of the two organizations are limited and based on a project approach. The Initiative for ASEAN Integration (IAI) is the main policy instrument for tackling territorial disparities in ASEAN and it funds projects to support the weakest countries to comply with ASEAN standards and reinforce their development policies. These projects generate as a \u201cmultiplier\u201d for interventions funded by national resources, ",
        "European Cohesion Policy and regional development policies in other parts of the world _____________________________________________________________________ 11 international cooperation or development banks. FOCEM, MERCOSUR\u2019s main financial instrument, is rather small in size (EUR 127 million in 2015). The fund, financed by the richest countries, supports projects for promoting infrastructures, enterprises and social cohesion mainly in the weakest countries. The sub-regional arrangement, which defines a common macro-regional strategy for groups of countries or regions, provides ASEAN with an additional instrument for the reduction of development gaps. These strategies are not funded by ASEAN but are a framework to channel international donor and national resources in those areas. These initiatives associate all countries under a single strategic umbrella and, mutatis mutandis, can be compared to the EU macro-regional strategies. The disparities and the economic convergence in the two organizations have varied enormously in the last 15 years: the disparities among the countries in ASEAN are very large but are converging, while the disparities in MERCOSUR are more limited but over the years have remained unaltered or decreased only slightly mainly due to the fall of some of the richer economies (Venezuela and Argentina). Currently, these features are likely to affect the different political initiatives and strategic capacity in the two organizations. Answers to the research questions Has the European regional policy influenced regional/development policies in countries outside the EU, and in what way? A diffused influence of the EU approaches on regional development policy and, more generally, territorial integration issues emerged from the analysis. Traces of the EU Cohesion Policy experience are evident in the Brazilian debate; the EU experience influenced also the features of the territorial social programmes and their local development approach. In addition, EU inspiration is also evident in the significant effort made in evaluating regional policy in Brazil. There are no evident traces of European influence in China also because it does not have a specific regional policy. However, themes such as multi-level governance, local development, social dialogue are at the centre of the Chinese debate and are part of the exchanges with EU. To a certain extent the nature of institutional arrangements of ASEAN and MERCOSUR is comparable to the EU institutions and this confirms the fundamental role that the EU experience has played at international level. This also means that there already is a common experimental platform and shared \u201clanguage\u201d on regional development in the international community. Has regional policy in countries outside the EU influenced European Cohesion policy, and in what way? The regional policies examined in the study do not seem to have exerted any influence on the EU Cohesion Policy. EU redistributive arrangements, at the basis of its Cohesion Policy, are difficult to find in China and Brazil - where redistribution is simpler \u2013 and in ASEAN and MERCOSUR - where the development of EU institutions and integration is still unfamiliar. Which innovations from the selected third countries and regional international bodies could be or should be further explored by the EU Cohesion Policy? Lessons deriving from the examined experiences have been grouped in three main categories: 1) the strategic approach to the Cohesion Policy, 2) its instruments, 3) administrative and institutional capacity. ",
        "Policy Department for Structural and Cohesion Policies _____________________________________________________________ 12 Lessons for Cohesion Policy - In this field lessons require a new approach to territorial development and the integration of competitiveness and social priorities. In order to combine regional, national and EU development strategy more successfully, financial concentration should continue to benefit weakest areas but a more flexible approach may make it possible to devote more resources to stronger areas when they promote integrated initiatives with less favoured regions (for instance, in research, education or tourism development). Migration and labour mobility should become an important priority for Cohesion Policy not only to tackle the current emergency, but also to counteract ageing and to promote balanced and inclusive patterns of growth. In this respect social issues should be integrated into Cohesion Policy more broadly and efficiently, while labour active policy, and also living standards and adequate social services should be guaranteed in the weakest areas. Cohesion Policy cannot bear the financial burden of these investments alone, MSs should be made responsible for ensuring social standards as a necessary precondition for growth. Finally, and in accordance with previous indications for a more articulated and flexible Cohesion Policy, the macro regional approach should be developed further and made more operational. Policy instruments - In order to increase the attractiveness to foreign investments, fiscal or financial incentives should be reinforced in the most deprived areas with easier and more flexible derogation of competition rules. This approach should be adjusted according to the size of the deprived areas on the one hand and the level of the national tax imposition on the other to avoid excessive and unfair discounts. The experience of the \u201cEnterprises zones\u201d of the ERDF may be extended. Administrative capacity \u2013 This is a pre-condition for growth policy, and in the weakest areas it is also a development instrument per se. Lessons from foreign countries encourage the use of tangible incentives and award mechanisms (career, financial incentives, work reorganizations, clear responsibility) in the administrations to improve their performance. In weak contexts the implementation of the EU programmes may be associated with compulsory national or local administrative reinforcement plans, as experienced in Italy in recent years. Other lessons would recommend a tighter cooperation between weak and strong administrations in the same countries or also among different countries. These forms of cooperation may be included in the national OPs and/or may represent a second generation of the current \u2018peer 2 peer\u2019 initiative of DG Regio. Last but not least, a resolute policy for capacity building in the EU requires a stronger leadership by the EC, which in perspective would have to multiply its efforts to intervene in radically different administrative organizations, coordinate regional cooperation and identify minimum common standards, and insist on MSs honouring their commitments. In conclusion, lessons learned recommend an increasing flexibility in the implementation of the Cohesion policy principles. These principles are still valid and shared in the world, but their adaptation to development strategies requires a new solidarity agreement between strong and weak regions. The new agreement should not be based on a rigid allocation of resources and narrow competition rules, but should be open to cooperation among regions, development of common projects and share the responsibility for national and EU growth.

Objectives of the study The main objective of this study is to compare the main features of the EU\u2019s Cohesion Policy with similar policies in other parts of the world. The review focuses on two important emerging countries, China and Brazil, as well as on two international organizations, ASEAN and MERCOSUR. The study makes recommendations to feed into the policy debate concerning the future of the EU Cohesion Policy after 2020. In particular, there are three research questions requiring an answer in the terms of reference: \uf0b7 Has the European regional policy influenced regional/development policies in countries outside the EU, and in what way? \uf0b7 Has regional policy in countries outside the EU influenced European Cohesion Policy, and in what way? Which novelties could be of interest to the EU Cohesion Policy? \uf0b7 Which innovations from the selected third countries and regional international bodies could be or should be further explored by the EU Cohesion Policy? Our analysis is mainly a survey of the literature, including current cooperation agreements. As far as China and Brazil are concerned, the study analyses regional policies implemented to identify the following: similarities and differences with European Cohesion Policy, elements of EU Cohesion Policy reproduced and adapted for their own circumstances via cooperation initiatives and aspects of their approach, which may be relevant to the EU\u2019s post-2020 Cohesion Policy. The study also analyses the regional policies of ASEAN and MERCOSUR, whose experience is of shorter duration than Europe\u2019s own longer term policies and who might benefit from the European experience. To consider this question, our analyses of MERCOSUR and ASEAN are more focused on whether and how these institutions deal with problems of regional inequality and development policies in each of the countries with respect to a free and open market. Our study examines the state of the debate among these associations of countries, and the actual and potential impact of EU cooperation initiatives. in their regional development policies. Our approach is summarised in the following paragraphs. Section 2 discusses the results of the analysis of China, Brazil, ASEAN and MERCOSUR. Section 3 draws conclusions from the examples analysed and discusses the possible lessons and recommendations for EU Cohesion Policy and for the cooperation between the EU and third countries. 1.2. Definition of regional development policy and methodology The scope of the study is rather broad and includes two large countries and two international organizations, one Asian and one South American. Both countries and both international organizations pursue different regional policies which are not comparable to the EU Cohesion Policy. For this reason in the text the expression \u201cCohesion Policy\u201d refers only to the EU, while \u201cregional policy\u201d or \u201cregional development policy\u201d are used for the other countries/organizations. However, \u201cregional policy\u201d or \u201cregional development policy\u201d do not identify a unique model but refer to a large variety of policies and interventions aimed at reducing territorial imbalances and promoting regional growth and employment. The features of the different regional policies of each country/organization are illustrated in the relevant paragraphs. ",
        "Policy Department for Structural and Cohesion Policies _____________________________________________________________ 14 1.2.1. Review of the literature The relevant literature was selected in accordance with the objective of the study. Institutional Literature (example, Memoranda of Understanding, Commission reports on the results of the cooperation with third countries) and academic literature were considered. The former was analysed to identify the institutional framework of cooperation between the EU and third countries. The analysis of the latter allows us to identify the main features of the regional development policy models in the international organizations versus the EU Cohesion Policy model. The literature review focuses in particular on the institutional framework, multilevel governance, redistribution and geographical targeting of resources, budget, objectives and systems of funds implementation. 1.2.2. Comparative analysis The comparative analysis makes it possible to identify the main differences and similarities between the different models of regional development policy and at the same time pinpoints which element of the EU experience has been transferred and which element of their model can be a useful for the EU debate on the future of EU Cohesion Policy. The analysis is structured around the following elements which characterise the EU model: 1. Institutional Framework and multilevel governance - Art. 4 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) categorises Cohesion Policy as a shared competence between the Union and the Member States. There is a clear division of competences between the actors involved. The European Commission has a coordination role, while Member States are responsible for the implementation of programmes and the co-financing of the projects. The interactions among the actors are based on the principle of multi-level governance. There are different definitions in literature of multi-level governance but it may be understood as \u201cthe participation of a range of different types of actors (public, private and societal) in policy-making and implementation through formal and informal means\u201d. The European Commission, in the Code of Conduct on the partnership principle for Cohesion Policy 2014-2020, states that \u201cMulti-level governance means coordinated action by the European Union, the Member States and local and regional authorities, based on partnership and aimed at drawing up and implementing EU policies\u201d. The study analyses whether in other world experiences there is an institutional framework involving different kinds of actors and their roles, whether there is a subsidiarity principle that allocates competence between tiers of government. 2. Redistribution and geographical targeting of resources - The EU Cohesion Policy pays much attention to the less developed regions of the EU, reserving a high portion of its budget (around 52% in 2014-2020) to regions with a per capita GDP lower than 75% of the EU average 1 . This rule has not changed since 1988. European regions are defined according to NUTS2, which allows to target specific problems that regions suffer from and which in many countries correspond to administrative units. The study 1 Considering also the countries with a per capita GDP lower than 90% of the EU average benefited by the Cohesion fund, the concentration of Cohesion Policy on the poorest areas reaches the 70% of the total resources in the 2014-2020 period. ",
        "European Cohesion Policy and regional development policies in other parts of the world _____________________________________________________________________ 15 examines if there are targeted regions and how these are defined in other parts of the world; if the method of identifying the targeted regions is able to meet their needs. 3. Budget and financial dimension - The European budget for Cohesion Policy is decided every seven years and amounts to a large share of the total EU budget, around 35% of the total budget and around 0.3% of the European GDP. In agreement with the European Commission, Member States (MSs) decide how to allocate their budget to the Operational programmes (OPs) and they have to co-finance the OPs expenditures. In all MSs resource allocation is defined according to the priorities set out in Europe 2020 strategy and the national/regional needs. In the current 2014-2020 programming period funds have increasingly been concentrated on a limited number of priorities due to specific prescriptions in the regulations. 4. Objectives and Funds - The main objective of the EU Cohesion Policy is to achieve a harmonious development in terms of economic, social and territorial cohesion among the European regions, as stated in the Treaty. In the last two programming periods, MSs were asked through Cohesion Policy and their national policies to explicitly contribute to the Lisbon Strategy and the Europe 2020 strategy. To pursue the objectives of the EU Cohesion Policy, specific funds are used (such as Cohesion Fund, European Regional Development Fund and the European Social Fund 2 ), with different but integrated aims and rules. Moreover, depending on the level of development of the regions funds finance different types of investments. The analysis examines how objectives are set in other countries and international organizations, if these objectives are mainly general, sectoral or territorial. Furthermore, the study identifies the main types of investment carried out, and whether regional development policy is financed with specific funds. 5. Implementation system - EU implementation rules have changed over the different programming periods but the main principles have remained unchanged. The most important are: the programming principle (regional policies have to be implemented through multiannual OPs, which define objectives, sectors of intervention, type of beneficiaries, responsible institutions); the management and control system (each authority responsible for a OP has to set up a management and control system following EU regulations); monitoring and evaluation (regional policies have to be result oriented, monitored on the basis of common indicators and annual implementation reports and have to be ex-ante, on-going and ex-post evaluated). The EC and the MSs co-share these rules and the EC controls that MSs respect them. 1.2.3. Interviews To broaden and update the analysis a small number of interviews were carried out with representatives of institutions and with experts in Member countries of ASEAN, MERCOSUR as well as in China and Brazil. The interviews focused on regional development policies, their multi-level governance, the approach to policy co-financing, and the strategic programming phase. The interviews were carried out by phone or Skype. 2 European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development and European Maritime and Fisheries Fund, although under the Common Provisions Regulation of the 2014-2020 period with the Cohesion Policy funds, are not directly part of the Cohesion Policy architecture even if they share some structural aims/principles with it.

ANALYSIS OF COUNTRIES AND INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS 2.1. China 3 2.1.1. The features of the Chinese regionalism In the last 30 years China has experienced the most sensational economic growth in the world in terms of the population involved, pace and duration. According to IMF data in 2015 the GDP of China at PPP was 17% of the world GDP against 12% of the Euro area. China has been changing from general poverty and a rural economy to a prosperous, urban society and this process is still on-going. Still today farmers make up 34% of the population and in 2016 over 43 million people lived in poverty. Until the beginning of this century the progressive polarization of economic development in urban and eastern coastal areas increased territorial disparities. As showed in the next table the Eastern macro-region, the most successful area, made up 44% of the Chinese GDP in 1978 which increased to 55% in 2005, while all the other macro-regions experienced a lower rate of growth in the same period (see table below). In most recent years a convergence trend appears under way and is benefiting Central and Western macro-regions. Table 1: Main indicators of Chinese macro-regions and comparisons with EU28 MACRO-REGION SURFACE POPULATION GDP IN 2005 GDP ON TOTAL (thou- sand sq km) % (million people) % (EUR billion) 1978 1995 2000 2005 2015 Eastern 91 9.5 480 36.7 1,069.09 43.7 51.2 52.5 55.5 51.6 Central 103 10.7 355 27.1 363.36 21.7 20.4 20.4 18.8 20.3 Western 686 71.5 365 27.9 327.50 20.6 18.1 17.1 17.0 20.1 North-Eastern 80 8.3 109 8.3 168.02 14.0 10.3 10.0 8.7 8.0 China 960 100 1,309 100.0 1,889.81 100 100 100 100 100 EU28 442 495 11,590.00 Source : EC (2010) and own elaboration based on Chinese National Bureau of Statistics, IMF and Eurostat data. The regional development policy in China always paid great attention to territorial dimension and adapted its strategy to promote or balance the territorial agglomeration effects in accordance with the national priorities of the moment. In this respect three main historical periods can be identified since the creation of the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) in 1949: 1) 1950s-1970s \u2013 public investments in infrastructures and industrial plants were relatively higher inland in order to promote a balanced development of all macro- regions. However, it was impossible to achieve analogous levels of productivity in the whole country through simple territorial redistribution of capital so that disparities in income per capita between the macro-regions were higher in 1978 than in 1952. 2) Late 1970s \u2013 late 1990s \u2013 At the end of the 1970s Chinese development policy entered a new era of opening up and slowly moving from a socialist planned economy to a market economy (with substantial public property and public assets). Since the sixth 5-year plan (1980\u20131985) development policy favoured Eastern coastal areas 3 The authors wish to thank Prof. Mick Dunford, of the University of Sussex, for precious suggestions; the information and views set out in this report are only those of the authors.

        "Policy Department for Structural and Cohesion Policies _____________________________________________________________ 18 and contemporary decentralisation of decision making processes increased. These changes were successful and the economy grew at an enormous pace, but also the territorially development became increasingly unbalanced and the coordination problems of the central State become more serious and at the end of the 1990s rebalancing initiatives were implemented. 3) Late 1990s \u2013 beginning of 21 st century \u2013 Development policy has pursued territorial rebalancing and social and education investments have been oriented towards reducing disparities. This new approach includes the renewal of the old industrialised areas of the northern-eastern macro-region and new productive investments in central and western macro-regions, as well as an increasing shift towards a knowledge economy in eastern coastal areas and an increasing focus on environmental sustainability. Recently also the fight against poverty has become more relevant in rural and mountainous areas. ",

        "Policy Department for Structural and Cohesion Policies _____________________________________________________________ 20 The different stages of national development were associated with progressive and constant migration from rural to urban areas, the government partially controlled the internal flows with an authorisation regime by providing social security only in the territory of residence ( hukou system). Recently, this policy has changed by promoting new urban centres. These brief considerations imply that China has always paid great attention to the territorial dimension of its development policy and territorial, social and economic cohesion has been an important component in its design. Nevertheless, regional policy is not defined and institutionalised in specific funds or programmes that are not distinguishable from the usual policy plans; it is the outcome of the interaction between the national orientations on regional development, generally defined in the 5-year plans, and the initiatives of the sub-national administrations. For this reason it is more appropriate to speak of Chinese \u201cregionalism\u201d instead of regional policy. 2.1.2. The institutional framework China is a centralised state with five different sub-national administrative levels: 1) provincial (including metropolitan areas such as Beijing, Chongqing, Shanghai and Tianjin that come directly under the central state, 22 Provinces, 5 Autonomous regions 4 and 2 Special Administrative areas, Hong Kong and Macau), 2) prefectural, 3) county, 4) township and 5) village. The main competence on territorial and development policy lies with the provinces and the four state-managed municipalities with provincial status. In 2010 the size of the provinces ranged from the 500 thousand inhabitants of Macau to the 104 million of Guangdong and from 29 square km of Macau to 1,660,400 square Km of Xinjiang. In addition to normal administrative bodies, special administrative units 5 are established to experiment development policies in limited areas and, once they prove successful, these policies are extended to other areas or the entire country; these areas are normally managed by specific Agencies. The Department of the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) is responsible for Regional Economy; there is also a Department for Western Region Development and another for North-eastern Region Revitalization. The NDRC and other Government Departments go from the national level down through the administrative system (provinces, counties, districts in cities). In 2008 the State Departments relating to spatial governance included the NDRC, Ministries of Finance, Land and Resources, Housing and Urban Rural Development, Environmental Protection, Agriculture, Industry and Information Technology, Commerce, Water Resources, and Transport. These ministries all have their own vertical management systems, so that each administrative tier has its own subordinate department at the next level down, forming a vertical management chain. Moreover, these departments often have many operational units to help them carry out their work. These long chains usually form interest groups. The administrative system is strongly hierarchical and local authorities are subject to central control and leadership. Nevertheless, devolution started in the 1980s and currently local authorities are responsible for many public services and investments; in fact, public expenditure implemented by local authorities has risen from around 50% in the 1980s to 85% in recent years. After the 1994 fiscal reform central administrations collect about 50% of the total government revenues and transfer an important part of 4 Inner Mongolia was established in 1947; Xinjiang in 1955; Guangxi and Ningxia in 1958 and Tibet in 1965. 5 Special Economic Zones (SEZs), Economic and Technological Development Zones (ETDZ), High-technology Development Zones (HTDZ) and state-level New Areas/New Districts.

        "European Cohesion Policy and regional development policies in other parts of the world _____________________________________________________________________ 21 its revenues to local administrations. Per capita transfers vary according to the fiscal capacity of the provinces and political priorities: Beijing, Shanghai and Tianjin have the highest revenues per capita and are the main net transferees, while Tibet, Qinghai, Ning Xia and Xin Jiang are the main net receivers. In addition, when local administrations do not have sufficient resources for their purposes they can increase revenues with loans and commercial activities generally related to urban land use. For instance, in recent years, around half of the investments in urban service facilities has been covered by loans and self-raised funds. Local governments also obtain substantial income from the preparation and leasing of development land (taking advantage of the fact that there is no private ownership of land in China). The public administration has a lot of influence, authority and power - plays a role at all levels of government, and in a large number of State owned enterprises and institutions 6 . This overlapping in administrative ranking gives rise to many difficulties in governance, as when low-tier cities cannot cope with large companies. 2.1.3. Multilevel governance The analysis of the governance of the Chinese regional policy needs some brief clarifications. First, the Chinese regional policy cannot be identified in a specific fund or policy framework and consequently its governance involves the entire public administration and its multi-level organization. Secondly, China is still moving from a planned economy to a market economy and this implies a gradual and still not pervasive involvement of private actors and market mechanisms in the decision making processes. Thirdly, the administration is organised very hierarchically and the career of administrative officials is decided by the higher tiers of the administration and the Communist Party commission; economic performance of the managed territory is an important criterion in their evaluation. Combined with the decentralization of economic development initiatives this Cadre Responsibility System generates strong inter- territorial competition and improves local economic performance. Furthermore, the status of an official does not depend only on their position in the hierarchy, but also on the positions of other officials with whom he/she interacts (as in the old mandarin system) and, hence, a top level manager of a local authority may be subordinated to a manager of a local state owned company. This administrative system is quite efficient in promoting competitiveness and activation among officials, but it can also create confusion in the division of power, coordination problems and forms of local \u201cprotectionism\u201d by competing, instead of collaborating, with the neighbour administrations or officials. The overall national development policy and the main regional strategies are identified in the 5-year plans for National Economic and Social development. In accordance with this national strategy, development plans are defined at provincial level and approved by the central government; in addition, other plans operate on a smaller geographic scale (county, municipality). In these plans the progressive transition to a market economy has increased the use of spatial approaches to address and regulate the private use of land rather than a pure economic approach. The different provincial plans are not compulsory or strictly interconnected and their timing may differ, but all must be coherent with national priorities. At central level the NDRC has broad supervision and coordination power on economic, energy and environmental policies, while at sub-national levels the different 6 For example, the Chinese Academy of Sciences is a provincial/ministry-level unit, the Presidents of Peking and Tsinghua Universities enjoy vice-provincial/ministry level treatment, the heads of large government- controlled enterprises, such as Sinopec, CNPC and China Telecom, also enjoy vice-provincial/ministry treatment. ",
        "Policy Department for Structural and Cohesion Policies _____________________________________________________________ 22 administrations are responsible for the economic planning of their territories in which the Provinces play a crucial role. The hierarchical organization of the development policy does not prevent participation and debate on economic and territorial priorities at each administrative level. In the last decade information and modern IT methods have been successfully used to include citizens and social organizations in decision making mechanisms especially on the provincial level. The eleventh 5 year plan (2006-2010) set out four basic mechanisms for regional development: market mechanism, mutual assistance mechanism, cooperation mechanism and support mechanism. The Mutual assistance mechanism, by which developed areas are encouraged to assist underdeveloped areas, is remarkable. To support mutual assistance counterpart assistance partnerships are defined, specific institutions to assist its implementation are set up and special funds are made available; the whole process is stimulated and regulated by the central government. In recent years mutual assistance has seen an increasing participation of quasi-social organizations, social groups and private sector institutions. Assistance instruments have also changed somewhat, moving from capital transfers and aid projects for infrastructures or industries to capacity building and technical support; the focus of the assistance has also tended to shift from economic development to improving living standards and better public services. Such regional policy governance makes large-scale programming and implementation of local strategies and investments possible, but it also encounters numerous problems or challenges (EC, 2010; Junli, 2014): \uf0b7 the division of responsibility and authority among the different administrative levels is confused and leads to overlaps and inefficiency; \uf0b7 weak coordination and cooperation mechanisms among administrations and departments of the same administration make decision making and implementation processes time consuming and costly; \uf0b7 disordered competition among regions offering tax benefits and land use to attract productive and residential investments penalises the weakest regions and public goods, and can lead to excess supply; \uf0b7 cooperation between cities and regions is too weak to activate sectoral integrated and spatially coordinated initiatives, especially in areas of rapid urbanisation; \uf0b7 the participation in regional policy design and policy accountability are still weak and should be strengthened; \uf0b7 a stronger institutional framework for regional policy in terms of governance, fiscal revenues and financial transfers system, and free movement of production factors should be set up. 2.1.4. Budget and financial arrangements The budget of the territorial and development policy in China is not available, because there are no specific funds and its estimation would require a complex analysis of the national public budget 7 , which is not within the scope of this study. In addition, the large 7 Estimation of this expenditure is not available in the official documents and literature because the regional development policy is not separated from other public policies and the calculation of the public expenditure for territorial objectives requires a very complex analysis of the Chinese public budget at national and local levels. In addition, the large use of fiscal benefits increases the difficulty of that calculation because the amount of non paid resources to the public budget has to be estimated. ",
        "European Cohesion Policy and regional development policies in other parts of the world _____________________________________________________________________ 23 use of fiscal benefits in development policy would make this estimation particularly complex. Some estimations in literature indicate 13-15% of investments on total government expenditure between 2005 and 2009. The estimated territorial distribution of funds suggests that more than 60% of the investment expenditure were allocated in western and central regions, according with cohesion priorities. Special funds are used in lagging behind areas to fight poverty and support employment and have been fundamental in reducing poverty, improving living conditions in deprived areas and ensuring a coordinated territorial development of the entire country. These funds have been reinforced and consolidated in recent years. An important role in development funding is also played by financial institutions; these are subjected to a mixed private-public regime and concentrate their financing in the eastern region (61% of the total domestic and foreign currency loans in 2008) in much greater proportion than the demographic and economic weight of the area. Public banks and loans are another major financial instrument that support regional development. The three banks involved are: the China Development Bank, the Agricultural Development Bank of China and the Export-Import Bank of China. The allocation of loans and other financial supports are mainly concentrated in the eastern region (43% in 2003), but to a lesser extent than the commercial banks and in such a way that they still manage to support weaker areas. 2.1.5. Objectives and targeting areas The main strategic priorities in the different macro-regions in 2010 were: \uf0b7 Eastern China - In the special economic zones (Shenzhen, Zhuhai, Shantou and Xiamen), in the coastal open cities and in Shanghai Pudong New Area several fiscal incentives to reduce business income tax or export taxes and tariffs were aimed at attracting foreign investments, favouring energy and transportation projects , and facilitating productions for export . \uf0b7 Western China - Business income tax and local income tax in autonomous regions are deducted or remitted and other fiscal incentives are allowed in the region. Bank loans and other loans of international organizations have to promote access to credit and investments in the region. \uf0b7 North-Eastern China \u2013 Central government sustained social security and other costs for the recovery of large enterprises and support unemployment in some provinces. Public investments were mainly focused on projects for industrial recovery and the transformation of old state-owned enterprises. \uf0b7 Central China \u2013 Some cities of central region, classified as old industrialised cities, are entitled to the same national preferential policies as the north- eastern region; many other counties implement policies to attract investments and poverty-alleviation projects similar to that of the western region. An important set of interventions was dedicated to the affected-poverty areas , as identified by the central government. In 2001 these areas included 534 counties of 19 different provinces and were particularly widespread in the western and central regions. To support these areas a specific fund and loans of the Agriculture Bank of China were available; investments were oriented to labour intensive industries and agriculture farms as well as to public goods, such as water conservation, restoring farmland to forest and resource development, road construction. The Government has made a solemn promise to lift all those still living in poverty out of that status by the end of ",
        "Policy Department for Structural and Cohesion Policies _____________________________________________________________ 24 2020; the number of people living in poverty nationwide was reduced by 12.4 million in 2016 and according to the prime minister the government will lift another 10 million people out of poverty this year (Li, 2017). In the eleventh 5-year plan the Chinese government divided the whole country into four development priority areas in order to promote industrialization and protect the most vulnerable environmental areas. These areas are: optimised development areas, key development areas, restricted development areas and prohibited development areas. Optimised Areas - development policy aimed to upgrade industrial technological and export capacity; an intensive exploitation of land was also expected to reinforce their commercial, productive and residential functions in these areas. Key Development Areas - strategies were oriented towards reinforcing infrastructures and balancing land for construction and farmland; the urbanisation and settlement of immigrants through housing and reinforcement of public services were encouraged in these areas. Restricted Development Areas - a special compensation fund to preserve environmental areas was established at national level and invested in these areas to restore or preserve the environment; the fund was financed by water resource rates, water and electricity charges and income from tourism. In these areas industry can only be developed if it respects the environment and is confined to areas equipped with suitable infrastructure. Prohibited Development Areas - territorial policy aims to preserve natural reserves and ensure resources for their maintenance; contemporary social services and income opportunities are provided for the population penalised by the environmental limitations. This analysis shows that Chinese development policy has a strong local base and strategies are differentiated by type of area. The central state uses zoning to address and enforce main national priorities, but this does not prevent the individual area from identifying its own policies according to its needs and capacity. 2.1.6. Implementation system Local administrations promote regional development through several instruments. On the one hand they use a wide range of incentives: fiscal subsidies (corporate tax relief, tax holidays, tax rebates, production subsidies, etc.); incentives to use lands for industrial purposes; provision of economic infrastructures for industrial areas; reduced constraints on the immigration of low-wage workers, provision of public housing and dormitories and other government subsidies to reduce production and logistic costs. On the other hand local governments can persuade higher levels of government to establish special zones, such as Economic and Technological Development Zones or High-technology Development Zones, New Areas or other types of zone to attract foreign investments or favour inter-border cooperation. There are more than 150 of these zones and they benefit from preferential treatments in taxation, household registration ( hukou ), special capital grants and greater governance autonomy. These zones also include free trade zones and bonded zones which are rapidly increasing in number 8 . 8 For example Bonded zones are increasingly being established and in western China offer a number of preferential policies: 1) various exemptions from value added tax, tariffs and excise duties, export rebates ",
        "European Cohesion Policy and regional development policies in other parts of the world _____________________________________________________________________ 25 As showed above, interventions are not centrally determined and implemented but only approved and controlled, hence their implementation depends on the activism and the capacity of the local officials. Administrative rank, negotiation capacity with other government levels and the personal network of the officials can accelerate or delay proposals and their implementation. In addition, the legal framework and the relations between central and local levels are not clearly defined. The central power often imposes constraints, such as limited funds for authorized projects, which local administrators have to resolve according to their capacity and spirit of initiative even at the limits of their own power. Fierce competitiveness among officials and incentives associated with the administrative career ensure relative efficient policy implementation. 2.1.7. The effects of the cooperation with the EU During the 2006-2015 period DG REGIO and the National Development and Reform Commission of China implemented a Memorandum of Understanding 9 , which agreed on a dialogue on Cohesion Policy. The policy dialogue included several activities (studies, visits and missions of experts and administrative officials, seminars and training). In 2015 a Joint Statement 10 for reinforcing the partnership between 10 EU and Chinese areas was signed, in the broader framework of the EU-China 2020 Strategic Agenda for Cooperation. The cooperation on regional policy was initially characterised by a one way transfer with Chinese institutions in the learning position. More recently, mutual and balanced exchanges have been developed. Potential fields of EU support to Chinese experiences are: \uf0b7 Institutionalisation and management of multi-level governance. \uf0b7 Public and private partnerships and social dialogue. \uf0b7 Definition and management of specific financial instruments to promote territorial development, such as ERDF or ESF. for domestic goods and raw material entering the zones, but import duties on goods sold domestically; 2) one-stop inspections and quarantine, and reduced fees; 3) reduced 15% enterprise income tax rate in accordance with China\u2019s Western Development Program; 4) reduction in enterprise income tax for five years (on the municipal government\u2019s share); 5) trading of goods between enterprises registered in the Zone and enterprises outside the Zone in China can be priced and settled in RMB or any foreign currency; 6) enterprises leasing factories, warehouses and stacking yards in the Zone are eligible for corresponding preferential policies. 9 The Memorandum of Understanding was signed in May 2006 by the Commissioner Danuta H\u00fcbner and Zhu Zixhin, Deputy Chairman of the National Development and Reform Commission. http://ec.europa.eu/regional_policy/sources/international/pdf/mou_china_en.pdf. 10 Joint Statement between The Directorate-General for Regional and Urban Policy of The European Commission and The National Development and Reform Commission of The People's Republic of China On Comprehensively Deepening EU-China Regional Policy Cooperation.

The country is now aiming at a significant change from the existing development approach to more balanced endogenous growth, extending it to its neighboring countries. By heavily investing in infrastructure, especially logistics, transport and energy as well as services in its weak regions, China aims to reinforce cohesion and rebalance its domestic markets, set in motion a wave of trade and promote a growth dynamics in the Eurasian continent and in South East Asia. This is a major strategic change, instrumental in \u201cdeveloping a global regional strategy\u201d with a wider scope, capable of reaching several objectives. The plan \u201cOne Belt, One Road\u201d (OBOR) simultaneously aims to lessen the historic Chinese isolation, reinforce the neighboring countries\u2019 economies alongside with their ties with China, create well equipped territorial corridors for securing and easing the flow of trade from China towards the West and the South East, and secure the provision of energy and raw materials for the internal needs.

The plan is an example of a geo-political regional policy approach that differs from the EU Cohesion policy and the cooperation policy with the neighboring and African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) countries. One Belt, One Road involves primarily the poorest regions of the country as well as the neighboring countries in South East Asia and in the Eurasian region in a global geo- political strategy.

A similar approach in Europe would mean a vast and multiannual investment programme focused on infrastructures involving EU companies as well as southern and eastern neighboring regions (e.g. Mediterranean and North African countries, Middle East, the Balkans, Russia and former Soviet Union countries). The EU global strategy was not completely devoid of the idea of a wider regional policy approach. In fact, it emerged for a few years in the early nineties with respect to the Mediterranean and the Middle East on the one hand and non-EU member countries on the other (e.g. Balkan countries, Ukraine, Belarus). However, a lack of financial resources and a fragmented political and territorial approach prevented this idea from taking off. The six economic corridors of OBOR Source: adapted from China Britain Business Council (One Belt One Road) Currently, EU\u2019s Official Development Assistance (ODA) comes from two main sources: the European Development Fund (EDF) and the EU\u2019s general budget which includes relevant funding instruments such as: the Development Cooperation Instrument (DCI), the European Neighborhood Instrument (ENI), and the Instrument for Pre-accession Assistance (IPA).

The EU approach is fragmented, not only because of the coexistence of several funds but also due to the fact that, unlike China which is a single state, the European outwards policy is the summation of multiple national policies, different orientations and approaches. This is a constraint to a common investment strategy which could involve neighboring countries. Four main distinctive features differentiate the Chinese approach to wider regional development from the EU approach to regional and cooperation policy: the awareness that regional imbalances and social disparities hamper the sustainability of growth, not only internally but also in relation to neighboring regions; a coordinated global approach to regional development; a pragmatic diplomatic approach to co-development based on market and geopolitical criteria and aims; scope and financial effort. 1) The Chinese government, having taken stock of the past experience of imbalanced growth both internally and with trade partners, is aware that it was creating growing discontent and believes that a change in strategy is essential. The experience of the last decade of slow growth and growing economic and territorial disparities within the EU and with the neighboring countries is similar and also asks for a strategic change. The consequences of these imbalances in fact have undermined the acceptance of the Union policy and founding principles in many Member States; on the other hand, the imbalances have been one of the causes of the massive migratory flows from the neighboring countries. While China has conceived OBOR to respond to such challenges, despite the significant efforts to counteract the disparities within Europe, with mixed results, the EU has not adopted a wider geopolitical stance in relation to the growing disparities with and within the neighboring countries (South Mediterranean, North Africa, the Middle East and non-member countries from the ex-Soviet Block) . 2) China pursues a global approach to regional development. It has a \u201cglobal geopolitical vision\u201d in which the country takes a \u201cleading role\u201d and acts as a \u201cdriver\u201d of regional growth which includes neighboring regions. Such strategy is not exclusively to its own advantage, considering that growth and investment spill over into the third countries involved in the plan. In fact, the new \u201csilk roads\u201d have been conceived for three main purposes: breaking the secular isolation of China by creating six corridors through better connectivity and simplified customs clearance systems to ease trade flows within the area and ",

The Chinese diplomatic approach to economic and political cooperation does not ask for binding political conditions, democratic standards or other political or economic reforms or significant political changes in the partner countries. This pragmatic approach, based on a principle of non-interference in the internal affairs of third countries, is different from the EU approach to cooperation with neighboring countries and potential new Member States. The EU approach highlights the free market economy virtues and the superiority of EU values and institutions, which are considered as a benchmark for democracy and economic efficiency. This strategy aims to reproduce, in all countries, identical social and political values which characterize the more developed EU countries. Despite its noble goals, this approach has evidently slowed down, if not blocked, regional cooperation plans in the Mediterranean and Middle East which could have generated growth in the southern and eastern regions of the EU. Chinese diplomacy is based on a realistic acceptance of the diversity and of the political and democratic heterogeneity of each partner country which is not supposed to undergo a process of homogenization, but rather to develop with the support of China, exclusively on the basis of market values and bilateral contractual agreements. 4) OBOR is characterized by a huge geographical coverage and a remarkable financial effort. It is estimated that over 60 countries and 4.4 billion people will be involved in and benefit from the investments. Funding is injected from various sources, thanks to the Chinese Government bilateral agreements and new multilateral financial institutions such as the Asian Infrastructure Investment bank (AIIB). Resources come also from Chinese state owned enterprises and even Chinese local governments. Therefore OBOR encompasses also a significant financial strategy, which through AIIB aims to counteract the power and the reach of the established international institutions such as the USA controlled World Bank and IMF. The available financial capital will be mobilized under the Chinese government strategic and political umbrella. This is a significant change in the strategy of the Chinese financial authorities which move away from the USA bonds. Obviously, the plan needs a significant financial participation of the over 60 OBOR countries, especially those where the investments are carried out. Sovereign funds of oil producing countries have already been involved and agreements with the EU banks are under way. 11 Since the crisis China has adapted to the new situation and has invested significantly to improve the infrastructures and living conditions of its less developed regions in the centre, northwest and southwest of the country, and of its low income agricultural enclaves. With this 20-year investment program China is rebalancing its regional economy and creating in perspective new centres of development located at its borders. The construction of these infrastructures will also benefit its large infrastructural companies and the firms of its weak border regions. Additional benefits, apart from those stemming from the enlargement of the economic space, easier accessibility of external markets etc., will consist of reduced congestion of the most developed Chinese regions and improved environmental conditions.

A third of the projects and deals took place in China. However, the plan is not progressing without obstacles and doubts as to its feasibility, both economically and politically. It takes many decades to recover the initial investment in huge infrastructures in growing but still underdeveloped areas. The problems of maintenance and security in some areas will increase the initially planned cost of the projects. The acceptance of Chinese influence in other Asian countries raises political doubts and bilateral agreements are not easily concluded. However, most countries have decided to participate with the aim to help their national companies and to place their transport and logistic \u201chot-spots\u201d into the corridors, aware that the future decade of growth will be centered in Asia. 2.1.8. Lessons for the EU The national character of the Chinese regional policy makes any comparison with EU Cohesion Policy difficult and a possible transfer of experiences has to keep this important institutional and operational difference in mind. With this caveat the main lessons of the Chinese development policy to EU Cohesion Policy could be: \uf0b7 the strong linkage between the national development strategy and the territorial strategies, even with a possible reduction in cohesion aims in periods when boosting economic growth is a priority. In the EU Cohesion Policy the strategic approach for the 2014-2020 programming period goes in this direction and is framed within the EU2020 strategy. Nevertheless, this strategic framework is still generic and finds difficult to merge national and EU aims. The Chinese case suggests that a more focused EU strategy in terms of sectoral and territorial priorities would help to reinforce coherence between EU priorities and Cohesion Policy implementation at national and regional level. \uf0b7 The linkage between national territorial development and China\u2019s plans for Eurasian integration ( yi Dai yi Lu or One Road One Belt: the Belt and Road Initiative, which plans huge investments in transport infrastructures of countries located to the South and West of China). In this respect EU Cohesion Policy and regional convergence should keep in mind the influence of global trends determined by transport and energy flows and the policies of neighbouring countries ; \uf0b7 The capacity to invest in and develop infrastructure, associated to a more general large scale of fixed asset investment. The low level of EU investments would require a reinforcement of the financial capacity of Cohesion Policy to raise infrastructure and capital investments; \uf0b7 The integration between regional development policy and social and migration policy. Labour mobility, migration flows and social standards should have an increasing space in Cohesion Policy strategy. The immigration emergency and the difficulty in defining a common EU policy of reception and social integration may be better tackled by Cohesion Policy in the future; \uf0b7 the efficiency of the incentives in the administrative management of the development policy, notwithstanding significant bottle-necks and bureaucratic constraints. In the EU the lack of administrative capacity often hampers the efficiency of Cohesion Policy and weak administrations may find it difficult to activate effective capacity building by themselves in absence of real commitment and adequate incentives; 12 PWC (2017), China and Belt & Road Infrastructure, 2016 review and outlook.

Brazil 2.2.1. The features of the Brazilian regional policy Brazil is a federal state whose federal policy is aimed at tackling socioeconomic differences among the states of Brazil. Hence, we reviewed Brazil\u2019s regional policies and our focus is not national development policy as in the case of China where policy is not explicitly \u2018regional\u2019 but where we provide references to social and development policies with noteworthy impacts on regional cohesion.

In the last 20 years regional differences have narrowed, but the international crisis in 2008 stopped this trend and reintroduced a modestly diverging trend. Overall, macro-regional disparities in Brazil are comparable to those recorded within the EU28 in the last decade (Ismeri, 2016). Regional policy in Brazil began in the late 1950s, but in the last decade attempts to strengthen inter-regional transfers failed to gain parliamentary approval. This short introduction divides the last sixty years of regional policy into four main periods: 1) 1958 \u2013 1975 - At the end of 1950s policy focused on the large macro-regional disparities and intended to transfer economic activity from the more developed areas to the poorest ones. The focus was mainly on Norte and Nordeste macro- regions, the least developed, and in the centre where Brasilia received significant infrastructure investment to become an important transport hub. In order to promote economic growth of the weakest areas several fiscal incentives were 13 In recent years Gini Index of per capita income in Purchasing Power Parity in Brazil is around 53% in comparison to a range between 20%-35% of Italy, France and Germany (World Bank, 2017).

In 1974, national funds for Investment in Nordeste (FINOR) and Amazonia (FINAM) were created. Despite criticism, concerning misallocation and corruption, the incentives succeeded in attracting growing investments into the North and Northeast regions. 2) 1976-1989 \u2013called the Brazil economy\u2019s \u201clost decade\u201d; in a period of oil-shocks and high inflation economic growth flagged and by the beginning of the \u201880s sharp rises in international borrowing rates generated an external debt crisis. In these times neo- liberalist responses were on the rise and the attention given to regional policy declined; transfer funding fell significantly. At the end of the period with the 1988 constitutional reform reducing regional disparities was again a priority and led to the creation of three new national funds for the Centre- west (FCO), the North-East (FNE) and the North (FNO) funded by income tax revenues to, however, only support private sector capital investments. 3) 1990-2002 \u2013 opening up to globalisation by dismantling state influence in accord with the \u201cWashington consensus\u201d 14 that also led to the abandonment of regional planning and development policies Development departments serving the regions were closed. Infrastructure policy focused instead on enabling enterprises to integrate more into international markets and global value chains that, however, mainly benefited the highest income areas. Infrastructure policy was hampered by insufficient public resources and over-optimistic expectations about private sector involvement. But, in relation to regional policy, however, it had the merit of focusing debate on spatial needs, local areas. and transport development axes.

        "European Cohesion Policy and regional development policies in other parts of the world _____________________________________________________________________ 33 priorities, returning regional policy issues to the centre of political attention albeit resting on an outdated design and using inadequate instruments. A reform of regional policy was defined with the aim of increasing significantly the amount of resources allocated to the poorest areas and introducing three new principles: 1) tackling not only regional imbalances but also within each macro-region and state; 2) restoring institutions to manage regional policy; 3) defining a new governance to coordinate those Ministries whose policy actions that affect regional development. The proposed reform identified sub-state areas eligible for different levels of support, and planned the setting up of a national fund for regional policy to invest in infrastructure, human resources and capacity building differently from the old funds, defined a new governance more attentive to planning, institutional coordination and stakeholders participation. This reform did not pass n parliament and only the territorialisation in micro-regions with different development levels remained in force to redirect the pre-existing constitutional funds. In 2008, the launch of the Territories of Citizenship Program (TCP) to fight poverty area by area, by means of interventions in education and social structures as well as other social transfers and strong collaboration with local authorities displaced regional policy, which released resources in favour of TCP and thereby marginalising regional policy. In 2010, a new reform of the regional policy was again proposed to decentralise by delegating responsibilities from central to state governments, and set up a dedicated national fund to support public and private investments. This reform failed again in parliament and regional policy continues to be implemented only by means of the old constitutional funds and other limited instruments (development funds and fiscal incentives). At the same time, national policies for large infrastructures investments in the North-east and income transfers to fight poverty that have important effects remain outside the regional policy framework. 2.2.2. The institutional framework In conformity with its 1988 Constitution, Brazil is a federal state of 26 states plus the federal District of Brasilia. The Constitution identifies also 5,564 municipalities with considerable autonomy within the states. Regional policy is a federal responsibility managed by several institutions. Since 1999 the Ministry of National Integration (MI) has been the most important by being responsible for the constitutional funds, in particular: \uf0b7 The North Region Fund (FNO) administered by the MI and by the Deliberative Council of the Superintendence of the Development of the Amazon (SUDAM) and Bank of Amazon (BASA). \uf0b7 The Northeast Financing Constitutional Fund (FNE) also administered by the MI and by the Deliberative Council of the Superintendence of the Development of the Northeast Region (SUDENE) and the Bank of Northeast (BNB). \uf0b7 the Centre-West financing Constitutional Fund (FCO) also managed by MI together with the Deliberative Council of the Superintendence of the Development of the Midwest (SUDECO) and Bank of Brazil 15 . 15 The States which compose the recipient regions are: FNO: States of Acre, Amazonas, Amapa, Para, Roraima, Rondonia, and Tocantins; FNE: States of Maranhao, Piaui, Ceara, Rio Grande do Norte, Paraiba, Pernambuco, Alagoas, Sergipe, Bahia, in addition to the north parts of the States of Minas Gerais and Espirito Santo; FCO: States of Mato Grosso, Mato Grosso do Sul, Goias and Distrito Federal. ",
        "Policy Department for Structural and Cohesion Policies _____________________________________________________________ 34 The MI is responsible for guidelines for the loans, for defining funding programs, and for supervising, monitoring and controlling the applications and for evaluating performance of the funds. The Deliberative Councils of the SUDECO, SUDENE and SUDAM are responsible for determining annual priorities, for approving the programmes, for assessing the results, for determining adjustments to comply with established policies and for reporting to Congress. The financial agents of FCO (Bank of Brazil), of the FNE (Bank of Northeast) and the FNO (Bank of Amazon) are responsible for applying the resources, defining standards, procedures and operational conditions, in addition to analyzing the financing proposals in its all aspects, including economic and financial viability and final granting of loans. In summary, the constitutional funds have a business model similar to that of international development banks, but under the direct oversight of central government. Other regional policy instruments include development funds dedicated to support public infrastructures and public services. These funds are: the development fund for Amazonia (FDA), the development fund for North-East (FDNE) and the development fund for Centre-west (FDCO) 16 . They are managed by the MI, which provides general objectives, and the Deliberative Councils (SUDAM; SUDENE e SUDECO) responsible for management of the funds. Federal financial institutions are responsible for disbursing these. The financing ranges from 40% to 60% of total project budgets depending on the typology of the investments and of the area (priority area or not 17 ) and can be assigned to private or public bodies. In 2017 the cost of the loan is around 10% of the received amount including the remuneration of the bank and the fund. In addition, specific fiscal incentives support the macro-regions of Amazonia and North- East. The incentives are managed by the Deliberative Councils and in the priority areas the fiscal cut can amount to 75% of the tax. However, fiscal incentives are widespread at state level and generated a \u201cfiscal war\u201d (OECD, 2013) producing a generalised subsidy and very limited effects on attracting foreign investments to the poorest areas. Individual states have additional territorial policies aimed at balancing internal disparities. These initiatives are promoted in several policy areas and funded with their own budget. 2.2.3. Regional policy governance A real multilevel governance does not exist in the Brazilian regional policy. All the main interventions are managed by national authorities and financial institutions; subsidiarity principle and co-sharing management are not in force. However, in academic literature the central state approach to regional policy is considered a limit and the reforms proposed in 2010 planned an increasing involvement of local authorities in programming and implementing regional policy (Montero Neto, 2017). In other policy areas influencing economic and territorial cohesion multilevel governance shows significant progress. Since 2008 the Territories of Citizenship Programme, a local development programme fighting poverty and for improving social and productive services in rural areas, promoted new forms of multi-level coordination. This involves 16 The states benefited by the development funds are the same of that benefited by the Constitutional funds. 17 Priority areas are identified at municipal level on the basis of the income per capita and the recent trends in its change. Areas are classified in four categories: high income (high income per capita independently on the recent trend); dynamic (middle low income per capita with positive trend); stagnating (middle income and low growth); low income (low income and low growth). ",
        "European Cohesion Policy and regional development policies in other parts of the world _____________________________________________________________________ 35 the collaboration of groups of municipalities in the eligible areas who carry out the interventions and, at the same time, promote their collaboration with State and National government authorities for \u201cvertical\u201d governance and with ONGs and groups of citizens to ensure participation and needs orientation. Similarly, the well-known Bolsa Fam\u00edlia Programme, the most important conditional cash transfer programme in the world, promoted new forms of cooperation between different administrations to respond to the demand in health, education and other social services generated by the cash transfers to poor households. In other cases, such as the research and development policy, the national government required the states to approve a legal framework to enhance public interventions on R&D in the entire country. These different forms of multi-level governance are still only partial and a generalised problem of institutional efficiency and coordination is evident (OECD, 2013). Its main issues concern: the horizontal coordination of sectoral policies at national level; the vertical coordination between the national government and States which often obstruct national polices for political reasons; the limited institutional and administrative capacity at the municipal level especially in the poorest areas. In addition to this, a complex overlapping of powers between the different institutional levels in education, health and welfare services make the implementation of any social and development policy difficult. 2.2.4. Redistribution and geographical targeting of resources Territorial redistribution of public resources in the Brazilian regional policy works in several ways. First, the constitutional funds concentrate their actions in the poorest region (North, North-East and Midwest) and do not cover South-East and South, the richest areas of the country; consequently, they redistribute resources in favour of the less developed areas. A second form of redistribution, as mentioned above, concerns the different rates of subsidy applied to the municipal areas according to their economic status. The \u201csubsidy\u201d, as public resources by individual project, is higher in the poorest areas. These priority areas are identified at municipal level according to their income trends 18 and their geo-economic position (for instance border regions). The major support to poorest areas does not mean that these receive a higher amount of resources, because they may produce a limited number of projects. In fact, several evaluations 19 showed that within the subsidised regions the strongest areas attract the major part of incentives. A third form of redistribution, by type of beneficiaries, favours SMEs which receive a unitary support proportionally higher than that of large enterprises. An additional difference in the level of subsidies concerns rural areas which receive advantageous conditions. However, the size of the enterprise and the characteristics of the territory are influential but not decisive in defining the level of the financial support. Border regions are an additional territorial target for regional policy. Recently, the principal interventions concerned the coordination of local authorities with national and state agencies, such as the capacity building in these peripheral administrations. Trans- border cooperation projects with Peru, Columbia, Argentina and Uruguay are supposed to start in the near future, but their size is small and their aim is still prevalently experimental. Social policies record a territorial allocation of resources similar to that of the regional policy. Territories of Citizenship and Bolsa Fam\u00edlia programmes concentrate their 18 See previous note. 19 (Da Silva; 2016), (Resende; 2014). ",
        "Policy Department for Structural and Cohesion Policies _____________________________________________________________ 36 resources in the poorest areas of the countries defined at municipal level and in a similar way to the priority areas of regional policy. The convergence of these different interventions on the same weakest areas multiplies the effort for a sustainable development integrating private competitiveness and social inclusion goals. However, the territorial distribution of the resources for national development policies shows a different picture. In 2010, The South-eastern macro-region, the richest of the country, received 40% of the state-owned companies investments, 60% of the investment in infrastructures and other public goods of the PAC (Accelerating Growth Programme) and 58% of the loans allocated by the National Development Bank to support private investments (OECD, 2013). In practice, regional and social policies only partially rebalance the territorial priorities of the national policies for growth. 2.2.5. Budget and financial dimension Public investment in Brazil is relatively low and did not reach 2% of GDP in 2008; adding state-owned companies investments it reached 3% of GDP (OECD, 2013). This value does not include fiscal incentives, which play a significant role in national and state development policies but is difficult to calculate. Within the public investments, an expenditure around 0.4% of GDP was imputable to constitutional funds in 2013. The fiscal incentives were around 0.1%-0.2% of GDP, while development funds did not reach 0.05% of GDP. On average regional policy resources are around 0.5% of GDP, which in turn is about 17% of total public investments (public enterprises included). It must be highlighted that resources for Bolsa Fam\u00edlia and Territories of Citizenship are around 0.4% of GDP each. Hence, in the last few years the financial weight of social policy with important territorial influence overtook that of regional policy. Annual resources for constitutional funds are defined in the 1988 Federal Constitution, which establishes that 3% of the income taxes and tax on industrialized goods is for financing the private sectors of the North, Northeast and Midwest regions of Brazil. The FNE receives a share equal to 1.8% of those tax revenues and the other two funds (FCO and FNO) a share of 0.6%; the constitutional funds also reuse the financial reflows of their loans. Federal Government cannot subtract resources from these Funds for other objectives and the unused resources in a given year will provide resources to make new loans in the following financial year. Since the beginning of this century the expenditure of the constitutional funds has increased (see next figure) benefitting from the good performance of the Brazilian economy and the increasing political attention to regional policy. According to data of the Ministry of National Integration in the last twenty years around 6,5 million in loans have been contracted by the constitutional funds. ",
        "European Cohesion Policy and regional development policies in other parts of the world _____________________________________________________________________ 37 Figure 1: : Evolution of the amount contracted by constitutional funds since 1995 (R$ billion Brazilian currency) Source: (Rosa, 2014) elaboration of the author on data from the Secretariat of Regional Funds and Tax Incentives of the Ministry of National Integration. 2.2.6. Implementation system As mentioned above, the current Brazilian regional policy mainly relies on the three Constitutional Financing Funds. Their implementation system is centralised; the Ministry of National Integration provides general orientations, the Deliberative Councils of the funds are responsible for their management and the public banks distribute the resources to the beneficiaries. The decision to invest the resources of the funds is, therefore, a discretionary act of the banks in combination with the demand for credit of the eligible macro-regions. In recent years several implementation acts favoured the disbursements of the resources and the participation of the weakest subjects and territories. In 2001 several changes in the implementation mechanisms were introduced. The government shared the default risk of the loans 20 with the banks, reducing the entering barriers to credit, requiring banks to pay major attention to project quality and diminishing potential political influence on the approval of the loans. Pre-defined interest rates substituted flexible ones and a reward for borrowers who pay their loan back in time; these arrangements have also favoured an increase in the number of beneficiaries. Different interest rates were applied to different kinds of enterprises in order to favour the smaller ones. Finally, the ceiling for funding infrastructures and services (10%) was removed and posed under the discretionary decision of the Ministry. This was an important change to help rural and remote areas and some of the modifications not approved within regional policy reform were introduced by an administrative act. The changes made it possible to increase the value of the loans for small enterprises from 28% in 2001 to 56% in 2013 (Rosa, 2014). Other additional arrangements (thresholds for the resources to destine to each state or the eligibility of micro-areas ) have been implemented to avoid concentration of the resources of the funds in the more developed states of the macro-regions. 20 In some extreme case of micro-enterprises in poorest areas the government assumes the entire risk of default. ",
        "Policy Department for Structural and Cohesion Policies _____________________________________________________________ 38 These mechanisms play an important role in the implementation of a regional policy based on financial instruments, however other problems of policy implementation derive from social and development policies. In particular, and for the aims of this study, it is important to highlight the difficulties in promoting participation and efficiency at the municipal level. A mix of insufficient administrative capacity, weak institutional coordination and bureaucratic formalism was encountered in social policies and anti- poverty programmes. A potential reform of regional policy with increasing subsidiarity and autonomy of the local administrations, as proposed in 2002 and 2010, should certainly tackle these issues. 2.2.7. The effects of the cooperation with the EU EU-Brazil regional policy cooperation started with the Memorandum of Understanding signed in 2007, \u201cwith the objective to promote mutual understanding and bi-lateral cooperation in the field of regional policy and to establish communication channels to strengthen the exchange of information\u201d. The dialogue produced debates, studies in strategic areas (innovation policy, cross-border cooperation), exchanges of experience and mutual visits between Brazilian and EU administrations. In addition to the memorandum, EU cooperation programmes with Latin America provided resources for studies on regional policy in Brazil and in the entire South-American continent. The influence of the EU experience on the design of the proposed reforms of the Brazilian regional policy is evident (Leite, 2011). Even if these reforms were not approved, important traces of the EU experience remain in the current regional and social policies. The division of the macro-regions into priority areas with different levels of assistance, the definition of cross-border intervention, the local development approach of the Territories of Citizenship programme are only some of the influences derived from the EU experience. Hence, EU experience is a central reference for the Brazilian debate on regional policy. However, the rejection of the regional policy reform in 2011 is probably at the root of the slowing down of the direct dialogue between the EC and the Brazilian government. Despite this, transfers of experience continued on governance and institutional capacity, on innovation policies and cross-border cooperation under the initiative of the European Parliament and the EU cooperation programmes with Latin America. In addition to these exchanges, a transnational cooperation programme between French Guyana, Guyana, Suriname and North of Brazil funded by ERDF is in progress. The programme promotes mutual knowledge and cooperation opportunities between the countries and support investments in SMEs promotion, transport, environmental conditions, social inclusion and health with almost EUR 19 million 21 . The main objectives of these investments are facilitating the mobility between countries, strengthening the fight against pollution at gold mines, increasing health services, and developing trade between French Guiana and the neighbouring territories. 2.2.8. Lessons for the EU The Brazilian regional policy does not provide direct and ready-to-use lessons for the EU. Its instruments are not particularly innovative and compared to the EU multilevel system governance is less complex. However, some general lessons from the Brazilian experience have to be underlined. A first suggestion comes from the social programmes ( Bolsa Fam\u00edlia and Territories of citizenship) launched in the last decade. Their emphasised territorial approach and the 21 http://ec.europa.eu/regional_policy/it/atlas/programmes/2014-2020/france/2014tc16rftn010. ",
        "European Cohesion Policy and regional development policies in other parts of the world _____________________________________________________________________ 39 aim to include the entire population derive from the characteristics of the Brazilian disparities, but also reflect a fundamental and complementary integration between social and competitive goals in territorial policies. In the EU social problems are very serious but less urgent than in Brazil, nevertheless the difficulty in promoting an EU social policy makes it difficult to integrate social elements in Cohesion as well as in Competitiveness Policy. A second suggestion descends from the stop-and-go process which has negatively affected Brazilian regional policy since the \u201890s. Political ownership and commitment to regional development policy are fundamental because their structural changes require time and regional policy cannot be radically modified too often without negative effects on its long term results. This does not mean that constant and targeted adjustments of regional policy are unnecessary, as highlighted by the modifications in the implementation of the Brazilian Constitutional funds. This consideration supports the past experience of Cohesion Policy, which was adjusted during successive programming periods without important changes in its size and overall approach. Nevertheless, radical innovations in Cohesion Policy may be introduced in the future but should not reduce the political commitment or the EU engagement to territorial and social convergence. A third suggestion concerns governance issues. In Brazil, as in all countries, they are relevant especially when the regional policy needs the coordination of different administrations with different missions. Brazil had very little experience in this field until social programmes were launched; at that time several administrative problems occurred but the policy design obliged local administrations to experiment new solutions and to improve institutional capacity. This experimental dimension of the regional development policy is already embodied in the EU experience, but it always has to be underlined: the development of Cohesion Policy always needs the development of institutional capacity. Institutional capacity is a critical dimension of any regional policy because it provides the well-functioning of the complex administrative and institutional arrangements required by multilevel or multi-sector coordination tasks. These arrangements were problematic within one country, Brazil, and are much more problematic in a union of many countries. In the present programming period Cohesion Policy has rightly embodied this dimension in its strategy , which before was left to the MSs, but a reflection on the strategic implications of this choice regarding possible or implicit EU administrative and efficiency standards has to be developed.

Institutional setting, priorities and governance The differences in the income per capita among ASEAN countries are important (see next table), but in recent years a convergence process has been at work and in the 2000-2015 period very poor countries, such as Cambodia, Laos, Vietnam and Myanmar recorded an annual average growth rate between 6.5%-10.6% per year against around 5% of the other countries (with the exception of Brunei with an average of 1% per year). After the Asiatic crisis of the \u201890s, the growth of ASEAN in comparison to EU is also impressive.

The Association of Southeast Asian Nations was established 50 years ago in 1967 as an intergovernmental regional organization by 5 founding countries (Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore and Thailand) aiming at ensuring peace and security in the region, and promoting socio-economic development through trade liberalisation. The institutional setting has changed over time and other 5 countries have joined the association (Brunei Darussalam, Viet Nam, Lao PDR, Myanmar and Cambodia). The present structure derives from the entrance into force in 2008 of the ASEAN Charter, a binding document signed by all ASEAN Members which gave legal entity to the Association and paved the way toward the creation of the ASEAN Community, established in 2015. The ASEAN Community governance structure includes: ",

This structure broadly recalls the institutional architecture designed by the 1993 Treaty on European Union, based on the European Council, the European Commission, the three pillars and a Coreper 23 . Role and responsibilities of the various institutional actors differ radically. In South East Asia there has been no devolution of power from the Member States to the ASEAN institutions. ASEAN set up and still maintains a strict intergovernmental character where all decisions must be taken unanimously and where there are no mechanisms of sanctions for non-compliance with common decisions. This implies that ASEAN evolution proceeds by small steps preserving and pursuing harmony and solidarity according to what has been labelled the \u201cASEAN way\u201d. But this implies also a high degree of ineffectiveness in the realization of policies and programmes as some critics have remarked (Portela, 2013). A further feature of ASEAN, relevant to this report, is the absence of significant ASEAN resources. The yearly budget is about 16 million US dollars, based on equal contribution by every Member State (European Commission, 2015), just enough to pay for the working costs of the organization. This implies that programmes and projects must be financed by means of alternative financial sources. 2.3.2. To what extent regional policy is part of the ASEAN agenda The issue of regional disparities has accompanied, with different emphasis and geographical / thematic scope, all the stages of the ASEAN project since the 1990s. Progress in ASEAN has sometimes been hampered by the diversity among ASEAN members together with political instability within countries in the region. The large disparities in the level of development of MSs have been identified as the main reason leading to the collapse of the region-to-region FTA attempted by the EU in 2009 (Portela, 2013). They have been tackled with two initiatives: 1. The creation of sub-regional groupings and co-operation arrangements covering sub-national territories across Member States. 2. The Initiative for ASEAN Integration (IAI) to accelerate economic integration and narrow the development gap of ASEAN new Member States that joined in 1995- 1999. 22 The three pillars of the ASEAN Communities were created in 2007 while the overall ASEAN Community was formally created in 2015. 23 The Permanent Representatives Committee or Coreper (Article 240 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union - TFEU) is responsible for preparing the work of the Council of the European Union. It consists of representatives from the EU countries with the rank of ambassador to the European Union and is chaired by the EU country which holds the Council Presidency. ",

They are explicitly recognised as building blocks to the physical, institutional, and people-to-people connectivity which are the fundamental ingredients of ASEAN community building. The Indonesia-Malaysia-Thailand Growth Triangle (IMT-GT) is a sub-regional cooperation initiative formed in 1993 by the governments of Indonesia, Malaysia, and Thailand to accelerate economic transformation in the involved provinces. The geographical scope has enlarged since then and now covers 32 provinces and states with a population of 70 million - 14 provinces in Southern Thailand; 8 states in Peninsular Malaysia; and 10 provinces on the island of Sumatra in Indonesia - characterised by complementarities, geographical proximity, and close historical, cultural, and linguistic ties. After the difficulties which came with the financial crisis in the late nineties, a renewed interest by associated members led to the strengthening of the institutional framework. During the first IMT-GT Summit Meeting held in 2005, the member governments agreed to the elaboration of a medium term roadmap, with the assistance of the Asian Development Bank (ADB). The first Roadmap covered the period 2007\u20132011 and was designed to pursue five strategic objectives: 1. Facilitate and promote intra- and inter IMT-GT trade and investment. 2. Promote the growth of agriculture, agro-industry, and tourism. 3. Strengthen infrastructure linkages and support to the integration of the IMT-GT sub-region. 4. Develop human resources and skills competences, enhance mobility of labour, and strengthen environment and natural resource management. 5. Strengthen institutional arrangements and mechanisms for cooperation, including public\u2013private sector collaboration, participation of stakeholders at the local level, and the mobilization of support from development partners. Projects and activities can be classified in two broad categories defined as \u201cpolicy and regulatory anchor\u201d and the \u201cIMT-GT connectivity corridors anchor\u201d. The former includes all measures directed at facilitating the movement of capital, goods, people, and vehicles in the sub-region, while the latter comprises economic activities, support to infrastructure and transport facilities and linkages. The Roadmap identified 37 flagship programmes/projects and more than 50 measures, and promoted the setup of six working groups responsible for their implementation. The implementation of the roadmap has been recognised as unsatisfactory mainly because of the weak national and regional institutional mechanisms of the programme, ",
        "European Cohesion Policy and regional development policies in other parts of the world _____________________________________________________________________ 43 absence of well-defined sector strategies and lack of effective project cycle management. An Implementation Blueprint (IB) was elaborated for the next programming period (2012-2016), and action was guided by the following principles: \uf0b7 Connectivity, in its broad sense of linking geographic areas, facilitating economic transactions, and enhancing people-to-people interface, as the overarching objective. \uf0b7 Anchoring of projects to the sector strategies and the 12 flagship programmes, with definition of linkages across sectors to create greater synergies. \uf0b7 Balancing the mix of projects that promote economic and social objectives, in particular those that promote livelihood in remote areas outside the state and provincial capitals. \uf0b7 Projects should be part of the national or local development plans. \uf0b7 Value added: projects should be sub-regional projects (i.e., involving at least two countries), or national projects with sub-regional implications, or that can benefit from sub-regional synergies. \uf0b7 Projects in the IB should serve as catalysts for accelerating investments from the private sector, including from SMEs, and through innovative public\u2013private partnership modalities. The Brunei Darussalam-Indonesia-Malaysia-Philippines East ASEAN Growth Area (BIMP-EAGA) initiative was launched in 1994 as a cooperation initiative by four Member States to accelerate economic development in areas that are less developed and peripheral within each country, yet in strategic proximity to each other. Therefore the initiative has the explicit aim to narrow the development gaps across and within the sub-region, realizing sustainable economic growth and sustaining the sub-region\u2019s full participation in the ASEAN. BIMP-EAGA covers the entire sultanate of Brunei Darussalam; the provinces of Kalimantan, Sulawesi, Maluku and West Papua of Indonesia; the states of Sabah and Sarawak and the federal territory of Labuan in Malaysia; and Mindanao and the province of Palawan in the Philippines. The sub-region covers a land area of 1.6 million km 2 with an estimated population of 70 million. The initiative has the final goal to change the economy of the sub-region toward a modern non resource-based one, relying on the mobilisation of private sector investments. A new momentum for action has followed the 1997 Asian financial crisis and in 2004 participating countries agreed to formulate the BIMP-EAGA Roadmap to Development 2006\u20132010 which identified four strategic objectives: \uf0b7 To promote intra- and extra-industry trade, investments, and tourism in selected priority sectors. \uf0b7 To coordinate the management of natural resources. \uf0b7 To coordinate the planning and implementation of infrastructure support. \uf0b7 To strengthen the BIMP-EAGA structures and mechanisms for effective implementation. Measurable targets were set to increase trade (+10%), tourism (+20% of arrivals), and investments (+10%), although measures, programs, and projects identified suffered from a lack of sufficient details and operational plans. The roadmap has been revised streamlining the objectives in 4 Pillars focused on connectivity, food basket, tourism, and sustainable management of the environment. ",
        "Policy Department for Structural and Cohesion Policies _____________________________________________________________ 44 The mid-term review of the Roadmap and the evaluation after 2010 highlighted poor implementation even if the targets to increase trade, investment, and tourism within EAGA were more or less achieved. For the following period (2012-2016) the objectives were confirmed as still valid, while the new framework has taken the form of an Implementation Blueprint, with the following guiding principles: \uf0b7 Complementarity with national development plans and objectives, possibly building upon them. \uf0b7 Consideration of social and environmental impacts on the livelihoods of people in remote areas in formulating projects (mainstreaming). \uf0b7 Projects in the IB should serve as catalysts for accelerating investments from the private sector, including from SMEs, and through innovative public\u2013private partnership modalities. \uf0b7 Participation of private sector with appropriate governance formulas and, when feasible, identification of projects with commercial potential. \uf0b7 Proper sequencing and synergy of projects so that progress made under one pillar contributes to the delivery of the other pillars (cross cutting principle). The \u201c Basic Framework of ASEAN- Mekong Basin Development Cooperation\u201d (AMBD) was set up in 1996 to promote economic integration among the Member Countries, thus helping to build the ASEAN Economic Community by 2015. Its members include all ASEAN Member States and the People\u2019s Republic of China. At least since 2009 the need of realignment of AMBD with the ASEAN Economic Community has been affirmed and pursued, with special focus on complementarities and objectives overlapping with the IAI-NDG initiatives (Hew, 2009). This initiative is strictly linked with the Greater Mekong Sub-region (GMS) programme of economic cooperation that has been active since 1992. It covers an area of 2.6 million km 2 with a population of around 326 million in six countries: Cambodia, the People's Republic of China (specifically Yunnan Province and Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region), Lao PDR, Myanmar, Thailand, and Viet Nam. The programme was supported by the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and other donors, with the aim of promoting the implementation of high priority sub-regional projects in transport, energy, telecommunications, environment, human resource development, tourism, trade, private sector investment, and agriculture. In the first twenty years, priority infrastructure projects worth around $11 billion have either been completed or are being implemented, and over $16 billion have been mobilised in investment projects. The new Greater Mekong Sub-region (GMS) Strategic Framework 2012-2022 was adopted at the 4th GMS Summit in Nay Pyi Taw, Myanmar in December 2011. The Framework is anchored to the corridor-development approach, which provides the spatial and thematic focus to the programme going forward. The new framework expands the GMS Programme from conventional infrastructure to multi-sector investments, involving stronger cross-sectoral linkages, better consideration of regional economic development\u2019s spatial aspects, more local stakeholders involvement, and more effective monitoring and evaluation. The strategy is translated into investment and technical assistance projects identified within the Regional Investment Framework (RIF) 2013-2022 approved in December 2013. Several other sub-regional programs are emerging in the GMS sub-region: after the GSM Programme in 1992, 11 additional regional arrangements involving one or all ",
        "European Cohesion Policy and regional development policies in other parts of the world _____________________________________________________________________ 45 Mekong countries were established during the 1992\u20132015 period. Among them ASEAN participates in the Ayeyawady-Chao Phraya-Mekong Economic Cooperation Strategy (ACMECS) , established in 2003 with the aim of promoting balanced development in the sub-region with focus on transport, trade and investment facilitation, and involving Cambodia, Lao PDR, Myanmar, Thailand, and Viet Nam. Initiative for ASEAN Integration (IAI) Some internal disparities emerged at the end of the nineties when four new States (Vietnam, in 1995, Laos PDR and Myanmar in 1997 and Cambodia in 1998), less developed than the founding countries, joined ASEAN. Therefore, at their Summit in 2000, the ASEAN Leaders launched the Initiative for ASEAN Integration (IAI) with the objectives of narrowing the development gap and accelerating economic integration. This was followed by the adoption of the Hanoi Declaration on Narrowing Development Gap for closer ASEAN integration in 2001 and has been confirmed in all succeeding declarations as an integral part of the ASEAN Vision. It was pursued under the third pillar labelled \u201cEquitable economic development\u201d of the ASEAN Economic Community Blueprint 2015 and now enhanced in the fourth Pillar on \u201cA resilient, inclusive, People- Oriented and People-Centred ASEAN\u201d in the Economic Community Blueprint 2025. The adoption of the framework \u201cNarrowing the development gap\u201d is justified on two different grounds: \uf0b7 The first is the awareness that the new Member States may encounter difficulties in complying both with the set of ASEAN past acquisitions and with the set of perspective targets and goals. This is particularly true of the policies to build up the ASEAN Free Trade Area. The weak economic fabric and the inadequate institutional capacity of these countries are considered an obstacle to the realization of the ambitious project of creating a single market for goods, services, capital and skilled workers. The newcomers face a two-fold challenge, i.e. catching up with thirty years of cooperation among ASEAN-6 while being less socio-economically developed on most fronts compared to the rest of the region (three new Member States are classified by the UN among the least developed countries in the world). \uf0b7 The second is the awareness that the political and cultural cohesion of ASEAN depends on the perception of all Members that belonging to the Association is of benefit to them. The conviction of the founding Member States is that only an inclusive ASEAN could survive and develop. In this respect, ASEAN followed a two-fold strategy: on the one hand new AMS were granted flexibility for implementing regional commitments (i.e. longer implementation timeframes and lower thresholds for compliance for the elimination of tariffs), on the other it put in place focused measures to augment AMS\u2019 capabilities to participate in the integration process (ASEAN, 2015 Integration report). The IAI responds to the second objective, and it is intended as a framework for regional co-operation where more developed AMS contribute resources as well as share expertise and experience to help other AMS. It should be remarked that the focus is on \u201cdevelopment gap\u201d at national level and not at regional or territorial levels. Differences within each ASEAN country are hardly mentioned and no specific territorial approach is contemplated here. The IAI cannot therefore be considered as a first conscious attempt to build a proper regional policy within ASEAN. The aim is ambitious but different. It is that of creating the economic and ",
        "Policy Department for Structural and Cohesion Policies _____________________________________________________________ 46 institutional conditions for the least developed countries to benefit from the integration process of ASEAN. Indeed, IAI helps to narrow the development gap by helping Cambodia, Lao PDR, Myanmar, Viet Nam (collectively referred as CLMV) to implement/foster/promote their commitments towards realising the goals of the ASEAN Community, ensuring that benefits of ASEAN integration are equitably shared. The implementation of IAI-NDG started in 2002 with Work Plan 2002-2008 made up of 232 actions in four priority areas: Infrastructure, Human Resource Development, Information and Communication Technology and Regional Economic Integration. The implementing projects were proposed by the AMS and were either self-funded or funded with the support of donor partners. The second IAI Work Plan covering the period 2009-2015 came after the adoption of the new ASEAN institutional structure and is fully inserted in it. It included 182 actions each of which refers to a specific field of intervention and to one of the three ASEAN Communities (Economic Community, Socio-cultural Community and Political-Security Community). Actions are translated in technical assistance projects broadly referring to three categories (studies, policy development and implementation, capacity-building and training). The ASEAN-6 countries played a major role and implemented a total of 285 projects amounting to US$ 20.3 million. The III IAI Work Plan is streamlined in the Economic Community Blueprint within the strategic document \u201cASEAN 2025 - Forging Ahead together\u201d. The actions of Work Plan III are distributed in five strategic areas: 1) Food and Agriculture, 2) Trade facilitation, 3) Micro, small and medium enterprises, 4) Education, 5) Health and Wellbeing. The initiative is managed by the IAI Task Force, which provides policy guidance and directions in the development and implementation of the IAI Work Plan. The Task Force is made up of the ten Permanent Representatives to ASEAN and reports to the ASEAN Coordinating Council; the Chair of the IAI Task Force serves a one-year term and rotates in alphabetical order among the CLMV countries. The IAI&NDG Division of the ASEAN Secretariat serves as secretariat to the IAI Task Force and assists in the monitoring and coordination of the IAI Work Plan\u2019s implementation. Projects are implemented through financial and technical support from ASEAN Member States, ASEAN\u2019s Dialogue Partners, development agencies and technical experts. The selection of projects takes into account three key criteria: 1. Align with the ASEAN Community Blueprints, including relevant ASEAN sectoral work plans where possible, and receive support from the relevant sectoral body. 2. Support the implementation of the existing IAI Work Plan. 3. Benefit all four, or at least two, CLMV countries. The project must also keep in mind the absorptive capacity of CLMV countries for technical assistance and knowledge transfer, and must be designed to include mechanisms for sustainability of outputs and outcomes. 2.3.3. ASEAN regional policy and its similarities with EU Despite the fact that the objective of reducing disparities among and within countries is part of the ASEAN agenda, a comprehensive regional development policy is not possible in the current institutional setting of the Association. ",
        "European Cohesion Policy and regional development policies in other parts of the world _____________________________________________________________________ 47 While moving towards the establishment of the ASEAN Economic Community (AEC), it became clear that it was necessary to align the different initiatives dealing with the broad issues of economic and territorial cohesion . One of the factors hampering the full achievement of expected results is fragmentation and divergence of single initiatives. In 2011, the ASEAN Framework for Equitable Economic Development (AFEED) was endorsed by AMS to provide guiding principles for inclusive and sustainable growth for all sectoral and ministerial bodies under the AEC. The Framework commits the ten MSs to working together to promote a narrowing of development gaps within and between MSs; to improve access to opportunities for human development, social welfare and justice; and to increase participation in the process of ASEAN integration and community building. The framework, streamlined under the Third Pillar of the ASEAN Economic Community Blueprint 2015, relies on the Initiative for ASEAN Integration (IAI) for newer AMS, and on the promotion of micro, small and medium sized enterprises (MSMEs) throughout the region. This is an important step that enlarges the scope of the cohesion objectives including vertical (i.e. IAI and other sub-regional programmes) and horizontal (i.e. MSME development) strategies. Since MSMEs make up more than 90% of all enterprises in the region, their growth and development are vital in narrowing the development gap, as they generate employment and, increasingly, income and innovation. Therefore strategies for enhancing their growth, such as in the areas of access to finance, access to markets, information dissemination and supporting services targeted at MSMEs, are part of the equitable development framework to promote regional cohesion. This concept has been further underlined with the Economic Community Blueprint 2025, where the objective of narrowing the development gap is part of the broader pillar aimed at creating \u201cA Resilient, Inclusive, People-Oriented and People-Centred ASEAN\u201d. According to this document, apart from sustaining the pace of economic growth among ASEAN Member States and strengthening the capacity building in CLVM, the IAI and NDG beyond 2015 should also aim at reducing regulation burdens on MSMEs, promoting their development, access to financial services and participation in regional and global value chains, and enhancing productivity and competitiveness of rural economies. Some final considerations can be made by highlighting the differences between the ASEAN and the EU approach: \uf0b7 Typology of projects aimed at creating the basic conditions so that less developed countries can benefit from ASEAN integration. The outputs are studies and research, feasibility projects, training, capacity building, legal support, technical assistance, support in the adoption of new rules and regulations. The focus is on institution building rather than on direct investments. \uf0b7 ASEAN budget and redistributive impact: the ASEAN budget is not funded by different countries whose contribution depends on their level of development, as in the case of the European Union. Consequently, there is no redistributive impact through the ASEAN budget. Each project must find its own resources and the work plan does not identify the financial sources of the various actions. A consortium is created for each project and its composition reflects the composition of financial sources. Failure to identify ex-ante the financial sources of the projects has sometimes led to the failure of the action. \uf0b7 Management and implementation: the overall initiative is managed by the IAI Task Force supported by the ASEAN Secretariat through a specific Unit for IAI ",
        "Policy Department for Structural and Cohesion Policies _____________________________________________________________ 48 and the implementation of other sub-regional programmes. These ASEAN bodies share the responsibility for the actions with the National States and with the funding organizations of individual projects. \uf0b7 Value added of ASEAN regional action: the design and management of IAI actions and projects implies a continuous exchange of knowledge and information, a transfer of skills and competences and a circulation of experiences and best practices among the various actors and stakeholders involved. Less developed countries with a weak institutional capacity and with a relatively poor endowment of skilled personnel may benefit greatly from the interaction and cooperation with the stronger institutions and with the more skilled personnel of more advanced countries and of ASEAN. These benefits are similar to those envisaged by the Open Method of Coordination adopted in the management of many European programmes. 2.3.4. EU-ASEAN Dialogue and Cooperation Dialogue and cooperation between EU and ASEAN was formalised for the first time in 1977 with the aim of pursuing closer coordination on regional and international issues. In 1980, the ASEAN-EEC Cooperation Agreement established the Joint Cooperation Committee; the Nuremberg Declaration on Enhanced Partnership in 2007 marked another step in interregional relationships, with a longer term perspective and multiannual plan of action. Within this framework, in 2012 the Bandar Seri Begawan Plan of Action 2013-2017 was adopted, detailing all the aspects of the interregional partnership. Within the broader field of economic cooperation, themes linked with cohesion and development policies are disentangled from two points of view: \uf0b7 Fostering the narrowing of the development gap within and between ASEAN Member States through the implementation of the IAI Work Plan and taking into account existing sub-regional cooperation frameworks. \uf0b7 reinforcing dialogue and cooperation in the field of economic and social policy with a view to contributing to sustainable and inclusive growth, social cohesion and labour market stability. Issues linked to territorial cohesion are mentioned in other sections of the Plan of Action, namely the support to sub-regional cooperation to promote social-economic development and sustainable water management including the Lower-Mekong region (explicitly quoting the EU\u2019s Strategy for the Danube Region). EU cooperation efforts reflect the three pillar structure of ASEAN Community (political- security, economic, socio-cultural) and have four main dimensions (European Union, 2016): 1. A regional portfolio that supports integration policy development, capacity building for policy makers, and programme implementation. 2. Bilateral (country) portfolios that help to narrow development gaps and address national issues such as poverty reduction. 3. Additional thematic programmes focusing on global public goods and shared challenges such as climate change and human rights. 4. The support provided directly by EU Member States at regional and/or national level. The magnitude of the efforts is significant and appreciated. In addition to EU bilateral cooperation with individual ASEAN countries (more than EUR 2 billion in grant assistance to Cambodia, Lao PDR, Myanmar, Vietnam and the Philippines for 2014-2020), the EU ",
        "European Cohesion Policy and regional development policies in other parts of the world _____________________________________________________________________ 49 significantly increased its funding to support ASEAN in the current period with up to EUR 170 million (plus EUR 26 million devoted to thematic regional initiatives such as the Farmers\u2019 Organizations\u2019 Support programme, the ASEAN Biodiversity Conservation and Management of Protected Areas programme; the new study facility for infrastructure projects to support sustainable urban development and ASEAN\u2019s connectivity) and focuses on three agreed focal areas: \uf0b7 Connectivity through sustainable and inclusive economic integration and trade (50%). \uf0b7 Climate change, environment and disaster management (37.5 %). \uf0b7 A Comprehensive Dialogue Facility (12.5 %). The EU heavily contributed to the ASEAN regional integration through its technical and financial assistance, contributing up to ten times more than all ASEAN MSs to the ASEAN budget. Most of the EU projects and programmes are focusing on to building the capacity of CLMV, thus supporting the Initiative for ASEAN Integration and helping fill the development gap between ASEAN MSs. The July 2014 EU-ASEAN Ministerial Meeting in Brussels recognised the benefits ASEAN could reap from the EU\u2019s own experience of integration and cohesion. For the future, EU and ASEAN are working on turning their relationship into a strategic partnership (European Union, 2014; EC-HRUFASP, 2015), going beyond the current predominantly bilateral mind set and aiming for greater engagement on key regional and global issues such as: climate change; disaster risk management and resilience; post-2015 sustainable development goals including poverty eradication; health pandemics; counter-terrorism, counter-radicalisation and foreign fighters. 2.3.5. How the European regional policy influenced ASEAN The European Union has largely assisted ASEAN regional integration both through financial support and capacity building and training. Indeed, the EU has been an inspirational model for ASEAN\u2019s institutional reform agreed in 2007. Nevertheless, there are more differences than similarities and the emphasis on sovereignty, non- interference, non-intervention and non-hierarchical forms of cooperation is still predominant (Jetschke, 2013; Jetschke & Portela, 2013; Murray, 2010; Notre Europe, 2006; Poli, 2014). The influence of the EU model is rather weak in the field of regional policy, despite acknowledging the importance of reducing internal disparities and the concrete risk of maintaining a two-tiered region (Alavi & Ramadan, 2008). Already in 2007 the ASEAN Secretary General mentioned the challenge of narrowing the development gap as one of the three areas where best practices from the EU could be relevant in Asia. Specifically he recognised the opportunity to push their initiatives in narrowing the development gap to a \u201cnext stage\u201d, shifting the focus from capacity building to regional infrastructure building. Instruments such as the Structural Funds or the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) where listed as concepts to be evaluated (ASEAN, 2007). A major challenge to ASEAN\u2019s move towards a more comprehensive regional policy is the lack of resources that, with the present institutional framework, cannot be realistically demanded from ASEAN-6 countries. The Asian Development Bank has partially overcome this problems by investing for the provision of regional public goods (especially infrastructure) and its role could be expanded. Another possibility, that also ",
        "Policy Department for Structural and Cohesion Policies _____________________________________________________________ 50 emerged from our interviews, would be to raise resources from the negotiation of external trade agreements with other countries and manage them regionally. Anyway, at present the main obstacle to considering the EU Cohesion Policy as a possible model is of a political/institutional nature. The EU model requires stronger institutions and administrative capacity which are still out of the ASEAN reach (Masujima, 2013). 2.3.6. Lessons for the EU The ASEAN and EU institutional settlements differ greatly and ASEAN has not yet implemented a proper regional policy . That is why rather than proper \u201clessons\u201d to be learnt for the EU we underline a few aspects which may inspire also the EU to strengthen its own Cohesion Policy: \uf0b7 ASEAN commitment to narrowing development gaps is explicitly aimed at promoting regional integration. IAI activities should help Member States to fully contribute to the \u201ccommon building\u201d in all fields (political-security, economic, socio-cultural) and to benefit from it. This linkage is also at the centre of the debate on the (current and) future Cohesion Policy in the EU (i.e. with relation to the migrant and refugee crisis). \uf0b7 A double geographical scope, regional and sub-regional, is adopted. The former specifically focuses on helping with the integration of new Member States, the latter focuses on the enhancement of areas that are geographically close and the common features across Member States borders. In this second case ASEAN has a long tradition which could be the opportunity for mutual learning with the EU\u2019s macro-regional strategies. \uf0b7 The collaboration of organizations and personnel, especially civil servants, from different countries on the design and management of projects aimed at reducing development gaps, plays an important role in facilitating the circulation of knowledge and capacity building. Indeed, it is part of the expected outcome of many projects and helps to strengthen overall integration. In the European context the importance of the exchange of best practices and mutual learning is recognised and promoted for policy efficacy and efficiency. Further mechanisms (i.e. transnational managing groups for specific projects; circulation of staff across countries to spread best practices, etc.) could be learned from the ASEAN experience. \uf0b7 Other aspects of the ASEAN approach which are important also in the current EU debate on Cohesion Policy deal with the mobilisation of private sector investments and, more generally the involvement of the private sector for meeting the expected policy results. Nevertheless, these are relatively new also to ASEAN and no evidence of possible lessons already on the ground was found. ",
        "European Cohesion Policy and regional development policies in other parts of the world _____________________________________________________________________ 51 2.4. MERCOSUR 2.4.1. Main features of MERCOSUR MERCOSUR or, in Spanish, Mercado Com\u00fan del Sur is a customs union established to promote free trade, set external tariffs, coordinate macroeconomic and sectoral policies, and facilitate circulation of people and goods. Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay, Uruguay, Bolivia and Venezuela are full members, but Venezuela was suspended in December 2016, due to non-compliance with the requirements for membership (i.e. violation of rules governing trade, politics, democracy and human rights). Chile, Peru, Colombia, Ecuador, Suriname and Guyana are associate countries while Mexico and New Zealand are observer countries. Map 3: Member States of MERCOSUR: surface and population Source: MERCOSUR website (www.mercosur.int) The development of MERCOSUR is a long, fragmented, yet not fully completed process, which started in the late 80ies and experienced several halts and adjustments over the years. In the 1990s, MERCOSUR experienced a golden age in which the inflow of FDI and the outflow of exports to other world regions, most notably the EU and the USA, increased significantly (Preu\u00dfe, 2004). Then the Brazilian and, in particular, the Argentinean crisis interrupted the process. The Argentina\u2019s decision not to repay its debt after declaring insolvency in 2001 had a negative effect on the country\u2019s reputation, the inflows of FDI declined sharply and never went back to the pre-crisis level. Initially, MERCOSUR was mostly an integration process between Brazil and Argentina. After the Argentinean crisis, the relative importance of the Brazil-Argentina axis decreased while smaller countries such as Uruguay and Paraguay, previously politically and economically marginalised, gained a more prominent role due to greater stability and credibility. This \u201credistribution of power\u201d generated some regional conflicts on trade and economic issues emerged at times, further slowing down the process of integration. For example, a 2005 dispute on a pulp mill on the border between Uruguay and Argentina led to protests and blocks by Argentine environmentalists, backed by the Government, which ",
        "Policy Department for Structural and Cohesion Policies _____________________________________________________________ 52 was actually a breach of the MERCOSUR agreements (Palermo, 2007) 24 . The dispute ended only when the International Court of Justice ruled that there was no evidence of pollution. This conflict demonstrates that the regional dispute settlement mechanism was insufficient to solve the disagreement and was a burden to MERCOSUR whose regional integration came to a halt. 2.4.2. Key institutions of MERCOSUR In 1988 the Presidents of Argentina and Brazil signed the Argentina-Brazil Integration and Economic Cooperation Programme (PICE). As a follow up to this programme, MERCOSUR was established in 1991 with the Treaty of Asunci\u00f3n, amended and updated in 1994 by the Treaty of Ouro Preto. In 2005, the MERCOSUR Parliament was established , with 18 representatives from each member country, regardless of population. The Common Market Council is the highest-level agency of MERCOSUR; it has the authority to conduct its policy and is responsible for compliance with the objectives set out in the Treaty of Asunci\u00f3n. The Council is made up of the Ministers of Foreign Affairs and the Ministers of Economy (or the equivalent) of Member Countries. The Members alternate in the presidency of the Council, every six months, in alphabetical order. MERCOSUR\u2019s executive body, the Common Market Group is composed of representatives of the Ministries of Foreign Affairs, the Ministries of the Economy (or equivalent) and the Central Banks. Its function is to ensure compliance with the Treaty and to implement the decisions of the Council. The Group can also initiate trade measures, initiatives for the coordination of macroeconomic policies, negotiation agreements with non-member states and international agencies. It may organise and coordinate Work Subgroups which are concerned with: commercial matters, customs, technical standards, tax and monetary policies relating to trade, land and sea transport, industrial and technology policy, agriculture, energy policy, coordination of macroeconomic policies, labour, employment and social security issues. The MERCOSUR Joint Parliamentary Committee has an advisory and decision- making nature. Its competences vary: follow up on the integration process and keeping the Congress of each Member State informed; organise sub-committees to examine matters relating to the integration process; submit recommendations to the Common Market Council and Group on the integration process and on the Southern Common Market; harmonise the laws of the different Member States and submit the changes to the national Congresses; establish relationships with private entities, international agencies to obtain information and specialised assistance on issues of interest; cooperation with non-member nations and entities involved in regional integration. A Trade Commission assists the MERCOSUR executive agency in applying the common trade policy instruments (e.g. free trade zones, external tariffs, product lists, consumer protection systems, harmonisation of export incentives) agreed by the Member States in relation to intra-MERCOSUR trade as well as trade with other countries. A regional Technical Commission deals with the integration of the education systems of the member states, ensuring harmonisation in the recognition of the degrees and certificates. 24 The pulp mill was a Finnish investment, the largest FDI in Uruguayan history. The mill fulfilled international standards and was more modern than many pulp mills in Argentina. However, it raised environmental concerns and Argentinean protesters started to block the bridge between Fray Bentos and Gualeguaych\u00fa (Palermo, 2007). ",
        "European Cohesion Policy and regional development policies in other parts of the world _____________________________________________________________________ 53 2.4.3. Relationships with the EU As for the MERCOSUR integration process itself, also the trade negotiations between the EU and MERCOSUR were somehow fragmented and experienced several starts, halts and re-launches. The current trade relations between the EU and MERCOSUR are governed by a 1999 inter-regional Framework Cooperation Agreement. In addition, the EU and individual MERCOSUR countries have bilateral Framework Cooperation Agreements, which also establish a structure for dealing with trade-related matters. The 1999 interregional framework cooperation agreement between the European Community and its Member States and, on the other side, the Southern Common Market and its Party States was aimed to strengthen existing relations and to lay the foundations for an Interregional Association. It covers trade and economic matters, cooperation and other fields of mutual interest. A regular political dialogue is carried out to facilitate the establishment of such an Interregional Association. The objective is to ensure consultation on bilateral and multilateral issues, by coordinating the Parties within the relevant international organizations. Closer relations are pursued to prepare for gradual and reciprocal liberalisation of trade. The main areas of cooperation in relation to trade and economic matters are: market access, liberalisation of trade and trade disciplines; trade relations with non-member countries; compatibility of trade with WTO rules; identification of sensitive and priority products; cooperation and exchange of information on services; statistical matters; intellectual property rights and technology transfer. There is a cooperation agreement on agricultural and industrial products to make policies on quality and conformity recognition coherent. The parties also aimed to cooperate to strengthen customs infrastructure and improve operations in order to consolidate the legal framework for trade relations. Regional cooperation is encouraged wherever it may result in a more rational and efficient use of resources. Particular attention was paid to the following fields: energy, transport, ICT, environmental protection, science and technology, business cooperation and investment promotion. In transport, cooperation aimed to help restructure and modernise transport systems and find solutions to problems of mobility of people and goods. Cooperation mostly consists of exchanges of information, education and training (e.g. cooperation between universities and businesses on vocational training, integration of young people), institution building, studies, joint projects and technical assistance, specific initiatives to fight drug trafficking. The Parties agreed to provide the necessary resources and encourage the European Investment Bank to help MERCOSUR in pursuing these objectives. In relation to the institutional framework, a Cooperation Council is set up at ministerial level, to oversee the implementation of the Agreement. The Council is to be assisted by a Joint Cooperation Committee. A Joint Subcommittee on Trade has also been set up. The EU-MERCOSUR negotiations were re-launched in May 2010. Ten negotiation rounds took place mostly focused on rules (as opposed to market access commitments) before 2012. As highlighted in the online information repository of the Directorate General for Trade of the European Commission devoted to MERCOSUR trade relations, the EU is currently negotiating a trade agreement with the four founding members of MERCOSUR (Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay, and Uruguay) as part of the overall negotiation for a bi- ",
        "Policy Department for Structural and Cohesion Policies _____________________________________________________________ 54 regional Association Agreement. Venezuela is only an observer in the trade negotiations but is not a negotiating party. On 11 May 2016, the EU and MERCOSUR exchanged offers for the first time since the re-launch, and a new negotiation round took place in October 2016, when the next round was planned to be held in 2017. A broad range of issues were covered including: tariffs, rules of origin, technical barriers to trade, sanitary and phytosanitary measures, services, government procurement, intellectual property, sustainable development, SMEs. This free trade agreement is meant to be part of the overall negotiation for a bi- regional Association Agreement which also includes a political and a cooperation pillar. 2.4.4. Regional development policy in MERCOSUR and potential influence of the EU As highlighted above, MERCOSUR was established as a customs union and since its creation the focus has been on trade rather than on cohesion and regional development. There are significant disparities between the member countries and also disparities within countries between central and peripheral zones, urban and rural areas, coastal and internal territories, problems of poverty and socio-economic inequalities of various nature. This context urged the setting up of the Structural Convergence Fund (FOCEM) in MECOSUR (see below). But, despite this fund, cohesion issues have still not attracted as much interest as trade integration and external relations. Several features may help to explain why regional development and cohesion has attracted limited interest so far. Regional integration in the Global South is not based on intraregional interdependence like in the industrialised countries of the EU. Integration is more outward oriented (Krapohl, 2010). There are significant economic asymmetries between emerging powers and peripheral countries and a trade-off between advantages of integration and the need for competing for FDI and access to extra-regional market. This may produce conflicts and no sanctions can mitigate such conflicts. The \u201climited rationality\u201d of national representatives and the complexity of regional trade agreements (RTAs) tend to lead to a pursuit of short term gains to the benefit of some constituents but not others (Duina and Buxbaum, 2008). FOCEM was set up at the end of 2004 and became operational in 2006. It is a redistributive instrument, novel for MERCOSUR, which combines the direct responsibility of Member States for projects and a technical control unit (UTF - Unidad T\u00e9cnica FOCEM). From 2006 to 2012, the fund had an annual budget of $ 100 million (approx. EUR 135 million). When Venezuela joined the budget increased to $ 127 million until 2015 (approx. EUR 141 million). The resources are allocated to projects, submitted by the MERCOSUR Member States Parties, with the criterion of benefiting the smaller and less developed territories. The Member States, through their National Technical Units of FOCEM (UTNF), present their projects to the Commission of Permanent Representatives of the MERCOSUR (CRPM) at any time of the year. Multi-state projects are also presented by two or more Member States through the Permanent Representatives. Once the proposals are received, the CRPM verify the eligibility of the projects; if they are eligible, they are forwarded to the Technical Unit FOCEM (UTF) for a technical opinion. ",
        "European Cohesion Policy and regional development policies in other parts of the world _____________________________________________________________________ 55 The UTF evaluates the projects and issues a technical opinion, which is sent to the CRPM together with the final version of the project and a proposed Financing Agreement (COF). Once such report has been received, the CRPM prepares its own report for submission to the Common Market Group (GMC) which in turn forwards the draft decision to the Common Market Council (CMC). The CMC approves the projects to be financed by FOCEM and allocates the corresponding resources. The FOCEM Projects are financed under four programs: \uf0b7 Structural Convergence (Program I). The projects in this programme consist of infrastructures: electricity lines; road construction; asphalting and rehabilitation; drinking water infrastructures; access and sanitation; railway rehabilitation. \uf0b7 Competitiveness Development (Program II). The eligible projects involve: value chain integration and human resource development in automotive; tourism. \uf0b7 Social Cohesion (Program III). The projects in this programme are targeted at vulnerable population and/or aimed at strengthening education. \uf0b7 Strengthening the Institutional Structure and the Integration Process (Program IV). The infrastructure programme accounts for 43% of the resources, followed by competitiveness (29%), social cohesion (16%) and institutional capacity (12%). Since 2006, a total of 43 projects have been approved. 37 were carried out and 6 are still ongoing. 4 further projects are in the technical analysis stage of the UTF and other 2 projects have been submitted to the CMC, for a total value exceeding $ 1 billion. FOCEM funds 85% of the project costs.

There is a potential for mutual learning between the EU and MERCOSUR, even though, as stressed by the literature (e.g. Santander, 2005 and Duina, 2006), existing legal traditions and regional laws differ greatly and certainly play a role in the way exchanges and learning may take place. There are examples of influence of EU legislation on MERCOSUR. For instance resolution 54/92 of 1992 on toys and safety requirements, repeats verbatim EU Directive 88/378 of 1988. The consequence may be an acceleration of convergence across RTAs as exchanges and interactions intensify (Duina, 2006). Already in the past (e.g. Bajo, 1999), the role of the EU as a \u201croad map\u201d for MERCOSUR institutional trajectory was highlighted even though the literature also pointed out that the debate on internal compensation was postponed to a later date and has not really tackled so far during MERCOSUR\u2019s evolution towards a more integrated union. Some reports on deepening integration also highlight the differences between MERCOSUR and the EU in terms of disparities across countries and features of main donors and receivers which make it challenging to design a common territorial policy for cohesion in the South American region (IDB, 2008). There are huge differences in the ",
        "Policy Department for Structural and Cohesion Policies _____________________________________________________________ 56 economic and demographic size of the countries of MERCOSUR. Brazil is the predominant country with 71% of the total population of MERCOSUR and 69% of GDP in 2014 and consequently its income per inhabitant is close to the MERCOSUR average. The GDP of Paraguay and Uruguay are equivalent, respectively, to 2% and 3% of Brazil\u2019s GDP, and to 6% and 10% of Argentina\u2019s GDP. The populations of these States are in similar proportions. The income disparities between countries are not very pronounced in MERCOSUR, with the exception of Paraguay, but we must keep in mind that regional disparities within countries are very important, especially in large countries like Brazil and Argentina. In the last 20 years a limited convergence has been recorded in the income per capita of the region, but only Uruguay had a significant development in the last ten years while the richest countries, such as Venezuela, recorded a fall in their income per capita. Brazil is the second-poorest country in MERCOSUR, above Paraguay but below Uruguay and Argentina. Therefore in MERCOSUR, size asymmetries are not correlated with wealth asymmetries. On the contrary in Europe there is a reasonable correlation between size and wealth which facilitates the formulation of Cohesion Policy. In any case, the EU Cohesion Policy can provide several suggestions on how to design a policy which takes into account both size and income disparities. Table 5: Per Capita GNI in MERCOSUR Member States, 2002 (Purchasing Power Parity (PPP), current international $) 1995 2000 2005 2010 2014 Argentina 119.3 124.6 120.6 123.1 118.9 Brazil 93.1 93.2 94.8 95.1 96.3 Paraguay 52.3 45.2 41.7 46.1 52.1 Uruguay 99.0 110.3 101.8 111.8 123.4 Venezuela, RB 130.4 122.3 119.1 110.9 106.0 MERCOSUR 100.0 100.0 100.0 100.0 100.0 EU 213.9 244.2 250.1 231.3 229.5 Source: our elaboration on World Bank Development Indicators. A larger country size and market ensures economies of scale and agglomeration, which are particularly effective in attracting FDI. A policy which intends to offset size disadvantages, could transfer resources from larger to smaller countries. However this might accentuate income disparities in MERCOSUR, considering that the largest country in the region, Brazil, is also one of the poorest. A policy which aims at reducing income disparities and promoting cohesion, on the contrary, might accentuate size advantages. A possible solution would be to combine size (e.g. GDP) and wealth (e.g. per capita GDP), while taking into account disparities between and within countries (as in the EU Cohesion Policy). This approach would suit smaller members of MERCOSUR such as Paraguay, which is small in size and wealth, and Uruguay, which is small in size. The approach would also be in line with the interests of the larger Member States such as Brazil and Argentina, with high GDP but depressed regions (Giordano et al., 2008). The literature highlights that the EU Cohesion Policy experience is worth copying, considering that it managed to help reduce tensions that tend to appear when disparities increase during an integration process. However, European integration was the expression of strong political will, a handful of powerful economies, and a firm belief in the long-term benefits of integration. These conditions made the largest countries (France, Germany, Italy and the UK) willing to finance a common investment fund to support catching up and reduce disparities. MERCOSUR does not fulfil these conditions but the need for a regional development fund should not be overlooked (Rezende, 2009). ",
        "European Cohesion Policy and regional development policies in other parts of the world _____________________________________________________________________ 57 In conclusion, considering the literature and the experience of the initiatives financed by FOCEM, it is safe to maintain that MERCOSUR has still a long way to go in order to complete the customs union, reinforce integration and a common internal development policy. The export share which stays within the region remains around 20% and this is much lower compared to the EU (approximately 60%) and also lower compared to Asia, Canada and the USA. As the World Bank underlines, trade in MERCOSUR is discouraged by the fact that the economies are small, produce similar products and are separated by humongous distances. Nonetheless, some positive effects of MERCOSUR integration are already visible. MERCOSUR has promoted democratic stability in the area, increased trade flows, international visibility of members countries (Gardini, 2011) although it is not a common market yet, as the Regional Parliament still has no competence and the enlargement process was postponed. FOCEM is considered a positive experience by the Member States of MERCOSUR. It helped to reduce the structural asymmetries as well as asymmetries of public policies, positive effects were registered on the population and the firms. Moreover, FOCEM contributed to the dissemination of MERCOSUR's achievements. The favourable evaluation of the functioning of the fund has led, within the framework of the MERCOSUR Presidential Summit held in Brasilia in July 2015, to approve Decision N\u00b0 22/15, which gives continuity to FOCEM for 10 more years. FOCEM is certainly a first important step in common regional development policy, clearly not sufficient, considering its budget and slow progress. MERCOSUR has potentially a lot to gain from cooperation with the EU in both trade and Cohesion Policy, and the recently revamped talks are an important milestone. 2.4.5. Lessons learnt, with a particular focus on the future of regional policy cooperation The foregoing paragraphs highlighted, time and again, that MERCOSUR integration is still an ongoing process. Moreover, the effort of participating countries is focused on trade, while a common territorial policy, which aims at addressing regional disparities, is not yet high on the agenda. For these reasons, the lessons for the EU from the experience of MERCOSUR are limited at the moment, while the European experience can facilitate integration in MERCOSUR and is significant for the future of EU-MERCOSUR cooperation on regional policy. The experience of MERCOSUR, characterised by \u201cstop-go\u201d, suggests that an integration process based only on customs and trade agreements is not sufficient to achieve cohesion among countries belonging to a certain regional bloc. There is a need for a strong political commitment and effort. Even though, at the end of the day, MERCOSUR can be considered a positive experience to date, especially if we look at how it helped to achieve democratic stability in the area, the frequent regional and cross border conflicts, which erupted over the years and were often backed by the local governments, demonstrate that local interests always prevailed over the integration objectives. Furthermore, the MERCOSUR dispute settlement mechanism clearly could not compensate the lack of political commitment. The MERCOSUR experience also suggests that an integration process strongly dependent upon a bilateral axis between two large countries (i.e. Argentina and Brazil) is unlikely to survive new exogenous crises (e.g. the Argentinean debt crisis), especially when a customs union is at an embryonic stage of development and it is relatively small in terms of number of countries involved. This underlines the importance of involving all the member states more deeply in the process, and even consider an enlargement of the associations to make it politically stronger. ",
        "Policy Department for Structural and Cohesion Policies _____________________________________________________________ 58 It is worth noting again that there are intrinsic and structural obstacles to the integration of MERCOSUR which are chiefly related to: 1. Geography (e.g. huge physical distances). 2. Specialisation (e.g. regardless of their size, the member states have similar productions and the inter-countries trade is substantially lower than in the EU) and. 3. Economic development (e.g. size asymmetries are not correlated with wealth asymmetries, namely some of the largest regions are also the poorest). The EU experience cannot provide a solution to the first issue but can indicate effective approaches to deal with the second and third. In particular, the EU Cohesion Policy is a good model which can provide useful suggestions on how to design a common territorial policy able to take into account both size and income disparities. Moreover, the EU history of regional development policy, especially as far as research and innovation, smart specialisation, start-up development, clusters, education and training policy, are concerned can be invaluable in assisting MERCOSUR in addressing the negative consequences of small economic size, the fact that the member states tend to produce similar products and that their intra-MERCOSUR export share is very low. In the future, EU-MERCOSUR cooperation could focus on the governance of a common territorial policy, from its design to its operational management, as well as monitoring and evaluation. Those are the fields where the European experience is more long lived and stronger and can give a valuable contribution to the integration process of MERCOSUR. Some ongoing cooperation projects funded by the European Commission point in this direction 25 and more commitment is desirable in the future, while FOCEM can certainly represent an important pilot experience. It is also worth noting that the MERCOSUR integration process experienced several halts and the EU-MERCOSUR negotiations have been characterised by fits and starts. Hence, there is significant room for improvement in the negotiation processes, for instance through signing a medium- long-term roadmap, characterised by few but binding goals and milestones. 25 http://ec.europa.eu/regional_policy/en/policy/cooperation/international/latin-america/ ",

CONCLUSIONS AND LESSONS LEARNT 3.1. Regional development policy in other parts of the world and EU influence 3.1.1. China and Brazil China and Brazil are emerging countries which to a different extent have experienced important economic and social growth in the past two decades. They differ greatly as to size, institutional arrangements, spatial organization and development models: China is a growing manufacturing country, already investing extensively in research and knowledge economy; Brazil largely depends on raw materials, and its industrial agglomerations, even if significant, are yet unable to haul the whole national economy. These differences affect the strategic choices that the two countries can make in relation to income and territorial redistribution. In any case, both countries have made an enormous effort to improve economic, social and territorial cohesion in recent years. Table 6: Main objectives of regional policy in China and Brazil Objectives and priorities Main instruments Annual resources Common/Similar Specific China \uf02d Integrate social and development policies and fight poverty \uf02d Attract foreign investments \uf02d Strong integration of territorial polices in national development policy \uf02d Environmental sustainable development \uf02d Concentration of industries in Central regions \uf02d Fiscal and financial incentives \uf02d Increasing role of income transfers in weakest areas \uf02d Public companies investments \uf02d Mutual assistance \uf02d N/A(*) Brazil \uf02d Focus on SMEs and border areas \uf02d Financial instruments and tax exemption \uf02d Important income transfer to fight poverty \uf02d Investments in public companies \uf02d Around 0.5% of GDP in regional policy \uf02d Around 0.8% of GDP in social and anti- poverty policy (*) As explained above (p.15) a precise estimation of this expenditure is not possible for China. Source: Own elaboration. Fighting poverty and promoting social cohesion according to a territorial approach are common strategic priorities which have attracted increasing political attention and resources in both countries. This implies a general awareness that income transfers and public service improvements are needed to support the weakest parts of the countries. Such increasing political attention must be considered an addition to basic welfare state provisions, still incomparable to EU standards, and aims to create pre-conditions for development and competitiveness policies. The increasing income redistribution effort attempted in China and Brazil should trigger a socially sustainable path of development. Behind this effort there is a common need for diminishing disparities between rural and urban areas, which are increasingly less acceptable in the presence of growing levels of income. Environmental sustainability is also an important priority in China where some areas are being preserved exclusively for tourism. Territorial policies for growth and competiveness are based on a broad range of incentives for attracting foreign investments in both countries. In general, China and Brazil have similar instruments to promote such investments (fiscal and financial incentives, infrastructure and public services supply, localisation of investments in public ",
        "Policy Department for Structural and Cohesion Policies _____________________________________________________________ 60 companies in certain areas), but they are organised in a different way. In China the utilisation of a large range of fiscal, financial and use of soil instruments allows local authorities to adapt competitiveness policies to territorial features. The re-localisation policies, which foster the transfer of activities to the Central provinces, is facilitated by the large Chinese industrial basis. Mutual assistance is a specific instrument for territorial policies that promotes bilateral economic solidarity and technical support between two provinces: one strong \u201cdonor\u201d and a weaker \u201crecipient\u201d. In Brazil, the fact that federal regional policy mix is limited to financial instruments makes the definition of an integrated territorial policy difficult. However, the recent changes in the eligibility of the national funds moved the focus to endogenous potential and increased the role of SMEs, local productive systems and disadvantaged border areas. It is also worth noting that in China territorial development is an important component of the 5-year development plan, while in Brazil the regional policy is based on constitutional obligations and is separate from the national development policy. In addition, in China political stability has promoted a constant adaptation of the territorial policies to the national economic strategy. In Brazil the more frequent political changes have generated a stop-and-go process in regional policy and hampered its reform and modernisation, as requested by large parts of the academia and the administration. It is difficult to estimate the resources devoted to territorial policies , especially in China, where the scope of regional policy is more fuzzy. In Brazil resources specifically devoted to federal regional policy amount to around 0.5% of GDP, without considering fiscal de-contribution.

Broad strategies normally refer to macro-regions which include several Provinces in China and several States in Brazil, while eligibility criteria and specific objectives are defined at a smaller spatial level. Target areas are generally classified on the basis of their current and potential development. This common approach suggests that great importance is given to the local dimension of development and functional areas are necessary to define consistent and effective interventions. In this respect, the Chinese experience seems more flexible and adaptable, as it can change fiscal rules for a specific and limited area. The two countries have different, and contrasting, governance models for regional policy. China merges regional policy into national development policies and its governance reflects the governance of the whole public expenditure system: largely decentralised in the implementation but strategically oriented from the centre. In Brazil, regional policy is separated from the other development policies, based on specific funds ",
        "European Cohesion Policy and regional development policies in other parts of the world _____________________________________________________________________ 61 and very centralised. Regional policy governance may be assimilated to a development bank business model: controlled by the central political power, addressed by a technical/administrative board and implemented by public financial institutions. Proposals for a more decentralised approach have been rejected till now (in 2003 and 2010), but there have been significant and positive experiences of multi-level and decentralised governance in anti-poverty and rural development policies. Both countries use programming documents , focused on territorial development in China and on regional constitutional Funds priorities in Brazil, but they respond to planning needs of national administrations and cannot be compared to the EU programmes, where planning objectives are agreed between the EU and the Member States. Regional policy implementation deserves special attention, especially in China, because there competition between local authorities is an important way to promote efficiency and proactive attitudes. In turn, competition is stimulated by the personal interests of the officials, who have a reasonable autonomy in decision making and whose careers are linked to the social and economic performance of their area. This competition pushes policy implementation, but negatively affects coordination and collaboration between officials. In general, both countries suffer from weak coordination between institutions and the inadequate definition of the roles and the powers of the different actors. In China this reflects the complex interrelations between the administration and the communist party and an administrative tradition where personal roles may prevail over the administrative division of competences. In Brazil coordination shortcomings mainly stem from an unclear division of power among the different institutional levels (federal, state and municipal). 3.1.2. ASEAN and MERCOSUR ASEAN and MERCOSUR are carrying out their integration processes with different approaches. ASEAN has adopted a gradual and multispeed approach, where bilateral and differentiated agreements prevail; the institutionalisation of ASEAN is limited and just in recent years a more structured organization has been established. In MERCOSUR there is a relatively advanced institutional organization but this does not correspond to an intense integration process while bilateral contrasts often break out. Despite these different approaches both organizations focus on economic disparities and cohesion. In principle, they recognise that trade and economic integration, their prime objective, cannot occur if disparities are too large and integration benefits are not distributed. The same preoccupation motivated the radical reform of the European Structural Funds in 1989 and the following revisions to make EU enlargements possible. The specific geo-political features of ASEAN need to be taken into consideration and affect its objectives and organization : the proximity of China, the second largest economy in the world, significantly influences the economic and infrastructural organization of member countries and their association facilitate relationships and exchanges with China. MERCOSUR has to deal with a different context. Even if the US influence on Latina America is significant, differences in the size of the countries and the predominance of Brazil do not facilitate balanced progress. The regional policies of the two organizations are limited and based on a project approach. The Initiative for ASEAN Integration (IAI) is the main policy instrument for tackling territorial disparities in ASEAN and it funds projects to support the weakest countries to comply with ASEAN standards and reinforce their development policies.

FOCEM is MERCOSUR\u2019s main financial instrument is rather small in size (EUR 127 million in 2015). The fund financed by the richest countries supports projects for promoting infrastructures, enterprises and social cohesion mainly in the weakest countries.

These strategies are not funded by ASEAN but are a framework to channel international donor and national resources in those areas. These initiatives associate all countries under a unique strategic umbrella and, mutatis mutandis, can be compared to the EU macro-regional strategies. The disparities and the economic convergence in the two organizations has varied enormously in the last 15 years: the disparities among the countries in ASEAN are very large but are converging, while the disparities in MERCOSUR are more limited but over the years are remained unaltered or decreased only slightly mainly due to the fall of some of the richer economies (Venezuela and Argentina). Currently, these features are likely to affect the different political initiatives and strategic capacity in the two organizations. General findings emerging from the analysis of regional development policy in other parts of the world The following findings are based on the previous comparisons between China, Brazil, ASEAN and MERCOSUR and highlight issues which were important in the regional policy. They confirm that principles and approaches of the EU Cohesion Policy are by now a common legacy at world level though the size and the practical implementation of them vary considerably among them and in relation to the EU. \uf0b7 Territorial issues are on the political agenda and the policy mix of all the examined countries and country organizations. Regional convergence is a common political priority to a different extent across those countries and regional development policies have to balance market forces which spontaneously create productive agglomerations and territorial concentrations of income. With globalisation, which generated increasing disparities, and after the international crisis which exploded in 2007, regional development has become an increasingly necessary component in the policy mix of any country/organization. ",
        "European Cohesion Policy and regional development policies in other parts of the world _____________________________________________________________________ 63 \uf0b7 Social dimension is strictly interlinked to economic and territorial dimensions in the regional policies , it is justified by the poverty and inequality problems affecting emerging and less developed countries. This reflects also the awareness that productivity differences cannot be alleviated in the short term and that social assistance and policies for inclusion must go hand in hand with interventions for competitiveness. \uf0b7 Regional development policy is strongly integrated into national or sub- continental development policies. Growth and employment with no location priority are prevailing in developing countries policies; territorial policy is complementary with other developing policies. This means that , the main policy efforts are devoted to reinforcing and improving stronger areas and productive agglomerations and to manage urbanisation and the related migration flows; resources and design of regional development policy for weaker territories is integrated with these interventions. \uf0b7 Local dimension and bottom up approaches are fundamental for regional development of the countries but they are also part of broader strategies. Territorial targeting is used in all the cases and territorial planning or local needs are important components of broader regional or macro-regional strategies. \uf0b7 Horizontal Coordination between national authorities and vertical multilevel coordination between the different institutional levels is crucial in implementing regional policy. This is an issue encountered everywhere. This implies the need for a clear distribution of power and fiscal resources, an effective legal framework defining Cohesion Policy and an adequate administrative capacity at all institutional levels. \uf0b7 Regional development policy can use a large range of instruments to pursue effectively its aims. Local problems are by nature multidimensional and cannot be tackled with few instruments. China is a positive example of the multi- instruments approach. On the contrary, in Brazil the lack of flexibility in the available instruments may constrain the effectiveness of the policy. \uf0b7 Administrative capacity is a widespread problem in regional development policy implementation. The complexity of regional policy requires an extended capacity in multi-level governance, a strategic view, the involvement of many different stakeholders, a continuous interaction with political and, sectoral levels, the instrument to assure the participation of citizens, learning and problem solving attitudes. The acquisition of these capacities takes time and requires appropriate initiatives. In general, capacities are a lot scarcer in the weaker areas, are often at the origin of the late development and are maintained weak to preserve political consensus and inefficient distribution of public resources. Consequently, weaker administrations cannot be entrusted with capacity building but they need strong external support or incentives to improve 26 . Answers to the research questions Has the European regional policy influenced regional/development policies in countries outside the EU, and in what way? A diffused influence of the EU approaches on regional development policy and, more generally, territorial integration issues emerged from the analysis. Traces of the EU 26 This occurred, for example, in Brazil with the Bolsa Familia programme which forced local administrations to deal with the growing need for social assistance, or in China with career incentives and the external control on the administration of the Communist Party which stimulate a proactive attitude of the bureaucracy.

        "Policy Department for Structural and Cohesion Policies _____________________________________________________________ 64 Cohesion Policy experience are evident in the Brazilian debate and have been at the basis of the proposed reforms of Brazilian regional policy in the past decade. Moreover, the EU experience influenced some of the features of the territorial social programmes and their local development approach; in addition, EU inspiration is also evident in the significant effort made in evaluating regional policy in Brazil. There are no evident traces of European influence in China also because it does not have a specific regional policy. However, themes such as multi-level governance, local development, social dialogue are at the centre of the Chinese debate and are part of the exchanges with EU. The EU experience has also led to serious considerations on the definition of a regional policy with financial autonomy and specific rules. At the moment, this hypothesis has been put aside and the \u201cOne belt - one road\u201d initiative of national and international infrastructure investments attracts the political attention. Chinese authorities have also shown great interest in EU policy instruments, especially in research and innovation such as technological parks and cooperation between research centres and businesses. To a certain extent the institutional arrangements of ASEAN and MERCOSUR are comparable to the EU institutions and this confirms the fundamental role that the EU experience has played at international level. This also means that there already is a common experimental platform and shared \u201clanguage\u201d on regional development in the international community and this is a fundamental advantage for EU cooperation initiatives. Has regional policy in countries outside the EU influenced EU Cohesion Policy, and in what way? The regional policies examined in the study do not seem to have exerted any influence on the EU Cohesion Policy. The fact that the development of the studied economies were much lower than EU development made territorial policies in these countries difficult until redistributive capacity increased. While Brazil was inspired by EU policies (for instance, South of Italy) or International development organizations (World Bank) in the \u201880s and has been in no condition to provide new ideas to EU Cohesion Policy. Not only do historical factors preclude the possibility of influencing EU Cohesion Policy easily, but also its institutional complexity makes transferring external experiences difficult. In particular, two elements of the Cohesion Policy complexity have to be remembered: a) the Cohesion Policy budget is important (around 0.3% of the EU GDP) and is the result of a delicate international redistributive allocation of resources among MSs with different financial contribution (net receivers/payers) which, in many cases, already have their own regional policy; b) the shared management regime of Cohesion Policy requires an articulated division of competences between different institutions, mutual commitments and continuous coordination. These arrangements are difficult to find in China and Brazil - where redistribution is simpler \u2013 and in ASEAN and MERCOSUR - where the development of EU institutions and integration is still unfamiliar. Which innovations from the selected third countries and regional international bodies could be or should be further explored by the EU Cohesion Policy? Notwithstanding the afore mentioned features and considering the specific rules of EU Cohesion Policy, the examined countries and organizations have provided some inspiration that may be taken into consideration for the next round of Cohesion Policy programming. In this paragraph the main lessons are resumed while their possible implementation in EU Cohesion Policy is presented in the next section. ",
        "European Cohesion Policy and regional development policies in other parts of the world _____________________________________________________________________ 65 In China and ASEAN the sustained growth of the recent decades has made it possible to achieve a balanced territorial redistribution of resources. In these countries initiatives for cohesion and strategic priorities of development policy are fairly consistent. On the contrary in Brazil and in MERCOSUR, slower growth, a weaker redistribution capacity and a specialisation which is able to exploit globalisation advantages have been obstacles to launching significant initiatives for internal cohesion. These trends cohabit in the EU where the interests of the most dynamic areas often diverge from those of the areas penalised by globalisation. Therefore, defining a Cohesion Policy able to simultaneously promote growth and reduce disparities is particularly challenging and the international experiences examined in this paper may provide useful suggestions. The main features of the Chinese experience that provide food for thought in the design of the EU Cohesion Policy include: \uf0b7 the strong linkage between the national development strategy and the territorial policies , making it possible to even reduce cohesion aims in some periods when boosting economic growth is a priority. \uf0b7 A regional policy design combined with the integration and trade strategy with bordering countries and external partners (see \u201cOne Belt One Road\u201d initiative), in order to transform geographical disadvantages of marginal regions into new opportunities. In the EU, the less developed regions in the periphery of the Union would benefit from a new strategic partnerships with neighbouring countries at the East of Europe and in the Mediterranean basin. \uf0b7 Mutual assistance between regions at different development stages, in order to transfer know-how, technical and financial resources to the less developed regions ; \uf0b7 integration between regional development policy and social and migration policy, to promote socially sustainable growth and balanced territorial distribution of well-being conditions as a first step of a development policy; \uf0b7 the flexible use of different policy instruments to attract investments , also derogating from their own competition rules; \uf0b7 incentives supporting administrative efficiency of development policy management , as necessary condition for ensuring adequate policy implementation and a satisfying level of public services in poor areas. The most interesting features of the Brazilian experience include: \uf0b7 complementary role of and integration between social and competitiveness goals in territorial policies, with large initiatives aimed at decreasing social exclusion; \uf0b7 the impact of regional development policy on the demand of public services (education, health, social infrastructures, industrial areas, etc.) and the role of public services in deprived areas. The main experiences emerging from ASEAN, which deserve an in-depth analysis and which may be transferred to EU Cohesion Policy include: \uf0b7 The multi-level governance approach and the macro-regional strategies as important instruments of cooperation; ",
        "Policy Department for Structural and Cohesion Policies _____________________________________________________________ 66 \uf0b7 The collaboration of organizations and personnel from different countries on the design and management of development projects, which could be transposed to EU cross-border cooperation or capacity building. MERCOSUR, which is in a more embryonic integration stage, has currently little to offer in terms of lessons for policy design. As previously highlighted, some positive feedback on the FOCEM cohesion fund has been recorded but is not sufficient to identify general and useful indications for the EU. However, the lessons to be learnt from MERCOSUR consist mainly in mistakes to be avoided, such as the scarce political commitment to integration and cohesion, the weakness of institutions in presence of MSs that vary greatly in importance, the limited capability to in promote common policies on several important issues. How to implement the lessons learnt The previous conclusions imply several lessons for the EU, which can be grouped into two main categories: lessons for cooperation between EU and third countries in regional development policy; lessons that the EU can learn from the foreign experiences and transfer to its Cohesion Policy. Lessons for EU-third countries cooperation The EU experience in cooperation initiatives with China should focus on the following themes: \uf02d Institutionalisation and management of the multi-level governance , in order to reinforce coordination and promote a clearer and more systematic division of labour between administrations. This area may include exchanges on monitoring and evaluations which are important instruments of efficiency and effectiveness, but also of democratisation and enlarged participation in policy implementation. \uf02d Public and private partnerships and social dialogue , in order to identify methods of participation and to support civil organizations in policy decision making processes and facilitate private-public cooperation in investments. \uf02d Definition and management of specific financial instruments to promote territorial development , such as ERDF or ESF, in order to analyse in depth the possibility of further developing a Chinese regional policy with a specific mission and specific resources. \uf02d Methods and instruments for supporting innovation and technology transfers in territorial development policy in order to facilitate permanent exchanges with EU centres and companies on technological aspects. A strategic dialogue and exchange on regional development policy with Brazil must initially verify the country\u2019s political intention to reform its current arrangements in order to update the previous cooperation programmes and transfer the most recent EU experiences (for instance, result orientation and ex-ante conditionalities, integration of capacity and development policy, smart specialisation as example of territorially defined research and innovation policy). If the reform of regional policy is not forthcoming, EU experiences may be \u201creused\u201d in cooperation initiatives, such as: \uf02d Multi-level governance and possible methods to integrate national, federal and local policies in Brazil. ",
        "European Cohesion Policy and regional development policies in other parts of the world _____________________________________________________________________ 67 \uf02d Local development interventions in urban and rural contexts. \uf02d Cross-border cooperation programmes and cooperation initiatives at different territorial scale between countries and regions. In addition to the bilateral agreements and involving key regional and global issues in cooperation, such as climate change, disaster risk management and resilience, post- 2015 sustainable development goals including poverty eradication, pandemics, counter- terrorism, counter-radicalisation and foreign fighters, the EU is working to promote a strategic partnership with ASEAN. Some themes may be transferred to ASEAN in relation to Cohesion Policy: \uf02d Problems arising from the entry of new low income MSs. \uf02d The Cohesion Fund and the reduction of national disparities by means of large infrastructural projects in environmental and transport sectors. \uf02d The cross-border cooperation initiatives . The EU-MERCOSUR cooperation initiatives may help to overcome a certain impasse in transnational cooperation and focus on: \uf02d Macro-regional strategies and the identification of a common ground of action for countries with similar problems. \uf02d Possible reinforcement and updating of FOCEM from the experiences of the EU programmes, not only in relation to Cohesion Policy but also to research and innovation, the business sector and education (drawing upon HORIZON 2020, ERASMUS, SME instrument or EU financial instruments). Lessons for the EU Cohesion Policy This final paragraph examines how the main lessons emerging from the study may be transposed to EU Cohesion Policy. The details of their possible implementation are not analysed here because that would require a debate on political and operational elements of the next Cohesion Policy which is outside the scope of the present study. To facilitate the readers, previous lessons deriving from the examined experiences have been grouped in three main categories: 1) the strategic approach to the Cohesion Policy, 2) its instruments, 3) administrative and institutional capacity. The table below summarises the lessons, their relevance to Cohesion Policy and the way to transpose them into the Cohesion Policy. Lessons concerning the Cohesion Policy strategy require a new approach to territorial development and the integration of competitiveness and social priorities. In order to combine regional, national and EU development strategy more successfully, financial concentration should continue to benefit weakest areas but a more flexible approach may make it possible to devote more resources to stronger areas when they promote integrated initiatives with less favoured regions (for instance, in research, education or tourism development). Migration and labour mobility should become an important priority in the Cohesion Policy not only to tackle the current emergency, but also to counteract ageing and to promote balanced and inclusive patterns of growth. In this respect social issues should be integrated into the Cohesion Policy more broadly and efficiently, while labour active policy, and also living standards and adequate social services should be guaranteed in the weakest areas. The Cohesion Policy cannot bear ",

        "Policy Department for Structural and Cohesion Policies _____________________________________________________________ 70 Finally, and in accordance with previous indications for a more articulated and flexible Cohesion Policy, the macro regional approach should be developed further and made more operational. In order to increase the attractiveness to foreign investments, lessons suggest that instruments such as fiscal or financial incentives should be reinforced in the most deprived areas with easier and more flexible derogation of competition rules. This approach should be adjusted according to the size of the deprived areas on the one hand and the level of the national tax imposition on the other to avoid excessive and unfair discounts. The experience of the \u201cEnterprises zones\u201d of the ERDF may be extended. However, it is important to notice that these fiscal instruments are relatively easy to implement in a single country, while implementing them on an EU level would require a firm hand by the EC. Administrative capacity is a pre-condition for growth policy, and in the weakest areas it is also a development instrument per se. The Cohesion Policy recognises the increasingly greater importance of this priority in the less developed regions. Lessons from foreign countries would seem to encourage the use of tangible incentives and award mechanisms (career, financial incentives, work reorganizations, clear responsibility) in the administrations to improve their performance. In weak contexts the implementation of the EU programmes may be associated with compulsory national or local administrative reinforcement plans 27 . Other lessons would recommend a tighter cooperation between weak and strong administrations in the same countries or also among different countries. This cooperation may be developed by implementing the same interventions in different territories or working together on similar projects. in both cases the \u2018donor\u2019 administration should receive some kind of reward for the transfer. These forms of cooperation may be included in the national OPs and/or may represent a second generation of the current \u2018peer 2 peer\u2019 initiative of DG Regio. Last but not least, a resolute policy for capacity building in the EU requires a stronger leadership by the EC, which in perspective would have to multiply its efforts to intervene in radically different administrative organizations, coordinate regional cooperation and identify minimum common standards, insist on MSs honouring their commitments. In conclusion, lessons learned recommend an increasing flexibility in the implementation of the Cohesion Policy principles. These principles are still valid and shared in the world, but their adaptation to development strategies requires a new solidarity agreement between strong and weak regions. The new agreement should not be based on a rigid allocation of resources and narrow competition rules, but should be open to cooperation among regions, development of common projects and share the responsibility for national and EU growth. In this perspective and to favour cooperation between regions, social and competitive policies should be integrated, public services should provide similar outputs everywhere and administrative capacity should not differ greatly between territories. 27 In Italy in the 2014-2020 period this approach made it possible to respond to the persistent Country Specific Recommendations concerning the low efficiency in the use of the Cohesion Policy resources.
