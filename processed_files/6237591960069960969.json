It publishes official harmonised statistics on the European Union and the euro area and offers a comparable, reliable and objective portrayal of a changing Europe. A vast range of data broken down by region and country of the European Union and of candidate countries is available to you. WHAT IS THE LEGAL BASIS? The legislation in force can be found at: http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa. eu/portal/page/portal/about_eurostat/european_framework/ legislation_in_force WHAT DOES EUROSTAT DO? To produce these statistics, Eurostat collects data from the national statis- tical institutes and harmonises them according to a single methodology. The data thus obtained are genuinely comparable for the European Union as a whole. WHO USES EUROSTAT\u2019S STATISTICS? Decision-makers in the fields of politics, higher education and economics use Eurostat services and products to obtain the information that is vital for their activities. Eurostat also enables the general public and the media to obtain an objective view of developments in European society. KSEG10001ENC_002.pdf 6 7/04/11 09:17 ",

        "9 Introduction Selection of Eurostat\u2019s products SELECTED STATISTICS Selected statistics are main tables in HTML format. They are listed below. (cid:2) Europe 2020 indicators Europe 2020 is a new strategy for the EU to develop as a smarter, know- ledge-based, greener economy, delivering high levels of employment, pro- ductivity and social cohesion. It is being designed as the successor to the Lisbon strategy. (See \u2018Structural indicators\u2019.) Statistics are an integral part of the Europe 2020 strategy. The headline indicators measure the progress made by the EU and the Member States towards achieving the five headline targets of the strategy. The additional indicators show in more detail developments with regard to the main ob- jectives and flagship initiatives of the strategy. Europe 2020 indicators are used as an input into the annual European eco- nomic policies report by the Commission. KSEG10001ENC_002.pdf 9 7/04/11 09:17 ",
        "10 EUROSTAT MINI-GUIDE 2011 (cid:2) Euro-indicators/Selected principal European economic indicators (PEEIs) The economic and monetary union required a broad range of infra-annual short-term statistics to measure economic and monetary developments within the euro area and to assist the European Central Bank in the im- plementation of a common monetary policy. Eurostat has developed the \u2018Euro-indicators\u2019, of which the principal European economic indicators (PEEIs) are the core, in order to provide policymakers, analysts, acade- mics, the media and the public with essential information for decision- making, economic analysis and research. The indicators have been developed by experts and agreed at a political level. They are being continuously monitored, improved and reviewed in order to be in line with evolving policy requirements. PEEIs have become progressively a natural reference in the European statistical system (ESS): a set of key short-term indicators needed for monetary and economic ana- lysis satisfying timeliness and quality requirements. The Euro-indicators\u2019/PEEIs\u2019 web pages are a reference point for all users of official statistics dealing with short-term data. They supply business- KSEG10001ENC_002.pdf 10 7/04/11 09:17 ",
        "11 Introduction cycle analysts, policymakers, the media, researchers, students and other interested users with a comprehensive, well-structured and reliable set of economic information which is useful in their daily activities. More than 300 tables provide an overview of the latest and most important economic indicators for the euro area and the European Union, as well as for the Member States; they are structured in eight main collections, listed below. Balance of payments The \u2018Balance of payments\u2019 (BoP) systematically summarises all eco- nomic transactions between the residents and non-residents of a coun- try or of a geographical region during a given period. The BoP provides harmonised information on international transactions which are part of the current account (goods, services, income, current transfers), but also on transactions which fall in the capital and in the financial ac- count. Business and consumer surveys Business and consumer surveys supply a wide range of information on current economic activity and its perspectives based on the opinion of economic actors, such as entrepreneurs and consumers. Consumer prices Consumer price indices (CPIs) are economic indicators constructed to measure the changes over time in the prices of consumer goods and services acquired, used or paid for by households. \u2018Harmonized indices of consumer prices\u2019 (HICPs) are designed for international compari- sons of consumer price inflation. They are used in the assessment of inflation convergence as required under Article 121 of the Treaty of Amsterdam (Article 109j of the Treaty on European Union). External trade Extra-EU trade statistics cover the trading of goods between a Member State and a non-member country. Intra-EU trade statistics cover the trading of goods between Member States. The external trade Euro-in- dicators are published for the euro area and its 13 Member States as well as for the European Union and its 27 Member States. They refer only to the extra-zone trade (i.e. the extra-euro-area and extra-EU trade). Industry, commerce and services Industry, commerce and services indicators contain information on a wide range of activity indicators (available either on a monthly or quarterly basis) such as production, turnover, output prices, new or- ders and labour utilisation and remuneration. This heading covers in- dicator activities on industry, construction and retail trade. Data are broken down according to both NACE Rev. 1.1 (statistical classification of economic activities in the European Community) and MIGS (main industrial groupings) classifications. KSEG10001ENC_002.pdf 11 7/04/11 09:17 ",
        "12 EUROSTAT MINI-GUIDE 2011 Labour market Labour market data contain information on harmonised unemploy- ment and measures of the cost pressures arising from the production factor \u2018labour\u2019. According to the International Labour Office (ILO) definition, un- employed persons are all persons 15 to 74 years of age who were not employed during the reference week, had actively sought work during the past four weeks and were ready to begin working immediately or within two weeks. Monetary and financial indicators Monetary and financial indicators include information on money sup- ply, interest rates, bond yields, exchange rates, stock market capitalisa- tion, share price indices and official foreign reserves. Aggregates in this section are compiled either by the European Central Bank or Eurostat. National accounts The data set presented here is mainly related to quarterly national ac- counts. Coverage: GDP and main components according to the output side (industry breakdown according to NACE Rev. 1 one letter clas- sification), the expenditure side, the income side and employment na- tional accounts data. (cid:2) Sustainable development indicators KSEG10001ENC_002.pdf 12 7/04/11 09:17 ",
        "13 Introduction The EU sustainable development strategy (SDS), which was renewed in June 2006, sets out a coherent approach as to how the EU will more effec- tively live up to its long-standing commitment to meet the challenges of sustainable development. It reaffirms the overall aim of achieving conti- nuous improvement of quality of life and well-being on Earth for present and future generations, through the creation of sustainable communities able to manage and use resources efficiently and to tap the ecological and social innovation potential of the economy, ensuring prosperity, environ- mental protection and social cohesion. The SDS requires the Commission to develop indicators at the appropriate level of detail to monitor progress with regard to each particular challenge. A first set of indicators was ad- opted by the Commission in 2005 and further reviewed in 2007 in order to adjust to the SDS. Sustainable development indicators (SDIs) are used to monitor the European Union SDS in a report to be published by Eurostat every two years. (cid:2) Government finance Government finance statistics (GFS) present the economic activities of go- vernment in a harmonised and comparable way, with an emphasis on the economic substance over the legal form of the event. GFS hence noticeably differ from the budget presentations or public accounting presentations that are nationally specific as far as scope of units and recording of trans- actions are concerned. The GFS presentation shows in an integrated manner: government reve- nue, government expenditure, government deficit, transactions in assets, transactions in liabilities, other economic flows and balance sheets. This presentation is similar to that of business accounting where the profit and loss accounts and the balance sheet are presented together, in a linked manner. European GFS are defined by reference to the European system of accounts 1995 (ESA 1995), the European manual for national accounts. This manual KSEG10001ENC_002.pdf 13 7/04/11 09:17 ",
        "14 EUROSTAT MINI-GUIDE 2011 has been supplemented by further interpretation and guidance from Euro- stat. These GFS form the basis for fiscal monitoring in Europe, notably for the statistics related to the excessive deficit procedure (EDP). (cid:2) Harmonized indices of consumer prices (HICPs) The HICPs are economic indicators constructed to measure the chan- ges over time in the prices of consumer goods and services acquired by households. The HICPs give comparable measures of inflation in the euro area, the EU, the European Economic Area and for other countries inclu- ding accession and candidate countries. They are calculated according to a harmonised approach and a single set of definitions. They provide the of- ficial measure of consumer price inflation in the euro area for the purposes of monetary policy in the euro area and assessing inflation convergence as required under the Maastricht criteria.

Exports to China remain at the same level \u2014 Issue number 48/2010 The year 2009 was marked by a considerable drop in the total value of goods traded: EU-27 exports to the selected countries decreased by 16% and imports from these countries fell by 20%. The United States remains the EU\u2019s most im- portant trading partner. The value of EU imports from China (including Hong Kong) was more than double that of exports, resulting in a high EU trade deficit. Trade in services has declined in 2009. Services are mainly exchanged with the USA (compared with 2008, services exports to the USA decreased by 12% and imports by 5%), followed by the EFTA countries. Direct investments from the USA increased substantially in 2009 while EU investments to the USA decreased, in sharp contrast with the situation in 2008.

        "23 Catalogue (cid:116) Portrait of EU coastal regions \u2014 Issue number 38/2010 In 2007, 196 million people lived, 88 million people worked and 410 million people embarked or disembarked in EU coastal regions. In 2007, 43 % of the inhabitants of the 22 EU Member States lived in coastal regions and 38 % of coastal region inhabitants resided in one of the 194 cities with over 100 000 inhabitants located within 50 km of the sea. The service sector is the biggest employer, accounting for 72 % of the jobs in these regions. However, involvement in the service sector is not homogeneous all over the regions. High density of tourism capacity or large marine passenger traffic is linked with the level of employment in sectors such as households and enterprise services. Administrative and financial services, for their part, are most often related to the level of urbanisation of these regions. An analysis of these characteristics enabled five main profiles to be drawn of these highly specific regions. The data contained in this publication can be used for the monitoring of coastal region profiles in the framework of the EU integrated maritime policy.

In 2009, the deficit amounted to \u20ac 8.6 billion, considerably less than in the previous three years. The products most export- ed to Latin America by the EU were machinery and road vehicles whereas imports were dominated by vegetables and fruit (especially from Argentina and Brazil), feeding stuffs for animals, petroleum (mainly from Venezuela) and metalliferous ores (especially from Brazil). For the trade in services, a 14 % increase in the total volume was registered between 2007 and 2008 (to reach \u20ac 47.6 billion). The EU\u2019s surplus in the trade of services amounted to \u20ac 8.7 billion. In relative terms, the EU surplus was considerable with Vene- zuela. Foreign direct investment flows in the Latin American economies were substantially reduced in 2008 (\u2013 43 % compared with 2007). Increases were noted for Mexico and Argentina but disinvestments occurred in Brazil. Catalogue No: KS-SF-10-035-EN-N Issue date: 29 June 2010 KSEG10001ENC_002.pdf 23 7/04/11 09:17 ",
        "24 EUROSTAT MINI-GUIDE 2011 (cid:116) Significant differences between regions in the stock of passenger cars and freight vehicles \u2014 Issue No 6/2010 There are important disparities in the use of passenger cars within the various regions of the different European countries. The number of passenger cars per inhabitant provides an illustration of this phenomenon, with the highest regional rate registered in the EU being more than 11 times the lowest one. At EU-27 level, the average rate is estimated at 0.54 passenger cars per inhab- itant in 2007. The ratio is often linked to economic or geographical issues: the highest ratios are more likely to be registered in less accessible regions while the lowest ratios are more often observed in regions with high density of population and where the public transport network is typically quite de- veloped. The highest numbers of passenger cars per inhabitant are registered in the west European regions and an important geographical contrast prevails compared with the east European countries. The picture is however different when considering freight vehicles. The highest regional stocks of freight vehi- cles are registered in regions playing a key role in large-scale freight transport, representing either major entry points to the EU or important crossroads..

The 2008-based regional population projections EUROPOP2008 show that the population may increase in two out of three regions between 2008 and 2030. However, in 2030, slightly more than half of the regions are projected to continue to increase their population. The median age of the regions\u2019 population in 2030 is projected to be between 34.2 years and 57.0 years, while in 2008 the range was between 32.9 years and 47.8 years. Similarly, in 2030, the share of the population aged 65 years or over is expected to range between 10.4 % and 37.3 %. In 2008, the range was between 9.1 % and 26.8 %. Population projections are what-if scenarios that aim to provide information about the likely future size and structure of the population. Eurostat\u2019s regional population projections scenario is one of several possible population change scenarios at regional level based on assumptions for fertility, mortality and migration.

        "25 Catalogue European and national short-term indicators With most of the old EU Member States participating in economic and monetary union since 1999, infra-annual economic statistics for the euro area and the European Union as a whole have gained and will continue to gain ever more operational importance for collec- tive and private decision-making. The momentum of the EU econo- mies and most notably the euro-area economy has to be assessed continuously. The Euro-indicators\u2019/PEEIs\u2019 special topic is exclusively dedicated to infra-annual economic statistics such as consumer prices, national accounts, balance of payments, external trade, industry, energy, com- merce and services, and the labour market, as well as a selection of monetary and financial indicators of the European Central Bank and business and consumer survey results from the European Commis- sion\u2019s Economic and Financial Affairs DG. Regional statistics This domain relates to the main aspects of economic, demographic and social life in the European Union at regional level. Created in 1975, it is subdivided into 12 statistical domains: demography, migration, eco- nomic accounts, unemployment, labour market, transport and energy, agriculture, education, health, tourism, structural business statistics and statistics concerning science and technology (including research and development). The regions are classified according to the Euro- pean regional classification NUTS (nomenclature of territorial units for statistics). Urban audit The \u2018urban audit\u2019 is a response to the growing demand for an assess- ment of the quality of life in European cities. The database allows a comparison of cities in terms of certain characteristics (demography, economic activity, employment, public transport, culture, environ- ment, education level, etc.). The audit comprises information for 357 cities. The data are available for three spatial levels: the core city, i.e. the administrative city, the larger urban zone (LUZ), which includes the hinterland of the cities, and the sub-city districts. Non-EU countries Non-EU countries covered are: Mediterranean countries, candidate and potential candidate countries, eastern European neighbourhood policy countries (ENP) and Russia.

The GFS presentation shows, in an integrated way: government revenue, government expenditure, government deficit, trans- actions in assets, transactions in liabilities, other economic flows, and bal- ance sheets. It gives a clear picture of the links between these data. The publication is intended primarily for national governments, central banks, economic analysts and academics with an interest in government finance, though it could also be of interest to the wider public. Other references on the same subject are, for example, the Eurostat manual on Government deficit and debt , Taxation trends in the European Union and the GFS web- site. The value added in comparison with other publications is to give an overview of government finances from several angles with consistency in- formation. The publication covers a 14-year period (1996\u20132009). K S EG1 000 1E NC _ 002.pdf 2 6 7/0 4 / 11 09: 1 7 ",

The data are presented, within a unified statistical framework (the ESA 95 harmonised system of national and regional accounts), which makes it possible to as- sess the heterogeneous national tax systems on a fully comparable basis. The standard classifications of tax revenues (by major type of tax or by level of government) presented in most international tax revenue statistics are hard to interpret in economic terms. This publication stands out for offering a breakdown of tax revenues by economic function (i.e. accord- ing to whether they are raised on consumption, labour or capital). This classification is based on disaggregated tax data and on a breakdown of the revenue from the personal income tax. In addition, the report contains indicators of the average effective tax burden on consumption, labour and capital. Country chapters give an overview of the tax system in each of the 28 countries covered, the revenue trends and the main recent policy chang- es. Detailed tables allow comparison between the individual countries and European averages. Data cover the 1995\u20132008 period and are presented both as a percentage of GDP and as a percentage of total taxation.

The overall trade in goods (sum of imports and exports) between the EU and the ACP (Africa, Caribbean, Pacific) coun- tries was valued at \u20ac 111.0 billion in 2009. This represents a decrease of 23.0% compared with 2008. The persistent trade deficit the EU had for nearly a dec- ade turned into a trade surplus (\u20ac 3.6 billion). South Africa remains the most important partner among the ACP group, in terms of EU-27 imports (27.8%) and exports (28.0%). Nigeria and Angola follow at a considerable distance.

        "31 Catalogue (cid:116) Financial turmoil: its impact on quarterly government accounts \u2014 Issue number 5/2010 In recent years Eurostat has significantly expanded the range of integrated quar- terly data available on government finances, providing a timely and increasingly high-quality picture of the evolution of government finances in the EU. These data now reflect non-financial, financial and debt aspects, and cover all countries in the European Union. This publication examines the main features of these data as they reflect the lead-up to and stages of the economic and financial crisis, based on data transmitted by Member States at the end of September 2009. This publica- tion complements the SIF recently published which provides an in-depth analysis of quarterly non-financial accounts (Issue number 93/2009). Catalogue No: KS-SF-10-005-EN-N Issue date: 27 January 2010 (cid:2) DATABASES National accounts This domain includes data on national accounts\u2019 aggregates on an an- nual basis. It includes variables covering the three approaches of GDP and other important macroeconomic variables such as gross national income (GNI), net saving, net lending and borrowing or employment. There is also more detailed information in the form of breakdowns for final consumption, gross value added and employment by branch, and gross fixed capital formation by investment product. These figures are in accordance with ESA 1995 and are available at current and con- stant prices, expressed in national currency, in euro and in PPS, sup- plemented by the respective growth rates, deflators, indices and ratios with respect to principal totals. Auxiliary indicators, like population and conversion rates, used to calculate the different evaluations are available in the domain itself. Geographical coverage includes the euro area, the EU, the Member States and candidate countries, as well as the main economic partners of the European Union.

It rearranges both supply and use in a single table with identical classification of products (or industries respectively) applied for both rows and columns. European sector accounts The European Central Bank (ECB) and Eurostat publish quarterly eu- ro-area and EU accounts for institutional sectors (the European sector accounts), back to the first quarter of 1999. The data are released every four months after the reference quarter. Macroeconomic developments, such as economic growth and infla- tion, are driven by the actions of the individual economic subjects in an economy. Grouping economic subjects with similar behaviour into institutional sectors (households, non-financial corporations, financial corporations and government) greatly helps to understand the func- tioning of the economy. The compilation of quarterly European sector accounts is the outcome of a close collaboration by Eurostat, the ECB, the national statistical institutes and the national central banks in the European Union. Government finance statistics (cid:2) Balance sheets: financial assets and liabilities, consolidated and non-consolidated, for all the sectors of the economy and the rest of the world. (cid:2) Financial transactions in assets and liabilities, consolidated and non-consolidated, for all the sectors of the economy and the rest of the world. (cid:2) Nominal holding gains and losses in assets and liabilities, consoli- dated and non-consolidated, for all the sectors of the economy and the rest of the world. Exchange rates Exchange rates and interest rates are basic financial statistics in their own right. They are also used in a wide range of calculations and for deriving other time-series. The bilateral exchange rates and conversion factors included in the exchange rates\u2019 collection are those which should officially be used throughout Eurostat in calculations. Bilateral exchange rates are avail- able, updated daily. In addition to these rates, exchange rates include bilateral and effective exchange rate indices, data on fluctuations in the exchange rate mechanism of the EU, and conversion factors for euro fixed series into euro/ecu. Interest rates The interest rates\u2019 collection covers short-, medium- and long-term interest rates. These include Central Bank interest rates, money mar- ket rates, bond yields, and commercial (retail) bank rates. The official series used for the EMU convergence criterion on long-term interest rates is available on a daily basis. The euro yield curve information cal- culated daily by Eurostat is also housed in this collection. K S EG1 000 1E NC _ 002.pdf 32 7/0 4 / 11 09: 1 7 ",
        "33 Catalogue Monetary and other financial statistics The collections of this domain cover many of the elements required for understanding monetary and financial developments: monetary aggregates, external assets and liabilities (including foreign official re- serves), stock and bond market information and banking transactions. For many series, annual, quarterly and monthly data are available. Nor- mally, euro-area and EU aggregates are available, along with data for individual countries in the European Economic Area, plus the candi- date countries, the United States and Japan. However, some euro-area country data end with the start of EMU. Prices (including HICP) This domain comprises four collections: \u2018harmonized indices of con- sumer prices\u2019 (monthly and annual data), national consumer price indices (monthly and annual data), cost of living comparison in the European Union (Brussels = 100) (annual data), and purchasing pow- er parities for private consumption (comparison by country, annual data). Balance of payments This domain provides monthly and quarterly balance of payment sta- tistics, annual data on international trade in services, annual data on foreign direct investment and on the activity of foreign affiliates, and detailed data on international transactions involving the European institutions. For all these subjects, this domain provides harmonised data for the European Union and for the euro area, but also for each EU Member State, the candidate countries, Norway, the United States, Japan and Switzerland.

It is hoped that such solidarity will be further promot- ed through the designation of 2010 as the European Year for Combating Poverty and Social Exclusion. Nevertheless, just over 84 million persons, or 17 % of the EU-27\u2019s population, were at risk of poverty in 2007, while a similar proportion (17 %) of the total EU-27 population suffered from material deprivation. There was a clear overlap between those who were at risk of poverty and those suffering from, among others, being unable to face unexpected expenses, afford a holiday, keep their home adequately warm, or afford a car. Combating poverty and social exclusion \u2014 A sta- tistical portrait of the European Union 2010 presents a broad range of statistical concepts and indicators from social statistics. The publication explores poverty and social exclusion across the 27 Member States, as well as providing (whenever possible) information about candidate and EFTA countries.

Working in close collaboration with Eurostat, Anne-Catherine Guio, from the Institut Wallon de l\u2019Evaluation de la Prospective et de la Statistique (IWEPS), is the author of the present paper. The paper describes the different steps taken over time to overcome the difficulties encountered in agreeing on indica- tors of material deprivation: lack of data from all Member States, limited number of the current SILC items; lack of comparability of current items due to discrepancies in their implementation at national level; validity of the items to reflect deprivation across Member States; appropriate meth- odology to build the indicators; giving different weights to the items within dimensions and across countries, or not.

This is also the case in lower secondary education but there the progress was more modest. Students in upper secondary general educa- tion study more languages than students in the vocational stream at the same level. English is by far the foreign language most studied at all levels of educa- tion, followed by French, German, Russian and Spanish. More than one third of adults aged 25 to 64 perceive that they do not know any foreign language. A slightly smaller proportion say that they know one foreign language. The best-known foreign language by far is perceived to be English. In general, a higher proportion of the younger adult population claims to speak foreign languages than of the older generations. Likewise, a correlation was found be- tween a high level of education and a higher perceived proficiency in foreign languages.

Acquisition of citizenship is often viewed as a key indicator of successful integration in the receiving country, as it usually implies a good knowledge of the country\u2019s language, culture and so- ciety, together with some level of contribution to economic activity in general. The number of people acquiring citizenship in an EU Member State declined for the second consecutive year in 2008 after rising for more than eight years. The decline, roughly 2 %, was smaller than that recorded for 2007 (around 4 %). The total number of acquisitions recorded in the EU in 2008 was slightly below 700 000. The highest number of acquisitions was recorded in France, the United Kingdom and Germany. These three countries accounted for more than 50 % of the EU total. While France recorded a moderate increase com- pared with 2007, the other two countries granted over 20 % fewer citizenships in 2008.

However, the increase has been much smaller than in the United States, where the rate has overtaken that of the EU despite having been much lower at the start of the crisis. Un- employment varies greatly across both Europe and the United States. Recent data from the US Current Population Survey and from the European Labour Force Survey (LFS) (fourth quarter of 2009) are used to analyse unemploy- ment in the two areas by gender, educational level and duration. The data are supplemented by seasonally adjusted monthly data. This publication is the fourth in a series analysing the effects of the current economic crisis on the labour market.

This category included 23 % of female full-time employees, 28 % of those with a low level of education, 31 % of those having a fixed-term contract and 41 % of those working in hotels and restaurants. The percentage of full-time employees who were low-wage earners was between 6 % (Finland) and 31 % (Latvia). This publication analyses in more detail the structure of low-wage employment in Europe. Also when looking at average gross earnings per hour wide variations around the average of \u20ac 13.38 per hour were reported in the EU in 2006. On average, hourly wages of persons with tertiary education were twice as high as those with lower education. Gross hourly earnings of women were 17.6 % lower than for men in 2007 (this relative difference is known as the gender pay gap). Catalogue No: KS-SF-10-003-EN-N Issue date: 15 January 2010 (cid:2) DATABASES Population Eurostat provides information for a large range of demographic data, including statistics on populations at national and regional level (cen- sus tables, population estimates and projections) as well as for various demographic factors (births, deaths, marriages and divorces, immigra- tion and emigration) influencing the size, the structure and the specific characteristics of these populations. In addition, statistics are available for migration flows, foreign popula- tion stocks, acquisition of citizenship and asylum applications. Statis- tics on the enforcement of immigration legislation (refusals of entry, returns) and on residence permits are under development and will be published in the course of 2009.

        "46 EUROSTAT MINI-GUIDE 2011 of health. The domain is divided into two main items: public health, and health and safety at work. Education and training Education, vocational training and lifelong learning play a vital role in both an economic and social context. The opportunities which the EU offers its citizens for living, studying and working in other coun- tries make a major contribution to cross-cultural understanding, personal development and the realisation of the EU\u2019s full economic potential. Each year, well over a million EU citizens of all ages benefit from EU-funded educational, vocational and citizenship-building programmes. Labour market Labour market statistics measure the involvement of individuals, households and businesses in the labour market. They cover short- term and structural aspects of the labour market in monetary and non- monetary terms. The focus is on both the supply side (actual labour market participation in its various dimensions, unemployment) and the demand side (employment, job vacancies). Income, social inclusion and living conditions This domain contains statistical information about income, pov- erty and social exclusion \u2014 notably indicators adopted under the \u2018open method of coordination\u2019 on social inclusion and on adequacy of pensions. The current focus is on income inequality and rela- tive monetary poverty, and is presented at aggregate level and with breakdowns according to various socio-demographic variables. Work is ongoing to develop additional indicators of poverty and exclusion. The primary source of data is currently the European Community household panel (ECHP). This pioneering survey covers private house- holds in the EU Member States, with effect from 1994, and is now being replaced by a new data collection instrument: the EU-SILC. The house- hold budget survey gathers cross-sectional data on final consumption expenditure of non-collective private households. Harmonised data on social protection expenditure (such as pensions, unemployment benefits, healthcare, and family allowances) and re- ceipts (such as social contributions by employers and employees, government contributions) are available for the 27 EU Member States, Iceland, Norway and Switzerland. Social protection The European system of integrated social protection statistics (ESS- PROS) was developed in the late 1970s by Eurostat jointly with repre- sentatives of the Member States of the European Union in response to the need for a specific instrument for statistical observation of social protection in the EC Member States.

        "47 Catalogue ESSPROS is a common framework which enables international com- parison of the administrative national data on social protection. It provides a coherent comparison between European countries of social benefits to households and their financing. The information collected concerns social protection benefits, receipts and expenditures, pensions\u2019 beneficiaries and net social benefits. Household budget surveys Household budget surveys (HBSs) are national surveys mainly focus- ing on consumption expenditure. They are conducted in all EU Mem- ber States and their primary aim (especially at national level) is to cal- culate weights for the consumer price index. They were launched in most EU Member States at the beginning of the 1960s and Eurostat has been collating and publishing these survey data every five years since 1988. The two last collection rounds were 1999 and 2005. Although there have been continuous efforts towards harmonisation, differences remain. The surveys vary between countries in terms of frequency, timing, content or structure. Currently data are collected for all 27 EU Member States as well as for Croatia, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Turkey, Norway and Switzerland. Crime and criminal justice This domain presents data on total crime and on some specific offences (homicide, violent crime, robbery, domestic burglary, theft of motor vehicles, drug trafficking). Data are also available for the number of police officers and for the prison population. Culture Cultural statistics rely on the pragmatic definition of culture gener- ally agreed upon during the earlier work by the European Leadership Group (LEG). It was decided to restrict the field to activities that were recognised as cultural by every Member State. For this reason sports and tourism, for example, were excluded. Next, the field of culture was broken down into some 60 activities, cross-relating eight \u2018domains\u2019 (ar- tistic and monumental heritage, archives, libraries, books and press, visual arts, architecture, performing arts and audiovisual/multimedia) to six \u2018functions\u2019 (conservation, creation, production, dissemination, trade and training).

As a result, tourism plays an important role in terms of its economic and employment potential, while presenting social and environmental implications; these twin characteristics drive the demand for reliable and harmonised statis- tics within this field. This publication aims at giving a broad overview of the available tourism-related statistics at the level of the European Union on the basis of the latest available results. The focus is on data at the EU level, but the analysis includes data at the Member State level and cross- country comparisons of the tourism indicators. Besides the core tourism statistics data compiled on the basis of the directive, the article also in- cludes results from other fields of official statistics that can be relevant for analysing tourism in Europe.

The regulation establish- ing NACE Rev. 2 was adopted in December 2006. It includes provisions for the implementation of NACE Rev. 2 and coordinated transition from NACE Rev. 1.1 to NACE Rev. 2 in various statistical domains. NACE Rev. 2 is to be used, in general, for statistics referring to economic activities performed as from 1 January 2008 onwards. New concepts at the highest level of the classification have been intro- duced, and new detail has been created to reflect different forms of pro- duction and emerging new industries. At the same time, efforts have been made to maintain the structure of the classification in all areas that do not explicitly require change based on new concepts. The detail of the classification has substantially increased (from 514 to 615 classes). For service-producing activities, this increase is visible at all levels, including the highest one, while for other activities, such as agriculture, the increase in detail has mostly affected the lower level of the classification.

Between 2007 and 2008, the number of producers (agricultural holdings) using organic farming methods within the EU-27 rose by 9.5 %. Cattle and sheep are the most popular species reared using such methods. The main industrial activities in the organic sector are the processing and preserving of meat and the production of meat products as well as the processing and preserving of fruit and vegetables. The aim of this publication is to describe the situation of the organic sector in 2008 and the more recent developments, paying particular attention to organic farm- ing. Wherever possible, it also includes comparisons with and references to agriculture as a whole.

Three quarters of the pigs are reared by just 1.5 % of the largest fatteners. Small pig producers are mostly found in the new Member States and are one of the reasons for the de- creasing size of the herd. The tasks of pig rearing are distributed across farms and, in the main production basins, even across regions. Catalogue No: KS-SF-10-008-EN-N Issue date: 4 February 2010 (cid:2) DATABASES Agriculture Agriculture was one of the first sectors of the economy (following coal and steel) to receive the attention of European policymakers. Article 39 of the Treaty of Rome on the EEC (1957) set out the objectives for the first common agricultural policy (CAP); these were focused on in- creasing agricultural productivity as a way to ensure a fair standard of living for the agricultural community, stabilising markets and ensuring security of supply at affordable prices to consumers. As the primary objective of producing more food was realised, food surpluses accrued, distorting trade and raising environmental con- cerns. These were the principal drivers for changes in the CAP, a proc- K S EG1 000 1E NC _ 002.pdf 5 6 7/0 4 / 11 09: 1 7 ",
        "57 Catalogue ess that started in the early 1990s and has resulted in a change from support for production towards a market-oriented and a more envi- ronment-friendly and sustainable agriculture. Reforms have focused mainly on increasing the competitiveness of agriculture by reducing support prices and compensating farmers by the introduction of direct aid payments. A decisive step came in the 2003/04 CAP reforms with the decoupling of direct aids from production and a move to try to realign the CAP with consumer concerns. The scope of this latest reform of the CAP was widened with the introduction of a comprehensive rural develop- ment policy. Together these policies aim to encourage entrepreneurial behaviour so that farm managers can respond better to market signals, introduce new techniques and promote diversified activities such as rural crafts, food-processing facilities on farms, tourism, or afforestation, as well as promoting sustainable farming practices and various other rural devel- opment measures. Forestry After the enlargements of the EU in 2004 and 2007, the EU has a total area of forests and other wooded land of 177 million hectares, account- ing for about 42 % of its land area. Contrary to what is happening in other parts of the world, forest cover in the EU is slowly but steadily increasing at the rate of approximately 0.4 % per year, although the evolution can be quite different between regions. Forests are present in a huge variety of climatic, geographic, ecological and socioeconomic conditions. Ecologically, EU forests belong to nu- merous vegetation zones, ranging from the coastal plains to the Alpine zone, while socioeconomic management conditions vary from small family holdings to large estates belonging to vertically integrated com- panies. Fisheries Fish are a natural, biological, mobile (sometimes over wide distances) and renewable resource. No one can own fish until they have been caught and one set of fishermen impacts on others. For this reason, fish stocks continue to be regarded as a common resource, to be managed collectively. This calls for policies that regulate the amount of fishing, as well as the types of fishing techniques and gear used in fish capture, if this heritage is to be passed to future generations. The first common measures in the fishing sector date from 1970. They set rules for access to fishing grounds, markets and structures. All these measures became more significant when, in 1976, Member States fol- lowed an international movement and agreed to extend their rights to marine resources from 12 to 200 miles from their coasts. After years of difficult negotiations, the common fisheries policy (CFP), the EU\u2019s instrument for the management of fisheries and aquaculture, was born K S EG1 000 1E NC _ 002.pdf 57 7/0 4 / 11 09: 1 7 ",
        "58 EUROSTAT MINI-GUIDE 2011 in 1983. The EU has a CFP in order to manage fisheries for the benefit of both fishing communities and consumers, and for the protection of resources. Food: from farm to fork The object of food safety statistics is to provide a framework for the quantitative evaluation of data on the safety of products used for hu- man or animal consumption on the territory of the Member States, irrespective of whether these products are manufactured within the EU or imported. This domain provides access to various sets of statistics related to food products and collected from different statistical sources, already avail- able on Eurostat\u2019s website, and covering \u2018from farm to fork\u2019. Only statistics providing information on food products, the food sector and relevant for food safety purposes are included. As an example, only importers from countries outside the EU are presented. Also, priority has been given to presenting data in volume terms rather than in value. The domain also includes statistics on \u2018products with distinctive marks\u2019 such as products issued from organic farming and genetically modified organisms (GMOs). Agri-environmental indicators With about 40 % of the EU\u2019s land area being farmed, agriculture has a very important impact on the natural environment: (cid:2) Over the centuries, farming has created and maintained a variety of valuable semi-natural habitats on which a wide range of wildlife depend for their survival. (cid:2) Farming practices can have an adverse impact on natural resources, such as pollution of soil, water and air, fragmentation of habitats, and a loss of wildlife. This relationship between agriculture and the environment has to be taken into account when integrating environmental concerns and safeguards into the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP). In the CAP, emphasis is placed on reducing the risks of environmental degradation and enhancing the sustainability of agro-ecosystems through: (cid:2) Cross-compliance criteria on agricultural market measures \u2212 as a condition of receiving direct payments, farmers must comply with certain requirements, including some related to environmental protection.

In 2009, the deficit amounted to \u20ac 8.6 billion, considerably less than in the previous three years. The products most exported to Latin America by the EU were machinery and road vehicles whereas im- ports were dominated by vegetables and fruit (especially from Argentina and Brazil), feeding stuffs for animals, petroleum (mainly from Venezuela) and metalliferous ores (especially from Brazil). For the trade in services, a 14 % increase in the total volume was registered between 2007 and 2008 (to reach \u20ac 47.6 billion). The EU\u2019s surplus in the trade of services amounted to \u20ac 8.7 billion. In relative terms, the EU surplus was considerable with Venezuela. Foreign direct investment flows in the Latin American economies were sub- stantially reduced in 2008 (\u2013 43 % compared with 2007). Increases were noted for Mexico and Argentina but disinvestments occurred in Brazil.

EU-27 trade with South Africa changed dramatically from 2008 to 2009. Exports, which had fallen slightly in 2008, dropped by a further fifth in 2009; imports, which had risen steadily since 2003, fell by one third. Germany was the largest EU trading partner with South Africa. German exports to South Africa fell by 20 % and their imports by 26 % from 2008 to 2009, resulting in its total trade with South Africa fall- ing by \u20ac 2.6 billion.

Imports fell by more than exports, leading to a reduction in the overall trade deficit of over \u20ac 150 billion, almost 60 %. The EU-27 remained the largest player in the world in trade in goods in 2008, the latest year for which comparable data are available. The EU-27\u2019s exports of goods to the United States fell by more than the over- all average, but it remained by far the most important destination. However, exports to Russia, which had become the second largest trading partner for exports in 2008, fell by over one third between 2008 and 2009, putting Russia in fourth place behind Switzerland and China. China remained the largest source of EU-27 imports in 2009, recording a fall of 13 % since 2008, much lower than the overall fall of 23 %. In contrast, EU-27 imports from Russia, Norway, Japan and Brazil all fell by over one quarter. While all Member States recorded falls in both exports and imports in 2009, the reductions were par- ticularly marked in Greece, Lithuania, Bulgaria, Romania and Finland, all of which saw falls of over 30 % in total trade.

However, in spite of this performance, the EU trade deficit widened consistently until a slight reduction in 2008. Less than half of the Member States posted a positive trade balance with Brazil in 2008 and, of the eight major trade partners, five posted deficits in excess of \u20ac 1 billion; only one, Germany, posted a significant positive balance of \u20ac 1.7 bil- lion. For both imports and exports, only three Member States reported nega- tive growth rates from 2000 to 2008. However, the highest growth rates came from countries with low trade values. Imports of food and drink, as well as crude materials, posted the highest values for 2008 with more than half of total imports.

The Kyoto Protocol committed in- dustrialised countries to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions, with the EU agreeing to an 8 % decrease between 1990 and the period 2008\u201312. In December 2008, EU leaders approved a comprehensive package of emis- sion-cutting measures aimed at reducing greenhouse gases by at least 20 % by 2020 compared with 1990 levels. At the United Nations\u2019 Climate Change Conference in Copenhagen, countries agreed to the principle of capping the global temperature rise to 2 \u00b0C by committing to significant emission reductions. To follow up on these agreements and objectives, detailed emissions inventories have been established in Kyoto Protocol countries, based on commonly agreed rules. Official statistics, as collected by national statistical offices, constitute an essential input to these inventories. After a short overview on the principles of emissions calculations, this publication presents a selection of official European statistics with relevance for the cal- culation of greenhouse gas emissions. Topics covered include land use and agriculture, energy, business (industry and services), transport and waste. K S EG1 000 1E NC _ 002.pdf 6 9 7/0 4 / 11 09: 1 7 ",

        "72 EUROSTAT MINI-GUIDE 2011 Waste statistics regulation Currently the domain consists of two data sets: generation of waste and treatment of waste. The data set on the generation of waste has a break- down in waste categories and in the source of waste generation; the data set on the treatment of waste has a breakdown in the type of treatment, waste category and region. Water Statistics are presented about the water cycle (resources of surface and groundwater) and human influence and interference, such as: (cid:2) abstraction (withdrawal) of water from these resources and its use in the economy; (cid:2) wastewater treatment (infrastructure, treatment performance at various levels, generation and disposal of sewage sludge); (cid:2) discharge of pollutants from point and diffuse sources to natural waters. Environmental accounts Environmental protection expenditure is defined as the money spent on all purposeful activities directly aimed at the prevention, reduction and elimination of pollution or nuisances resulting from the produc- tion processes or consumption of goods and services. Excluded are activities that, while beneficial to the environment, primarily satisfy technical needs or health and safety requirements. Agriculture and environment In this section, data on consumption of pesticides, sales of pesticides, nitrogen balances and consumption of fertilisers are available. Two additional data collections cover the impact of specific economic sec- tors. The part on agriculture includes data on pesticides, fertilisers and organic farming; the part on transport covers various environmental aspects including transport efficiency and prices. The chapter on envi- ronmental protection expenditure delivers detailed data on private and public spending on the protection of the environment. Biodiversity This domain covers three sets of biodiversity indicators: protected area for biodiversity (habitats directive), protection of natural resources; common bird index; and fish catches from stocks outside of \u2018safe bio- logical limits\u2019. Main indicators \u2014 Energy statistics Seven selected energy indicators belonging to the major collection \u2018Structural indicators\u2019 and four indicators belonging to the collection \u2018Euro-indicators\u2019 are included.

Monthly data on crude oil, oil products, natural gas, electricity and solid fuels cover mainly the supply side. Energy statistics \u2014 Prices Half-yearly data are available on electricity and natural gas prices for industrial end-users as well as for households, together with pump prices of premium unleaded gasoline 95 RON and diesel oil, as well as prices of heating oil and residual fuel oil. Prices are provided without taxes, with VAT and with all taxes included in monetary units (euro, national currencies and purchasing power parities). Energy statistics \u2014 Heating degree-days Consumption of energy depends strongly on weather conditions. If the temperature decreases below a certain value, the \u2018heating threshold\u2019, more energy is consumed due to an increased need for space heating. Taking this into account, Eurostat launched a project aiming at the de- velopment and implementation of a common method for the climatic correction of final energy consumption for space-heating purposes in the 27 EU Member States. Temperature corrected energy consumption data will allow for correct interpretation of energy consumption trends, providing also a solid basis to design policy actions and to measure achievement of policy goals in the field of energy.

        "75 Catalogue DATA/STATISTICS IN FOCUS German regions lead European R & D \u2014 Issue number 35/200 (cid:116) 9 In 2005, there were 20 European regions that devoted 3 % or more of GDP to research and development. Germany scored highest, with eight of its regions among the top 20. However, regional disparities in R & D expenditure exist not only between countries, but also between regions of the same country, ranging from 0.21 percentage points between Irish regions to 5.2 percentage points between German regions. In the business enterprise sector (BES), re- gions with a high R & D intensity (more than 3 %) were mainly concentrated in Germany and in northern Europe (Sweden, Finland and the United King- dom). Praha (Czech Republic) was the region with the highest percentage of R & D personnel as a share of total employment, with 4.8 %. Germany had five regions in the top 20, making it the leading country in terms of R & D person- nel. Regional disparities also appeared when looking at R & D personnel as a share of total employment. More than 4 percentage points separated the top and bottom regions in the Czech Republic, while the gap between Irish regions was only 0.15 percentage points. Catalogue No: KS-SF-09-035-EN-N Issue date: 11 May 2009 Quality in the focus of innovation \u2014 Issue number 33/200 (cid:116) 9 This publication aims to analyse the relationship between patent activity and R & D personnel. According to the 2006 Community Innovation Survey (CIS 2006), participation in innovation activity differs widely across countries and economic sectors. The main focus of the CIS is placed on product and/or proc- ess innovators. The size of the enterprise seems to be a key factor in terms of innovation. This publication aims to shed light on why, at EU level, less than one third of small enterprises engaged in innovation activity introduced new or improved products to the market, whereas this was the case for close to half of large enterprises. On average, turnover from new or significantly improved (new-to-market) products accounted for 10 % of the total turnover of enterprises engaged in innovation activity. Cooperation does not seem to be a necessary precondition for enterprises to innovate. However, more than half of innovative enterprises were engaged in cooperation in their innovation activities in Cyprus, Finland, Lithuania and Slovenia.

        "76 EUROSTAT MINI-GUIDE 2011 (cid:116) China passes the EU in high-tech exports \u2014 Issue number 25/2009 The value of high-tech exports worldwide increased by an average of 5 % a year between 2001 and 2006. This increase was mostly due to the rise of Chinese exports in world trade. Although in 2005 the EU was the leader in high-tech exports, China took over the lead in 2006 followed by the United States, the EU-27 and Japan. At EU level, four countries make a significant contribution to the share of world exports in high-tech products: Germany is in front, fol- lowed by the United Kingdom, France and the Netherlands. In 2006, as in previous years, \u2018electronics\u2013telecommunication\u2019 accounted for the largest share of high-tech imports and exports, closely followed by \u2018computers\u2013office machines\u2019. Taken together, both groups accounted for 67 % of the world\u2019s high- tech trade. The aim of this issue is to present the world shares of high-tech trade, focusing in particular on high-tech trade by main product groups. Catalogue No: KS-SF-09-025-EN-N Issue date: 1 April 2009 (cid:2) DATABASES Research and development R & D indicators are often considered as a main driver for economic development, innovation and growth. This domain provides users with data concerning R & D expenditure and R & D personnel, broken down by the following institutional sectors: business enterprise, government, higher education, private non-profit and the total of all sectors. Data are compiled and broken down further using the guidelines laid out in the proposed standard practice for surveys of research and experimen- tal development, the \u2018Frascati manual\u2019, OECD, 2002. Community Innovation Survey This domain covers statistics on the number of enterprises having in- troduced new or improved products or processes, turnover of new and improved products, innovation expenditure, objectives and hampering factors for innovation in the business enterprise sector (all manufac- turing industries and several service industries). The Community In- novation Survey (CIS) is a survey on innovation activity in enterprises covering EU Member States, EU candidate countries, Iceland and Nor- way. All aggregations and indicators presented in this collection are based on data from the national CIS 2 and CIS 3 data collections. Data from the CIS 2 cover the period 1996\u201398, while CIS 3 data cover the period 1998\u20132000. K S EG1 000 1E NC _ 002.pdf 7 6 7/0 4 / 11 09: 1 7 ",
