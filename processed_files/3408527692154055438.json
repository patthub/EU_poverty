In parallel, the share of employment in the energy sector in total employment has remained broadly constant (from 1.3% to 1.4%) but is still more than twice the EU average (0.6% in 2012). Source: EUROSTAT \u2013 National Accounts According to EurObserv'ER, in 2013, the share of direct and indirect renewable energy related employment in total employment of the economy in Latvia was at about 0.69%, above the EU average of 0.53%. Source: European Commission, based on EurObserv'ER and EUROSTAT TRADE BALANCE OF ENERGY PRODUCTS The energy trade balance of Latvia is overall negative and around 5% of GDP. Like the EU average, the Latvian deficit is driven mostly by gas and oil import. Latvia has considerably reduced its current account deficit over the past decade. It went from a deficit of 20% of GDP in 2006 to 3% in 2014. The reduction was largely due to non-energy components, with energy trade deficit remaining stable around 5% of GDP. 0.0 1.0 2.0 3.0 4.0 2005 2012 LV EU27 Value added of energy sector % of gross value added (total economy) 0.0 0.4 0.8 1.2 1.6 2005 2012 LV EU27 Employment in energy sector % of total employment Towards an Energy Union Latvia ",

Energy Security, solidarity and trust ENERGY MIX The energy mix of Latvia differs broadly from the one of the EU-28, with the notable difference of a much higher share of renewables and much lower of solid fuels. Compared to 1995, the share of solid fuels and petroleum products decreased (from 6.1% to 1.7% and from 42.7 to 32.4% of gross inland energy consumption-primary products, respectively), while the share of renewable energy sharply increased (by about 9 percentage points). The share of gases increased from 22.8% to 27.7% of the gross inland consumption-primary products. Gross inland energy consumption in 2013 Source: European Commission, based on EUROSTAT IMPORT DEPENDENCY Latvia experiences an above EU average import dependency 1 ratio for all fossil fuels. Import dependency is particularly significant for petroleum products and natural gas. Latvia imports all its gas from Russia 2 . Consequently, the country supplier concentration index is very high and Latvia experiences a significant energy trade deficit, expressed in percentage of GDP. 1 Note: A dependency rate in excess of 100% indicates that energy products have been stocked. 2 Top non-EU gas suppliers table is based on EUROSTAT data.

A fully-integrated internal energy market INTERCONNECTIONS Interconnection capacity for electricity in 2014 Source: European Commission based on ENTSO-E scenario outlook and adequacy forecast 2014 Note: Reference to 2030 target is based on October 2014 European Council conclusions stating that \"the Commission will also report regularly to the European Council with the objective of arriving at a 15% target by 2030\" The interconnection capacity for electricity with the European power transmission networks was only 4% in 2013 for the three Baltic States \u2013 Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania \u2013 taken as one entity. With the start of operation of Estlink2 in 2014, their level of interconnection substantially increased to around 10% and with the implementation of current and new Projects of Common Interest (PCI), the interconnection capacity will overachieve the 15%-target for 2030. In some cases, the Latvian system for electricity generation is dependent on external energy suppliers (mainly gas supply for cogeneration plants). The three Baltic States agreed in the first quarter of 2015 on a common strategic goal: de-synchronisation from IPS/UPS and the synchronisation of their power systems with the Continental European Network in order to end the isolation of the Baltic States, reduce the energy dependence from third countries and have access to cheaper electricity resources. The project of synchronization is included as a key infrastructure project in the European Energy Security Strategy as well as is highlighted as one of the key energy priority areas of the Baltic Energy Market Interconnection Plan (BEMIP). Several other PCIs have been recognized as important for Latvia: the 3rd electricity interconnection with Estonia, internal reinforcement of the Kurzeme ring and projects to reinforce transmission capacity in the North-South direction. As regards gas, Latvia still depends on Russian supplies. Since the Klaipeda LNG terminal in Lithuania started its commercial operation at the beginning of 2015, gas from Klaipeda could become a viable source for alternative gas supplies if sufficient infrastructure and the right economic conditions regarding the gas price are in place. The building of the Poland \u2013 Lithuania gas interconnector 'GIPL' would help ending the gas isolation of the Baltic States.

Modernisation and enhancement of the Incukalns Underground Gas Storage is important for the efficient operation of the joint East-Baltic regional gas market. ELECTRICITY AND GAS MARKETS Market concentration index for power generation (left) and gas supply (right) (2013) (Herfindahl index \u2013 10000 means monopoly) Sources: European Commission based on ESTAT, CEER and Platts Power Vision Sources:E S TAT and European Commission Calculations Concentration on power generation and gas supply markets is extremely high. Prices on the wholesale market in the Latvian-Lithuanian price zone remain on average higher than in Estonia and Finland and less stable. The Estonian-Latvian connection is still heavily congested. By end-2015 the situation is likely to improve as Nordbalt, the Swedish-Lithuanian interconnector, will be completed. Full electricity market opening took place on 1 January 2015. Some 0.5% of households had switched their electricity provider at the beginning of 2015, the switching rate for non-household customers was 15% at the end of 2013. On the retail gas market, Latvijas G\u0101ze JSC remains the only player. Switching supplier is therefore not an option. Latvia's emergent gas market exemption expired in 2014 and the respective market opening legislation is being gradually adopted in view of achieving full compliance with the 3 rd Energy Package (in particular ownership unbundling of gas transmission and storage system operator by 3 April 2017). Domestic retail prices are below EU average for both electricity and gas. 3 A wide-scale roll-out of electricity smart meters is being carried out. Latvian consumer assessment of the performance of their retail electricity market in 2013 was more than 3 points below the EU average, corresponding to 21th place EU-wide. The retail gas market is assessed somewhat above the EU average. 4 CONTRIBUTION OF ENERGY TO CONSUMER PRICE EVOLUTION Inflation of consumer prices has decreased importantly in Latvia compared to the pre-crisis period. In Latvia and in the rest of the Euro area, oil prices have declined in 2014, driving overall inflation at historically low levels. 3 Source: Eurostat (http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/Energy_price_statistics) 4 10th Consumer Markets Scoreboard (June 2014), http://ec.europa.eu/consumers/consumer_evidence/consumer_scoreboards/10_edition/index_en.htm ",

The national target for primary energy was set at a level which allows for an increase in energy consumption. Even if Latvia's current primary energy consumption (4.4 Mtoe in 2013) is below its 2020 target, it could continue its current efforts regarding energy efficiency to keep the primary energy consumption at this level or increase it only slightly that it will reach its 2020 target even if the economy continues to grow in the next five years. -5 05 10 15 20 2005 2007 2009 2011 2013 % i n c r e a s e o n a y e a r e a r l i e r Non Energy Energy All items Latvia : Price evolution & the contribution of energy prices -10123 4 2005 2007 2009 2011 2013 % i n c r e a s e o n a y e a r e a r l i e r Non Energy Energy All items EA : Price evolution & the contribution of energy prices ",

With a renewable energy share of 37.1% in 2013, Latvia is on track to reach its 40% target in 2020. However, the 3.1% share of renewable energy in transport (2013) was well below the necessary progress to reach the 10% renewable energy target in transport by 2020. Legal uncertainty surrounding the renewable energy support system delays investments in this sector. GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSION INDICATORS \u2022 In 2012 the share of emissions from the energy sector is significantly lower than the EU average as the result of the high use of renewables in the energy mix. \u2022 Transport and agriculture account for the largest proportions of Latvia's overall greenhouse gas emissions (even though in the case of transport vehicle registration tax is linked to CO 2 emissions, new cars in Latvia had the highest CO 2 emission per km in the EU in 2013). \u2022 The share of non-ETS emissions in Latvia is 76% of total GHG emissions in 2013, being much higher than the EU average. \u2022 Latvia has the lowest GHG emissions per capita of the EU in 2013, being almost 40% lower than the EU indicator. \u2022 In 2014 the revenues from the auctioning of ETS allowances amounted to EUR 10.2 million.

This document has been supplemented in 2013 by the Latvian Energy Long-term Strategy 2030 (\"Strategy 2030\") which includes energy- related targets and planned policy measures, though amendments in declared 2030 indicative targets could result from forthcoming Energy development guidelines for 2015- 2020. The Ministry of Economics plans to transpose the goals and principles set by the Strategy into subsequent laws, regulations and planning documents. Latvia is also preparing a low-carbon development strategy. \uf0b7 The Environmental Policy Guideline 2014-2020 is a medium-term planning document, which inter alia sets the policy targets on climate change mitigation and defines the necessary measures to solve the stated problems within the GHG emission reduction. \uf0b7 One of the objectives of the Latvian Strategy 2030 is the enhancement of energy security. The Strategy foresees that this should be achieved by ensuring accessible and stable supply of energy, by diversifying sources and suppliers and by developing infrastructure. NATIONAL TARGETS, especially for 2030 Objective, 2030-2050 Targets Comments GHG reduction Yes 45% GHG emission reduction in 2030 compared to 1990 levels; reduction of GHG emission intensity of the economy to 1.13 by 2020 and to 1.07 by 2030 Renewable energy Partly (indicative objective) Indicative objective of 50% share of renewables in final energy consumption by 2030 has been mentioned in the Latvian Energy Long-term Strategy 2030 (strategic guidelines for policy makers), mainly involving the heating, electricity and transport sector, however this target has not yet been agreed at political level. Energy Efficiency / savings Partly (indicative and housing only) Similarly as for renewable energy, the Strategy 2030 indicates a potential for achieving a reduction of energy intensity of manufacturing industry and average annual heat consumption in housing and public buildings, which could be brought down to 100kWh/m2 by 2030.

        "11 Towards an Energy Union - Latvia 7. Regional cooperation EU Member States cooperation in the energy sector in the Baltic Sea region has brought many benefits for the participating countries. The work and achievements within the framework of the Baltic Energy Market Interconnection Plan (BEMIP) agreed in June 2009 and with subsequent amendments in 2011 and 2013 respectively proved that enhanced regional cooperation can be a catalyst for positive developments both in energy infrastructure projects or market related aspects. During the first half of 2015 the regional cooperation framework in the Baltic Sea Region was reformed by bringing together two initiatives \u2013 BEMIP and EU Strategy for Baltic Sea Region Policy Area Energy (EUSBSR PA Energy) in order to improve the macro regional cooperation. The MoU on reinforced BEMIP was signed on 8 June 2015 with the overall goal to ensure further market and system integration of the Baltic States into European Continental network and ensure its full market functioning also strengthening the organisational structure of the BEMIP. The new MoU and the joint BEMIP / EUSBSR PA Energy Action Plan also foresees regional cooperation in key energy policy areas, including electricity and gas markets, security of supply, power generation, renewable energy and energy efficiency. The TEN-E Regulation and the Projects of Common Interest (PCI) process have also been addressing the need for strong regional cooperation through the establishment of priority corridors and the activity of the Regional Groups. For the Baltic Sea region, the work is undertaken within the respective BEMIP Regional Groups for electricity and gas. Additionally, Regional Gas Market Coordination Group was established on February 12, 2015 to facilitate creation of the effectively functioning regional gas market, consisting from the representatives of the ministries responsible for energy policy, the national regulatory authorities of the energy sector and the operators of the key gas infrastructure in the Baltic States and Finland. 8. Cohesion policy contribution The EU Cohesion policy provides for important investment possibilities to implement energy policy objectives in Latvia which will be complemented by national public and private co-financing, aiming at optimal leverage. It also ensures integrated territorial solutions to challenges by supporting capacity building, technical assistance and territorial cooperation, including the Baltic Sea Region macro-regional strategy in which Latvia takes part. Internal Energy Market: Over 2014-2020, EU Cohesion Policy will invest some EUR 41 million in smart energy infrastructure in relation to local gas and electricity connections for enterprises in industrial zones and connections of degraded territories to main networks of engineering communications of the city. Energy efficiency: Over 2014-2020, EU Cohesion Policy will invest some EUR 338 million in energy efficiency improvements in public and residential buildings and in enterprises, as well as in high- efficiency cogeneration and district heating in Latvia. A further estimated EUR 651 million will be invested in supporting the move towards an energy-efficient, decarbonised transport sector. These investments are expected to contribute to around 14 000 households with improved energy consumption classification and a decrease of around 50 100 000 kWh per year of decreased primary energy consumption of public buildings, as well as to around 1000 km of reconstructed or upgraded railway lines and 10 km of new or improved tram lines.

        "12 Towards an Energy Union - Latvia Decarbonisation: Overall, the EU Cohesion Policy investments in Latvia over 2014-2020 are expected to contribute to an estimated annual decrease of GHG of around 63 000 tonnes of CO2eq. Over 2014-2020, EU Cohesion Policy will invest some EUR 27 million in renewable energy in Latvia. These investments are expected to contribute to around 40 MW of additional capacity of renewable energy production. Research, Innovation and Competitiveness: Over 2014-2020, EU Cohesion Policy will invest significantly in R&I and in SME competitiveness in Latvia. This will be based on the national strategy for smart specialisation. For Latvia, the strategy includes a focus on smart energetics. At this stage, the allocations foreseen for investments in R&I and adoption of low-carbon technologies in Latvia are not specified, but should become available in line with the evolving content of the smart specialisation strategy.
