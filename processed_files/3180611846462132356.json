        "DIRECTORATE GENERAL FOR INTERNAL POLICIES POLICY DEPARTMENT A: ECONOMIC AND SCIENTIFIC POLICY Contribution of the Internal Market and Consumer Protection to Growth STUDY Abstract This study first outlines the economic benefits of the EU single market and consumer protection from a general perspective. It then presents key achievements of the Europe 2020 flagship initiatives in deepening the single market and improving consumer protection, as well as remaining barriers. Based on evidence collected with regard to potentially significant economic benefits (including untapped potential in areas beyond the explicit scope of the flagship initiatives), it advocates further leveraging of single market and consumer protection policies in the Europe 2020 strategy to reignite growth.

        "Contribution of the Internal Market and Consumer Protection to Growth PE 518.762 11 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY Background This report presents the results of a study commissioned by the European Parliament\u2019s Committee on Internal Market and Consumer Protection (IMCO) and carried out by Civic Consulting between July and September 2014. The study concerns achievements in the area of the single market and consumer protection and related contributions to economic growth in the European Union, with a specific focus on the flagship initiatives of the Europe 2020 strategy. A general perspective: contributions of the single market and consumer protection & empowerment to growth \uf0b7 The benefits of a single market for growth can be broadly subsumed into four separate categories: economies of scale; stronger competition; lower transaction costs; and better allocation of resources. In addition to benefits for growth, single market integration also induces other benefits, such as increased consumer choice and better quality, and innovative goods and services. Nonetheless, the single market may induce additional costs, including administrative costs, adjustment or transition costs, a widening in regional and distributional disparities, and an increase in environmental degradation. \uf0b7 Many studies have tried to quantify the overall impact of single market integration on economic growth. One of the most-often quoted ex-ante studies is the Cecchini report, commissioned in 1988 by the European Commission. It estimated an impact of 4.25-6.5% increase in EU GDP for the EU-12. More recent studies assessing the effects of the elimination of intra-EU goods and services barriers have subsequently made even higher estimates, indicating that EU GDP could increase by 14% as early as 2020 , depending on the assumptions made. \uf0b7 However, ex-post analyses have since measured the observed impact of the single market on growth and have generally estimated the real gains to be smaller. Several factors may explain the differences noted between ex-ante and ex-post estimates identified, including the absence of a clear control group or counterfactual; difficulty in predicting the dramatic transformative effects of market liberalisation; difficulty in accounting for dynamic effects of integration related to gradual changes in productivity and efficiency; and other potential biases leading to an overestimation of the predicted gains of single market integration. \uf0b7 Improving consumer protection and empowerment can also have positive effects on growth, through several channels including: consumers\u2019 increased confidence and trust; consumers\u2019 better decision-making and assertion of rights; lower consumer financial detriment from problems; and as a signal of high standards for third countries trading with the EU. However, while there is a significant body of literature confirming these benefits, little empirical evidence has been identified to support them. Nonetheless, a major EU-wide survey in 2010 concluded that total ex-post consumer detriment \u2013 based on financial losses reported from problems experienced \u2013 was equivalent to 0.4% of EU GDP . ",
        "Policy Department A: Economic and Scientific Policy PE 518.762 12 The Single Market and consumer protection & empowerment through the lens of the Europe 2020 flagship initiatives \uf0b7 A larger number of achievements have been made relevant to the single market and consumer protection within the scope of \u2018A Digital Agenda for Europe\u2019, relating to electronic communications, e-commerce/online services and data protection. Major legislation proposed includes the Connected Continent Regulation and Data Protection Reform Package. Evidence suggests that completing the digital single market has significant potential to contribute to growth, with one estimate indicating a possible 2-4% increase in EU GDP by 2020 . \uf0b7 Relevant aspects of \u2018Innovation Union\u2019 relate to breaking down barriers to innovation, improving cross-border access to finance for SMEs and encouraging cross-border mobility of researchers, which may each have beneficial effects on growth. Key achievements include the establishment of a unitary patent system, expected to reduce costs of applying for a patent valid EU-wide by 80% . \uf0b7 Learning and employment mobility of young people constitute the key areas of relevance for the single market under \u2018Youth on the Move\u2019, for which available evidence indicates a potential positive impact on the EU economy. A major achievement is the regulation establishing Erasmus+, which combines the EU\u2019s education, training, youth and sport schemes into one integrated programme. \uf0b7 Significant achievements have been made within the scope of \u2018Resource-efficient Europe\u2019 relevant for the single market and consumer protection & empowerment in the energy and transport sectors. Major legislation adopted in the energy sector includes the Third Energy Package, while for several transport modes fresh single- market initiatives have been proposed, accompanied by a well-developed framework for passenger rights. Significant growth potential is evident: according to estimates, liberalisation of gas and electricity markets could raise EU GDP by 0.6-0.8% over 2011-2020 , while supply- and demand-side effects of air transport liberalisation could, respectively, raise EU GDP by 1.8% and 1.3% over 2005-2025 . \uf0b7 Relevant achievements as part of \u2018An industrial policy for the globalisation era\u2019 relate mainly to industrial products, as well as specific areas such as combating late payments, business services, and entrepreneurship. Major legislation proposed includes the Product Safety and Market Surveillance Package. Addressing the remaining barriers to intra-EU trade in goods could be highly beneficial; one estimate shows that full integration of goods markets could result in a 2.2-8.8% increase in EU GDP in the long run . \uf0b7 Labour mobility is the main aspect relevant to the single market in \u2018An agenda for new skills and jobs\u2019. Major legislation adopted includes the revised Professional Qualifications Directive. Research suggests labour mobility stimulates growth: one study finds the immigration of four million people from eight of the countries acceding to the EU in 2004 could lead to a long-run increase of 0.6% in EU GDP . \uf0b7 Finally, actions under \u2018European Platform against Poverty and Social Exclusion\u2019 relevant to the single market relate primarily to social enterprise, which may also induce growth. A key achievement was the launch of the Social Business Initiative. The tables below summarise key policy and legislative achievements during the seventh legislature in the areas of the single market and consumer protection & empowerment by flagship initiative. The status at the time of writing \u2013 adopted or proposed \u2013 is also indicated. ",

        "Contribution of the Internal Market and Consumer Protection to Growth PE 518.762 15 The Single Market and consumer protection & empowerment beyond the flagship initiatives \uf0b7 The services sector has been highlighted by the Commission as one of a few key sectors in which further deepening of the single market could lead to substantial gains in terms of growth. The Services Directive, adopted in 2006, constitutes the main horizontal internal market-related legislation in place for the sector. It is estimated that full implementation of the Services Directive by Member States in only a selection of the sectors covered by it could increase EU GDP by 2.6% in the long run . \uf0b7 Regarding financial services, the Commission has acted in developing a substantial regulatory reform agenda in response to the financial crisis. Legislative achievements at the retail level relevant for the single market include the Mortgage Credit Directive (MCD) and the Payment Accounts Directive (PAD). According to one estimate, fully integrated financial markets could induce a rise in EU GDP of 1.1% in the long run . \uf0b7 The main existing legislation on public procurement was revised during the 7th legislature as part of a comprehensive modernisation package, which could contribute to addressing barriers to a single procurement market. If savings already achieved for procurement contracts published at EU level could be achieved for all public procurement, EU GDP could increase by 0.5% , according to one estimate. \uf0b7 The Mutual Recognition Regulation is the main legislative achievement serving to uphold the principle of mutual recognition. According to the impact assessment that accompanied the initial proposal, successfully ensuring the perfect operation of mutual recognition inside the EU could produce a maximum possible one-off increase in EU GDP of 1.8% . \uf0b7 Taxation is also a tool that can contribute to furthering the single market. Among other things, policy action during the 7th legislature has aimed at revising the VAT system. One study has estimated that implementation of the VAT Directive could potentially lead to an increase of 1% in EU GDP , with 0.3% of GDP growth lost due to inefficient implementation. \uf0b7 Competition policy aims to ensure a level-playing field that can facilitate the provision of goods and services across borders and thus strengthen the single market. An achievement of the 7th legislature relates to the ongoing modernisation of state aid policy. In addition, competition decisions taken by the Commission in 2011 concerning horizontal mergers are estimated to have led to consumer savings of EUR 4 billion . \uf0b7 Similarly, an open trade policy is an important complement to furthering the single market, and also holds potential for a major contribution to growth. An agreement to lower barriers between the US and the EU could boost the EU\u2019s GDP per capita by between 2% and 3.5% , although strong concerns exist regarding the impact of such an agreement on consumer protection. The table below presents key results from the evidence presented in Sections 3 and 4 selected to illustrate both potential contributions to growth as well as potential savings resulting from actions to deepen the single market. Results are presented by areas, distinguishing between those covered/not explicitly or comprehensively covered by the flagship initiatives. ",

        "Policy Department A: Economic and Scientific Policy PE 518.762 18 Conclusions and recommendations \uf0b7 Progress has been made in furthering the single market and improving consumer protection and empowerment through a range of legislative and non-legislative achievements across all flagship initiatives. Evidence collected shows in particular in several areas a comprehensive legal framework for deepening the single market and/or improving consumer protection and empowerment has already been adopted or has been proposed by the Commission. Such is the case, for example, regarding the energy sector, the transport sector, the digital sector, or industrial products. \uf0b7 Nonetheless, achievements have been more numerous and wide-ranging in specific flagship initiatives, and in some areas substantial barriers to single market integration or deficiencies in consumer protection remain. \uf0b7 Research demonstrates that potentially significant increases in GDP or in efficiency/savings could be achieved through actions relating to furthering the single market and improving consumer protection in the sectors covered by the flagship initiatives. Specifically, some of the largest contributions to growth/savings could be achieved in furthering the single market in the goods market, digital markets, energy markets and transport markets. \uf0b7 While the coverage of the flagship initiatives of areas relevant for the single market and consumer protection can be considered relatively comprehensive, several others do not fall explicitly or comprehensively within the scope of the flagship initiatives (in terms of policy actions to deepen the single market or improve consumer protection). These include the services sectors covered by the Services Directive, retail financial services, public procurement and concessions, mutual recognition, taxation and the business environment, as well as linkages to other relevant policy areas such as competition policy and trade policy. Evidence suggests that significant contributions to economic growth as well as efficiency gains/savings could also be achieved if relevant policy actions to further the single market and/or consumer protection were implemented in these areas. \uf0b7 On the basis of these conclusions as well as observations made during the course of the research, key recommendations for future policymaking needs relate to: 1. Reigniting growth through the single market and consumer protection 2. Refining the focus of the Europe 2020 strategy and its flagship initiatives on areas with untapped growth potential 3. Improving the clarity in the coverage and presentation of the flagship initiatives and their synergies with other ongoing initiatives 4.

        "Contribution of the Internal Market and Consumer Protection to Growth PE 518.762 21 1. INTRODUCTION This report presents the results of a study commissioned by the European Parliament\u2019s Committee on Internal Market and Consumer Protection (IMCO) and carried out by Civic Consulting between July and September 2014. The study concerns achievements in the area of the single market and consumer protection and related contributions to economic growth in the European Union, with a specific focus on the flagship initiatives of the Europe 2020 strategy. Preliminary results were presented to the IMCO Committee on 25 September 2014. Evidence was collected on the basis of a comprehensive literature and document review comprising over 1000 documents; individual or group interviews with more than 30 experts from all Commission DGs relevant for the Europe 2020 flagship initiatives, industry, consumer organisations, and research institutes/universities; and case studies on achievements relevant for the single market or consumer protection and related contributions to growth under the Europe 2020 flagship initiatives. The report is structured as follows: \uf0b7 Section 2 presents a general perspective on contributions of the single market and consumer protection to growth; \uf0b7 Section 3 presents key achievements relevant for the single market and consumer protection and related contributions to growth in each of the Europe 2020 flagship initiatives, as well as relevant horizontal single market or consumer protection initiatives; \uf0b7 Section 4 presents key achievements relevant for the single market and consumer protection and related contributions to growth beyond the Europe 2020 flagship initiatives; and \uf0b7 Section 5 presents conclusions and recommendations. In the Annex we present an overview of achievements and contributions to growth by flagship initiative, as well as a list of references contained in this report and a list of organisations consulted.

        "Policy Department A: Economic and Scientific Policy PE 518.762 22 2. A GENERAL PERSPECTIVE: CONTRIBUTIONS OF THE SINGLE MARKET AND CONSUMER PROTECTION & EMPOWERMENT TO GROWTH KEY FINDINGS \uf0b7 The benefits of a single market for growth can be broadly subsumed into four separate categories: economies of scale; stronger competition; lower transaction costs; and better allocation of resources. In addition to benefits for growth, single market integration also induces other benefits, such as increased consumer choice and better quality, and innovative goods and services. Nonetheless, the single market may induce additional costs, including administrative costs, adjustment or transition costs, a widening in regional and distributional disparities, and an increase in environmental degradation. \uf0b7 Many studies have tried to quantify the overall impact of single market integration on economic growth. One of the most-often quoted ex-ante studies is the Cecchini report, commissioned in 1988 by the European Commission. It estimated an impact of 4.25-6.5% increase in EU GDP for the EU-12. More recent studies assessing the effects of the elimination of intra-EU goods and services barriers have subsequently made even higher estimates, indicating that EU GDP could increase by 14% as early as 2020, depending on the assumptions made. \uf0b7 However, ex-post analyses have since measured the observed impact of the single market on growth and have generally estimated the real gains to be smaller. Several factors may explain the differences noted between ex-ante and ex-post estimates identified, including the absence of a clear control group or counterfactual; difficulty in predicting the dramatic transformative effects of market liberalisation; difficulty in accounting for dynamic effects of integration related to gradual changes in productivity and efficiency; and other potential biases leading to an overestimation of the predicted gains of single market integration. \uf0b7 Improving consumer protection and empowerment can also have positive effects on growth, through several channels including: consumers\u2019 increased confidence and trust; consumers\u2019 better decision-making and assertion of rights; lower consumer financial detriment from problems; and as a signal of high standards for third countries trading with the EU. However, while there is a significant body of literature confirming these benefits, little empirical evidence has been identified to support them. Nonetheless, a major EU-wide survey in 2010 concluded that total ex-post consumer detriment \u2013 based on financial losses reported from problems experienced \u2013 was equivalent to 0.4% of EU GDP. In this section we first present the cornerstones of single market integration along with some key indicators, which illustrate overall both the progress that has been made and the barriers that still remain. Next, we present the benefits of single market integration for growth, based on economic theory and the evidence collected, followed by the benefits of consumer protection and empowerment for growth.

        "Contribution of the Internal Market and Consumer Protection to Growth PE 518.762 23 2.1. The cornerstones of single market integration and associated indicators The single market constitutes the foundation of the European Union, as embodied in its founding treaties, the Treaty on European Union, signed in Maastricht in 1992, 1 and the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, originally signed in Rome in 1958. 2 It can be defined both as the market made up of the constituent 28 Member States, with a combined GDP of more than EUR 13 trillion and their 507 million citizens, interacting variously as individuals, consumers, businesses and governments, as well as the European project aiming to eliminate market barriers stemming from national borders. The elimination of these barriers relates to the upholding of the four freedoms or cornerstones of the single market enshrined in the treaties: the free movement of people, goods, services and capital. The degree to which free movement according to the four freedoms has been achieved is measurable through the use of specific indicators. Such indicators thereby help to indicate the extent to which the single market has become a reality, as well as the extent to which barriers remain. The following is a list of indicators based on the four freedoms for which data is readily available, these include: 3 \uf0b7 Cross-border trade in goods and services (e.g. value of goods or services exported to other Member States as a proportion of GDP); \uf0b7 Cross-border capital flows (e.g. intra-EU foreign direct investment, intra-EU bank loans); \uf0b7 Cross-border labour mobility (e.g. the number of EU citizens working in another Member State than their own); or \uf0b7 Price convergence between countries (i.e. the variation of prices for the same goods and services between countries). The first three indicators are based on a relatively direct measurement of the four freedoms. The last is based on a more indirect measurement of single market integration: as markets become more integrated, price convergence is expected as a result of a drop in higher prices thanks to competition, or a rise in lower prices thanks to \u2018catch-up\u2019 effects, or both. In the table below we present examples of quantification of these indicators over various time periods. In each case we provide both examples of how single market integration in the EU has progressed, but also of the existence of barriers still to be overcome. 1 In particular Article 3, Paragraph 3. 2 In particular Article 21, Title I, 26, 28, 29, Title IV, Title V, Articles 114, 115. 3 For a discussion on the appropriateness of these indicators and various others to measure single market integration in the literature, see the recent Centre for European Policy Studies, Indicators for Measuring the Performance of the Single Market - Building the Single Market Pillar of the European Semester, 2014.

The benefits of a single market in economic theory In theory, the benefits of a single market for growth can be broadly subsumed into four separate categories: 16 \uf0b7 Economies of scale : The access to a bigger market facilitated by a lowering of barriers increases the sales potential of companies; in addition, if companies benefit from increasing economies of scale, companies can produce larger quantities more cost-efficiently, thus contributing to growth. \uf0b7 Stronger competition : The elimination of cross-border barriers generally lowers barriers to market entry in a given Member State for firms from other Member States, which increases the competitive pressure on firms already operating in that Member State. Greater competition induces both greater productive and dynamic efficiency and thus growth, as firms are induced to produce goods and services at lower cost due to price competition, while at the same time innovate. \uf0b7 Lower transaction costs : The harmonisation of production and quality standards enables goods and services to be marketed across borders at lower expense, owing to e.g. less administrative burden from border formalities. Cross-border financial transactions are also less costly when financial markets are integrated, and particularly when Member States share a common currency (as is the case in the Eurozone). Firms can then invest the savings from reduced transaction costs towards more productive ends, thus contributing to growth. \uf0b7 Better allocation of resources: The lowering of barriers to labour and capital mobility allow companies to have access to a much larger labour-force and financing possibilities, respectively. As a result, resources flow more efficiently to where they are most needed, contributing to greater allocative efficiency and thus growth. In addition to these benefits for growth, it is important to note that single market integration also induces other benefits, including: \uf0b7 Increased consumer choice : In a truly single market, consumers would have access to goods and services from other Member States in the same way as they do in their country of residence, and thus their overall choice of goods and services is greatly increased. \uf0b7 Better quality, innovative goods and services : The greater competition fostered by a single market induces companies to provide better quality and innovative goods and services to consumers to get ahead of their competitors. Nonetheless, the single market may induce additional costs, such as: \uf0b7 Administrative costs : New harmonisation legislation may induce administrative costs, relating both to companies\u2019 need to adapt and comply with the legislation and public authorities\u2019 need to enforce it. Administrative costs also apply to technical standards, for example, which need to be harmonised in a single market. \uf0b7 Adjustment or transition costs : Companies accustomed to only providing goods or services in a specific Member State that are subsequently confronted with competition from firms in other Member States may undergo costs in adjusting to 16 These benefits are listed in many studies on economic integration. See e.g. Baldwin, Richard, and Anthony Venables, \u201cRegional Economic Integration,\u201d Handbook of International Economics, Vol. 3, 1995 for an overview. ",
        "Contribution of the Internal Market and Consumer Protection to Growth PE 518.762 27 the larger market. This could in particular involve reallocation of labour resources inducing job losses in the short term, e.g. in non-competitive industries. \uf0b7 Widening in regional and distributional disparities: The opening up to competition and reallocation of resources across borders may induce some regions to become more competitive and efficient, while other regions may stagnate. Over time, snowball effects may cause these impacts to exacerbate, leading to longer term socio-economic distributional consequences. \uf0b7 Increase in environmental degradation: As the intensity of movement of goods, services and labour across borders increases in an increasingly integrated market, detrimental environmental effects may occur, e.g. resulting from increases in greenhouse gas emissions from greater volumes of transport. 2.2.2. The evidence of the EU single market\u2019s contributions to growth Many studies have tried to quantify the overall impact of single market integration on economic growth. One of the most-often quoted ex-ante studies is the Cecchini report, commissioned in 1988 by the European Commission. It estimated an impact of 4.25-6.5% increase in EU GDP for the EU-12, as a result of effects of the Single Market Programme of 1992 in the long run. More recent studies assessing the effects of an elimination of intra-EU goods and services barriers have subsequently made even higher estimates. In the table below we outline the estimates of the some of the main ex-ante studies in the literature of the impact of the single market on growth in the EU. For each study, we indicate: \uf0b7 The driver of the impact measured in the study; \uf0b7 The quantitative estimation of the impact on EU GDP, including the time period for which the estimate is made; \uf0b7 Further information on the methodology, where relevant; and \uf0b7 The source.

That is, it is very difficult to know what would have happened in the absence of the Single Market programme. As a result, it is difficult to isolate its impacts alone from those arising from simultaneous developments, e.g. the impact of globalisation. Methods exist to construct such a counterfactual or control group, however they involve the use of very specific assumptions that make comparisons between studies difficult. 17 Another caveat is that the technological and structural changes that tend to occur at the same time as market liberalisation can have particularly dramatic transformative effects, such that disentangling the pure effect of the single market from other simultaneous effects related to e.g. gains from technological productivity improvements is difficult. An example is the internal market liberalisation of the telecommunications market in the 1990s, which has since seen a complete overhaul in infrastructure, equipment and services. 18 A further problem is that often ex-post estimates focus on the static effects of single market integration on growth (e.g. from immediate savings). The dynamic effects of integration, related to the gradual changes in productivity and efficiency owing to reallocation of capital and labour and innovation over time, are both harder to measure and require the appropriate hindsight to properly appreciate, as the concrete reductions in barriers stemming from legislation may take much longer to materialise. This is also related to the possibility of a critical mass/threshold or tipping point: reduction in barriers to cross- border movement of goods and services and harmonisation of legislation may not lead to the expected market integration until a specific threshold of businesses and consumers sell and purchase goods and services across borders respectively, at which point \u2018snowball\u2019 effects allow for the large predicted economic gains to be achieved. Finally, it is important to note a potential bias leading to an overestimation of the gains of single market integration in ex-ante studies. First, what is modelled is often a situation of perfect market integration, which can inevitably lead to high estimated impacts on growth. However a range of factors, such as imperfect interpretation, implementation and enforcement of harmonisation legislation, are likely to impede the achievement of a perfect level of integration, and lead to lower gains in reality (and particularly if effects are not observed until a critical mass/threshold is attained, as highlighted above). Second, it is plausible that many commissioned studies have a desired aim at the outset of finding significant positive impacts of single market integration on growth; while the potential bias induced is unlikely to be significant, it should be taken into account nonetheless. Despite the above caveats that shed light on the reasons for differences in the predicted and observed benefits, the latter are nonetheless significant. To put these figures into perspective, it is estimated that of the 2% and 1.1% increase in the EU-27\u2019s GDP over the 2001-2005 and 2006-2011 periods, growth in capital and labour productivity are estimated to have contributed 0.3 and -0.1 percentage points respectively. 19 Overall therefore, the 17 Without differentiating between ex-post and ex-ante methods, these include comparing developments in the EU to those in the US, or comparing highly productive/efficient EU Member States to worse performing ones, and estimating based on extrapolation what level of growth would be achieved respectively if the same level of integration applied in the EU as the US, or if all Member States were as productive/efficient as the best performers (as cross-country productivity levels are expected to converge in a true single market). This methodology is applied in particular in a recent related study commissioned by the Commission: London Economics/PWC, Study on \u201cThe Cost of Non-Europe: The Untapped Potential of the European Single Market\u201d, 2013. 18 As pointed out in Pelkmans, Jacques, The Case for \u201cmore Single Market,\u201d 2011. 19 van Ark, Bart, Vivian ChenChen1, Bert Colijn, Kirsten Jaeger, Wim Overmeer, and Marcel Timmer, Recent Changes in Europe\u2019s Competitive Landscape and Medium-Term Perspectives: How the Sources of Demand and Supply Are Shaping Up, European Economy, Economic Papers 485, April 2013, 2013. The negative contribution of productivity growth observed in 2006-2011 is to be understood as the effects of a decrease in productivity. ",
        "Contribution of the Internal Market and Consumer Protection to Growth PE 518.762 31 weight of the evidence in the many studies identified above is such that a strong case can nonetheless be made for the potential for the single market to contribute to growth. This conclusion is further explored in Section 5 on conclusions and recommendations. 2.3. The benefits of consumer protection and empowerment for economic growth As with the deepening of the single market, improving consumer protection and empowerment can also have positive effects on growth. In theory, this can occur through several channels: 20 \uf0b7 Increased confidence and trust : Consumers are more inclined to make purchases if they have confidence and trust that their rights and health will be protected, particularly across borders. In addition, making cross-border purchases further opens up the market to foreign suppliers of goods and services, which stimulates competition and thus growth. \uf0b7 Better decision-making and assertion of rights : If consumers are better informed about markets and their rights, they are both more able to make decisions about selecting and/or switching to the best goods and services available to them, and are more able to complain and seek redress if they are unsatisfied with them. This forces suppliers to become more efficient and innovate, and thus contributes to growth. \uf0b7 Lower financial detriment from problems : If, thanks to high levels of consumer protection and empowerment, consumers spend less money and time dealing with problems encountered with suppliers than they otherwise would, they may instead spend the money and time freed up on other goods and services (or on switching to similar goods and services). This additional expenditure could thus contribute to growth. \uf0b7 Signal of high standards for third countries : If consumers from third countries are aware of the high standards of consumer protection and empowerment in the EU, and thus of the quality and safety of goods and services purchased in the EU, they may be more likely to purchase them compared to those produced elsewhere. This would result in a boost in EU exports of those goods and services and thus contributes to growth. 21 While there is a significant body of literature confirming the theoretical benefits outlined above, little empirical evidence has been identified in the course of this study to support the theory. 22 This may be because it is in practice very difficult to disentangle other effects that are conducive to growth. Nonetheless, a major EU-wide survey in 2010 concluded that total ex-post consumer detriment \u2013 based on financial losses reported from problems experienced \u2013 was equivalent to 0.4% of EU GDP. 23 This indicates that significant savings could be made if the appropriate measures are taken to reduce consumer detriment by improving consumer protection and empowerment, and thus induce a positive impact on growth. Results from this section are further explored in Section 5 containing conclusions and recommendations. 20 For an overview of the theoretical benefits of consumer protection/empowerment for growth, see BIS, Empowered Consumers and Growth: Literature Review \u2013 Final Report, by ICF-GHK, 2012. 21 In line with findings from Porter, Michael, The Competitive Advantage of Nations, 1990. 22 A finding that is corroborated by ICF - GHK, Consumer Rights and Economic Growth, 2013.

THE SINGLE MARKET AND CONSUMER PROTECTION & EMPOWERMENT THROUGH THE LENS OF THE EUROPE 2020 FLAGSHIP INITIATIVES KEY FINDINGS \uf0b7 A large number of achievements have been made relevant to the single market and consumer protection within the scope of \u2018A Digital Agenda for Europe\u2019, relating to electronic communications, e-commerce/online services and data protection. Major legislation proposed includes the Connected Continent Regulation and Data Protection Reform Package. Evidence suggests that completing the digital single market has significant potential to contribute to growth, with one estimate indicating a possible 2- 4% increase in EU GDP by 2020. \uf0b7 Relevant aspects of \u2018Innovation Union\u2019 relate to breaking down barriers to innovation, improving cross-border access to finance for SMEs and encouraging cross-border mobility of researchers, which may each have beneficial effects on growth. Key achievements include the establishment of a unitary patent system, which is expected to reduce costs of applying for a patent valid EU-wide by 80%. \uf0b7 Learning and employment mobility of young people constitute the key areas of relevance for the single market under \u2018Youth on the Move\u2019, for which available evidence indicates a potential positive impact on the EU economy. A major achievement is the regulation establishing Erasmus+, which combines the EU\u2019s education, training, youth and sport schemes into one integrated programme. \uf0b7 Significant achievements have been made within the scope of \u2018Resource-efficient Europe\u2019 relevant for the single market and consumer protection and empowerment in the energy and transport sectors. Major legislation adopted in the energy sector includes the Third Energy Package, while for several transport modes fresh single- market initiatives have been proposed, accompanied by a well-developed framework for passenger rights. Significant growth potential is also evident: according to estimates, liberalisation of gas and electricity markets could raise EU GDP by 0.6-0.8% over 2011-2020, while supply- and demand-side effects of air transport liberalisation could, respectively, raise EU GDP by 1.8% and 1.3% over 2005-2025. \uf0b7 Relevant achievements as part of \u2018An industrial policy for the globalisation era\u2019 relate mainly to industrial products, as well as specific areas such as combating late payments, business services, and entrepreneurship. Major legislation proposed includes the Product Safety and Market Surveillance Package. Addressing the remaining barriers to intra-EU trade in goods could be highly beneficial; one estimate shows that full integration of goods markets could result in a 2.2-8.8% increase in EU GDP in the long run. \uf0b7 Labour mobility is the main aspect relevant to the single market in \u2018An agenda for new skills and jobs\u2019. Major legislation adopted includes the revised Professional Qualifications Directive. Research suggests labour mobility stimulates growth: one study finds the immigration of four million people from eight of the countries acceding to the EU in 2004 could lead to a long-run increase of 0.6% in EU GDP. \uf0b7 Finally, actions under \u2018European Platform against Poverty and Social Exclusion\u2019 relevant to the single market relate primarily to social enterprise, which may also induce growth. A key achievement was the launch of the Social Business Initiative. ",

Overview of flagship initiative and progress in achieving Europe 2020 objectives The flagship initiative \u2018A Digital Agenda for Europe\u2019 aims to achieve the wider deployment and more effective use of digital technologies in order to encourage economic growth and improve the daily life of European citizens and businesses. The ICT sector is viewed as having enormous economic potential, already accounting for 5% of Europe\u2019s GDP and a significant share of its productivity growth (20% directly from the ICT sector and 30% from ICT investments in other sectors). 24 However, major barriers to the effective development of the digital economy have been identified, including fragmented digital markets, lack of interoperability, insufficient innovation and investment, lack of trust in digital networks and a deficit of digital literacy. The flagship initiative aims to overcome these obstacles and thereby properly equip the EU to take advantage of the opportunities offered by new digital technologies, which is regarded as particularly important in view of the gap that has opened up between the EU and many of its economic partners in this sector. 25 The initiative is structured into seven pillars, namely the Digital Single Market; interoperability and standards; trust and security; fast and ultra-fast Internet access; research and innovation; enhancing digital literacy, skills and inclusion; and ICT-enabled benefits for EU society. 24 European Commission, COM (2010) 245 Final - A Digital Agenda for Europe, 2010, p. 4. 25 For example, as of 2010 the penetration of fibre-based high-speed networks in the EU was only 1%, while in Japan it was 12% and in South Korea 15%.

In order to measure the progress of the Digital Agenda, a number of key performance targets were adopted. 27 Much progress has been made towards achieving these, as explained in the Digital Agenda Scoreboard 2014. In particular it notes that: \uf0b7 Internet usage stood at 72% in 2013, up from 60% in 2009; \uf0b7 The share of the population buying online had increased to 47% by 2013, up ten percentage points since before the start of the Digital Agenda; \uf0b7 By 2013, 62% of the population had access to high-speed broadband, which is more than double the figure from 2010 (29%). Nonetheless, progress in some areas has not been sufficient. Specifically: \uf0b7 The use of eGovernment by citizens grew by only four percentage points over the four years between 2009 and 2013, and is stagnating in some countries; \uf0b7 Only 14% of SMEs were selling online in 2012, an increase of just two percentage points in four years; \uf0b7 Public investment in ICT research and development is not growing fast enough to achieve the targeted doubling by 2020; \uf0b7 Cross-border shopping has grown, reaching 12% by 2013 (up from 8% in 2009), but the growth rate has not been fast enough to reach the goal of 20% by 2015. 28 3.1.2.

        "Contribution of the Internal Market and Consumer Protection to Growth PE 518.762 35 Electronic communications Key achievements in furthering the single market The creation of a single market for electronic communications is seen as an essential part of the Digital Agenda flagship initiative. The existence of barriers within the Single Market limits the economic potential of the electronic communications sector and brings detriment for consumers and businesses, for example through high mobile roaming costs or lack of regulatory clarity. However, much work has been undertaken to overcome these obstacles. The regulatory framework was significantly revised in 2009 with the Telecoms Package, which included the Better Regulation and Citizens\u2019 Rights Directives, as well as two new regulations to cut mobile roaming charges and create a body of European regulators for electronic communications (BEREC). A subsequent regulation was introduced in 2012 to further limit roaming charges. In September 2013 the Commission announced more legislative action, proposing a \u2018Regulation for a Connected Continent\u2019. The proposal aims, among other things, to simplify and reduce regulation, standardise wholesale products, achieve more co-ordination of spectrum allocation and eliminate roaming charges. There are indications that legislation to further the single market for electronic communications has already had positive results. According to the Commission, EU legislation in this sector has led to a 30% reduction in overall telecommunication prices during the past decade. 30 The figure below displays the development of prices for standalone broadband offers between 2007 and 2014. As it shows, the median price of offers with a speed of 30 to 100 Mbps has decreased from EUR 70 to EUR 34 during this period.

The regulation from 2009 cut roaming prices for voices calls (which had initially been limited in Regulation 717/2007) and introduced caps on SMS charges. Prices for voice calls were limited once again by the 2012 regulation, which also extended the price cap on roaming charges to data usage. 34 Adoption of the Telecoms Package 35 The Telecoms Package was adopted to promote efficient competition, innovation and investment in new infrastructures. Among other things it provides the Commission with greater powers in regard to competition remedies for the telecom markets and encourages investment in next generation access (NGA) networks. While promoting competition in the sector, it aims to ensure that any access obligation takes appropriate account of the risk incurred by the investing undertakings. Measures are also included to improve the management of radio spectrum and make it effectively available for wireless broadband services in regions where building a new fibre infrastructure is too costly. Additionally, the package establishes a Body of European Regulators for Electronic Communications, BEREC, to ensure more transparent and effective co-operation between regulators. It also provides national telecoms regulators with greater independence from political interference. 36 Source: Civic Consulting, based on sources indicated in table. Nonetheless, the European communications market remains fragmented along national lines. Despite the existence of 200 operators across the EU, none of these is present in more than half of Member States (as of September 2013), with operators tending to focus on their home market. 37 Significant barriers to cross-border provision of services by 31 Outlined in European Commission, COM (2013) 627 final - A proposal for a regulation laying down measures concerning the European single market for electronic communications and to achieve a Connected Continent, and amending Directives 2002/20/EC, 2002/21/EC and 2002/22/EC and Regulations No 1211/2009 and No 531/2012, 2013. 32 http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_MEMO-13-779_en.htm. 33 Regulation No 544/2009 and Regulation No. 531/2012. 34 http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2009:167:0012:0023:EN:PDF; http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:32012R0531&from=EN. 35 Consisting of Better Regulation Directive 2009/140/EC, the Citizens' Rights Directive 2009/136/EC and the Regulation on BEREC No 1211/2009.

        "Contribution of the Internal Market and Consumer Protection to Growth PE 518.762 37 electronic communications operators still exist, such as divergences in operating costs, for example in regard to radio spectrum (although co-ordination of spectrum could be improved by the Connected Continent Regulation). The continued fragmentation of the market brings with it major disadvantages, for example by discouraging investment in new infrastructure (such as high-speed networks). Moreover, lack of competition has negative effects on consumers, who suffer from less choice and lower quality services. Although electronic communication prices have decreased, there remains significant price divergence between Member States. For example, in 2014, the median price for a standalone broadband offer with a download speed between 30 and 100 Mbps was EUR 22 in Lithuania, but was EUR 102 in Malta. 38 While the Commission\u2019s proposal for a Connected Continent Regulation aims to reduce fragmentation, it avoids carrying out a major reform of the regulatory framework \u2013 including in regard to the supervision of national markets \u2013 so as not to cause disruption for operators who wish to maintain a national focus. 39 It also refrains from creating a system for EU-wide allocation of wireless spectrum, although it contains provisions to improve co-ordination. A recent cost of non-Europe report assessed that the proposal, if accepted, would improve integration considerably, but would probably not succeed in creating a genuine single market for electronic communications. 40 Key achievements in improving consumer protection & empowerment The amendments made to the regulatory framework within the scope of the Telecoms Package (see above) also included changes in consumer protection regulation. The Better Regulation and Citizens\u2019 Rights Directives both altered consumer rights provisions, specifically through the amendments to the original Framework Directive of 2002 and the Universal Services and Privacy and Electronic Communication Directives. Changes to consumer protection regulation in this period included the introduction of new rights in the areas of information transparency, switching and number portability. Moreover, the proposal for a Connected Continent Regulation also contains provisions to strengthen consumers\u2019 rights in the sphere of electronic communications. Among other things these address and improve contractual information requirements, the transparency and comparability of information provided by the operator, switching rights, cross-border dispute resolution procedures and the provision of facilities to monitor consumption and avoid unexpectedly high bills. The proposal also contains provisions regarding net neutrality, although some stakeholders have doubts regarding how effective these will be. 41 The table below describes key legislative/policy achievements under the 7 th legislature relevant for consumer protection and empowerment in the electronic communications sector, selected on the basis of a review of relevant literature (including key EU policy documents), as well as interviews with academic experts and stakeholders (including the relevant Commission officials). 38 European Commission, Digital Agenda Scoreboard: Broadband Markets, 2014, p. 26. 39 European Commission, COM (2013) 627 Final - Proposal for a Connected Continent Regulation, 2013, p. 9. 40 European Parliamentary Research Service, The Cost of Non-Europe in the Single Market II - Services, 2014, pp. 61-62. 41 See for example: European Data Protection Supervisor, Opinion of the European Data Protection Supervisor on the Proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council Laying Down Measures Concerning the European Single Market for Electronic Communications and to Achieve a Connected Continent, 2013; http://www.beuc.org/publications/beuc-x-2014-020_gbe_telecoms_single_market_proposal-key_issues.pdf.

A new internet freedom provision should protect citizens\u2019 rights relating to internet access, while national telecoms authorities now have the powers to set minimum quality levels for network transmission services so as to promote \u2018net neutrality\u2019 and \u2018net freedoms\u2019 for European citizens. Further provisions relate to protection against personal data breaches and spam, as well as better access to the emergency services from new technologies. 43 Proposal for a Connected Continent Regulation 44 Relevant measures proposed include those to protect net neutrality, such as a ban on the blocking and throttling of internet content. Consumers would be allowed to check whether the actual speed of their internet connection matches that which they have paid for, and to step out of the contract if this is not the case. In addition, the right to a plain language contract, greater switching rights, the right to a 12-month contract and the right to have emails forwarded to a new address after switching provider are all foreseen. Consumers will also benefit from the plans to eliminate roaming charges. 45 Source: Civic Consulting, based on sources indicated in table. The introduction of legislation improving consumer protection and empowerment in the electronic communications sector appears to have already had a positive impact in some areas. According to the 10 th edition of the Consumer Markets Scoreboard, switching rates were higher for telecommunications than for other services, with 23% of those surveyed having switched their mobile telephone provider and 19% their internet provider. 46 The sector also received an above-average score for comparability. A consumer survey carried out in 2012 noted that those respondents who had switched reported saving on average EUR 14.7 per month as a result. 47 Nonetheless, of all the market sectors surveyed in the 10th Consumer Markets Scoreboard, telecommunications had the highest rate of problems and complaints, as well as relatively low scores for trust, choice of providers and overall satisfaction. 48 Moreover, a third of respondents to the consumer survey of 2012 reported experiencing problems with their internet provider in the preceding 12 months. 49 42 Directive 2009/140/EC and Directive 2009/136/EC. 43 http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_MEMO-09-513_en.htm?locale=en. 44 Outlined in COM (2013) 627 final. 45 http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_IP-13-828_en.htm. 46 European Commission, SWD (2014) 212 Final - Consumer Markets Scoreboard - Making Markets Work for Consumers, 2014, p. 39. 47 Civic Consulting, Consumer Market Study on the Functioning of the Market for Internet Access and Provision from a Consumer Perspective, 2012, p. 10. 48 SWD (2014) 212 Final - Consumer Markets Scoreboard - Making Markets Work for Consumers, 2014, p. 22. 49 Civic Consulting, Consumer Market Study on the Functioning of the Market for Internet Access and Provision from a Consumer Perspective, 2012, p. 5.

However, the European Consumer Organisation (BEUC) has expressed concerns with some of the provisions included in the proposal, regarding inter alia contract termination and penalty fees for switching, as well as the means foreseen to eliminate roaming charges. It also points to further issues that have not yet been addressed, arguing that legislation is necessary to ensure that equipment (e.g. modems, routers) cannot be locked into a specific provider, to enable consumers to accumulate unused credit (minutes, text messages and data allowances), to regulate Deep Packet Inspection (DPI) and to include the right to withdrawal in pre-contractual information requirements. 50 Furthermore, there remain doubts as to how effectively the regulation would protect net neutrality, as mentioned above. E-commerce and online services Key achievements in furthering the single market The Digital Agenda flagship initiative also focuses on encouraging the development of online commerce and services, with the expansion of the Single Market in this area seen as vital. Much legislation has been introduced to address the remaining obstacles, which include payment difficulties, regulatory barriers and lack of consumer trust in cross-border transactions. The adoption of the Single Euro Payments Area (SEPA) Regulation in 2012, for example, established a single market for retail payments within the euro area, and in 2013 the Commission announced a proposal for new rules on Payment Services. 51 In addition, the creation a Common European Sales Law has been proposed to simplify the regulatory environment and cut transaction costs, while a regulation on electronic identification and trust services has been adopted with the aim of increasing trust in online transactions. 52 A further issue is the opening up of access to content and allowing it to flow freely across borders, which has been furthered by the adoption of the Directive on Collective Management of Copyright and the Directive on Orphan Works. 53 Other areas where progress has been made are cloud computing, with the Commission announcing its cloud computing strategy in 2012, 54 and e-invoicing for public procurement, with a new directive adopted in 2014. 55 The table below describes in further detail key legislative/policy achievements under the 7th legislature relevant for the Single Market in the e-commerce and online service sectors, selected on the basis of a review of relevant literature (including key EU policy documents), as well as interviews with academic experts and stakeholders (including the relevant Commission officials). 50 BEUC, Telecoms Single Market \u2013 Achieving a Connected Continent, 2013; BEUC, Telecoms Single Market \u2013 Key Priorities for BEUC, 2014. 51 Corresponds to key action 8 of the Single Market Act II \u2018Support online services by making payment services in the EU more efficient\u2019.

Among other things this enables people with a bank account in the euro area to use their debit card and set up direct debits in any other country within in it. 57 Adoption of Regulation on Cross-Border Payments in the Community 58 Eliminates differences in charges for cross-border and national payments in euro. The legislation applies to all electronically processed payments in euro in all Member States, including credit transfers, direct debits, withdrawals from cash machines, payments by means of debit and credit cards, and money remittance. It was amended by the SEPA Regulation in 2012. 59 Proposal for a new directive on Payment Services 60 A revised Payment Services Directive (PSD) would facilitate and render more secure the use of low-cost internet payment services by including within its scope new so-called payment initiation services (services that operate between the merchant and the purchaser\u2019s bank, allowing for cheap and efficient electronic payments without the use of a credit card). It also proposes to promote the emergence of new players and the development of innovative mobile and internet payments. A regulation on interchange fees, combined with the revised PSD, would introduce maximum levels of interchange fees for transactions based on consumer debit and credit cards, and ban surcharges on these types of cards. 61 Proposal for a Common European Sales Law 62 Would give traders the choice to sell their products to citizens in another Member State on the basis of a single set of contract law rules, which would stand as an alternative alongside the national contract law of each Member State. Parties to a cross-border sales contract anywhere in the EU would be able to choose to apply the Common European Sales Law. 63 Adoption of Regulation on electronic identification and trust services 64 Creates a European internal market for electronic Trust Services (eTS) by ensuring that they will work across borders and have the same legal status as traditional paper-based processes. Enhanced legal certainty and the mutual recognition of eTS across the EU should create a predictable regulatory environment to enable secure and seamless electronic interactions between businesses and citizens. This will increase the effectiveness of online services, eBusiness and e-commerce in the EU. 65 56 Regulation No 260/2012; amended by Regulation No 248/2014 . 57 See http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/payments/sepa/index_en.htm for more details. 58 Regulation No 924/2009. 59 See http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/payments/crossborder/index_en.htm for more details. 60 Outlined in COM(2013) 547 final and COM (2013) 550 final. 61 See http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_IP-13-730_en.htm for more details. 62 Outlined in COM(2011) 635 final. 63 See http://ec.europa.eu/justice/contract/cesl/index_en.htm for more details. 64 Regulation No 910/2014. 65 See http://ec.europa.eu/digital-agenda/en/trust-services-and-eid for more details.

The new rules will also ease the multi-territorial licensing by collective management organisations of authors\u2019 rights in musical works for online use. 67 Adoption of Directive on Orphan Works 68 Sets out common rules on the digitisation and online display of so-called orphan works. Orphan works are part of the collections held by European libraries that might remain untouched without common rules to make their digitisation and online display legally possible. 69 Roadmap for completing the Single Market for parcel delivery 70 Sets out the most important issues concerning the incomplete single market for parcel delivery, with the aim of ensuring tangible improvements as soon as possible. Its three main objectives are increased transparency and information, improved availability, quality and affordability of delivery solutions, and enhanced complaint handling and redress mechanisms. 71 Adoption of Directive on electronic invoicing in public procurement 72 Aims to facilitate the use of e-invoicing in Europe by removing market barriers resulting from insufficient interoperability between e-invoicing systems and setting out rules for the reception of e-invoices by the public sector. Specifically, the directive calls for the development of a European standard for e-invoicing, and obliges all contracting authorities and contracting entities across the EU to receive and process e-invoices complying with the future standard. 73 Adoption of revised public procurement directives 74 Introduces a number of simplified rules and procedures, as well as broadening the possibilities for negotiation. The documentation required is reduced, notably through the compulsory acceptance of self-declarations from bidders (through a standardised European Single Procurement Document). The mandatory use of electronic communication in public procurement applies from September 2018. 75 Source: Civic Consulting, based on sources indicated in table. An indication that legislation in the e-commerce and online services sector may have proven successful in boosting online commerce is the fact that 47% of the EU\u2019s population was shopping online (both domestically and cross-border) by 2013. 76 This represents an increase of ten percentage points since the Digital Agenda\u2019s inception, and it is predicted that the target of 50% by 2015 should be reached. However, as shown by the graph below, cross-border online shopping is significantly lagging behind domestic e-commerce.

Indeed, it is considered possible that the introduction of an optional Common European Sales Law, which would create an additional layer of legislation, may add to confusion for consumers. 80 In regard to the eID Regulation, one gap identified relates to the lack of a (voluntary) European eID scheme for legal persons, although it should be noted that barriers to the development of legal signatures (including for legal persons) are considered primarily caused by technical and practical implementation issues. 81 Furthermore, a recent study on the cost of non-Europe in the Digital Single Market considered a major gap in the Commission\u2019s cloud computing strategy to be a lack of proposals for legislation. It noted in particular legal uncertainty in regard to cloud computing contracts, which deters businesses and consumers from making use of cloud computing, and there are doubts as to whether the Commission\u2019s strategy will sufficiently deal with this situation. 82 77 Eurostat: isoc_ec_ibuy. 78 TNS Political & Social / European Commission, Flash Eurobarometer 359: Retailers\u2019 Attitudes Towards Cross- Border Trade and Consumer Protection, 2013, p. 5. 79 Ibid., p. 26. 80 European Parliamentary Research Service / GHK, The Cost of Non- Europe in the Single Market III - Digital Single Market, 2014, p. 38. 81 Ibid., p. 56, p. 66. 82 Ibid., pp. 48-50.

        "Contribution of the Internal Market and Consumer Protection to Growth PE 518.762 43 In regard to payment services, a considerable amount of fragmentation continues to exist. However, the above-mentioned study considered that the implementation of SEPA and the adoption of the proposal for a new directive on payment services would contribute significantly towards closing these gaps. Remaining barriers were considered to be primarily non-legislative, relating more to informational and implementation issues, and resulting from variation in business practices between Member States 83 (elsewhere gaps relating to lack of technical standardisation have also been stressed). 84 Likewise, the study could not identify any specific legislative gaps in regard to postal and parcel delivery services. Instead it highlighted lack of knowledge among consumers and e-retailers regarding the availability of various delivery services and options. 85 Nonetheless, implementation of existing legislation appears to be an issue. Key achievements in improving consumer protection and empowerment Recent legislation regarding online consumer rights has focused on transparency of information and the right to return unwanted goods. In 2011 the Consumer Rights Directive was adopted, with the legislation entering into force in June 2014. This introduced a range of improved consumer rights relevant for e-commerce and online services, including an extension of the right of withdrawal period to 14 days, an elimination of surcharges for credit card use and new provisions to increase price transparency and protect consumers against hidden costs. To help ensure its uniform and consistent application, the Commission also published an accompanying guidance document. 86 In addition to the Consumer Rights Directive, consumers should also profit from the introduction of more general legislation on the single market for e-commerce and online services (as described in the previous sub- section). These rules are expected to provide consumers with cheaper and more secure payment methods, better quality parcel delivery and increased access to content, as well as improved protection and more legal certainty when shopping cross-border. Furthermore, legislation has been adopted aiming to improve the provision of dispute resolution mechanisms, 87 while the Commission\u2019s Recommendation on Collective Redress sets out a series of common, non-binding principles for collective redress mechanisms to enable consumers to more effectively protect their rights in the digital environment. The strengthening of consumer protection/empowerment is likely to encourage the growth of e-commerce, in particular cross-border, and the online services sector, which in turn will bring consumers benefits in terms of increased choice. According to a survey carried out in 2010, 44% of Europeans are discouraged from making cross-border purchases within the EU as the result of uncertainty about their rights. 88 Another survey, conducted in 2012, established that only 36% of European consumers feel confident about making a purchase from a vendor based in another EU country, compared to 59% who feel confident about purchasing from a domestic vendor. 89 There are indications that more harmonised legislation could play a role in countering this lack of confidence, as 31% of consumers 83 European Parliamentary Research Service / GHK, The Cost of Non- Europe in the Single Market III - Digital Single Market, 2014, p. 58-61, p. 74. 84 European Commission, COM (2011) 941 final \u2013 Towards an integrated European market for card, internet and mobile payments, 2011. 85 Ibid., pp. 75-76. 86 See http://ec.europa.eu/justice/consumer-marketing/files/crd_guidance_en.pdf. The document attempts to achieve a uniform and consistent implementation of the Consumer Rights Directive. To this end, it provides guidance on the directive's key concepts and provisions. It also includes practical examples that show how the directive should work. 87 This corresponds to one of the actions foreseen by the Single Market Act I in relation to consumer rights. 88 The Gallup Organisation / European Commission, Flash Eurobarometer 299a: Attitudes towards Cross- Border Trade and Consumer Protection - Analytical Report, 2011, p. 5. 89 TNS Political & Social / European Commission, Flash Eurobarometer 358 - Consumer Attitudes Towards Cross- Border Trade and Consumer Protection, 2013, p. 5.

While an almost equally large number (29%) would be less willing to do so, there was a much clearer preference for EU-wide legislation among respondents who had already made a cross-border purchase in the previous twelve months: 46% would be more willing, while only 12% would be less so. 90 In regard to remaining gaps, it is worth highlighting some issues which remain unclear despite the adoption and recent entering into force of the Consumer Rights Directive. For example, although it introduces new provisions regarding digital content (in particular pre- contractual information requirements), a lack of clarity has been perceived regarding the right of consumers to redress after purchasing digital content that they consider to be inadequate. 91 Another gap relates to transactions that take place between consumers on online auction sites. While the directive extended the right of withdrawal to include online auctions, this only applies if the product has been purchased from a professional seller, but not if the product was purchased from another consumer. 92 The table below describes key achievements under the 7 th legislature in further detail, selected on the basis of a review of relevant literature (including key EU policy documents), as well as interviews with academic experts and stakeholders (including the relevant Commission officials).

This includes laying down information requirements for distance and off-premises contracts (in regard to digital content this refers particularly to information about functionality and interoperability). Furthermore, the legislation should eliminate hidden costs by ensuring that consumers are adequately informed about what they are purchasing and its total price (e.g. banning pre-ticked boxes). It also introduces a range of new rights in regard to returning unwanted items, such as extending the right of withdrawal period to 14 days. In addition, it eliminates surcharges for credit card payments. 94 Proposal for initiatives to protect consumers in the area of online gambling 95 Aims to protect consumers of online gambling services. In particular it has the goal of drawing consumers away from potentially harmful offers, protecting vulnerable groups (such as minors) and preventing addiction. Among other things the proposal aims at establishing a common set of principles, in regard to issues such as age verification, no credit policies and complaint handling. 96 90 The Gallup Organisation/ European Commission, Flash Eurobarometer 299a: Attitudes towards Cross- Border Trade and Consumer Protection - Analytical Report, 2011, p. 12. 91 European Parliamentary Research Service / GHK, The Cost of Non- Europe in the Single Market III - Digital Single Market, 2014, p. 36. 92 European Parliamentary Research Service / GHK, The Cost of Non- Europe in the Single Market V - Consumer Acquis, 2014, p. 21. 93 Directive 2011/83/EC. 94 http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32011L0083&rid=1. 95 As outlined in COM (2012) 596 final and SWD (2012) 345 final.

Both pieces of legislation contain provisions to ensure that consumers are well-informed about the existence of dispute resolution mechanisms. 98 Proposal for a new directive on Payment Services 99 Would protect consumers against fraud and payment abuses. In particular, in cases of unauthorised card payments consumers may only have to pay a small sum (up to max. EUR 50). In addition, consumers would gain new rights in regard to transferring money outside the EU and paying in non-EU currencies. 100 Adoption of Regulation on Cross-Border Payments in the Community 101 Requires Member States to establish out-of-court complaint and redress procedures in case of disputes between consumers and service providers. National authorities are required to be designated or created by Member States, and to co-operate closely to solve cross-border disputes. 102 Adoption of Collective Redress Recommendation 103 Sets out a series of common, non-binding principles for collective redress mechanisms in the Member States so that citizens and companies can enforce the rights granted to them under EU law where these have been infringed. National redress mechanisms should be available in different areas where EU law grants rights to citizens and companies, notably in consumer protection, competition, environment protection and financial services. 104 Proposal for a Common European Sales Law 105 Would offer consumers a choice of remedies in case of a defective product, giving them the option of a replacement, a repair or a price reduction. This would apply even several months after the purchase. In addition, the legislation would require that consumers give their consent to a contract based on the Common European Sales Law. Information notices in their own language would ensure that they are well informed about their rights. 106 Source: Civic Consulting, based on sources indicated in table.

Moreover, the current fragmentation of European data protection regulation has been identified as a source of additional burden on European businesses that sustains legal uncertainty. In order to address these problems, the Commission announced a reform of the current data protection framework in 2012, proposing a new regulation and directive. These will create a single set of rules on data protection throughout the EU, as well as introducing provisions to give consumers more control over their data. In addition, proposals for a directive on network and information security were announced in 2013. The table below provides further detail on these achievements, which were selected on the basis of a review of relevant literature (including key EU policy documents), as well as interviews with academic experts and stakeholders (including the relevant Commission officials). Table 12: Key legislative achievements under the 7th legislature in regard to data protection and security Achievement Key aspects relevant to single market and consumer protection & empowerment Proposal for a General Data Protection Regulation 108 and a Police and Criminal Justice Data Protection Directive 109 Proposes to update and modernise the 1995 Data Protection Directive. The legislation would create a single set of rules on data protection throughout the EU, harmonising the current patchwork of national regulations, and allow organisations based in the EU to only deal with one single supervisory authority, even when operating in several Member States. This should create savings for businesses by cutting red tape and improve consumer trust by providing a strong and simplified data protection framework. New consumer rights would include a \u2018right to be forgotten\u2019 and improved data portability, enabling consumers to more easily access their personal data and transfer it from one service provider to another. The new rules would apply also for data that is processed abroad, as long the company handling it is active in the European market and offers their services to citizens of the EU. Additionally, the legislation would require companies to inform the national supervisory authority of any serious data breaches. The directive in the package would lay down general data protection rules for police and judicial cooperation in criminal matters, applicable for both domestic and cross-border transfers of data. 110 Proposal for a Directive concerning measures to ensure a high common level of network and information security across the Union 111 Would require Member States to adopt a network and information security (NIS) strategy and designate a national NIS competent authority with adequate resources to prevent, handle and respond to NIS risks and incident. It would also create a co-operation mechanism among Member States and the Commission to share early warnings on risks and incidents through a secure infrastructure, as well as to organise regular peer reviews. In addition, operators of critical infrastructures in some sectors (financial services, transport, energy, and health), enablers of information society services and public administrations would be required to adopt risk management practices and report major security incidents on their core services. 112 Source: Civic Consulting, based on sources indicated in table. 107 TNS Opinion & Social / European Commission, Special Eurobarometer 359: Attitudes on Data Protection and Electronic Identity in the European Union, 2011, p. 2. 108 Outlined in COM (2012) 11 final. 109 Outlined in COM (2012) 10 final. 110 http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_IP-12-46_en.htm. 111 Outlined in COM (2013) 48 final. 112 http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_IP-13-94_en.htm.

        "Contribution of the Internal Market and Consumer Protection to Growth PE 518.762 47 3.1.3. Evidence of impacts on economic growth of actions relevant for the single market or consumer protection In this section we present the evidence collected concerning assessments of impacts on economic growth of actions in areas related to the flagship initiative \u2018A Digital Agenda for Europe\u2019 and relevant for the single market or consumer protection and empowerment. 113 The evidence collected refers variously to impacts on increases in GDP itself as well as factors that are considered to be conducive to economic growth, such as efficiency gains, savings and increases in employment. The collection of evidence is based on an analytical approach combining a comprehensive literature review and interviews, which served to identify and categorise relevant impacts. Results are detailed in the table on the following pages. Evidence suggests that the single-market and consumer protection/empowerment related actions in the digital sector can make a very significant contribution to economic growth. Indeed, a number of ex-ante studies estimate that the completion of a digital single market could potentially contribute several percentage points to the EU\u2019s GDP in the long term. One study estimates that completing the digital single market could lead to a 4% increase in GDP by 2020. Moreover, there is evidence that policy action in the digital sector has already acted as a boost to economic growth in the EU: one study estimates that the adoption of the GSM standard in the EU contributed an additional 0.46% of GDP annually over the period 1995-2003. However, another study has estimated that the potential impact of closing the digital single market could amount only to an increase of 0.4% in the EU\u2019s GDP by 2020, (although this estimate is based on gaps identified in a limited number of areas, specifically in regard to cloud computing, parcel delivery and payment services). Other studies refer to a range of specific actions in the digital sector that would be conducive to economic growth, such as increasing the EU\u2019s ICT capital stock (could increase GDP by 5% in total) and introducing policy action to encourage the growth of cloud computing (potentially increasing the EU\u2019s GDP by EUR 583 billion between 2015 and 2020). In addition to GDP growth as such, studies also point to considerable savings that could be made. In particular, consumers could potentially save EUR 204.5 billion annually due to the growth of e-commerce and removal of single market barriers. Further opening up of national markets (leading to increased competition) could create welfare gains of EUR 27-55 billion per year thanks to lower prices and more investment. The widespread adoption of e-invoicing and the creation of SEPA could also bring significant savings \u2013 EUR 238 billion over a six year period and annual savings of EUR 21.9 billion, respectively. There are also indications that actions within the scope of the Digital Agenda could boost employment, with one study estimating that policy initiatives in the area of cloud computing could potentially lead to the creation of 2.5 million jobs. Another study argues that intervention to support the deployment of next generation access (NGA) could create 0.63 to 2.59 million jobs by 2020. Finally, according to a recent study, if the Consumer Rights Directive were to be applied to all consumer transactions in the EU (i.e. if it were to be extended to also cover the financial services, passenger travel, healthcare and real estate sectors), this could bring gains of EUR 58 billion annually. This would be related to increased cross-border competition, which would lower prices, improve choice and encourage innovation. The table on the next page provides further details. 113 Evidence has been collected to the extent possible regarding key legislative/policy achievements highlighted in the previous sub-section.

        "Policy Department A: Economic and Scientific Policy PE 518.762 52 Impacts on other areas Besides contributing to GDP growth, achievements and policy actions within the framework of the flagship initiative relevant for the single market and consumer protection are also likely to have positive impacts in terms of sustainability and inclusiveness. Legislation to deepen the single market for electronic communications, for example, has among other things aimed at improving access to the Internet and overcoming the \u2018digital divide\u2019. Moreover, there is evidence that the development of a digital economy in the EU could lead to the creation of a significant number of new jobs. In terms of sustainability, the completion of the digital single market could contribute towards the dematerialisation of the economy, reducing its resource-intensity and carbon footprint. Finally, completing the digital single market also yields benefits for the single market in other areas. For example, facilitating the online purchase of goods and services from other Member States also contributes to the movement of goods and services across borders more generally. 3.1.4. Conclusions on key single market- and consumer protection-related achievements under the flagship initiative and related contributions to growth Much activity has occurred relating to deepening the single market and improving consumer protection and empowerment within the scope of the flagship initiative \u2018A Digital Agenda for Europe\u2019. These fall into the categories of electronic communications, e- commerce/online services and data protection/network and information security. Evidence suggests that these areas have significant potential to contribute to growth, in particular electronic communications and e-commerce/online services. According to one study, the creation of a digital single market could lead to a 4% increase in the EU\u2019s GDP (estimate given for the time period 2010 to 2020). The importance of the digital sector has also been stressed by the president of the Commission Jean-Claude Juncker, who has announced plans for ambitious legislative reforms on the digital single market within his first six months in office. 114 Regarding electronic communications, progress is particularly visible when considering prices, which have sunk by 30% over the last decade. A reform of the regulatory framework was completed in 2009, which both contributed to creating a single market for the sector and to strengthening consumer rights. Moreover, a new legislative package has been proposed by the Commission, the Connected Continent proposal, which aims to build on these achievements. It contains some major legislative changes, including a complete elimination of roaming charges within the European Union, although it may not significantly impact on the way national regulatory authorities supervise markets and some stakeholders have doubts regarding the extent to which it would defend net neutrality. Nonetheless, the adoption of the proposal could contribute significantly to realising the economic growth potential of completing the single market for electronic communications. The 7 th legislature has also seen important developments in regard to e-commerce and the online services sector. In particular, legislation has been adopted to address payment difficulties (the SEPA Regulation), to create an internal market for electronic Trust Services (eTS) and to encourage e-invoicing in public procurement. The Consumer Rights Directive has also introduced a range of new consumer rights that are relevant for e-commerce and online services, while the legislation on ADR and ODR and the Commission\u2019s Recommendation on collective redress should also enhance consumer protection in the e- commerce and online services sector. However, important pieces of legislation remain at the proposal stage (such as the new rules for payment services and the Common European Sales Law), and certain gaps remain that have not yet been addressed by policy proposals. 114 Juncker, Jean-Claude, A New Start for Europe: My Agenda for Jobs, Growth, Fairness and Democratic Change, 2014.

        "Contribution of the Internal Market and Consumer Protection to Growth PE 518.762 53 Moreover, interviewees pointed to inconsistencies in the implementation of consumer protection legislation throughout the European Union. Considering that lack of consumer trust is a major barrier to the development of e-commerce and online services, policy action aimed at boosting trust could remain a key focus. 3.2. Flagship initiative 2: Innovation Union 3.2.1. Overview of flagship initiative and progress in achieving Europe 2020 objectives The flagship initiative \u2018Innovation Union\u2019 is aimed at improving conditions for research and innovation in the European Union, which are seen as vital for achieving economic growth and maintaining global competitiveness. Among other things the flagship initiative stresses the need for adequate funding for innovation, and establishes as its headline target that 3% of the EU\u2019s GDP should be invested annually in research and development (R&D) by 2020. 115 In addition, it aims to overcome the continued fragmentation of the Single Market (e.g. the lack of a unified patent system) that acts as a disincentive to innovation. Another aspect of the flagship initiative involves the creation of a European Research Area, in which researchers (in both the public and private sectors) can co-operate effectively with each other across national borders, thereby avoiding duplications and sharing knowledge. Box 2: EU goals under the \u2018Innovation Union\u2019 flagship initiative 116 \uf0b7 Complete the European Research Area, develop a strategy research agenda focused on challenges such as energy security, transport, climate change and resource efficiency, health and ageing, environmentally-friendly production methods and land management, and enhance joint programming with Member States and regions; \uf0b7 Improve framework conditions for business to innovate (i.e. create the single EU Patent and a specialised Patent Court, modernise the framework of copyright and trademarks, improve access of SMEs to Intellectual Property Production, speed up setting up interoperable standards; improve access to capital and make full use of demand side policies, e.g. through public procurement and smart regulation); \uf0b7 Launch \u2018European Innovation Partnerships\u2019 between the EU and national levels to speed up the development and deployment of the technologies needed to meet the challenges identified. The first will include: \u2018building the bio-economy by 2020\u2019, \u2018the key enabling technologies to shape Europe\u2019s industrial future\u2019 and \u2018technologies to allow older people to live independently and be active in society\u2019; \uf0b7 Strengthen and further develop the role of EU instruments to support innovation (e.g. structural funds, rural development funds, R&D framework programme, CIP, SET plan), including through closer work with the EIB and streamline administrative procedures to facilitate access to funding, particularly for SMEs and to bring in innovative incentive mechanisms linked to the carbon market, namely for fast-movers; \uf0b7 Promote knowledge partnerships and strengthen links between education, business, research and innovation, including through the EIT, and to promote entrepreneurship by supporting Young Innovative Companies. 115 This is seen as particularly important in view of the fact that several other major economies spend more on R&D than the EU. In 2010 Japan spent 3.25% of its GDP on research and development, while for the United States the figure in 2011 was 2.67%, compared to only 2.04% in 2011 for the EU28. Eurostat (t2020_20). 116 European Commission, COM (2010) 2020 - Communication on Europe 2020 - A Strategy for Smart, Sustainable and Inclusive Growth, 2010, pp. 12-13 (extracts). ",
        "Policy Department A: Economic and Scientific Policy PE 518.762 54 However, little progress has been made so far in terms of reaching the overall flagship target for R&D spending. Investment levels increased to only 2.07% in 2012, up from 2.01% in 2009. The Commission has therefore estimated that R&D spending will only reach 2.2% of the EU\u2019s GDP by 2020, although if Member States reach their national targets this could rise to 2.6%. 117 It has also expressed concerns that the lack of progress in this area may have negative impacts on long-term growth potential, although it hopes the gradually improving economic situation may allow Member States to readjust their focus towards growth-enhancing policies. 118 This recognition of the need for increased R&D spending has been reflected in the Union budget for 2014 to 2020, with EUR 80 billion available for research and innovation under the Horizon 2020 programme. 119 It should be noted, however, that public funding only accounts for part of R&D spending in the European Union, and achieving progress in this area could require finding solutions to insufficient private investment. Overall investment levels in the European Union (for all parts of the economy) sank rapidly following the outbreak of the financial crisis in 2007 and have not yet recovered. 120 3.2.2. Achievements relevant to the Single Market during the 7 th legislature, and remaining barriers The main areas covered by the flagship initiative \u2018Innovation Union\u2019 that relate to the single market are the \u2018single market for innovation\u2019, access to finance for SMEs and the European Research Area. None of the actions taken within the scope of the flagship initiative relate directly to consumer protection and/or empowerment. 121 In this section we outline key achievements in these areas considered to fall within the scope of the flagship initiative \u2018Innovation Union\u2019 that are relevant for the single market, along with remaining barriers. Single market for innovation Although the single market should, due to its size, be able to attract investment and enable innovative businesses to grow rapidly, in reality significant fragmentation across borders remains and acts as a hindrance to innovation. And in the absence of a functioning single market, it is possible that other measures to boost innovation (e.g. increased public funding for R&D) will not have the desired effect. A central element of the flagship initiative is therefore to overcome these barriers. Of particular significance is the adoption of the EU Patent Package, which establishes a unified EU patent system. Although the absolute number of WIPO-PCT international patent applications from the EU increased between 2000 and 2011, the EU\u2019s share of world patent applications has nonetheless fallen (from 36.1% in 2000 to 28.8% in 2010). 122 Moreover, due to the high costs of applying for a European patent, many investors only apply for a patent in a few countries, which offers them less protection and allows their inventions to be more easily copied. 123 It is hoped that the creation of a unified EU patent system can counteract this situation by reducing the costs of obtaining patent protection in the EU. Currently this can cost up to EUR 36,000, compared to only EUR 1,850 for obtaining a patent in the United States, as shown in the graph on the 117 European Commission, COM (2014) 130 final/2 - Taking Stock of the Europe 2020 Strategy for Smart, Sustainable and Inclusive Growth, 2014, p. 12. 118 European Commission, COM (2014) 339 Final - Research and Innovation as Sources of Renewed Growth, 2014, p. 3. 119 European Commission, State of the Innovation Union - Taking Stock 2010 - 2014, 2014, p. 28. 120 Direct investment flows for the EU27 amounted to EUR1,278,121 million in 2007, but only 418,635 million in 2012.

M. Barroso to the European Council, 23 October 2011. Besides the EU Patent Package, innovation could potentially benefit from cross-cutting legislation that is also relevant for the single market in other areas, such as freedom of movement for goods. There is evidence that regulatory barriers, such as certification requirements to sell products in other Member States, can act as an obstacle to innovation. In the construction materials sector, for example, the costs of compliance with national requirements have been estimated to be between EUR 5,000 and EUR 25,000 per product. According to a recent study, this may negatively affect the global competitiveness of the EU\u2019s construction materials sector, with the most dynamic markets for construction products being located outside of the EU. 126 Therefore, it is likely that the Regulation on European Standardisation, adopted in 2012, will have a positive effect on innovation. The legislation aims to improve the EU\u2019s standard setting system and should promote harmonised standards for innovation and new technologies (see section 3.5 on the flagship initiative \u2018An industrial policy for the globalisation era\u2019 for more details). Other cross-cutting single market achievements that could boost innovation include the State Aid Modernisation process, which makes it easier for innovative firms to receive state funding, and the new Procurement Directives, which stress the importance of innovation in public procurement. 124 http://ec.europa.eu/unitedkingdom/press/press_releases/2011/pr1138_en.htm. 125 http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_MEMO-12-970_en.htm?locale=en.

Of particular note is the revised General Block Exemption Regulation (GBER), under which Member States will be able to grant more aid measures and higher amounts without having to notify them to the Commission for prior authorisation. New areas have been exempted from state aid restrictions, such as broadband infrastructure, while categories already covered by the GBER have been broadened. 130 Public procurement reform 131 Aims to simplify public procurement procedures, while providing greater flexibility and legal certainty, and for the first time sets common EU standards on concession contracts.

Selection of legislative/policy achievements based on literature and interviews with relevant stakeholders. SMEs\u2019 access to finance Improving the access of SMEs to finance across borders is considered to be essential if their growth and innovation potential is to be fully taken advantage of. This is particularly the case in the context of the economic crisis, which has tended to reduce the availability of credit for companies. In view of these issues, the EU announced in 2011 an Action Plan to improve SMEs\u2019 access to finance. This focused partly on increased financial support from the EU budget, but also included proposals that are relevant for the single market. One of these was for a Regulation on European Venture Capital Funds, which was adopted in 2013. 127 Regulation No. 1257/2012 and Council regulation No. 1260/2012. The package also consists of an international agreement among Member States setting up a single and specialised patent jurisdiction (the \u201cUnified Patent Court\u201d), which can be accessed here: http://www.unified-patent-court.org/images/documents/upc- agreement.pdf.

Furthermore, venture capital investments in the EU declined by 2.8% between 2007 and 2012 (as a percentage of GDP). 133 While this latter development may be countered by the introduction of the European Venture Capital Fund, both these figures underline the difficult investment environment in which European SMEs are currently operating. In recognition of this situation, the Commission established a number of relevant policy priorities in 2014, including the development of innovative sources of finance (e.g. crowd-funding), as well as action to facilitate cross-border access to company information in the EU. 134 Future activity could also focus on reducing the heterogeneity of the EU\u2019s product market regulation, as restrictive product market regulations have been found to negatively affect foreign direct investment. 135 133 European Commission, Innovation Union Scoreboard, 2014, p. 6. 134 European Commission, COM (2013) 785 Final - A Single Market for Growth and Jobs: An Analysis of Progress Made and Remaining Obstacles in the Member States - Contribution to the Annual Growth Survey 2014, 2013. 135 Kalemli-Ozcan S., V.

        "Contribution of the Internal Market and Consumer Protection to Growth PE 518.762 59 European Research Area Another priority of the \u2018Innovation Union\u2019 flagship initiative is the creation of a European Research Area, which aims at improving cross-border mobility and co-operation for research purposes. This is viewed as necessary in order to achieve more effective and efficient research processes by avoiding duplication and creating synergies. Moreover, the international mobility of researchers (which is of particular relevance for the single market) is understood to contribute to high quality research. Correspondingly, a variety of measures have been taken in order to encourage this. The European Framework for Research Careers improves the comparability of research careers in the EU, while steps have been made towards establishing a Pan-European Pension Fund for Researchers, which would enable employees to remain affiliated to the same pension vehicle when moving between different countries. Already before the beginning of the 7 th legislature, the cross-border mobility of researchers had received a boost from the creation of the EURAXESS job portal. In addition, the pre-existing Marie Curie Actions (which provide scholarships for researcher mobility and have now been renamed as the Marie Sk\u0142odowska-Curie Actions) have been integrated into Horizon 2020, with EUR 6.16 billion funding made available for 2014 to 2020. Table 16: Key legislative and policy achievements under the 7th legislature in regard to the European Research Area relevant for the single market Achievement Key aspects relevant for the single market Measures to support the establishment of a Pan-European Pension Fund for Researchers 148 Aim to establish a Pan-European Pension Fund for Researchers, which would enable employees to remain affiliated to the same pension vehicle when moving between different countries and changing jobs. In 2013, a Task Force was created, which in 2014 was transformed into a consortium of committed employers to promote the establishment of the Institution for Occupational Retirement Provision (IORP) that will manage occupational pension plan(s) for the benefit of researchers of the sponsoring undertakings (universities and/or research institutions) within the EEA. 149 Strengthening of Marie Sk\u0142odowska- Curie Actions (MSCA) 150 Aims to support the career development and training of researchers \u2013 with a focus on innovation skills \u2013 in all scientific disciplines. The scheme provides grants at all stages of researchers' careers, from PhD candidates to highly experienced researchers, and encourages transnational, intersectoral and interdisciplinary mobility. As of January 2014 the scheme is part of Horizon 2020, and will receive EUR 6.16 billion funding over the period 2014- 2020. 151 In total, 65,000 researchers will be funded under MSCA in Horizon 2020. 152 European Framework for Research Careers (EFRC) 153 Intended to foster cross-border and cross-sector researcher mobility, helping researchers to identify job offers and employers to find suitable candidates.

        "Policy Department A: Economic and Scientific Policy PE 518.762 60 3.2.3. Evidence of impacts on economic growth of actions relevant for the single market In this section we present the evidence collected concerning assessments of impacts on economic growth of actions in areas related to the flagship initiative \u2019Innovation Union\u2019 and relevant to the single market. 155 The evidence collected refers variously to impacts on increases in GDP itself as well as factors that are considered to be conducive to economic growth, such as efficiency gains, savings and increases in employment. The collection of evidence is based on an analytical approach combining a comprehensive literature review and interviews, which served to identify and categorise relevant impacts. Results are detailed in the table on the following pages. Research suggests that the flagship initiative \u2018Innovation Union\u2019 as a whole has very significant potential to contribute to economic growth in the EU. According to one study, a gradual increase of R&D spending from 1.8% up to 3% of GDP between 2010 and 2020, and a strict persistence of this 3% level afterwards, could potentially generate an additional 5.4 percentage points of GDP, and at the same time create 3.7 million jobs. 156 An impact assessment conducted by the Commission argues that the combined effect of Horizon 2020, a gradual reallocation of national funding to transnational activities and achieving the 3% R&D spending goal by 2020 could boost the EU\u2019s GDP by EUR 445 billion by 2030, as well as create 7.2 million new jobs. 157 Insofar as some of the single-market related measures taken as part of the flagship initiative encourage investment in R&D, they can be seen as broadly contributing to the figures mentioned above. Moreover, there is specific evidence regarding the contribution to economic growth of individual policy measures. One study estimates that a European patent system could lead to savings of EUR 250 million for European businesses, while another study argues that the creation of a Unified Patent Court could lead to savings of EUR 148 million to EUR 289 million. By abolishing the obligation of listed companies to present quarterly financial reports, furthermore, the revised Transparency Directive could bring savings of EUR 2,000 to EUR 60,000 per year/per issuer for small and medium issuers, and from EUR 35,000 to EUR 250,000 per year/per issuer for large issuers, without taking into account savings in wage bills linked to the staff involved in preparation of these reports. While in some cases studies on the economic impact of specific measures could not be identified, there nonetheless exists more general evidence suggesting that they could contribute to growth. For example, it has been argued that standardisation has a positive impact on annual GDP growth ranging from an additional 0.3 to 1 percentage points of growth. There is also evidence that an increase of venture capital investments by 0.1% of GDP could lead to an increase in real GDP growth of 0.3 percentage points (estimate based on ex-post econometric modelling). In regard to researcher mobility the evidence is less clear-cut, however. While one study that looked at the mobility of UK researchers has argued that changing jobs had a minimal impact on the scientific performance of the individuals concerned, another study has claimed that researchers who moved jobs either between European countries or out of Europe had a higher field-weighted citation impact than those who remained in the same country. 155 Evidence has been collected to the extent possible regarding key legislative/policy achievements highlighted in the previous sub-section. Despite this, in many cases the evidence collected does not relate to specific policy actions/achievements, as opposed to general developments and actions. 156 Zagam\u00e9, Paul, The Costs of a Non-Innovative Europe: What Can We Learn and What Can We Expect from the Simulation Works, 2010. 157 European Commission, SWD (2012) 212 Final - Impact Assessment - A Reinforced European Research Area Partnership for Excellence and Growth, 2012.

        "Policy Department A: Economic and Scientific Policy PE 518.762 62 Impacts on other areas Besides contributing to smart economic growth, actions taken within the scope of the flagship initiative \u2018Innovation Union\u2019 also have potential to contribute to the EU\u2019s social and environmental goals. One area of the flagship initiative focuses on improving SMEs\u2019 access to cross-border finance, something which is also of significance for the social enterprise sector. The Commission views the development of the EU\u2019s social enterprise sector as an important means of combatting poverty, with several of the actions taken within the scope of the flagship initiative \u2018European Platform against Poverty and Social Exclusion\u2019 intended to support its future growth (see Section 3.7.2 for more details). In addition, the \u2018Innovation Union\u2019 flagship initiative can contribute to achieving the European Union\u2019s targets on energy and climate change, as the development of a green economy is closely linked with the use of new and innovative technologies. 3.2.4. Conclusions on key single market-related achievements under the flagship initiative and related contributions to growth Aspects of the flagship initiative \u2018Innovation Union\u2019 relevant for the single market relate primarily to breaking down barriers to innovation (such as restrictive patenting regulations), improving cross-border access to finance for SMEs and encouraging the cross- border mobility of researchers. While little evidence could be identified regarding the economic impacts of researcher mobility, there are indications that a single market for innovation and improved access to finance for SMEs could be conducive to economic growth. The latter of these also contributes to achieving the overarching flagship headline goal that 3% of GDP should be invested in R&D. One of the most important legislative developments under the Innovation Union flagship initiative has been the establishment of a unitary patent system, which is expected to reduce the costs involved in applying for a patent that is valid throughout the EU by around 80%. The new Procurement Directives and the modernisation of State Aid were also introduced with a view to encouraging innovation in the Single Market. In regard to the access of SMEs to finance, it is hoped that the Regulation on European Venture Capital Funds can help counteract the recent decline of venture capital investments in the EU. However, access of SMEs to finance continues to be negatively affected by the economic crisis and it is foreseen that more action in this area could be necessary. The Single Market Act II included as one of its key actions a proposal for a Regulation on European Long-term Investment Funds, although as of yet it has not been adopted. Other priorities identified by the Commission include improving the framework conditions for new and innovative sources of cross-border funding (e.g. crowd-funding), developing SME bonds and alternative stock markets, and improving cross-border access to company information within the EU. Another potential area for future activity could be reducing product market regulations that hinder foreign direct investment. Although less evidence could be identified for the contribution of researcher mobility to economic growth, it is worth nothing that there has been progress in this area, in particular through the creation of the European Framework for Research Careers and the strengthening of the Marie Sk\u0142odowska-Curie Actions. While the Pan-European Pension Fund for Researchers has yet to be established, steps have been taken in this direction, and the Commission predicts that the fund would be operational by 2015. 158 158 European Commission, State of the Innovation Union - Taking Stock 2010 - 2014, 2014.

Overview of flagship initiative and progress in achieving Europe 2020 objectives The flagship initiative \u2018Youth on the Move\u2019 focuses on improving the education and employability of young people within the European Union, with the goal of combatting youth unemployment and creating a workforce with the skills required by the economy. It aims to do this by improving the quality and relevance of education systems, as well as by promoting the mobility of young people and easing their transition from education into the workforce. A particular focus is placed on increasing the participation of young people in education, with headline targets to reduce early school-leaving to 10% and ensure that at least 40% of 30-34 year olds have completed tertiary or equivalent education. Box 3: EU goals under the \u2018Youth on the Move\u2019 flagship initiative 159 \uf0b7 Integrate and enhance the EU's mobility, university and researchers' programmes (such as Erasmus, Erasmus Mundus, Tempus and Marie Curie) and link them up with national programmes and resources; \uf0b7 Step up the modernisation agenda of higher education (curricula, governance and financing) including by benchmarking university performance and educational outcomes in a global context; \uf0b7 Explore ways of promoting entrepreneurship through mobility programmes for young professionals; \uf0b7 Promote the recognition of non-formal and informal learning; \uf0b7 Launch a Youth employment framework outlining policies aimed at reducing youth unemployment rates: this should promote, with Member States and social partners, young people's entry into the labour market through apprenticeships, stages or other work experience, including a scheme (\"Your first EURES job\") aimed at increasing job opportunities for young people by favouring mobility across the EU. Much progress has been made towards achieving the headline targets since the launch of the \u2018Youth on the Move\u2019 flagship in 2010, with early school-leaving sinking from 14.2% in 2009 to 12% in 2013, and tertiary educational attainment rising from 32.3% to 36.9% over the same period. 160 The Commission\u2019s recent stock-take of the Europe 2020 strategy therefore argued that the targets were realistically achievable by 2020. Both trends are considered to be of a long-term and structural nature, although the reduction in early school-leaving may also be related to a more difficult employment situation. 161 3.3.2. Achievements relevant to the Single Market during the 7 th legislature, and remaining barriers The main area covered by the flagship initiative \u2018Youth on the Move\u2019 that relates to the single market is learning and employment mobility. None of actions taken within the scope of the flagship initiative relate directly to consumer protection and/or empowerment. In this section we outline key achievements in this sector considered to fall within the scope of the flagship initiative that are relevant for the single market, along with remaining barriers. 159 European Commission, COM (2010) 2020 - Communication on Europe 2020 - A Strategy for Smart, Sustainable and Inclusive Growth, 2010, p. 13 (extracts). 160 Eurostat (t2020_40; t2020_41). 161 European Commission, COM (2014) 130 final/2 - Taking Stock of the Europe 2020 Strategy for Smart, Sustainable and Inclusive Growth, 2014, p. 13.

        "Policy Department A: Economic and Scientific Policy PE 518.762 64 Promoting the learning and employment mobility of young people is a central element of the \u2018Youth on the Move\u2019 flagship initiative. Studying abroad is a fundamental way for young people to improve their employability, as well as develop linguistic and intercultural skills. Moreover, increasing employment mobility is necessary to more effectively match labour demand with labour supply. While measures to improve the mobility of young people (such as the Erasmus programme) have been in place for many years, progress continued to be made during the 7 th legislature. In particular, the regulation establishing Erasmus+ represented a major restructuring of the EU\u2019s education, training, youth and sport mobility schemes, combining them into one integrated programme and significantly increasing the available funding. As the figure below shows, the number of students taking part in Erasmus has steadily increased since its introduction in 1987. During the 2012/13 academic year as many as 268,143 students went abroad under the Erasmus programme, meaning that in total over three million students have taken part in it during the course of its existence. It is foreseen that a further four million people will benefit from support under the Erasmus+ scheme over the seven-year period from 2014 to 2020. 162 Figure 6: The number of students spending a study period abroad under the Erasmus programme (1987/88 to 2012/13) 0 50,000 100,000 150,000 200,000 250,000 300,000 1 9 8 7 - 8 8 1 9 8 8 - 8 9 1 9 8 9 - 9 0 1 9 9 0 - 9 1 1 9 9 1 - 9 2 1 9 9 2 - 9 3 1 9 9 3 - 9 4 1 9 9 4 - 9 5 1 9 9 5 - 9 6 1 9 9 6 - 9 7 1 9 9 7 - 9 8 1 9 9 8 - 9 9 1 9 9 9 - 0 0 2 0 0 0 - 0 1 2 0 0 1 - 0 2 2 0 0 2 - 0 3 2 0 0 3 - 0 4 2 0 0 4 - 0 5 2 0 0 5 - 0 6 2 0 0 6 - 0 7 2 0 0 7 - 0 8 2 0 0 8 - 0 9 2 0 0 9 - 1 0 2 0 1 0 - 1 1 2 0 1 1 - 1 2 2 0 1 2 - 1 3 Source: European Commission, Erasmus: Facts, Figures & Trends , 2014. In addition to the regulation establishing Erasmus+, other achievements in regard to youth mobility should be noted. These include a Recommendation on the Learning Mobility of Young People, which encourages Member States to take measures to improve conditions for mobile learning, with the launch of a Mobility Scoreboard in early 2014 providing the necessary methodological framework to measure progress in this area. Other relevant actions taken include the review of the ECTS Users\u2019 Guide (to be published in 2015), the development of the U-Multirank system, the launch of the European Skills Passport, the Recommendation on the establishment of the ECVET, the initiative \u2018Your first EURES job\u2019 and the publication of guidance on the rights of mobile students within the EU. However, barriers to cross-border youth mobility continue to exist, with only around 10% of EU students going abroad to study or train at any point during their studies, which is well below the EU target of 20% for overall student mobility. 163 Various surveys of non-mobile 162 http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_IP-14-821_en.htm. 163 http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_IP-14-821_en.htm.

Finally, concerns about education systems abroad, recognition of credits and the continuity between subjects studied abroad and at home are also highlighted in various studies as major barriers to participation in the Erasmus programme. 166 The table below describes in further detail key legislative/policy achievements under the 7 th legislature relevant for the single market in regard to learning and employment mobility: Table 18: Key legislative and policy achievements under the 7th legislature in regard to learning and employment mobility Achievement Key aspects relevant for the single market Adoption of Regulation establishing Erasmus+ 167 Combines seven existing schemes \u2013 the Lifelong Learning Programme (Erasmus, Leonardo da Vinci, Comenius and Grundtvig), Youth in Action and five international cooperation programmes (Erasmus Mundus, Tempus, Alfa, Edulink and the programme for cooperation with industrialised countries) \u2013 into one integrated programme for education, training, youth and sport, with the aim of improving effectiveness and promoting synergies. The seven-year programme (2014-2020) has a budget of EUR 14.7 billion, which represents a 40% increase in relation to previous spending levels, and will provide grants to 4 million people. New elements include a loan guarantee scheme to help master's degree students to finance their studies abroad. 168 Adoption of Recommendation on Promoting the Learning Mobility of Young People 169 Recommends Member States to improve conditions for learning mobility, among other things by increasing quality of guidance and information on opportunities for learning mobility, preparing opportunities for mobile learning (e.g. through improved language education), reducing administrative burdens that represent a barrier to mobility and promoting the portability of grants and loans. 170 Publication of the first Mobility Scoreboard 171 Follows up on the Council Recommendation from 2011, which called on Member States to support the creation of a methodological framework to monitor progress in terms of promoting learning mobility.

Evidence of impacts on economic growth of actions relevant for the single market In this section we present the evidence collected concerning assessments of impacts on economic growth of actions in areas related to the flagship initiative \u2018Youth on the Move\u2019 and relevant for the single market. 185 The evidence collected refers variously to impacts on increases in GDP itself as well as factors that are considered to be conducive to economic growth, such as efficiency gains, savings and increases in employment. The collection of evidence is based on an analytical approach combining a comprehensive literature review and interviews, which served to identify and categorise relevant impacts. Results are detailed in the table on the following pages. In general, measures to improve education and youth employment have a significant potential to contribute to economic growth in the EU. According to an estimate by Eurofound, the cost of the economic inactivity and/or unemployment of young people amounted to EUR 153 billion in 2011, which is equivalent to around 1.2% of EU GDP. 186 At the same time, while unemployment among young people is high, there were two million unfilled vacancies in the EU in 2012, many of which could not be filled due to a lack of workers with the necessary skills. 187 A wide range of measures could be necessary to address these problems, only one aspect of which would be increasing the mobility of young people. However, there are indications that youth mobility could play a major role. While quantitative evidence of the contribution of youth mobility to GDP growth could not be identified for this study, an impact assessment conducted by the Commission on the creation of a single EU programme for education, training, youth and sport (later established by the Erasmus + regulation) estimated that the policy could have positive effects on both economic growth and employment. Another impact assessment on a Council Recommendation on Youth Mobility also predicted positive economic and social effects. Furthermore, there is evidence that the \u2018Your first EURES job\u2019 scheme could already be leading to savings, with the benefits per successful work placement ranging from EUR 131 per month in Bulgaria to EUR 2,266 per month in Luxembourg, due to reduced expenditure on unemployment benefits. In addition, several studies suggest that study abroad programmes such as Erasmus can improve the employability of participants. One of these presents evidence that graduates who had taken part in a study abroad programme were 24% more likely to be in employment three years after graduation relative to graduates who did not study abroad. Other studies have established that former Erasmus participants are more likely to work abroad later in life, relate positively towards the EU, identify as European and/or speak more foreign languages in comparison with non-mobile graduates. 188 Finally, former Erasmus students are half as likely to experience long-term unemployment compared with those who have not studied or trained abroad, according to a study prepared for the Commission on the impacts of the Erasmus programme. Further details are outlined in the table below. 185 Evidence has been collected to the extent possible regarding key legislative/policy achievements highlighted in the previous sub-section. Despite this, in many cases the evidence collected does not relate to specific policy actions/achievements, as opposed to general developments and actions. 186 Eurofound, NEETs \u2013 Young people not in employment, education or training: Characteristics, costs and policy responses in Europe, 2012, p. 81. 187 European Commission, COM (2012) 727 Final - Moving Youth into Employment, 2012, p. 5. 188 Mitchell, Kristine, \u201cStudent Mobility and European Identity: Erasmus Study as a Civic Experience?,\u201d Journal of Contemporary European Research, Vol. 8, No. 4, 2012, pp. 490\u2013518.

        "Contribution of the Internal Market and Consumer Protection to Growth PE 518.762 69 Impacts on other areas The inclusive nature of the \u2018Youth on the Move\u2019 initiative is clear, in the sense that it aims at combatting youth unemployment. Arguably, however, it also contributes to sustainability and innovation, as students who take part in the Erasmus programme are more likely to work abroad later in life than those who stay in their own Member State for their entire study period. As explained further in Section 3.6.3 on the flagship initiative \u2018An Agenda for New Skills and Jobs\u2019, labour mobility is seen as necessary to overcome skills shortages that could potentially hinder the development of a smart and sustainable economy. 3.3.4. Conclusions on key single market-related achievements under the flagship initiative and related contributions to growth Single-market related actions that took place within the scope of the flagship initiative \u2018Youth on the Move\u2019 have focused on encouraging the learning and employment mobility of young people. While little quantitative evidence on the contribution of these policies to economic growth could be identified, the available evidence nonetheless suggests that they can have a positive impact on the European economy, among other things by increasing the employability of young people, as well as their mobility later in life. A major achievement has been the regulation establishing Erasmus+, which combines the EU\u2019s education, training, youth and sport schemes into one integrated programme, with the aim of improving effectiveness and promoting synergies. It is hoped that this can build on the success of previous measures relating to learning mobility, which have already contributed to a very significant increase in the number of students studying abroad since the 1980s. Other actions taken in the 7 th legislature include the Council Recommendation on the Learning Mobility of Young People, the launch of a Mobility Scoreboard, the review of the ECTS Users\u2019 Guide, the launch of U-Multirank, the Recommendation on the establishment of the ECVET and the publication of guidance on the rights of mobile students within the EU. Besides these activities, all of which are related to learning mobility, the launch of the European Skills Passport and \u2018Your first EURES job\u2019 have also taken place within the scope of the \u2018Youth on the Move\u2019 flagship initiative. However, more could be done to overcome the remaining barriers to youth mobility. Just 10% of EU students go abroad to study or train, which is only half of the EU\u2019s goal of 20% overall student mobility. Based on surveys of non-mobile students, major obstacles to studying abroad include language issues, financial barriers and problems regarding recognition of credits and integration of courses completed abroad into overall degree, as well as lack of awareness regarding possibilities to study abroad and receive funding. 3.4. Flagship initiative 4: A Resource-efficient Europe 3.4.1. Overview of flagship initiative and progress in achieving Europe 2020 objectives The flagship initiative \u2018Resource-Efficient Europe\u2019 aims to support the shift towards a low- carbon economy that is efficient in the way it uses all resources. The aim is to decouple economic growth from resource and energy use, reduce CO 2 emissions, enhance competitiveness and promote greater energy security. It is specifically aimed at achieving the energy and climate headline targets of the Europe 2020 strategy - i.e. reducing greenhouse gas emissions by at least 20% compared to 1990 levels; increasing the share of renewable energy in final energy consumption to 20%; and moving towards a 20% increase in energy efficiency. The box below presents the Commission\u2019s goals under the flagship initiative in further detail. ",

[\u2026]; \uf0b7 Accelerate the implementation of strategic projects with high European added value to address critical bottlenecks, in particular cross border sections and inter modal nodes (cities, ports, logistic platforms); \uf0b7 Complete the internal energy market and implement the strategic energy technologies (SET) plan, promoting renewable sources of energy in the single market would also be a priority; \uf0b7 Present an initiative to upgrade Europe's networks, including Trans European Energy Networks, towards a European supergrid, \"smart grids\" and interconnections in particular of renewable energy sources to the grid (with support of structural funds and the EIB). [\u2026]; \uf0b7 Adopt and implement a revised Energy Efficiency Action Plan and promote a substantial programme in resource efficiency (supporting SMEs as well as households) by making use of structural and other funds to leverage new financing through existing highly successful models of innovative investment schemes; this should promote changes in consumption and production patterns; \uf0b7 Establish a vision of structural and technological changes required to move to a low carbon, resource efficient and climate resilient economy by 2050 which will allow the EU to achieve its emissions reduction and biodiversity targets; [\u2026]. As noted in the Commission\u2019s recent stock-take of the Europe 2020 strategy, 190 much progress has been made under this flagship initiative towards the relevant Europe 2020 headline targets, which are considered broadly achievable. Specifically: \uf0b7 The EU already achieved an 18% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2012, and the reduction could be as high as 24% in 2020 compared to 1990, thus over- achieving the target; \uf0b7 From 7.5% in 2000, the share of renewables already reached 14.4% in 2012. The target of a 20% share by 2020 seems achievable and may be exceeded (around 21%); \uf0b7 Primary energy consumption fell by around 8% between the 2006 peak and 2012, although a further reduction of 6.3% would be needed by 2020 to meet the energy efficiency target. 189 European Commission, COM (2010) 2020 - Communication on Europe 2020 - A Strategy for Smart, Sustainable and Inclusive Growth, 2010 (extracts). 190 European Commission, COM (2014) 130 Final - Communication \u201cTaking Stock of the Europe 2020 Strategy for Smart, Sustainable and Inclusive Growth,\u201d 2014.

Achievements relevant to the Single Market and consumer protection & empowerment during the 7 th legislature, and remaining barriers The flagship initiative \u2018Resource-Efficient Europe\u2019 primarily relates to the energy and transport sectors. In this section we outline key achievements in these sectors considered to fall within the scope of the flagship initiative \u2018Resource-efficient Europe\u2019 that are relevant for the Single Market or consumer protection & empowerment, along with remaining barriers. 191 These are presented for the energy and transport sectors separately. Energy Key achievements in furthering the single market A single market for energy is viewed as necessary in order to ensure competitive prices, promote the use of renewable energy, and safeguard security of supply. Significant progress has been made towards the integration of the European gas and electricity markets, with the legislative framework provided by the Third Energy Package, particularly through the unbundling of transmission system operators at the wholesale level. 192 As of June 2013, there were at least 14 EU energy companies that were active in more than one Member State, providing consumers with greater choice and improving their ability to switch. Wholesale prices have seen both significant reduction in price dispersion and for electricity a general drop across the EU, with prices of the major European wholesale electricity benchmarks decreasing by 35\u201345 % over 2008-2012. 193 In addition, the Renewable Energy Directive has fostered the creation of a single market for trade in renewable energy. Furthermore, there have also been advances made in terms of infrastructure, such as improved interconnections on the Africa-Spain-France gas corridor and the construction of reverse flow gas projects in Eastern and Central Europe, on the basis of legislation on trans-European energy networks (TEN-E) that facilitates for eligibility for EU funds to finance infrastructure projects. 194 The table below describes in further detail key legislative/policy achievements under the 7 th legislature relevant for the Single Market in the energy sector, selected on the basis of a review of relevant literature (including key EU policy documents), as well as interviews with academic experts and stakeholders (including the relevant Commission officials). 191 Key policy actions outlined by the Commission relevant for the Single Market and consumer protection & empowerment under the flagship initiative are presented in the Annex. It should be noted that policy actions relating to the completion of the internal market for network services such as energy and transport are also outlined in the flagship initiative \u2018An industrial policy for the globalisation era\u2019. However, as this flagship initiative covers many other sectors or areas relevant to the single market and consumer protection in addition to transport and energy (in contrast to the \u2018Resource-efficient Europe\u2019 flagship initiative, which focuses almost exclusively on transport and energy) we address transport and energy as a whole in this Section alone. 192 At the time of writing, reportedly the 100th transmission systems operator (TSO) was in the process of being certified by the Commission as compliant with unbundling rules. 193 European Commission, SWD (2014) 20 final/2 \u2013 Energy prices and costs in Europe, 2014; p25. 194 Based on Decision No 1364/2006/EC of 6 September 2006 laying down guidelines for trans-European energy networks and repealing Decision 96/391/EC and Decision No 1229/2003/EC.

The \u2018Gas Directive\u2019 (Directive 2009/73/EC) similarly introduces common rules for the transmission, distribution, supply and storage of natural gas. Key requirements were for Member States to unbundle electricity and gas transmission systems and transmission system operators from 3 March 2012, and for Member States to organise a system of third party access to transmission and distribution systems. Regulations 714/2009 and 715/2009 additionally lay down conditions for access to the network for cross-border exchanges in electricity and to the natural gas transmission networks respectively. Regulation 713/2009 establishes the Agency for the Cooperation of Energy Regulators with the aim of exercising at Community level the tasks performed by the Member States\u2019 regulatory authorities. 196 Adoption of Renewable Energy Directive 197 Sets out a common framework for the promotion of energy from renewable sources, which include wind, solar, aerothermal, geothermal, hydrothermal and ocean energy, hydropower, biomass, landfill gas, sewage treatment plant gas and biogases. It in particular lays down rules relating to statistical transfers and joint projects between European Community Member States, joint projects with third countries, guarantees of origin, administrative procedures, information and training, and access to the electricity grid for energy from renewable sources. It also harmonises sustainability criteria for biofuels and bioliquids, thus facilitating their cross-border trade. 198 Adoption of guidelines for trans- European energy infrastructure 199 List and rank, according to the objectives and priorities laid down, projects eligible for Community assistance, and introduce the concept of 'project of European interest'. They also strengthen project coordination and now fully incorporate the new Member States. 200 Adoption of guidance package to Member States on state intervention in electricity markets 201 Provides guidance to Member States on how to design and reform national support schemes (e.g. state subsidies) for renewables and to design adequate generation capacities to ensure the continuous supply of electricity when generation fluctuates, for instance due to changing weather conditions. 202 Source: Civic Consulting, based on sources indicated in table. 195 Directive 2009/72/EC; Directive 2009/73/EC; Regulation No 714/2009; Regulation No 715/2009;Regulation No 713/2009. 196 See http://europa.eu/legislation_summaries/energy/internal_energy_market/index_en.htm for more details. 197 Directive 2009/28/EC. 198 See http://www.ecolex.org/ecolex/ledge/view/RecordDetails;jsessionid=81486EE7CA5E560409D392398C9539 A0?id=LEX-FAOC088009&index=documents for more details. 199 Regulation 347/2013. 200 See http://ec.europa.eu/energy/infrastructure/tent_e/ten_e_en.htm for more details. 201 Outlined in COM (2013) 7243 final; and detailed in SWD (2013) 438, 439, 440, 441, 442. 202 See http://ec.europa.eu/energy/gas_electricity/internal_market_en.htm for more details.

There remains a high level of market concentration in regard to generation: in 2012, in nine Member States more than 70% of the electricity generation market was under the control of the historic incumbent. 203 There have been some delays in the transposition of the Third Energy Package Directives (although only one case for non-transposition was still pending in October 2014 according to interviewees, down for 12 in October 2013). 204 The fragmentation of energy markets in the EU is also illustrated by the high level of retail price divergence for both electricity and gas, which have also not echoed the global downward trend in wholesale prices: on average, the EU household electricity prices increased by more than 4% a year between 2008 and 2012. 205 Indeed, much of the legislation relating to the internal energy market focuses to the wholesale level, such that less has been achieved in furthering the single market at retail level, as pointed out in a recent Commission roadmap. 206 Reasons for retail price divergence include price regulation in some Member States, differing levels of competition, variations in network costs and taxes, non-diversified supply and a lack of cross-border interconnections.

        "Policy Department A: Economic and Scientific Policy PE 518.762 74 Nonetheless, the necessary legislative framework is considered by interviewees to be largely laid down in the Third Energy Package; a key priority is therefore the timely and comprehensive transposition of the Third Energy Package directives, and their enforcement. 207 Other priorities include the adoption and application of electricity and gas network codes (which facilitate cross-border trade in energy); increasing interconnection capacity with neighbouring countries, in particular through ensuring the relevant infrastructure is available; and rethinking state intervention to avoid distortive effects on market functioning. 208 Key achievements in improving consumer protection & empowerment Consumer protection and empowerment in the energy sector relates inter alia to ensuring consumers are adequately informed and are aware of their rights, can choose and switch between multiplier suppliers, that prices are transparent, and that adequate dispute resolution mechanisms are in place. Eco-labelling and new technologies like smart metering are considered to play a significant role in empowering consumers to control their energy use and participate in energy markets. The Third Energy Package and the Energy Efficiency Directive in particular have created the legal framework for a series of new consumer rights. These should make it easier for consumers to switch, compare suppliers and monitor their energy use. In addition, several Member States have announced plans to roll-out smart-metering systems for electricity in the coming years, so that 84% of consumers in the EU should be covered by 2020. Plans are also in place for the roll-out of smart meters for gas, with current plans encompassing 30% of consumers. 209 The table below describes key legislative/policy achievements under the 7 th legislature relevant for consumer protection and empowerment in the energy sector, selected on the basis of a review of relevant literature (including key EU policy documents), as well as interviews with academic experts and stakeholders (including the relevant Commission officials). 207 Importantly, key action 4 of the Single Market Act II of 2012 involved \u2018improv[ing] the implementation and enforcement of the third energy package and mak[ing] cross-border markets that benefit consumers a reality\u2019; to address this the Commission proposed an Action Plan for Europe, of which the key actions are outlined in European Commission, COM (2012) 663 Final - Making the Internal Energy Market Work, 2012.

In particular, according to the Electricity Directive: \uf0b7 Member States shall ensure that all customers have the right to choose their electricity supplier and to change supplier easily, with the operator\u2019s assistance, within three weeks. They shall also ensure that customers receive relevant consumption data. \uf0b7 Electricity suppliers are obliged to inform final customers about: - the contribution of each energy source; - the environmental impact caused; - their rights in the event of a dispute. \uf0b7 Member States shall put in place an independent mechanism (energy ombudsman or consumer body) to manage complaints or disputes efficiently. \uf0b7 Member States shall ensure that contractual arrangements, commitment to customers, data exchange and settlement rules, data ownership and metering responsibility are defined. Similar rules apply to the gas market. 210 Adoption of Energy Efficiency Directive 211 Provides a common framework of measures for the promotion of energy efficiency within the EU. Measures are estimated inter alia to lead to major energy savings for consumers including easy and free-of-charge access to data on real-time and historical energy consumption through more accurate individual metering will now empower consumers to better manage their energy consumption. 212 Establishing European Energy Consumers\u2019 Checklist Provides consumers with clear information on their rights in the energy field, relating to the right to an electricity connection; a choice of supplier; an easy and fast switch of supplier; clear contract information and right of withdrawal; accurate information on consumption; information on how to use energy more efficiently and on the benefits of using energy from renewable sources; specific consumer protection measures for vulnerable consumers; easy resolution of complaints and disputes; an energy performance certificate for residential property; a national contact point for energy. 213 Adoption of guidance document on vulnerable consumers Helps Member States in designing the appropriate policy mix to provide the best level of support to consumers in vulnerable situations, in line with the relevant legislation. 214 Source: Civic Consulting, based on sources indicated in table. 210 See http://europa.eu/legislation_summaries/energy/internal_energy_market/index_en.htm for more details. 211 Directive 2012/27/EU. 212 See http://ec.europa.eu/energy/efficiency/eed/eed_en.htm for more details. 213 See http://ec.europa.eu/energy/gas_electricity/consumer/doc/20140617_consumer_rights_en.pdf for more details. 214 See http://ec.europa.eu/energy/gas_electricity/doc/forum_citizen_energy/20140106_vulnerable_consumer_re port.pdf for more details.

        "Policy Department A: Economic and Scientific Policy PE 518.762 76 Despite these achievements, much remains to be done. Electricity supply was in the bottom sixth of consumer service markets assessed in the last Consumer Markets Scoreboard, with gas supply also in the bottom third (of a total of 31 service markets evaluated). 215 Both services received low scores for comparability, choice and switching. Retail energy markets continue to be marked by a high degree of supplier market concentration, and retail prices in many Member States continue to be highly regulated. Key priorities of the Commission therefore include continued action to spur on competition in the sector; the phase out of regulated prices, whilst ensuring the protection of vulnerable consumers; and further action to promote consumer participation in the market. 216 Transport Key achievements in furthering the single market Achieving a single market for transport is part of the overarching aim of the flagship initiative \u2018Resource-efficient Europe\u2019, and involves creating a low-carbon, resource-efficient, secure and competitive transport system. Part of this is the creation of a single European transport area, which is expected to ease the movements of citizens and freight, reduce costs and enhance the sustainability of European transport. 217 Some advances have been made in recent years in terms of creating a single market for transport. For example, market opening in the aviation sector has led both to a significant increase in the number of passengers flown and to a substantial decrease in prices since the 1990s. International road haulage has also grown as the result of market opening, by as much as 32% between 2000 and 2011. 218 Many of main key legislative/policy achievements furthering the single market in the various transport modes occurred prior to the 7 th legislature; however key exceptions are Regulations No 1072/2009 and No 1073/2009, which respectively lay down common rules for the access to the international road haulage markets and international markets for coach and bus services. However, overall, integration of the EU\u2019s transport sector has been limited, such that several major proposals and initiatives have been proposed for the various modes recently, as shown in the table below (selected on the basis of a review of relevant literature, including key EU policy documents, as well as interviews with academic experts and stakeholders, including the relevant Commission officials). 215 European Commission, SWD (2014) 212 Final - Consumer Markets Scoreboard - Making Markets Work for Consumers - 10th Edition, June 2014, 2014. 216 As indicated in European Commission, COM (2013) 785 Final - A Single Market for Growth and Jobs: An Analysis of Progress Made and Remaining Obstacles in the Member States - Contribution to the Annual Growth Survey 2014, 2013. 217 European Commission (DG MOVE), Roadmap to a Single European Transport Area - Towards a Competitive and Resource-Efficient Transport System, 2011. 218 European Commission, COM (2013) 785 Final - A Single Market for Growth and Jobs: An Analysis of Progress Made and Remaining Obstacles in the Member States - Contribution to the Annual Growth Survey 2014, 2013, p. 16.

It also lays down the conditions under which non-resident hauliers may operate transport services within an EU country. 232 Source: Civic Consulting, based on sources indicated in table. As mentioned above, integration of the EU\u2019s transport sector has been limited. Short sea shipping, port services and railways are all affected by major bottlenecks, and even in the aviation and road haulage sectors there remains a significant level of fragmentation. Rail services in particular are affected by barriers to market entry, with domestic passenger services largely closed to competition. 233 In 2013, in 16 out of the 25 Member States with rail, incumbent operators' market share remains above 90%. 234 Besides issues related to competition, the establishment of a single market for transport is also hindered by insufficient cross-border transport connections. There have also been problems with the transposition and implementation of legislation, with 20 infringement cases against Member States still pending as of November 2013. 235 The graph below shows the evolution of transport prices for consumers, as well as overall consumer prices for the wider economy: as is evident in the graph, only prices of motor cars have increased at a slower rate than overall consumer prices (denoted by \u2018All items\u2019 in the graph). According to the Commission, key priorities to move forward therefore include ensuring a timely and high-quality transposition of the transport acquis, in particular in the railway sector; opening domestic rail passenger services to competition and ensuring that public service contracts are well defined and awarded following a fair, open and transparent tendering procedure; removing red tape in ports easing customs formalities for intra-EU shipping and easing customs formalities for ships that dock in third country ports; accelerating the implementation of the Single European Sky (SES); reviewing remaining national restrictions to access to domestic road haulage and road passenger markets; and removing bottlenecks and modernising transport infrastructure through the TEN-T corridors. 236 227 Regulation No 1315/2013. 228 See http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32013R1315&rid=1 for more details. 229 Regulation No 1073/2009. 230 See http://europa.eu/legislation_summaries/internal_market/single_market_services/tr0039_en.htm for more details. 231 Regulation No 1072/2009. 232 See http://europa.eu/legislation_summaries/internal_market/single_market_services/tr0038_en.htm for more details. 233 European Commission, COM (2013) 785 Final - A Single Market for Growth and Jobs: An Analysis of Progress Made and Remaining Obstacles in the Member States - Contribution to the Annual Growth Survey 2014, 2013. 234 European Commission, SWD (2013) 11 Final - Executive Summary of the Impact Assessment - Proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council Amending Regulation (EC) No 1370/2007 Concerning the Opening of the Market for Domestic Passenger Transport Services, 2013. 235 European Commission, COM (2013) 785 Final - A Single Market for Growth and Jobs: An Analysis of Progress Made and Remaining Obstacles in the Member States - Contribution to the Annual Growth Survey 2014, 2013. 236 Ibid.

Harmonised Indices of Consumer Prices (HCIP); figures refer to the EU27. Key achievements in improving consumer protection and empowerment Consumer protection and empowerment in the transport sector essentially relates to passenger rights. The EU now benefits from a comprehensive set of basic passenger rights in all modes: air, rail, waterborne and road transport. Many of the legislative achievements relating to passenger rights across the various transport modes have occurred prior to the 7 th legislature, in particular the Air Passenger Rights Regulations 237 and the Rail Regulation 238 . Key achievements under the 7 th legislature relate to air, waterborne and road passenger rights, with the proposal for a Regulation on air passenger rights in 2013 and the adoption of the Waterborne and Bus Regulations in 2010 and 2011 respectively, as well as a proposal for a Directive on package travel and assisted travel arrangements. These modal-specific rights complement the more recently established cross-cutting rights for passengers by the Consumer Rights Directive adopted in 2011. In addition, in light of the need to raise awareness on passenger rights and facilitate a common interpretation in the legislation, the Commission offered guidance in the form of a Communication on Passenger Rights in all transport modes, which also constituted one of the measures envisaged as part of actions relating to consumer empowerment under the Single Market Act I. The table below describes these key achievements under the 7 th legislature in further detail, selected on the basis of a review of relevant literature (including key EU policy documents), as well as interviews with academic experts and stakeholders (including the relevant Commission officials). 237 Regulations No 261/2004, No 1107/2006, No 1008/2008, and No 889/2002. 238 Regulation No 1371/2007.

Key elements of the proposal include ensuring effective and consistent enforcement of passenger rights; better taking into account the financial capacities of the air carriers; better enforcement of passenger rights with regard to mishandled baggage; and adapted liability limits in accordance to general price inflation. Adoption of a European vision for Passengers 240 Aims at helping carriers towards a more coherent and effective application of EU law; national authorities towards a harmonised enforcement of passenger protection across all modes; and passengers towards a better understanding of what they can legitimately expect (and what they cannot) as minimum quality service when travelling, by summarising in a simple manner the rights and principles applying to all modes. 241 Adoption of Bus Regulation 242 Establishes rules for the rights of passengers when travelling by bus and coach transport. It covers, inter alia non-discrimination between passengers regarding transport conditions offered by carriers, rights of passengers in the event of accidents, non-discrimination and assistance for disabled persons and persons with reduced mobility, rights of passengers in case of cancellation or delay, minimum information to be provided to passengers, and the handling of complaints. 243 Adoption of Waterborne Regulation 244 Establishes rules for the rights of passengers when travelling by sea and inland waterway transport. The coverage of areas and rights is similar to those described for the Bus Regulation. 245 Adoption of Consumer Rights Directive 246 In the transport sector, the Directive aims to increase transparency for passengers, especially when buying their transport tickets on-line. It explicitly bans pre-ticked boxes, internet \u2018cost traps\u2019 and additional charges which passengers were not duly informed about in advance. Additionally, it prohibits traders from charging fees for the use of means of payment (e.g. credit cards) that exceed the cost borne by the trader for the use of these means. 247 Proposal for a Package Travel Directive* 248 Would modernise EU rules on package holidays. Key elements of the proposal include stricter controls on price surcharges and a requirement to pass on price reductions; improved cancellation rights; better information on liability; better redress; and a single point of contact for complaints. 249 Source: Civic Consulting, based on sources indicated in table.

        "Contribution of the Internal Market and Consumer Protection to Growth PE 518.762 81 Despite progress made on establishing rights, consumer satisfaction assessed through surveys has been shown to differ widely across transport modes: in the 8 th Consumer Markets Scoreboard ranking of service markets, airline services were ranked 5th (out of 30), whereas the railway services were ranked 27th. In the 10 th Consumer Markets Scoreboard the situation marginally improved for railway services, where it was at 25 out of 31 services markets. The Commission associates the differences in perception by consumers to differences in where the problems lie in each sector. In addition, the Commission notes that even if airline services receive a comparatively more favourable assessment, a fifth of all cross-border complaints in 2013 related to passenger or luggage transport by air. 250 3.4.3. Evidence of impacts on economic growth of actions relevant for the single market or consumer protection In this section we present the evidence collected concerning assessments of impacts on economic growth of actions in areas related to flagship initiative \u2018A Resource-efficient Europe\u2019 and relevant for the single market or consumer protection and empowerment. 251 The evidence collected refers variously to impacts on increases in GDP itself as well as factors that are considered to be conducive to economic growth, such as efficiency gains, savings and increases in employment. The collection of evidence is based on an analytical approach combining a comprehensive literature review and interviews, which served to identify and categorise relevant impacts. Results are detailed in the table on the following pages. Energy Overall, evidence indicates that single-market and consumer protection/empowerment- related actions in the energy sector have contributed and are likely to contribute substantially to economic growth. In particular, strong benefits from an increase in EU-wide market integration and competition in the form of increases in GDP and in efficiency/savings from switching, welfare gains and lower prices could be achieved. It is estimated that already EUR 13 billion can be saved by consumers in the EU27 by switching electricity suppliers, and that the opening of EU energy markets to greater competition has resulted in welfare gains of around EUR 2 billion per year. In the future, an increase of 0.6- 0.8% in EU GDP after 10 years could result from liberalising EU gas and electricity markets, while cost savings of up to EUR 30 billion per year in the EU27 and between EUR 12.5-4 billion per year in the EU27 by 2030 could result from the full integration of gas and electricity markets respectively. Other large potential savings estimated include EUR16-30 billion per year in savings in the EU27 if a true common market for renewable energy were established as envisaged by the Renewable Energy Directive by 2030, and EUR 90-127 billion in savings by 2020 as a result of the implementation of the Eco-design Directive. Further details are presented in the table below. 250 Recorded by the European Consumer Centres Network in 2013: http://ec.europa.eu/consumers/ecc/ecc_key_statistics_en.htm. 251 Evidence has been collected to the extent possible regarding key legislative/policy achievements highlighted in the previous sub-section. Despite this, in many cases the evidence collected does not relate to specific policy actions/achievements, as opposed to general developments and actions. ",

        "Contribution of the Internal Market and Consumer Protection to Growth PE 518.762 85 Impacts on other areas In addition to contributing to economic growth, many achievements or policy actions in the energy sector relating to the single market or consumer protection and empowerment contribute to improvements in other areas at the same time, most notably in terms of innovation and sustainability. Specifically, increased levels of competition brought on by further EU market integration is likely to spur on innovation, e.g. through the continued development of smart meters, or smart demand-response devices, which empower end- user consumers reducing their electricity consumption in response to power grid needs, economic signals from a competitive wholesale market or special retail rates. Sustainability is also likely to benefit in the long term as the economic incentives to invest in cleaner and renewable energy become increasingly significant in a competitive, integrated market. Transport Overall, evidence again indicates the potential for significant economic benefits from single market-related actions in the transport area. 252 In the air transport sector, it was estimated that over 1993-2003, the GDP of the EU25 increased by up to 4% and would continue to increase over 2003-2025 by 1.8% as a result of specific supply-side effects of growth in air transport related to liberalisation (business investment and underlying productivity impacts), while demand-side effects could lead to an increase of another 1.3%. The currently proposed policy changes to update the Single European Sky regulations (SES2+, as mentioned above) could result in an increase in EU GDP of EUR 750 million per year by 2020 and EUR 900 million per year by 2030. Full liberalisation of road freight transport could lead to a net benefit in the range of EUR 50-90 billion within the 2015-2035 timeframe, or EUR 2.5-4.5 billion annually. In the railway sector, savings of between EUR 1-2 billion per year could be achieved through further market opening, greater open tendering for public service contracts and continued unbundling until 2034. And in the maritime sector, the liberalisation of provision of port services and increased financial transparency of ports could result in a reduction of total port-related costs by 7%, i.e. EUR 1 billion annually. Further details are in the table below. 252 No evidence was identified concerning impacts of purely consumer protection and empowerment-related actions in the transport sector (i.e. relating to passenger rights).

        "Policy Department A: Economic and Scientific Policy PE 518.762 88 Impacts on other areas Similarly to energy, achievements and policy actions in the transport sector relating to the single market and consumer protection and empowerment are also likely to positively contribute to other areas. Initiatives to further the single European transport area across all modes are on the one hand likely to contribute to innovation in transport services thanks to increased competition. In addition, the continued expansion of the single market for transport services is likely to promote both regional development in supporting better interconnection of areas yet to be sufficiently serviced by transport networks as well as jobs in these areas, thus contributing to greater inclusive growth. However, the overall energy consumption of the transport sector will need to be closely surveyed in light of the growing potential for negative environmental impacts from increasing transport. Transport currently contributes to around a quarter of EU greenhouse gas emissions making it the second biggest greenhouse gas emitting sector after energy, and while emissions from other sectors have generally fallen, those from transport have increased by 36% since 1990. 253 3.4.4. Conclusions on key single market- and consumer protection-related achievements under the flagship initiative and related contributions to growth Significant achievements have been made within the scope of the flagship initiative \u2018Resource-efficient Europe\u2019 in terms of furthering the single market and improving consumer protection and empowerment. These relate to the energy and transport sectors primarily, both of which may have significant potential to contribute to economic growth if the relevant policy actions continue to be implemented. In the energy sector, advances have been made in particular regarding wholesale prices, with major European benchmarks decreasing by 35\u201345% over 2008-2012. The main legislative basis for both the internal energy market and relevant consumer protection and empowerment provisions has largely already been laid, primarily thanks to the adoption of the Third Energy Package, the Energy Efficiency Directive, the TEN-E Regulation and the Renewable Energy Directive. Therefore, and as mentioned by interviewees, greater focus could be placed on ensuring the correct implementation and enforcement of the existing acquis in the sector, rather than initiating new legislative actions. An example of this type of activity that has already been carried out is the adoption of a guidance package on state intervention in electricity markets. Nonetheless, interviewees noted that the existing acquis focuses predominantly on the wholesale level, while work remains to be done at the retail level, as described above (in particular as e.g. retail prices have not mirrored the fall in wholesale prices). As a result, progress in both of these areas, inter alia, remains crucial to securing some of the sector\u2019s growth potential. In particular, there is evidence that the liberalisation of gas and electricity markets could lead to a 0.6-0.8% increase in EU GDP over 2011-2020. As for the transport sector, price data (e.g. for air fares) also point to significant benefits of single market-related reforms. One study in particular has estimated that the supply-side and demand-side effects of air transport liberalisation could, respectively, lead to increases in the EU\u2019s GDP of 1.8% and 1.3% over the time-period 2005-2025. A number of transport modes have now seen multiple waves of internal market legislation, and several major initiatives in the various modal sectors of single market \u2013 rail, air and sea \u2013 have been proposed, as shown above. The adoption and proper implementation of the current proposals could therefore also be a stronger priority, as opposed to fresh policy initiatives. On the other hand, the legislative framework for consumer protection and empowerment in the form of passenger rights is now well-developed; attention could therefore focus on ensuring that rights are adequately upheld to safeguard high levels of consumer satisfaction and trust. 253 See http://ec.europa.eu/clima/policies/transport/index_en.htm for more details.

        "Policy Department A: Economic and Scientific Policy PE 518.762 90 Under this flagship initiative, specific actions for the Commission were outlined with a focus on strengthening the single market. These included: \uf0b7 Developing the Single Market and enforcing intellectual property rights; \uf0b7 Competition policy; \uf0b7 Improving infrastructure; and \uf0b7 Standardisation. Since the initial flagship initiative outlined in 2010, it has been updated twice in subsequent Communications in 2012 and in 2014, particularly in light of the impact of the economic crisis on several Member States, the subsequent economic stagnation in the EU and the deteriorating outlook for the global economy. Proposed measures relevant to the Single Market built upon those proposed in 2010, and in 2012 emphasised improving the internal market for goods; fostering entrepreneurship to render the internal market more dynamic; improving the internal market for technology, the unitary patent and the protection of intellectual property rights; and international markets. 255 In 2014 proposed measures relevant for the Single Market related to completing the integration of networks: information networks, energy and transport; an open and integrated internal market in goods and services; business environment, regulatory framework and public administration in the EU. 256 3.5.2. Achievements relevant to the Single Market and consumer protection & empowerment during the 7 th legislature, and remaining barriers As highlighted above, the relevance of the flagship initiative \u2018An industrial policy for the globalisation era\u2019 for the single market is observed primarily for the goods markets, in particular industrial products, business-related services, intellectual property rights, the business environment, and standardisation. In this section we outline key achievements in these sectors considered to fall within the scope of the flagship initiative \u2018An industrial policy for the globalisation era\u2019 that are relevant for the Single Market or consumer protection & empowerment, along with remaining barriers. 257 Industrial products and standardisation Key achievements in furthering the single market The internal market for products has historically been a main pillar of European economic integration. Intra-EU exports of goods have risen from 12% to 22% as a share of GDP over 1992 to 2012. 258 The figure below presents the evolution of intra-EU trade in goods between 2004 and 2013, divided by sector. As it shows, almost all sectors experienced a growth in intra-EU trade during this period (the only exception being commodities and transactions not classified elsewhere in the standard international trade classification (SITC)). 255 See European Commission, COM (2012) 582 Final - A Stronger European Industry for Growth and Economic Recovery - Industrial Policy Communication Update, 2012. 256 See European Commission, COM (2014) 14/2 - For a European Industrial Renaissance, 2014. 257 While specific policy actions relevant for intellectual property rights are outlined in this flagship initiative, this topic is also a key focus of the \u2018Innovation Union\u2019 flagship; we therefore present relevant achievements in this area in Section 3.2.2.1. Furthermore, the flagship initiative details actions in relation to the energy and transport markets; as noted previously, these are detailed under the flagship initiative \u2018Resource-efficient Europe\u2019 in Section 3.4. 258 OECDstat.

However, there are significant differences between economic sectors. While intra-EU trade increased in almost all sectors covered by Union harmonisation legislation on industrial products between 2000 and 2012, three sectors experienced a reduced intensity of intra-EU trade. 259 These were office machines and automatic data processing, metalworking machinery and photographic apparatus. The Commission notes that the reduced level of intra-EU trade in these sectors could partially be related to the economic and financial crisis of 2008, but also to specific developments, such as the spread of smartphones. 260 Today more than 30 directives and regulations in the area of industrial products are in force, 261 with legislation on the internal market for products providing rules for the circulation of more than 75% of all products in the internal market. 262 The coverage of legislation ranges from specific products such as pressure equipment and gas appliances, to major sector-specific legislation applying in some areas such as construction products. 263 The key horizontal legislation in the area of single market for industrial products was already laid down in 2008, through a package of measures known as the \u2018New legislative framework\u2019, 264 which aimed at improving market surveillance rules, boosting the quality of the conformity assessment of products, clarifying the meaning of CE marking (a conformity 259 European Commission, COM (2014) 25 Final - A Vision for the Internal Market for Industrial Products, 2014. 260 Ibid. 261 Ibid. 262 Based on IMCO Committee policy paper. 263 Ibid. 264 Includes Regulation 756/2008, Decision No 768/2008/EC, and Regulation No 764/2008.

More recently, in order to bring product harmonisation legislation in line with the model provisions of Decision 768/2008/EC, an Alignment Package consisting of eight directives was adopted in February 2014. In addition, the Single Market for Green Products initiative adopted in 2013 proposes a set of actions to overcome barriers to the circulation of these products in the internal market. Among other things, the removal of barriers to the free movement of goods can allow manufacturers to benefit from greater economies of scale, by improving access to markets other than those of the Member States in which they are based. An additional important cross-cutting area of achievement relevant for the single market for industrial products is standardisation: in 2012 the Standardisation Regulation was adopted, which introduced an overhaul of the European standardisation system. As mentioned in the legislation, European standards play a very important role within the internal market, for instance through the use of harmonised standards in the presumption of conformity of products to be made available on the market with the essential requirements relating to those products laid down in the relevant Union harmonisation legislation. Such requirements need to be precisely defined in order to avoid misinterpretation on the part of the European standardisation organisations. 265 The table below describes in further detail key legislative/policy achievements under the 7 th legislature relevant for the single market relating to industrial products, selected on the basis of a review of relevant literature (including key EU policy documents), as well as interviews with academic experts and stakeholders (including the relevant Commission officials). Table 26: Key legislative and policy achievements under the 7th legislature in the industrial products sector relevant for the single market Achievement Key aspects relevant for the single market Adoption of sector- specific industrial products directives, including Alignment Package 266 Over fifteen different new directives or amendments of older directives aimed at harmonising rules on a wide range of industrial products, varying from toys to cableway installations, have been adopted during the period 2009-2014. These include an Alignment Package aimed at bringing specific product harmonisation legislation in line with the reference provisions of Decision 768/2008/EC. 267 Adoption of Construction Products Regulation 268 Aims to ensure reliable information on construction products in relation to their performances. This is achieved by providing a \u2018common technical language\u2019, offering uniform assessment methods of the performance of construction products. 269 265 See Regulation No. 1025/2012. 266 The Alignment Package, adopted on 26 February 2014, consists of the Low Voltage Directive (Directive 2014/35/EU); the Electromagnetic Compatibility Directive (Directive 2014/30/EU); the ATEX Directive (Directive 2014/34/EU); the Lifts Directive (Directive 2014/33/EU); the Simple Pressure Vessels Directive: Directive (2014/29/EU); the Measuring Instruments Directive (Directive 2014/32/EU); the Non-automatic Weighing Instruments Directive (Directive 2014/31/EU); and the Civil Explosives Directive (Directive 2014/28/EU). 267 See European Commission, COM (2014) 25 Final - A Vision for the Internal Market for Industrial Products, 2014; and http://ec.europa.eu/enterprise/policies/single-market-goods/internal-market-for-products/new- legislative-framework/index_en.htm for further details. 268 Regulation No. 305/2011.

Among other things, it sets a directly applicable framework for using harmonised standards in Union harmonisation legislation, and sets obligations to European standardisation organisations and national standardisation bodies on transparency of standardisation processes and on stakeholder participation in European and national standardisation activities. 273 Source: Civic Consulting, based on sources indicated in table. Nonetheless, barriers remain. The EU remains a less integrated market than the US, with trade integration 70% lower in the EU than in the US and the price dispersion for tradable goods between EU capitals higher in the EU than in the US. 274 Recent results show that technical and administrative barriers (comprising product requirements, labelling and packaging) constituted the most frequent barriers to the trade of goods in the single market (56% of total barriers), and were the primary type of obstacle in all goods sectors (except equipment). They were found to be mainly used in the food (35%) and automotive (26%) industries. Government restrictive practices and policies relating to intellectual property rights, monopolies and subsidies accounted for 16% of all barriers, and were mainly used in the health industry. Barriers relating to mutual recognition represented 18% of all barriers, affecting primarily the equipment industry. 275 A recent review of EU internal market legislation on industrial products concluded that the existing legislative framework is relevant to meeting EU objectives relating to the need for technical harmonisation measures with high levels of protection for health and safety, consumers and the environment. It is also marked by a built-in responsiveness to adapt to change. 276 Nonetheless, the assessment and public consultation reportedly identified several problems or points for improvement, entailing a number of recommendations. These related to improving the architecture of EU harmonisation legislation; strengthening the effectiveness of the regulatory framework; strengthening the implementation regime for Union harmonisation legislation; and extending the reach of Union harmonisation legislation on products. 269 See http://ec.europa.eu/enterprise/sectors/construction/legislation/index_en.htm for more details. 270 Based on European Commission, COM (2013) 196 final \u2013 Building the Single Market for Green Products \u2013 Facilitating better information on the environmental performance of products and organisations, 2013. 271 See http://ec.europa.eu/environment/eussd/smgp/ for further details. 272 Regulation No. 1025/2012.

        "Policy Department A: Economic and Scientific Policy PE 518.762 94 The Commission pledged to act by concentrating first and foremost on implementing and enforcing the legislative framework in place. Specifically, it pledged to act by considering ways to strengthen enforcement mechanisms; streamlining and simplifying the existing framework for the marketing of industrial products; better taking into account innovation and technological developments in the elaboration of new proposals relating to industrial products; examining how to improve the interface between manufacturing products and services within the internal market; giving priority to the use of regulations as opposed to directives as the main source of EU law; considering the regrouping of sectoral legislation with other legislation when periodic reviews are carried out; and promoting international convergence in legislation and technical standards for industrial products. 277 Key achievements in improving consumer protection & empowerment Consumer protection and empowerment specifically in the goods sector primarily relates to ensuring the safety and compliance of products and thus the protection of consumers\u2019 health. Ensuring the safety of products contributes to maintaining consumer confidence and trust in the market in order to sustain consumption, especially from a cross-border perspective, which in turn is crucial to economic growth, particularly as consumer spending accounts for 56% of the GDP of the EU. 278 Comprehensive EU legislation in the area of consumer product safety and market surveillance has existed for some time, 279 and has in particular provided the basis of a key achievement, the EU Rapid Alert Exchange Information System (RAPEX). 280 However, outdated rules for a globalised market, the patchwork adoption of legislation over years and differences in their application across Member States have led to fragmentation, gaps and uncertainties. In addition, evidence indicates that the existing rules may not be sufficient. For example, consumer confidence in the safety of products has not increased in recent years: in 2012, 27% of EU consumers surveyed thought that a significant number of non-food products were unsafe compared to 25% in 2011 and 20% in 2010; and in 2012 12% of EU consumers surveyed thought that essentially all products are safe, compared to 16% in 2010. 281 It is notable that in parallel the number of risk notifications sent through RAPEX has increased almost invariably every year (as shown in the graph below), indicating an increasing number of risky products or improved market surveillance. 277 Ibid. 278 European Commission, SWD (2013) 33 Final - Impact Assessment Accompanying the Document Product Safety and Market Surveillance Package, 2013. 279 The General Product Safety Directive 2001/95/EC (GPSD) contains the core safety provisions regarding most non-food consumer products, and also provides the basis for the EU Rapid Alert Exchange Information System (RAPEX). Market surveillance rules are spread across three separate \u2018tiers\u2019 Regulation 765/2008, the General Product Safety Directive and various pieces of product harmonisation legislation. 280 The system facilitates the rapid exchange of information between Member States and the Commission on measures taken to prevent or restrict the marketing or use of products posing a serious risk to the health and safety of consumers with the exception of food, pharmaceutical and medical devices, which are covered by other mechanisms.

These include combating late payments, business services, and entrepreneurship. A common thread to these policy areas is their specific relevance to SMEs, of which the development has traditionally been a key priority for EU industrial policy. Combating late payments A significant impediment to the development of SMEs in the internal market is that commercial transactions between businesses or between businesses and public authorities are in practice made much later than agreed. The costs, particularly for SMEs and businesses selling cross-border can be significant in terms of operating capital; many have gone bankrupt while waiting for payment. As a result, late payments can significantly hinder the free movement of goods and services in the internal market, as well as competition. The graph below shows that reported losses as a result of debts related to late payments has increased from 1.9% in 2004 to 3.1% in 2014. Figure 11: Bad debt loss % 01234 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 Source: Intrum Justitia, European Payment Index 2014 \u2013 Infographics, 2014.

        "Policy Department A: Economic and Scientific Policy PE 518.762 98 expects that if properly implemented, the legislation will result in savings of EUR 180 billion per year due the obligation for public authorities to pay within 30 days. 287 Business services 288 Business-related services, including professional services (e.g. lawyers, architects, tax advisers, consulting agencies, etc.), constitute an important part of the services sector, representing 11.7% of GDP in 2012. 289 They are also specifically relevant for SMEs and businesses operating cross-border. 290 And while business services are covered by the Services Directive in what relates to reduction of administrative barriers to cross-border service provision, they are still confronted to specific barriers relating to e.g. quality standards and international trade issues. As a result, as part of the \u2018An industrial policy for the globalisation era\u2019 flagship initiative the Commission set up a High Level Group (HLG) on business services in 2013, with the aim of helping policy makers better understand the current challenges in the sector and to identifying ways to improve the level of productivity and innovation of business-services. The HLG\u2019s work finished in April 2014; key recommendations to the Commission are expanded upon in the table below. Entrepreneurship The Commission considers entrepreneurship to be a powerful driver of economic growth and job creation in the internal market. 291 However, evidence indicates that in 2009, 45% of Europeans chose self-employment over being an employee; in 2012 this figure stood at 37%. In contrast, the reported proportions for the United States and China were much higher, at 51% and 56% respectively. 292 In light of these considerations, as part of the flagship initiative the Commission established an Entrepreneurship Action Plan. The plan sets out recommendations to Member States to improve the framework conditions and support measures for entrepreneurship as well as actions to stimulate in particular the uptake of digital technologies and e-commerce.

Evidence of impacts on economic growth of actions relevant for the single market or consumer protection In this section we present the evidence collected concerning assessments of impacts on economic growth of actions in areas related to flagship initiative \u2018An industrial policy for the globalisation era\u2019 and relevant for the single market or consumer protection and empowerment. 298 The evidence collected refers variously to impacts on increases in GDP itself as well as factors that are considered to be conducive to economic growth, such as efficiency gains, savings and increases in employment. The collection of evidence is based on an analytical approach combining a comprehensive literature review and interviews, which served to identify and categorise relevant impacts. Results are detailed in the table on the following page. Evidence indicates that full market integration of the goods markets could contribute significantly to economic growth. In particular, one study shows that integration of goods markets in the internal market has yielded 2.2-3.3% higher per capita GDP in the EU. If the current level of integration of goods continues, GDP per capita in the long run could increase by between 2.2-8.8% in the EU. Moreover, full removal of existing non-tariff barriers (NTBs) and barriers to foreign direct investment (FDI) could lead to the creation of 4.6 billion jobs, according to another study. Research also reveals significant savings to be made as a result of the implementation of relevant actions as part of the flagship initiative, such as EUR 180 billion in savings per year due the obligation of the Late Payment Directive for public authorities to pay for services within 30 days. In addition, qualitative impact assessments from the Commission assess that the implementation of the Alignment Package, as well as that of the Product Safety and Market Surveillance Package, will have a variety of positive economic effects, such as increased competitiveness. Finally, increased use of mutual recognition could see bilateral trade in commercial services among EU countries rise by around 30% to 60%, according to a study from 2005. 298 Evidence has been collected to the extent possible regarding key legislative/policy achievements highlighted in the previous sub-section.

        "Contribution of the Internal Market and Consumer Protection to Growth PE 518.762 103 Impacts on other areas In addition to contributing to economic growth, many achievements or policy actions under the industrial policy flagship initiative relating to the single market or consumer protection and empowerment contribute to improvements in other areas at the same time. The Single market for green products initiative, for example, is likely to contribute to enlarging the market for environmentally sustainable products, and thus contribute to sustainable growth. The Entrepreneurship Action Plan, in addition, is aimed at fostering the uptake of digital technologies and e-commerce, and should thus also contribute to boosting innovation. 3.5.4. Conclusions on key single market- and consumer protection-related achievements under the flagship initiative and related contributions to growth A range of achievements have been made within the scope of the flagship initiative \u2018An industrial policy for the globalisation era\u2019 in terms of furthering the single market and improving consumer protection and empowerment. These relate to the market for industrial products on the one hand, as well as other specific areas relevant for the internal market, including combating late payments, business services, and entrepreneurship. In the industrial products market in particular, a major legislative reform package has been proposed to improve the safety of consumer products circulating in the Single Market and market surveillance concerning all non-food products. This is supported by specific legislation harmonising rules for a wide range of industrial products, as well as a cross- cutting regulation on standardisation. Further achievements of the 7 th legislature include the Construction Products Regulation and the Single Market for Green Products initiative, both of which have already been adopted. The European market for goods as already seen significant progress in integration, with intra-EU trade accounting for 22% of EU GDP in 2011. According to one study, integration of the goods market over the period 1960 to 2000 had already led to a 2.3% to 3.3% increase in the EU\u2019s GDP by 2005. However, substantial obstacles remain to intra-EU trade, mostly in the form of technical or administrative barriers. Addressing these barriers could be highly beneficial in terms of growth, as studies show substantial potential future gains in GDP from full integration of the goods markets, possibly as much as a 2.2% to 8.8% increase in the long run. Other areas relevant for the single market have also seen action under this flagship initiative, a major achievement being the Late Payment Directive, which should lead to important savings from the obligation of public authorities to pay for services within shorter deadlines, and thus contribute to sustaining the development of SMEs in the internal market. Further actions taken include setting up a High Level Group on Business Services and the announcement of an Entrepreneurship 2020 Action Plan. 3.6. Flagship initiative 6: An Agenda for New Skills and Jobs 3.6.1. Overview of flagship initiative and progress in achieving Europe 2020 objectives The flagship initiative \u2018An Agenda for New Skills and Jobs\u2019 is focused on raising employment rates in the European Union. While the effect of the economic crisis on European labour markets has been profound and damaging, the flagship initiative sets the ambitious, overarching goal of raising employment rates for women and men to 75% by 2020. It foresees a range of methods to achieve this goal, including the modernisation of labour markets (according to the principle of \u2018flexicurity\u2019), improvements in the skills base of the European workforce, the better anticipation of future skills needs, the encouragement of intra-EU labour mobility to more effectively match labour supply and demand, better quality working conditions and stronger policies to promote job creation (e.g. well-targeted employment subsidies).

This should notably result in the implementation of life-long learning principles (in cooperation with Member States, social partners, experts) including through flexible learning pathways between different education and training sectors and levels and by reinforcing the attractiveness of vocational education and training. Social partners at European level should be consulted in view of developing an initiative of their own in this area; \uf0b7 Ensure that the competences required to engage in further learning and the labour market are acquired and recognised throughout general, vocational, higher and adult education and develop a common language and operational tool for education/training and work: a European Skills, Competences and Occupations framework (ESCO). As of yet, little progress has been made towards reaching the 75% employment rate goal. Indeed, the employment rate has fallen since the beginning of the flagship initiative, from 69% in 2009 to 68.5% in 2010 and 2011, decreasing further to 68.4% in 2012 and 2013. 300 The unemployment rate has meanwhile increased, from 7.1% in 2008 to 10.9% in 2013, with youth unemployment rates particularly high. 301 These developments should be seen within the context of the challenging economic situation of the last few years. Although the EU\u2019s economic performance has improved since suffering a 4.5% contraction of GDP in 2009, its recovery has been sluggish, as the Commission noted in its 2014 stock- taking. 302 Nonetheless, current economic forecasts predict an annual GDP growth rate for the EU of 1.6% for the years 2014-2020, and the Commission foresees that the EU\u2019s employment rate will rise to 72% over this period. This could potentially rise to 74% if national targets are fulfilled, although the Commission notes that national performances are very diverse. 303 299 European Commission, COM (2010) 2020 - Communication on Europe 2020 - A Strategy for Smart, Sustainable and Inclusive Growth, 2010, pp. 18-19 (extracts). 300 Eurostat (Code: t2020_10). 301 European Commission, COM (2014) 130 final/2 - Taking Stock of the Europe 2020 Strategy for Smart, Sustainable and Inclusive Growth, 2014, p. 8. 302 Ibid., pp. 5-6. 303 Ibid., p. 12.

        "Contribution of the Internal Market and Consumer Protection to Growth PE 518.762 105 3.6.2. Achievements relevant to the Single Market during the 7 th legislature, and remaining barriers The main area covered by the flagship initiative \u2018An Agenda for New Skills and Jobs\u2019 that relates to the Single Market is intra-EU labour mobility. None of the actions undertaken within the scope of the flagship initiative relates directly to consumer protection and/or empowerment. In this section we outline key achievements in this area considered to fall within the scope of the flagship initiative \u2018An Agenda for New Skills and Jobs\u2019 that are relevant for the Single Market, along with remaining barriers. Policies to boost intra-EU labour mobility are seen as an important means of encouraging economic growth in the EU. Free movement for workers within the EU can help reduce unemployment by better matching labour demand with labour supply. It also plays a role in absorbing \u2018asymmetric\u2019 economic shocks between different parts of the Union \u2013 the burden on Member States with high levels of unemployment is reduced, while parts of the EU experiencing skill shortages benefit from an increased labour supply. In general, an increase in the mobility of the EU\u2019s workforce should lead to a more efficient allocation of human resources, thereby boosting productivity and growth. Encouraging labour mobility has therefore been a major focus of the flagship initiative \u2018An Agenda for New Skills and Jobs\u2019. One element of this has been the evaluation 304 and subsequent revision of the Professional Qualifications Directive, which was aimed at modernising and simplifying the recognition of qualifications for professionals. Fragmentation in the regulation of professions can be seen as one of the major policy barriers to labour mobility within the EU, 305 with training requirements for particular professions varying greatly between Member States. The Professional Qualifications Directive was adopted in 2005 in order to facilitate recognition of qualifications throughout the EU. However, the procedures foreseen under the directive were found to be cumbersome, which was the main basis for a revision of the directive in 2013. The revised directive aims to make the recognition procedure smoother and places strong emphasis on the use of modern technologies to achieve this. Nonetheless, it is not intended as a radical restructuring of the recognition system, 306 and significant fragmentation remains, according to one study. 307 In addition to the revision of the Professional Qualifications Directive, the Commission has announced proposals to strengthen the pan-European job search network EURES, and already in 2014 a decision was taken by the Parliament and the Council to improve co- operation between public employment services. Moreover, the programme \u2018Your First EURES Job\u2019, launched in 2012, focuses on providing support to young people who wish to take advantage of job opportunities in other Member States (please see Section 3.3.2 on \u2018Youth on the Move\u2019 for further details). The Erasmus for Young Entrepreneurs programme is another targeted mobility scheme for young people, which was initially launched as a pilot project in 2007. It underwent an interim evaluation during the 7 th legislature, with the final report recommending a continuation of support. In addition, the Council Recommendation on establishing a Youth Guarantee also aims (among other things) to encourage mobility, as is likewise the case for the European Alliance for Apprenticeships scheme and the Council Recommendation on a Quality Framework for Traineeships. Meanwhile, the first public release of ESCO 308 in October 2013 should improve the comparability of skills, competences, qualifications and occupations across the EU. 304 European Commission, Evaluation of the Professional Qualifications Directive (2005/36/EC), 2011. 305 OECD, OECD Economic Surveys - European Union, 2014, p. 67. 306 http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_MEMO-13-867_en.htm. 307 European Parliamentary Research Service, The Cost of Non- Europe in the Single Market II - Services, 2014. 308 The European Classification of Skills/Competences, Qualifications and Occupations.

        "Policy Department A: Economic and Scientific Policy PE 518.762 106 Furthermore, policy action in the 7 th legislature has also focused on improving the rights of internal migrants in the EU. In 2013, the Commission released a communication on the free movement of EU citizens, which among other things aimed to clarify their rights and obligations, and the following year a directive was adopted to more effectively enforce the rights of workers living in a Member State other than their own. The rights of posted workers, a specific group of mobile workers, have also been addressed in a new enforcement directive. Finally, actions have also been taken in regard to the social security rights of mobile workers. In particular, a directive has been adopted to improve the protection of their supplementary pension rights. One remaining barrier, however, relates to the access of mobile workers to unemployment and long-term care benefits. For example, a person who goes abroad to look for work in another Member State can currently receive unemployment benefits for a period of only three months (although Member States can chose to extend this to six). A partial revision of Regulations Nos. 883/2004 and 987/2009 relating to coordination of social security schemes is therefore foreseen in order to improve the situation.

Figures apply to the EU27. The figure above displays the evolution of number of EU citizens aged 15-64 living in another Member State between the years of 2007 and 2013. As it shows, there has been an increase over this period, from less than 8 million in 2007 to almost 10 million in 2013. Important causes for this development have been the 2004 and 2007 enlargements, as well as the asymmetric nature of the economic crisis. Nonetheless, even in 2012 only 3.1% of the EU workforce was living in a Member State other than their own. 309 And while annual cross-border mobility in the EU involved only 0.29% of the population in 2010, mobility between the 50 federal states of the US was 2.4%. 310 Moreover, according to a recent Eurobarometer survey (carried out in 2013), only 25% of EU citizens would even consider working in an EU Member State other than their own. 311 The reasons most frequently given for not wanting to work abroad were family/personal reasons (47%), simply not wanting to 309 Dh\u00e9ret, Claire, Alex Lazarowicz, Francesco Nicoli, Yves Pascouau, and Fabian Zuleeg, Making Progress towards the Completion of the Single European Labour Market, 2013, p. 6. 310 Konrad Adenauer Stiftung and Institut der deutschen Wirtschaft Koeln, Europe\u2019s Single Market \u2013 Exploiting Untapped Potentials, 2013, p. 17. 311 TNS Opinion & Social / European Commission, Special Eurobarometer 398 - Internal Market, 2013, p. 53.

Table 30: Key legislative and policy achievements under the 7th legislature in regard to labour mobility relevant for the single market Achievement Key aspects relevant for the single market Adoption of revised Professional Qualifications Directive 313 Aims to modernise the Professional Qualifications Directive in order to achieve greater mobility of skilled workers within the EU. It responds to the need to have a smoother and simpler system of recognition of qualifications, and places emphasis on the use of modern technologies in recognition procedures. Specific elements include the introduction of a European professional card, requirements for Member States to improve access to information about the recognition of qualifications, modernisation of harmonised minimum training requirements, the introduction of common training frameworks, mechanisms to ensure greater transparency and justification of regulated professions and an extension of the scope of the directive to professionals who are not yet fully qualified. 314 Proposal for a Regulation on EURES 315 Would enhance provision of intra-EU labour mobility support services, thus encouraging mobility and increasing access to employment opportunities throughout the Union. Among other things the regulation would allow EURES to offer more job vacancies on its portal (including those from private employment services), carry out automatic matching through job vacancies and CVs, give basic information on the EU labour market and EURES to any jobseeker or employer throughout the Union, offer candidates and employers mobility support services to facilitate recruitment and integrate workers in the new post abroad, and improve coordination and information exchange on national labour shortages and surpluses among EU countries, making mobility an integral part of their employment policies. 316 Establishing the European Classification of Skills/ Competences, Qualifications and Occupations (ESCO) 317 Identifies and categorises skills, competences, qualifications and occupations relevant for the EU labour market and education and training. The system provides occupational profiles showing the relationships between occupations, skills, competences and qualifications. It has been developed in an open IT format, is available for use free of charge and can be accessed through an online portal. By introducing a standard terminology for occupations, skills, competences and qualifications, ESCO can help education and training systems and the labour market to better identify and manage the availability of required skills, competences and qualifications. Its multilingual character facilitates increased international transparency and cooperation in the area of skills and qualifications. 318 312 Ibid., p. 60 313 Directive 2013/55/EU.

These include provisions to guarantee pension rights after a maximum of three years and to ensure that employees\u2019 own contributions cannot be lost. Moreover, the rights of workers who leave an employer-run pension scheme before retirement must be preserved and treated fairly compared to the rights of those workers who remain in the scheme. Additionally, workers have the right to know how potential mobility would affect their pension rights, and those who have left the scheme must be informed about the value of their rights. 320 Adoption of Posting of Workers Enforcement Directive 321 Improves the application of the Posting of Workers\u2019 Directive (96/71/EC) without changing its provisions. It will do this by setting higher standards to inform workers and companies about their rights and obligations; establishing clear rules for cooperation between national authorities in charge of posting; clarifying the definition of posting so as to increase legal certainty and combat abuse; defining the supervisory responsibilities of relevant national authorities; improving the enforcement of workers\u2019 rights and the handling of complaints. 322 Adoption of Directive to Improve Enforcement of Workers Rights 323 Aims to remove existing obstacles to the free movement of workers, such as the lack of awareness of EU rules among employers and the difficulties faced by mobile citizens to get information and assistance in the host Member States. To overcome these barriers and prevent discrimination, the Directive requires Member States to ensure that one or more bodies at national level will provide support and legal assistance to EU migrant workers with the enforcement of their rights and to guarantee effective legal protection of rights and provision of easily accessible information on the rights enjoyed by EU migrant workers and jobseekers. 324 Roadmap for a Partial Revision of Regulations Nos. 883/2004 and 987/2009 325 Would entail a partial revision of the Regulations Nos. 883/2004 and 987/2009 on coordination of social security schemes, with a view to ensuring that persons moving within the EU do not suffer disadvantages in their social security rights. The revision will focus in particular on two areas of social security co-ordination, namely unemployment benefits and long-term care benefits. The roadmap has raised the possibility of extending the mandatory provision of unemployment benefit for EU citizens living in another Member State from three months to six months. 326 Decision on enhanced co- operation between Public Employment Services 327 Aims to help Member States' public employment services to improve their effectiveness through closer cooperation.

        "Contribution of the Internal Market and Consumer Protection to Growth PE 518.762 109 3.6.3. Evidence of impacts on economic growth of actions relevant for the single market In this section we present the evidence collected concerning assessments of impacts on economic growth of actions in areas related to the flagship initiative \u2018An agenda for new skills and jobs\u2019 and relevant for the single market. 329 The evidence collected refers variously to impacts on increases in GDP itself as well as factors that are considered to be conducive to economic growth, such as efficiency gains, savings and increases in employment. The collection of evidence is based on an analytical approach combining a comprehensive literature review and interviews, which served to identify and categorise relevant impacts. Results are detailed in the table on the following pages. Relatively little quantitative evidence was identified about the contribution of intra-EU labour mobility to economic growth. Evidence is particularly sparse regarding specific policy actions that have been taken or are foreseen within the scope of the flagship initiative \u2018An Agenda for New Skills and Jobs\u2019. Although impact assessments are regularly conducted on proposed policy actions, these in many cases do not estimate the potential impact on economic growth. An exception is the Erasmus for Young Entrepreneurs programme, with the interim evaluation study estimating that an increase in the programme to support 10,000 New Entrepreneurs per year (and the same number of Host Entrepreneurs) could lead to the creation of 6000 new jobs annually. Nonetheless, other studies in the scientific and policy literature demonstrate that an increase in labour mobility would be positive for economic growth in the EU. One study identified favourable effects that labour mobility could have on countering asymmetrical economic shocks and reducing labour market disparities. 330 Another has estimated that migration within the EU27/EFTA has already led to a reduction in unemployment by up to 6% over the period 2001- 2010 (as the study points out, this is not insignificant when one considers the low level of intra- EU mobility). It has also been estimated that EUR 1.3 billion was saved by the Spanish government in 2011 alone as the result of avoided expenditure on unemployment benefits for workers who had emigrated to another EU country. 331 A specific aspect of intra-EU labour mobility that has been quite widely addressed by the scientific literature relates to the population flows that resulted from the expansion of the EU in 2004 and 2007. For example, it has been estimated that the long-term effect of the immigration of four million people from the countries that acceded to the EU in 2004 excluding Cyprus and Malta (\u2018the EU8\u2019) could be an additional 0.6% in the enlarged EU\u2019s GDP. Other studies estimate the impact of recent intra-EU mobility between 2004 and 2007 to be an increase in EU GDP of around 0.2% or 0.27% in the long run. It should be noted, however, that these economic gains are not distributed equally throughout the Union: while the GDP of receiving countries may rise, the sending countries may suffer from a drop in overall wealth. Nonetheless, these losses could potentially be off-set by a decline in population and therefore co-exist with an increase in GDP per capita. Moreover, the effect of remittances sent home by mobile workers may also be able to (at least partially) counteract negative economic consequences for the sending countries. 332 A further issue is the potential role that migration from the EU8 and Bulgaria and Romania could play in increasing unemployment and depressing wages in the EU15. However, several studies suggest that these effects would be minimal or non-existent, while overall employment and wage/income trends throughout the EU could be positively affected by migration flows. 329 Evidence has been collected to the extent possible regarding key legislative/policy achievements highlighted in the previous sub-section. Despite this, in many cases the evidence collected does not relate to specific policy actions/achievements, as opposed to general developments and actions. 330 OECD, Migration as an Adjustment Mechanism in the Crisis?

This GDP growth, however, is irregularly distributed throughout the EU: the EU15 grows by 0.13% in the short term and 0.26% in the long-run, while the GDP of the EU8 actually decreases (by 0.52% the short run, 1.10% in the long-run). Nonetheless, GDP per capita increases for the EU8, both in the short-run and the long-run (0.65% and 0.05% respectively). While GDP per capita decreases for the EU15 in the short-term, by 0.09%, in the long-run it increases, by 0.03%. 335 The figure of 0.27% corresponds to a simulation in which it is assumed that the skills distribution among migrant workers is the same as among the local population. The lower figure applies to a simulation in which it is assumed that more migrants are employed in low skilled jobs. There are, however, major differences between the effects on the EU10 and on the EU15. In the first simulation, the GDP of the EU15 would grow by 0.38%, but GDP per capita would sink by 0.12%; for the EU10 the figures are -2.23% and 0.28% respectively. In the second simulation, the figures for the EU15 are 0.31% and -0.18%, but -1.99% and 0.53% for the EU10. ",

        "Policy Department A: Economic and Scientific Policy PE 518.762 112 Impacts on other areas In so far as freedom of movement for workers contributes to fighting unemployment, the positive impact on inclusiveness is clear. The extent to which it would impact on wage levels is less certain, with evidence pointing in contradictory directions, but potentially labour mobility could also play a beneficial role in this regard. 336 Additionally, it could be an important element of encouraging smart growth in the European Union, as an economy based on innovation is strongly dependent on an available supply of researchers. Indeed, encouraging the mobility of researchers has been an important aspect of the flagship initiative \u2018Innovation Union\u2019, which, among other things, has foreseen the creation of a Pan- European Pension Fund for Researchers. Finally, labour mobility also has the potential to promote sustainability, by helping to overcome skills shortages in the green economy. 3.6.4. Conclusions on key single market-related achievements under the flagship initiative and related contributions to growth A number of policy actions were undertaken during the 7 th legislature with a view to encouraging labour mobility in the EU, a central aspect of the flagship initiative \u2018An Agenda for New Skills and Jobs\u2019. Although there is a lack of concrete evidence for the contribution of specific actions to economic growth, research suggests that labour mobility in general can play a positive role for the EU\u2019s economy, in particular in terms of overcoming asymmetrical economic shocks and mismatches of labour demand and supply. According to one study, the long-term effect of the immigration of four million people from the countries that acceded to the EU in 2004 excluding Cyprus and Malta (\u2018the EU8\u2019) could be an additional 0.6% in the enlarged EU\u2019s GDP. Labour mobility in the EU has increased in recent years, driven primarily by the 2004 and 2007 enlargements, as well as the economic crisis. However, it still remains at a relatively low level, as becomes particularly clear when European mobility levels are compared to those in other countries, such as the United States. This can be partially explained by factors such as linguistic barriers and family ties, which are arguably difficult to address with legislation. However, there also exist a number of regulatory obstacles to intra-EU labour mobility, many of which have been the subject of policy action in the last few years. One of the most important recent developments has been the revision of the Professional Qualifications Directive, which aims to overcome some of the barriers to European professionals having their qualifications recognised in other Member States. Other significant achievements include the launch of ESCO and the directives on the rights of posted workers and on improving the acquisition and preservation of supplementary pension rights for mobile workers. However, barriers to cross-border labour mobility remain to be overcome. A priority could be the adoption of the proposed regulation on EURES, which among other things would aim at improving its coverage of job vacancies across the EU (currently it only covers 30% to 40% of vacancies). The proposed revision of Regulation No. 883/2004 and Regulation No. 987/2009 on the coordination of social security systems could also be carried forward. Beyond the adoption of current legislative proposals, there is also scope for new policy ideas, with potential areas for action including career guidance for mobile workers and language education, as well as further simplification of the system for recognition of professional qualifications (e.g. extension of automatic recognition). 336 See Baas, Timo, Andreas Hauptmann, and Herbert Br\u00fccker, \u201cEU Labor Markets After Post-Enlargement Migration: Who Wins, Who Loses?,\u201d in Martin Kahanec and Klaus F.

Overview of flagship initiative and progress in achieving Europe 2020 objectives The flagship initiative \u2018European Platform against Poverty and Social Exclusion\u2019 aims to improve the economic situation and social inclusion of the poorest and most excluded sections of the EU\u2019s population. Activity taken within the scope of the initiative focuses among other things on employment, social protection and essential services (such as pensions and health systems), anti-discrimination policies (for example to address gender inequality and marginalisation of Roma populations) and providing support to the development of social enterprise. Overall, the flagship initiative sets a target of lifting 20 million people out of poverty throughout the European Union by 2020. Box 7: EU goals under the \u2018Platform against Poverty and Social Exclusion\u2019 flagship initiative 337 \uf0b7 Transform the open method of coordination on social exclusion and social protection into a platform for cooperation, peer-review and exchange of good practice, and into an instrument to foster commitment by public and private players to reduce social exclusion and take concrete action, including through targeted support from structural funds, notably the ESF; \uf0b7 Design and implement programmes to promote social innovation for the most vulnerable, in particular by providing innovative education, training and employment opportunities for deprived communities, to fight discrimination (e.g. disabled), and to develop a new agenda for migrants\u2019 integration to enable them to take full advantage of their potential; \uf0b7 Undertake an assessment of the adequacy and sustainability of social protection and pension systems, and identify ways to ensure better access to health care systems. However, little progress has been made so far towards achieving the aims of the flagship initiative. As noted in Section 3.6, unemployment in the EU has increased since 2009, while employment levels have sunk. This has contributed to the growth in the number of people at risk of poverty and social exclusion, which has risen from 114 million in 2009 to over 124 million in 2012. While economic forecasts for the coming years suggest moderate growth for the EU, the Commission does not consider that rapid progress will be made in combating poverty, and is not confident that the headline target for reducing poverty rates (which would entail bringing the number of people at risk of poverty down to 96.4 million) can be met. Nonetheless, it does believe it is realistic to reduce the number of people in the EU at risk of poverty to around 100 million by 2020. 338 3.7.2.

In this section we outline key achievements in these areas considered to fall within the scope of the initiative that are relevant for the single market or consumer protection/empowerment, along with remaining barriers. A substantial component of the flagship initiative \u2018European Platform against Poverty and Social Exclusion\u2019 involves encouraging the growth of social business, a sector which already accounts for 10% of all European businesses and has over 11 million paid employees. 339 One quarter of businesses founded in Europe consist of social enterprises, suggesting that the sector has considerable growth potential. 340 Moreover, employment in Social Economy Organisations (SEOs) grew by 2.6% in 2011, at a time when aggregate unemployment in many areas was on the increase. 341 In recognition of the sector\u2019s potential to contribute to economic growth, as well as its role in combatting poverty and social exclusion, the flagship initiative places priority on improving the framework conditions for social enterprise within the Single Market and ensuring a level playing field. To these ends, the Social Business Initiative was launched in 2011. This contained in total eleven policy proposals, including one for a Regulation on European Social Entrepreneurship Funds, which has already been adopted and is expected to help investors to easily identify funds that focus on investing in social businesses. The Commission has also proposed a Regulation on the Statute for a European Foundation (FE), although this has not been adopted as of yet. However, barriers to the development of social enterprise continue to exist. For example, social businesses can find it difficult to access adequate funding (for more details on access to finance for SMEs see Section 3.2.2.2 on the flagship initiative \u2018Innovation Union\u2019). In addition, more could be done to improve the legal and administrative framework for mutual societies and co-operatives, with the Commission planning a simplification of the European Cooperative Regulation, as well as the creation of a European Mutual Society Statute. Besides measures to encourage social enterprise, other achievements within the scope of the flagship initiative that are relevant for the single market and/or consumer protection include the revised public procurement directives, which include provisions to boost social inclusion, and the Payment Accounts Directive, which provides all citizens with the right to a basic bank account. Finally, a recently adopted directive on disclosure of non-financial and diversity information aims at improving the transparency of certain large companies on social and environmental matters. 339 European Commission, COM (2010) 758 Final - The European Platform against Poverty and Social Exclusion: A European Framework for Social and Territorial Cohesion, 2010, p. 17. 340 European Commission, COM (2011) 682 Final - Social Business Initiative - Creating a Favourable Climate for Social Enterprises, Key Stakeholders in the Social Economy and Innovation, 2011, p. 3. 341 OECD, Job Creation through the Social Economy and Social Entrepreneurship, 2013, pp. 62 \u2013 64.

It contains 11 policy proposals with the aim of improving the access to funding for social businesses, as well as improving their visibility and the legal environment. Some of these measures are listed below, while other measures include the issuing of a European Code of Conduct for Microcredit Provision and the creation of the Social Initiative Europe platform. 343 Adoption of a Regulation on European Social Entrepreneurship Funds 344 Sets out a new \u2018European Social Entrepreneurship Fund\u2019 label, so investors can easily identify funds that focus on investing in European social businesses. Once the uniform requirements defined in the proposal are met, managers of social entrepreneurship funds will be able to use the new label and market their funds across the whole of Europe. 345 Proposal for a Council Regulation on the Statute for a European Foundation (FE) 346 Would make it easier for foundations to support public benefit causes across the EU. The proposal seeks to create a single European legal form - the \u2018European Foundation\u2019 (FE) \u2013 which would be fundamentally the same in all Member States, and would exist in parallel with domestic foundations. Acquiring the status of a European Foundation would be voluntary. 347 Adoption of revised Public Procurement Directives 348 Includes provisions to boost social inclusion. The current contracts' reservation in favour of sheltered workshops has been extended to economic operators whose main aim is the social and professional integration of disabled and disadvantaged workers; and the minimum required percentage of disabled or disadvantaged employees is reduced from 50% to 30%. 349 Adoption of Directive on Payment Accounts 350 Aims to foster the creation of a single market for retail financial services and provides consumers with a right to a basic payment account irrespective of their place of residence or financial situation. It will also improve the transparency of bank account fees and simplify bank account switching. 351 Adoption of Directive on Disclosure of Non-Financial and Diversity Information 352 Proposes to amend existing accounting legislation in order to improve the transparency of certain companies on social and environmental matters. Companies concerned will need to disclose information on their environmental record, social and employee-related issues, respect for human rights, anti-corruption, bribery and diversity. 353 342 Outlined in COM(2011) 682 final.

        "Policy Department A: Economic and Scientific Policy PE 518.762 116 3.7.3. Evidence of impacts on economic growth of actions relevant for the single market or consumer protection In this section we present the evidence collected concerning assessments of impacts on economic growth of actions in areas related to the flagship initiative \u2018European Platform against Poverty\u2019 and relevant to the single market or consumer protection and empowerment. 354 The evidence collected refers variously to impacts on increases in GDP itself as well as factors that are considered to be conducive to economic growth, such as efficiency gains, savings and increases in employment. The collection of evidence is based on an analytical approach combining a comprehensive literature review and interviews, which served to identify and categorise relevant impacts. Results are detailed in the table on the following pages. Although relatively little quantitative evidence could be identified in regard to the contribution of flagship-specific actions to economic growth, there are indications that measures to boost social enterprise could have a positive effect on the EU\u2019s economy. For example, an impact assessment conducted by the Commission on the proposal for a Council Regulation on the Statute for a European Foundation claims that this could potentially create 15,000 new jobs, as well as 15,000 volunteer positions. The impact assessment on the proposal for a Regulation on a European Social Entrepreneurship Fund also foresees positive economic effects, predicting that this would lead to higher investment flows to social business. This, in turn, could benefit the wider economy. Finally, there is much qualitative evidence suggesting that the Directive on Payment Accounts could contribute to economic growth. Lack of access to a bank account can generate a range of additional costs for consumers, for example when paying utility bills, cashing cheques or making bank transfers. Moreover, lack of a debit or credit card can prevent consumers from taking advantage of cheaper products that can only be purchased with these payment methods. Indeed, according to the Commission\u2019s impact assessment for the directive, improving access to bank accounts would help stimulate both domestic and cross-border trade, as more people would be able to make online purchases. A further issue to consider is that people without a bank account are often prevented from taking up employment, as payment of wages is carried out by electronic bank transfer. 355 354 Evidence has been collected to the extent possible regarding key legislative/policy achievements highlighted in the previous sub-section. Despite this, in many cases the evidence collected does not relate to specific policy actions/achievements, as opposed to general developments and actions. 355 European Commission, Financial Services Provision and Prevention of Financial Exclusion, 2008, p. 54.

        "Policy Department A: Economic and Scientific Policy PE 518.762 118 Impacts on other areas Enterprises working in the social business sector have goals other than profit maximisation, often focussing on help to disadvantaged sections of the population. However, they can also be committed to protection of the environment, and the growth of social business (which is an important aspect of the \u2018Platform against Poverty\u2019 flagship initiative) therefore arguably contributes to the sustainability of the European Union\u2019s economy. Furthermore, social and environmental goals can be mutually inclusive, for example in the case of energy efficiency, which besides cutting energy consumption can also bring savings for consumers and help to address fuel poverty. Although the introduction of energy efficiency measures has been discussed in Section 3.4 on \u2018Resource-Efficient Europe\u2019, their implementation is also monitored as part of the \u2018Platform against Poverty\u2019 flagship initiative. 3.7.4. Conclusions on key single market- and consumer protection-related achievements under the flagship initiative and related contributions to growth A central element of the flagship initiative \u2018European Platform against Poverty and Social Exclusion\u2019 that has relevance for the Single Market relates to improving the EU\u2019s legal and administrative framework for social enterprise. The social business sector already accounts for a large portion of economic activity within the European Union and evidence would suggest that it has potential to contribute to growth. Actions under the flagship initiative aim to unleash this potential by removing the barriers that hinder the sector\u2019s development. A key achievement of the flagship initiative was the launch of the Social Business Initiative, which among other things included a proposal for a Regulation on European Social Entrepreneurship Funds. While this has already been adopted, this is not the case for the Council Regulation on the Statute for a European Foundation. In view of the social enterprise sector\u2019s economic potential, the rapid adoption of this proposal could be beneficial. However, other barriers to the sector\u2019s development may also need to be addressed, in particular relating to co-operatives and mutual societies. Activity could focus on simplifying the Statute for a European Co-operative Society and on developing proposals for a European Mutual Society Statue. In addition to social business, a number of other issues that are relevant for the Single Market and consumer protection have been addressed by the flagship initiative. In particular, the Payment Accounts Directive introduces the right to a basic bank account throughout the EU, while the new Procurement Directives stress the importance of social inclusion within procurement procedures. Evidence suggests that the Payment Accounts Directive on will not only improve social and financial inclusion, but also has potential to contribute to economic growth, for example by improving access to online shopping. 3.8. Horizontal single market or consumer protection and empowerment initiatives supporting the flagship initiatives A number of horizontal policy instruments or tools of relevance to the single market or consumer protection and empowerment serve to either complement the flagship initiatives or are integrated as specific actions within the flagship initiatives.

Each Act contains a set of 12 key actions, which were to be adopted either by the end of 2012 (in the case of SMA I) or \u2018within the mandate of [the former] Commission\u2019 (SMA II). Several complementary actions also complete the initiatives: 50 for SMA I and over 10 for SMA II. The key actions and their complementary actions are grouped in 12 categories, or levers, reflecting the Commission\u2019s chosen priorities for improving the single market and stimulating growth arrived at on the basis of public consultation. In the table below we indicate the status of the actions conducted as of June 2014, based on an assessment of the state of play in the implementation of the SMAs, as well as the coverage of the flagship initiatives of each of the actions. As shown, as of June 2014, 9 of the 12 key actions for SMA I and 5\u00bd of the 12 for SMA II had been completed.

Horizontal EU consumer protection and empowerment achievements under the 7 th legislature Several cross-cutting consumer protection and empowerment initiatives, including legislative acts, have been undertaken during the 7 th legislature. The overarching policy initiative is the Commission\u2019s strategic vision for EU consumer policy, the European Consumer Agenda. 358 The Consumer Agenda is designed to complement other initiatives, including the Europe 2020 flagship initiatives and the Single Market Acts (see above), and replaces the Commission\u2019s previous strategy for the 2007-2013 period. The Agenda is built around four main objectives aiming to increase consumer confidence and thereby consumption and growth - these are: reinforcing consumer safety; enhancing knowledge; stepping up enforcement and securing redress; aligning consumer rights and policies to changes in society and in the economy. The attainment of objectives is based on the completion of a series of key actions in a selection of specific sectors: the energy, transport, digital, financial services and food chain sectors. The sectors were selected on the basis of consumers\u2019 perception of their being the most problematic, according to the Consumer Markets Scoreboard, and with the exception of the food chain, they mirror the selection of sectors considered to have the most potential to contribute to growth, if the single market were deepened. 359 The agenda is structured according to 8 specific objectives each comprising specific actions, as follows: 1. Improving the regulatory framework on product and service safety and enhancing the market surveillance framework; 2. Reinforcing safety in the food chain. 3. Improving information and raising awareness of consumer rights and interests among both consumers and traders; 4. Building knowledge and capacity for more effective consumer participation in the market. 5. Effectively enforcing consumer law, focusing on key sectors; 6. Giving consumers efficient ways to solve disputes. 7. Adapting consumer law to the digital age; 8. Promoting sustainable growth and supporting consumer interests in key sectors. In December 2013 the Commission noted that of the 61 actions contained in the Agenda, 50 had been completed by December 2013 and 11 were being pursued. 360 Many of these also fall within the scope of the flagship initiatives. In the following we highlight key horizontal policy and legislative achievements during the 7 th legislature, considering both those occurring prior to the current consumer strategy outlined in the Agenda, and those subsequent to it. As these achievements are not sector- specific, they relate predominantly to general rights, redress, enforcement, and tools for information provision and monitoring.

Parties to a cross-border sales contract anywhere in the EU would be able to choose, by express agreement, to apply the Common European Sales Law. 364 Concerning redress, important achievements include: \uf0b7 The Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) Directive and the Online Dispute Resolution (ODR) Regulation, adopted in 2013. 365 The ADR Directive ensures that disputes between consumers and traders in almost all business sectors can be submitted to an ADR entity (with measures to ensure the quality of ADR entities), while the ODR regulation will set up an EU-wide online platform for disputes arising from online purchases. Both pieces of legislation contain provisions to ensure that consumers are well-informed about the existence of dispute resolution mechanisms. 366 \uf0b7 The Collective Redress Recommendation, adopted in 2013. 367 The recommendation sets out a series of common, non-binding principles for collective redress mechanisms, in order for consumers and businesses to enforce rights granted under EU law in cases where they are infringed, with the aim of ensuring a coherent horizontal approach to collective redress in the European Union without harmonising Member States' systems. 368 Concerning enforcement, important achievements include: \uf0b7 Joint enforcement actions such as sweeps conducted by Member State authorities in the Consumer Protection Cooperation (CPC) Network, involving the screening of online commercial websites in certain sectors to verify their compliance with EU 361 Directive 2011/83/EU. This measure is also identified as an action as part of the Digital Agenda for Europe flagship initiative. 362 Further details can be found in European Commission, Key facts on the new EU Consumer Rights Directive, 2014.

Created in 2002, SOLVIT is an informal alternative to other problem-solving mechanisms such as national court procedures. On 17 September 2013, the Commission adopted a Recommendation on the principles in an effort to help SOLVIT do better in providing citizens and businesses with fast and pragmatic solutions to problems they face Single Market Scoreboard The Single Market Scoreboard (SMS) is an online Commission reporting system. In its present form, the SMS was created in July 2013, merging the previous Internal Market Scoreboard (biannual report on transposition and infringement figures) and separate reports on governance tools such as SOLVIT and IMI. Currently, the SMS covers 13 different tools and is updated on a yearly basis. Your Europe Your Europe is a multilingual web portal aimed at providing citizens and businesses with practical information on their rights and opportunities within the single market. On 17 September 2013 the Commission presented an Action Plan for boosting Your Europe. The Action Plan is to guide the action of the Commission and the Member States in further developing Your Europe at both EU and national level up until the end of 2014. Internal Market Information System The Internal Market Information system (IMI) is an IT-based information network that links up national, regional and local authorities across borders. It enables those authorities to communicate and exchange information among themselves and with the Commission, and to engage in a more efficient day-to-day cooperation in the implementation of the internal market legislation. Recently adopted Regulation No. 1024/2012 (the IMI Regulation) provides a comprehensive legal framework for the operation of IMI which is currently being expanded to encompass new legislative areas and sectors. Points of Single Contact The Services Directive provides for Points of Single Contact (PSC) to be set up in each Member State. PSCs allow service providers to: Obtain all information about the procedures they need to complete to provide their services at home or in another EU country (e.g. company registration, business licences, recognition of professional qualifications); Deal with all formalities via one single contact point; and Complete the necessary steps remotely by electronic means. EU Pilot The \u2018EU Pilot\u2019 project was introduced by the Commission with a number of volunteer Member States in 2008. \u2018EU Pilot\u2019 is an online platform which Member States and Commission's services use to communicate and clarify the factual and legal background of problems arising in relation to the conformity of national law with EU law or the correct application of EU law. As a general rule, EU Pilot is used as a first step to try to resolve problems, so that, if possible, formal infringement proceedings are avoided. Currently all 28 Member States are participating in EU Pilot.

THE SINGLE MARKET AND CONSUMER PROTECTION & EMPOWERMENT BEYOND THE FLAGSHIP INITIATIVES KEY FINDINGS \uf0b7 The services sector has been highlighted by the Commission as one of a few key sectors in which further deepening of the single market could lead to substantial gains in terms of growth. The Services Directive, adopted in 2006, constitutes the main horizontal internal market-related legislation in place for the sector. It is estimated that full implementation of the Services Directive by Member States in only a selection of the sectors covered by it could increase EU GDP by 2.6% in the long run. \uf0b7 Regarding financial services, the Commission has acted in developing a substantial regulatory reform agenda in response to the financial crisis. Legislative achievements at the retail level relevant for the single market include the Mortgage Credit Directive (MCD) and the Payment Accounts Directive (PAD). According to one estimate, fully integrated financial markets could induce a rise in EU GDP of 1.1% in the long run. \uf0b7 The main existing legislation on public procurement was revised during the 7th legislature as part of a comprehensive modernisation package, which could contribute to addressing barriers to a single procurement market. If cost savings already achieved for procurement contracts published at EU level could be achieved for all public procurement, EU GDP could increase by 0.5%, according to one estimate. \uf0b7 The Mutual Recognition Regulation is the main legislative achievement serving to uphold the principle of mutual recognition. According to the impact assessment that accompanied the initial proposal, successfully ensuring the perfect operation of mutual recognition inside the EU could produce a maximum possible one-off increase in EU GDP of 1.8%. \uf0b7 Taxation is also a tool that can contribute to furthering the single market. Among other things, policy action during the 7th legislature has aimed at revising the VAT system. One study has estimated that implementation of the VAT Directive could potentially lead to an increase of 1% in the EU\u2019s GDP, with 0.3% of GDP growth lost due to inefficient implementation. \uf0b7 Competition policy aims to ensure a level-playing field that can facilitate the provision of goods and services across borders and thus strengthen the single market. An achievement of the 7th legislature relates to the ongoing modernisation of state aid policy. In addition, competition decisions taken by the Commission in 2011 concerning horizontal mergers are estimated to have led to consumer savings of EUR 4 billion. \uf0b7 Similarly, an open trade policy is an important complement to furthering the single market, and also holds potential for a major contribution to growth. An agreement to lower barriers between the US and the EU could boost the EU\u2019s GDP per capita by between 2% and 3.5%, although strong concerns exist regarding the impact of such an agreement on consumer protection. In this section we briefly further elaborate on relevant sectors or cross-sectoral policy areas that have not explicitly or comprehensively been the focus of the flagship initiatives, but which feature important policy actions or achievements relevant for the single market or consumer protection for which evidence exists of past or potential future contributions to ",
        "Contribution of the Internal Market and Consumer Protection to Growth PE 518.762 127 economic growth. 372 These include services falling within the scope of the Services Directive, retail financial services, public procurement and concessions, the principle of mutual recognition, taxation and the business environment, and linkages to other cross- cutting policy areas such as competition and trade policy. 4.1. Services under the Services Directive The production and consumption of services constitutes a substantial proportion of the EU economy: excluding government and public services, they account for 71% of EU GDP. In addition, on average 67% of employment in the Member States is in the services sector. 373 The services sector has been highlighted by the Commission as one of a few key sectors in which further deepening of the single market could lead to substantial gains in terms of growth. 374 The Services Directive, adopted in 2006, constitutes the main horizontal internal market- related legislation in place for the services sector. It applies to a wide range of services, including the professional and business services, 375 construction and crafts, real estate, retail and tourism. Together, the services covered by the directive amount to 46% of EU GDP. 376 Other services, however, are explicitly excluded; these include financial services, electronic communications, transport, healthcare, audio-visual services, and others (but these are mostly covered by other specific EU internal market legislation). The main aims of the directive are to establish a general legal framework promoting the exercise of the freedom of establishment for service providers and the free movement of services, while maintaining a high quality of services. It aims to help businesses set up and provide services across borders through a range of provisions, inter alia by prohibiting Member States from imposing restrictions upon incoming service providers (with some exceptions), and requiring them to set up one-stop-shops through which incoming service providers can complete all necessary procedures \u2018points of single contact\u2019. It is also relevant to consumer protection and empowerment e.g. by affirming the right of recipients to use the services of other Member States, and by establishing the right to obtain information on the rules applicable to providers and the services they offer. 377 Initial implementation of the directive is considered to have brought major benefits in terms of removing discriminatory barriers. 378 The EU-level impact on GDP under the status of implementation in 2011 was estimated to be a 0.8% increase, with the majority of the effect materializing during the first 5 years following implementation (although the overall impact could potentially be higher, as this study did not cover all service sectors covered by the Services Directive). 379 Despite this, intra-EU trade in the Single Market for the services 372 The distinction between initiatives that are/are not explicitly covered by the flagship initiatives is not made for cross-cutting policy actions, which are presented separately in the previous Section 3.8. In addition, figures concerning potential impacts of achievements/actions in specific policy areas on growth discussed in this section are provided for illustrative purposes only, and should not be considered to be based on an exhaustive review of the available literature for those policy areas. 373 European Commission, Services: Tapping the Potential for Growth and Jobs, 2014. 374 See European Commission, COM (2012) 259/2 - Better Governance for the Single Market, 2012. 375 Note that business-related services are covered under the \u2018An industrial policy for the globalisation era\u2019 flagship initiative; see Section 3.5.2. 376 European Commission, Services: Tapping the Potential for Growth and Jobs, 2014. The break-down by services is the following: Tourism (3.2% EU GDP), cultural and sport activities (1.4% EU GDP), wholesale and retail (11.1% EU GDP), construction (6% EU GDP), real estate (10.9% EU GDP), business services (11.7% EU GDP), other services (e.g. repair) (1.6% EU GDP). 377 See http://europa.eu/legislation_summaries/internal_market/single_market_services/l33237_en.htm for more information. 378 European Commission, COM (2012) 261 Final - A Partnership for New Growth in Services 2012-2015, 2012. 379 Monteagudo, Josefa, Aleksander Rutkowski, and Dimitri Lorenzani, The Economic Impact of the Services Directive: A First Assessment Following Implementation, 2012.

While all Member States have now transposed the directive, the Commission has identified many instances of inconsistent implementation or applications as well as infringements in several Member States, relating to e.g. discrimination on grounds of residence or nationality, and has launched almost 40 investigations on this basis. 382 To redouble efforts, the Commission produced an action plan for implementation of the Services Directive in 2012, including a zero-tolerance policy for non-compliance through infringement procedures. 383 Many estimates of the economic impact of the implementation of the Services Directive have been conducted. 384 The most recent evidence, from the Commission, indicates that if the Services Directive were to be fully implemented by Member States, in particular with close to a full elimination of sectorial barriers as well as the full implementation of the Points of Single Contact, the additional contributions to growth would amount to 1.8% of GDP, on top of the 0.8% mentioned above, for a total of contribution of 2.6% since implementation of the Directive (again only for a selection of service sectors covered by the Directive). 385 It is also estimated that if the service sectors not covered by the study but within the scope of the Services Directive were to be considered as well, the total long-run effect on GDP would be doubled, i.e. 5.2%. 386 In parallel to the ongoing implementation of the Services Directive, other specific policy and legislative achievements have been made under the 7 th legislature to deepen services market integration that do not explicitly fall within the scope of the flagship initiatives. A key area is the retail and wholesale services sector, representing 11% of EU GDP and accounting for almost 15% of EU employment. 387 In 2013 the Commission adopted a European Retail Action Plan providing a roadmap towards a single market in retail, complementing and going beyond the Services Directive in the sector. Its aim is to address two main challenges - (i) restrictions on establishment; and (ii) lack of competitiveness in the retail sector, in particular in some Member States, and a need to lower barriers and reduce operational restrictions. Consumer protection and empowerment is in particular strongly emphasised in the 11 concrete policy actions proposed, as one of the five priorities acting as a basis for the policy actions concerns \u2018empowering consumers\u2019. 388 There are indications that increased consumer protection & empowerment in the retail services sector could have positive economic impacts, as established by a recent study 380 European Commission, COM (2013) 785 Final - A Single Market for Growth and Jobs: An Analysis of Progress Made and Remaining Obstacles in the Member States - Contribution to the Annual Growth Survey 2014, 2013.

The assessment is based on an ambitious scenario where Member States move to the level of restrictions of the five best countries in the EU per sector, considered to be essentially close to a full elimination of barriers, which would bring additional gains amounting to 1.6%. The remaining 0.2% would be achieved through the full implementation of the Points of Single Contact. 386 As pointed out in European Parliament, European Added Value Assessment: Better Governance of the Single Market, 2013. 387 European Commission, COM (2013) 36 final \u2013 Setting up a European retail action plan, 2013. 388 Ibid.

The reform measures were based on four main pillars: financial stability; financial integration (including deepening the EU single market in financial services); market integrity and confidence (including consumer protection measures); and efficiency. 392 Policy actions related to the single market and consumer protection and empowerment in financial services therefore hold significant importance in the Commission\u2019s financial regulatory reform agenda. And similarly to the services markets, the Commission has specifically identified the financial services sector as one in which further deepening of the single market could lead to substantial contributions to growth. 393 Single market- or consumer protection-related policy actions in the financial services area are linked to several of the flagship initiatives, but are not explicitly prioritised in any single flagship initiative in particular. In addition, while many achievements during the 7 th legislature that are relevant for a single market for financial services have materialised, they vary in the extent to which they can be considered to directly support both the single market (in the sense of provision of and use of basic financial services cross-border) and consumer protection and empowerment, as opposed to a more indirect link. In this section, we therefore focus on policy and legislative achievements at the retail level, which have both clear and direct links to the single market and consumer protection and empowerment (even if at the wholesale level and the infrastructure level relevant achievements can have strong implications, but of a more indirect nature, for the single market and consumer protection and empowerment in the financial services sector). As part of the Commission\u2019s financial regulatory reform agenda, a substantial number of major policy and legislative achievements at the retail level have materialised under the 7 th legislature relevant for the single market and consumer protection and empowerment in the financial services sector: \uf0b7 The Mortgage Credit Directive (MCD) was adopted in 2014. 394 It aims to create an EU-wide mortgage credit market with a high level of consumer protection. \uf0b7 The Payment Accounts Directive (PAD) was adopted in 2014. 395 It provides EU consumers with a right to a basic payment account regardless of their place of residence or financial situation. It also aims to improve the transparency of bank account fees and facilitate switching of bank accounts. The initiative also corresponds to key action 12 of the Single Market Act II, and is highlighted as an action under the European Platform against Poverty flagship initiative. 396 \uf0b7 The Deposit Guarantee Schemes Directive (DGSD) was adopted in 2014, revising a previous directive on deposit guarantee schemes. 397 It aims to strengthen the 390 European Commission, Special Eurobarometer 373 \u2013 Retail financial services, 2012. 391 See the Consumer Markets Scoreboards. 392 For a detailed overview of the main achievements as part of the EU financial regulation agenda as well as information on their economic impacts, see European Commission, SWD (2014) 158 final \u2013 Economic Review of the Financial Regulation Agenda, 2014. 393 European Commission, COM (2012) 259/2 - Better Governance for the Single Market, 2012. 394 Directive 2014/17/EU 395 Directive 2014/92/EU. 396 \u2018Present in 2011 a legislative initiative to ensure access to certain basic banking services and call on the banking sector to submit a self-regulatory initiative geared towards improving the transparency and comparability of bank charges.\u2019 397 Directive 2014/49/EU.

Other achievements provide important stimulus to the single market for retail financial services and related consumer protection and empowerment indirectly, by increasing the stability and resilience of financial market infrastructures, including in particular: \uf0b7 The revised Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (MiFID2) and Regulation on markets in financial instruments, adopted in 2014. 401 The legislation strengthens organisational requirements and safety standards across all EU trading venues and extends trade transparency requirements to bond and derivatives markets, inter alia; \uf0b7 The Capital Requirements Regulation and Directive (CRR/CRD IV), adopted in 2013 and replacing the previous capital requirements directives. 402 The legislation transposes the global standards on bank capital (based on the Basel III agreement) into EU law; and \uf0b7 The establishment of a single rulebook ensuring a single regulatory framework uniformly applied across the EU, based on: 403 o A Banking Union founded on two pillars: a Single Supervisory Mechanism (SSM), and a Single Resolution Mechanism (SRM); and o A European System of Financial Supervisors (ESFS), on the basis of three European supervisory authorities: the European Banking Authority (EBA); the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) and the European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority (EIOPOA), in operation since January 2011. Evidence of the benefits of financial integration for economic growth can be identified across several studies. A study in 2002 estimated that fully integrated financial markets could induce a rise in GDP of 1.1% in the long run. 404 According to a study from 2004, an increase in financial integration that would give firms access to a financial market similar to that of the US could have a positive impact of 0.6% or 0.7% per year on the growth of Europe\u2019s manufacturing industry. 405 More recently, Commission simulations estimate that the higher bank capital requirements of the CRD IV package as well as the bail-in and 398 See COM (2013) 0547 final and COM (2013) 0550 final. 399 See COM (2012) 352 final. 400 Regulation No. 248/2014 amending Regulation No. 260/2012. 401 Directive 2014/65/EU and Regulation No. 600/2014. 402 Directive 2013/36/EU and Regulation No. 575/2013 repealing Directive 2006/48/EC and Directive 2006/49/EC. 403 For more information see http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/finances/banking-union/index_en.htm. 404 London Economics / PWC / Oxford Economic Forecasting, Quantification of the Macro-Economic Impact of Integration of the EU Financial Markets, 2002. 405 Guiso, Luigi, Tullio Jappelli, Mario Padula, and Marco Pagano, Financial Market Integration and Economic Growth in the EU, 2004.

        "Contribution of the Internal Market and Consumer Protection to Growth PE 518.762 133 4.3. Public procurement and concessions Public procurement can be defined as the process whereby public authorities or certain private entities buy goods, services or works. A single EU market for public procurement can therefore be understood as a market in which the purchase and sale of goods, services and works between their providers and public authorities or certain private entities can be conducted across Member States\u2019 borders in the same way as purely national public procurement activities. A number of major legislative achievements in the public procurement area have occurred under the 7 th legislature. As shown in Sections 3.1, 3.2 and 3.7, these achievements also come within the scope of the Digital Agenda for Europe, Innovation Union and European Platform Against Poverty flagship initiatives. However, these relate primarily to the aspects/sectors specific to those flagship initiatives (i.e. digital, innovation, and social inclusion aspects); other aspects/sectors of public procurement are not explicitly covered in the flagship initiatives. Here we therefore expand upon the legislation as a whole. The main existing legislation, the Classic Directive on procurement by public authorities 410 and the Utilities Directive on procurement by entities operating in the water, energy, transport and postal services sectors 411 was revised in 2014 as part of a comprehensive modernisation package. The revised directives 412 introduce a number of simplified rules and procedures, as well as broaden the possibilities for negotiation. The documentation required is reduced, notably through the compulsory acceptance of self-declarations from bidders (through a standardised European Single Procurement Document). The mandatory use of electronic communication in public procurement applies from September 2018. The revision of the directives also corresponds to key action 12 of the Single Market Act I. In addition, as part of the package the Concessions Directive was adopted, 413 which establishes a single EU-wide instrument regulating the competitive award of concessions contracts. Complementing the package is the e-Invoicing Directive, also adopted in 2014, 414 which calls for the development a European standard for e-invoicing, and obliges all contracting authorities and contracting entities across the EU to receive and process e-invoices complying with the future standard, and also corresponds to key action 10 of the Single Market Act II. The market for public procurement represented approximately 19% of EU-wide GDP in 2009. 415 However, less than 4% of the value of public procurement contracts in the EU is awarded to firms from another Member State; 416 it is therefore hoped that the reforms will contribute to addressing these barriers to further the single market, through increasing the share of foreign suppliers in the procurement process. Research shows that single-market related reforms in public procurement could have substantial effects on growth and savings. For example, one estimate indicates that the requirement for all contracts above a certain price threshold to be both open to competition from other Member States and publicly advertised has caused a price reduction of 6%. 417 An evaluation of the two original public procurement directives found that costs had been driven down by around 4-5% for 410 Directive 2004/18/EC 411 Directive 2004/17/EC. 412 Directive 2014/24/EU replacing directive 2004/18/EC and Directive 2014/25/EU replacing directive 2004/17/EC. 413 Directive 2014/23/EU. 414 Directive 2014/55/EU. 415 Beuter, Rita, European Public Procurement: Time for Reform?, 2011. 416 OECD, Public Procurement for Sustainable and Inclusive Growth, 2012. 417 EPRS, European Added Value in Action, 2013.

        "Policy Department A: Economic and Scientific Policy PE 518.762 134 those contracts published at EU level, generating savings of approximately EUR 20 billion. It estimated that this would allow for an increase of 0.08-0.12% in GDP after one decade, corresponding to 160-240 000 jobs. 418 Another study considers that the increase in GDP calculated by the evaluation only realises half of the maximum potential increase, and that GDP could rise by another 0.1 percentage points if the share of cross-border procurement in the public sector were as high as it is in the private sector is, for a total of roughly 0.2%. 419 In addition, it is estimated that if savings were realised for all public procurement (i.e. not only those published at EU level), gains could be as high as a 0.5% increase in GDP and employment. 420 More recently, a recent report estimated annual savings resulting from EU procurement legislation to be between EUR 6.4 billion and EUR 35.5 billion (not including the effects of the revised directives, which have to be transposed by April 2016). Further savings that could be achieved by addressing remaining gaps were assessed to be EUR 36.5 billion to EUR 66.5 billion annually. However, it stressed that not all of these costs could be eliminated, as they are partly due to \u2018natural\u2019 barriers (such as language difficulties), rather than legislative obstacles. In so far as legislative barriers do remain, the report assessed that some of these would be addressed by the new directives, in particular procedural costs, the difficulty of integrating strategic goals into procurement and the limited nature of legislation on concessions. Nonetheless, it found that the new legislation may not sufficiently address lack of clarity regarding the scope of certain regulations and procedures, and does not introduce an \u2018EU procurement passport\u2019. The report, therefore, concludes that more could be done to improve the access of SMEs to cross-border procurement markets. 421 The table below provides further details on evidence of impacts.

Mutual recognition Mutual recognition concerns the principle that a product lawfully marketed in one Member State and not subject to EU harmonisation should be allowed to be marketed in any other Member States, even in cases where the product does not entirely comply with technical rules in the Member State of destination. Upholding the principle thereby contributes to ensuring the free movement of goods in the internal market, as it facilitates market access in other Member States. The main legislative achievement serving to uphold the principle is the Mutual Recognition Regulation. 422 Key aspects of the regulation are the requirement for Member States to have a product contact point for free information for business and reference to the competent authorities; and a requirement that national authorities set out in writing the precise reasons - technical or scientific - for their intention to deny the product access to the national market. It thus shifts the burden of proof for market access to the Member State, as opposed to the company that wishes to gain market access. The need to ensure the correct application of the Mutual Recognition Regulation is not indicated as a specific policy measure to be conducted as part of the flagship initiatives, even if referred to as one of the pillars of the internal market for industrial products. As mentioned previously, barriers relating to mutual recognition have been found to represent 18% of all intra-EU barriers to trade in goods, affecting primarily the equipment industry. 423 422 Regulation No 764/2008. 423 See Egan, Michelle, and Helena Guimaraes, Tackling Barriers to Trade in the Single Market, 2014 for more details.

Taxation and other aspects of the business environment Responsibility for tax policy in the European Union remains to a large extent in the hands of the Member States, in particular for direct taxation. However, the Commission considers it essential that tax policy supports the EU\u2019s broader policy objectives, including economic growth and the extension of the single market. 427 This implies the need for a large degree of co-ordination and in some cases for harmonisation. A number of cross-border tax obstacles that hinder the functioning of the single market have been identified by the Commission, including double taxation, difficulties in claiming tax refunds, complicated VAT rules that hamper cross-border e-commerce, and difficulties in obtaining information on foreign tax rules. 428 A separate issue, which has implications for taxation, involves combatting the shadow economy. This is viewed as necessary in order to create a level playing field in the single market, but could also lead to greater tax revenues. While taxation has played a relatively minor role in the Europe 2020 flagship initiatives, the Commission has nonetheless foreseen that it could be used as a cross-cutting policy tool to both strengthen the single market and achieve other goals, such as improving resource efficiency and boosting innovation. 429 Taxation was included as the ninth lever of the Single 424 European Commission, COM (2007) 36 final / SEC (2007) 112 - Impact Assessment accompanying document to the Proposal for a Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council laying down procedures relating to the application of certain national technical rules to products lawfully marketed in another Member State and repealing Decision 3052/95/EC, 2011, as highlighted in Copenhagen Economics, Delivering a stronger Single Market, 2012. 425 Kox, Henk, and Arjan Lejour, Regulatory Heterogeneity as Obstacle for International Services Trade, 2005. 426 European Commission, COM (2014) 25 Final - A Vision for the Internal Market for Industrial Products, 2014. 427 European Commission, COM (2001) 260 final \u2013 Tax policy in the European Union priorities for the years ahead, 2001. 428 European Commission, COM (2010) 769 - Removing cross-border tax obstacles for EU citizens, 2010. 429 European Commission, COM (2010) 2020 - Communication on Europe 2020 - A Strategy for Smart, Sustainable and Inclusive Growth, 2010.

The proposal, presented by the Commission in 2011, includes new rules to better take into account the carbon footprint and energy content of energy products. 430 Complementary actions foreseen in the Single Market Act I included putting in place a Common Consolidated Corporate Tax Base (CCCTB), revising the VAT system and addressing cross-border fiscal obstacles. The Commission\u2019s proposal for a CCCTB aims to introduce a single set of rules that companies operating within the EU could use to calculate their taxable profits, as well as a \u2018one-stop-shop\u2019 system for filing their tax returns, but has not yet been adopted. 431 In regard to VAT, the Commission adopted a Communication in 2011 setting out the elements of a strategy to make the system more efficient, which was welcomed by the Council in its conclusions from 2012. 432 Progress has also been made in regard to cross-border fiscal obstacles, including the launch of a consultation on tax problems faced by EU citizens when active across borders within the EU. However, a number of actions foreseen to reduce cross-border obstacles, including a proposal to create binding arbitration in cross- border tax disputes, have not yet been implemented. 433 Besides taxation, other aspects of the business environment have also been addressed during the 7 th legislature, with the goal of fostering economic growth and strengthening the single market. In particular, by removing administrative burdens the Commission aims to encourage economic activity and free movement throughout the Union. 434 In addition to those actions falling within the scope of the flagship initiatives that contribute to the business environment (e.g. improving access to finance), a number of other actions have also been taken. For example, the Single Market Act I foresaw improvements in the regulatory environment for businesses, with a particular focus placed on simplification of the directives on accounting standards. A new directive was adopted in 2013, 435 which merged the two previous Accounting Directives and aims to reduce disproportionate administrative costs imposed on small companies. Another area that has received attention relates to the modernisation of EU insolvency rules. Increasing numbers of European companies conduct business activities in EU Member States other than those in which they are based. If these companies go insolvent this could potentially impact on the functioning of the single market. Currently, about a quarter of bankruptcies in the EU have a cross-border element, with cross-border insolvencies proceedings involving around 55,000 companies per year. 436 Although rules already exist to deal with cases of cross-border insolvency, i.e. the European Insolvency Regulation, the Commission has proposed a modernisation of the legislation, with the goal of helping businesses overcome financial difficulties while protecting the interests of creditors (this proposal corresponds to the seventh key lever of the Single Market Act II). As of 10 June 2014 the proposal was awaiting its first reading in the Council. 437 In terms of contribution to economic growth, a number of studies have provided quantitative estimates of gains that could be achieved due to policy action regarding 430 COM (2011) 169/3. 431 European Commission, COM(2011) 121/4 \u2013 Proposal for a Council Directive on a Common Consolidated Corporate Tax Base (CCCTB), 2011. 432 European Commission, COM (2011) 851 final - Towards a simpler, more robust and efficient VAT system tailored to the single market, 2011. 433 For an overview see European Commission, \u2013 DG Taxation and Customs Union, Management Plan 2014, 2014, and European Parliament, Single Market Act: State of Play, 2014. 434 European Commission, COM (2011) 206 Final - Single Market Act - Twelve Levers to Boost Growth and Strengthen Confidence, 2011. 435 Directive 2013/34/EU. 436 http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_MEMO-14-397_en.htm. 437 European Parliament, Single Market Act: State of Play (updated 10 June 2014), 2014.

        "Contribution of the Internal Market and Consumer Protection to Growth PE 518.762 139 other various growth drivers \u2013 such as inducing effects relating to resource efficiency, replacement, innovation, and investment \u2013 competition policy contributes to growth. 438 Competition policy is a key policy strand for which the EU enjoys overarching competence in a number of areas. The main competition instruments at its disposal include antitrust, merger control, state aid, liberalisation and sector-specific regulatory measures. 439 While competition policy is considered a component of some of the flagship initiatives \u2013 in particular \u2018Innovation Union\u2019 as well as the \u2018An industrial policy for the globalisation era\u2019 mainly in relation to collaborative IPR agreements and the modernisation of the state aid research and development framework \u2013 the cross-cutting importance of competition policy for the single market in the flagship initiatives across all sectors is not made explicit. A competition policy instrument that is of specific importance for the single market is state aid control, i.e. the control of financial support Member State governments provide to domestic companies that may induce an advantage over foreign competitors. The Commission notes that Member States have decreased illegal state aid from 0.28% of GDP in 1996-2000 to 0.08% in 2009. 440 A major future potential achievement relevant for the single market that is not explicitly highlighted in the flagship initiatives is the modernisation of the state aid control framework across a range of sectors proposed in 2012. 441 The modernisation has three main, closely linked objectives: foster growth in a strengthened, dynamic and competitive internal market; focus enforcement on cases with the biggest impact on the internal market; streamlined rules and faster decisions. It is expected that following the implementation of the reform, state aid control would more effectively target sustainable growth-enhancing policies while encouraging budgetary consolidation, limiting distortions of competition and keeping the single market open. 442 While quantitative estimates of potential impacts on EU GDP were not identified, a substantial body of empirical research indicates that competition policy and competition in general can contribute significantly to economic growth. A number of relevant studies, some of which are summarised in the table below, have made a link between increased competition and increased productivity. One study, furthermore, that analysed the impact of product market reforms undertaken in the European Union over the 1980s and 1990s has argued that competition leads to higher levels of employment and investment, as well as bringing prices closer to marginal costs. Two recent studies have also made a direct link between a strong state competition policy and positive economic developments. Finally, evidence suggests that competition policy can bring benefits for consumers. For example, the Commission estimates that its competition decisions in 2011 concerning horizontal mergers led to consumer savings of EUR 4 billion. 438 As noted in Copenhagen Economics, The Contribution of Competition Policy to Growth and the EU 2020 Strategy, 2013. 439 Copenhagen Economics, The Contribution of Competition Policy to Growth and the EU 2020 Strategy, 2013. 440 European Commission, 20 Years of the European Single Market - Together for New Growth - Main Achievements, 2012. 441 As outlined in COM (2012) 0209 final. 442 See for more http://ec.europa.eu/competition/state_aid/modernisation/index_en.html information.

Linkage to trade policy Similarly to competition policy, an open trade policy is also an important complement to furthering the single market, and also holds potential for strong contribution to growth. Completing the single market and building stronger trade ties with the world are considered mutually reinforcing goals. 443 In particular, similarly to the internal market, lowering external barriers to trade e.g. through the use of bilateral or multilateral trade agreements and promoting the alignment of global standards with EU standards, helps to further integrate EU firms in global value chains, thus further contributing to competition, productivity and innovation in the internal market. 444 443 OECD, OECD Economic Surveys - European Union, 2014. 444 Ibid.

        "Contribution of the Internal Market and Consumer Protection to Growth PE 518.762 141 For these reasons, the European Union supports a policy of free trade with a number of its economic partners. Already almost three-quarters of imports into the EU either pay no duties or pay at a reduced rate, 445 and negotiations are currently taking place with a number of countries to further liberalise trade. Current trade policy focuses on the EU\u2019s major and established economic partners, in particular the United States, Canada and Japan, with efforts also being made to strengthen ties with emerging economies. In regard to the Europe 2020 strategy, external policy instruments such as trade policy are considered to play a supporting role as an EU-level instrument. However, the inclusion of specific actions relating to the linkage between e.g. trade policy and the single market is not explicit in the flagship initiatives. In its stock-taking of the strategy, the Commission underlined the need to further link the internal and external EU agenda better, noting that \u201ctrade has become a crucial lever for growth and jobs due to the role of external demand and the wide scale of the EU agenda.\u201d 446 Quantitative estimations of the impact of external trade agreements on growth have been conducted and show significant potential. One study estimated that substantial reductions of the barriers that limit product market entry, FDI and trade in the US and the EU could see the EU\u2019s GDP per capita rise by between 2% and 3.5%. A further study estimates that the elimination of 50% of non-tariff measures (NTMs) and regulatory divergence between the US and the EU could lead the EU\u2019s GDP to increase by 0.7% in 2018, compared to the baseline scenario (study published in 2009), while another study has assessed that a comprehensive and ambitious liberalisation could add EUR 119.2 billion to the EU\u2019s GDP. However, other scenarios analysed in the last of these studies (in which, for example, reforms are limited to tariff barriers, or services liberalisation only) are assessed to bring lower economic gains. Moreover, a free trade agreement between the US and the EU could be associated with a certain amount of labour displacement (so that 0.2 to 0.5 per cent of the EU labour force would have to move from one sector to another). 447 Additionally, it is important to note that strong concerns have been raised regarding the effects of such an agreement on consumer protection. 448 The table below provides further details on evidence of impacts. 445 European Commission, The European Union Explained: Trade, 2013. 446 European Commission, COM (2014) 130 final/2 - Taking Stock of the Europe 2020 Strategy for Smart, Sustainable and Inclusive Growth, 2014. 447 Francois, Joseph, Reducing Transatlantic Barriers to Trade and Investment, An Economic Assessment \u2013 Final Project Report, 2013, p. vii. 448 For example, see BEUC, Consumers at the heart of the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) \u2013 BEUC Position Statement, 2014.

CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS KEY FINDINGS \uf0b7 Progress has been made in furthering the single market and improving consumer protection and empowerment through a range of legislative and non-legislative achievements across all flagship initiatives. Evidence collected shows in particular in several areas a comprehensive legal framework for deepening the single market and/or improving consumer protection and empowerment has already been adopted or has been proposed by the Commission.

Specifically, some of the largest contributions to growth/savings could be achieved in furthering the single market in the goods market, digital markets, energy markets and transport markets. \uf0b7 While the coverage of the flagship initiatives of areas relevant for the single market and consumer protection can be considered relatively comprehensive, several others do not fall explicitly or comprehensively within the scope of the flagship initiatives (in terms of policy actions to deepen the single market or improve consumer protection). These include the services sectors covered by the Services Directive, retail financial services, public procurement and concessions, mutual recognition, taxation and the business environment, as well as linkages to other relevant policy areas such as competition policy and trade policy. Evidence suggests that significant contributions to economic growth as well as efficiency gains/savings could also be achieved if relevant policy actions to further the single market and/or consumer protection were implemented in these areas. \uf0b7 On the basis of these conclusions as well as observations made during the course of the research, key recommendations for future policymaking needs relate to: 1.

        "Policy Department A: Economic and Scientific Policy PE 518.762 144 In this section we first present the key findings of the study combined, followed by cross- cutting conclusions on single market- or consumer protection-related achievements and contributions to growth. We then present recommendations made on the basis of conclusions of the study and observations made throughout the course of the research. We finish with an overview of strategic objectives and specific objectives/instruments to guide future policymaking needs developed on the basis of the recommendations. 5.1. Conclusions 5.1.1. A general perspective: contributions of the single market and consumer protection & empowerment to growth \uf0b7 The benefits of a single market for growth can be broadly subsumed into four separate categories: economies of scale; stronger competition; lower transaction costs; and better allocation of resources. In addition to benefits for growth, single market integration also induces other benefits, such as increased consumer choice and better quality, and innovative goods and services. Nonetheless, the single market may induce additional costs, including administrative costs, adjustment or transition costs, a widening in regional and distributional disparities, and an increase in environmental degradation. \uf0b7 Many studies have tried to quantify the overall impact of single market integration on economic growth. One of the most-often quoted ex-ante studies is the Cecchini report, commissioned in 1988 by the European Commission. It estimated an impact of 4.25-6.5% increase in EU GDP for the EU-12. More recent studies assessing the effects of the elimination of intra-EU goods and services barriers have subsequently made even higher estimates, indicating that EU GDP could increase by 14% as early as 2020, depending on the assumptions made. \uf0b7 However, ex-post analyses have since measured the observed impact of the single market on growth and have generally estimated the real gains to be smaller. Several factors may explain the differences noted between ex-ante and ex-post estimates identified, including the absence of a clear control group or counterfactual; difficulty in predicting the dramatic transformative effects of market liberalisation; difficulty in accounting for dynamic effects of integration related to gradual changes in productivity and efficiency; and other potential biases leading to an overestimation of the predicted gains of single market integration. \uf0b7 Improving consumer protection and empowerment can also have positive effects on growth, through several channels including: consumers\u2019 increased confidence and trust; consumers\u2019 better decision-making and assertion of rights; lower consumer financial detriment from problems; and as a signal of high standards for third countries trading with the EU. However, while there is a significant body of literature confirming these benefits, little empirical evidence has been identified to support them. Nonetheless, a major EU-wide survey in 2010 concluded that total ex-post consumer detriment \u2013 based on financial losses reported from problems experienced \u2013 was equivalent to 0.4% of EU GDP. 5.1.2. The single market and consumer protection & empowerment through the lens of the Europe 2020 flagship initiatives \uf0b7 A larger number of achievements have been made relevant to the single market and consumer protection within the scope of \u2018A Digital Agenda for Europe\u2019, relating to electronic communications, e-commerce/online services and data protection. ",
        "Contribution of the Internal Market and Consumer Protection to Growth PE 518.762 145 Major legislation proposed includes the Connected Continent Regulation and Data Protection Reform Package. Evidence suggests that completing the digital single market has significant potential to contribute to growth, with one estimate indicating a possible 2-4% increase in EU GDP by 2020. \uf0b7 Relevant aspects of \u2018Innovation Union\u2019 relate to breaking down barriers to innovation, improving cross-border access to finance for SMEs and encouraging cross-border mobility of researchers, which may each have beneficial effects on growth. Key achievements include the establishment of a unitary patent system, which is expected to reduce costs of applying for a patent valid EU-wide by 80%. \uf0b7 Learning and employment mobility of young people constitute the key areas of relevance for the single market under \u2018Youth on the Move\u2019, for which available evidence indicates a potential positive impact on the EU economy. A major achievement is the regulation establishing Erasmus+, which combines the EU\u2019s education, training, youth and sport schemes into one integrated programme. \uf0b7 Significant achievements have been made within the scope of \u2018Resource-efficient Europe\u2019 relevant for the single market and consumer protection and empowerment in the energy and transport sectors. Major legislation adopted in the energy sector includes the Third Energy Package, while for several transport modes fresh single- market initiatives have been proposed, accompanied by a well-developed framework for passenger rights. Significant growth potential is also evident: according to estimates, liberalisation of gas and electricity markets could raise EU GDP by 0.6-0.8% over 2011-2020, while supply- and demand-side effects of air transport liberalisation could, respectively, raise EU GDP by 1.8% and 1.3% over 2005-2025. \uf0b7 Relevant achievements as part of \u2018An industrial policy for the globalisation era\u2019 relate mainly to industrial products, as well as specific areas such as combating late payments, business services, and entrepreneurship. Major legislation proposed includes the Product Safety and Market Surveillance Package. Addressing the remaining barriers to intra-EU trade in goods could be highly beneficial; one estimate shows that full integration of goods markets could result in a 2.2-8.8% increase in EU GDP in the long run. \uf0b7 Labour mobility is the main aspect relevant to the single market in \u2018An agenda for new skills and jobs\u2019. Major legislation adopted includes the revised Professional Qualifications Directive. Research suggests labour mobility stimulates growth: one study finds the immigration of four million people from eight of the countries acceding to the EU in 2004 could lead to a long-run increase of 0.6% in EU GDP. \uf0b7 Finally, actions under \u2018European Platform against Poverty and Social Exclusion\u2019 relevant to the single market relate primarily to social enterprise, which may also induce growth. A key achievement was the launch of the Social Business Initiative. 5.1.3. The single market and consumer protection and empowerment beyond the flagship initiatives \uf0b7 The services sector has been highlighted by the Commission as one of a few key sectors in which further deepening of the single market could lead to substantial gains in terms of growth. The Services Directive, adopted in 2006, constitutes the main horizontal internal market-related legislation in place for the sector. It is estimated that full implementation of the Services Directive by Member States in ",
        "Policy Department A: Economic and Scientific Policy PE 518.762 146 only a selection of the sectors covered by it could increase the EU\u2019s GDP by 2.6% in the long run. \uf0b7 Regarding financial services, the Commission has acted in developing a substantial regulatory reform agenda in response to the financial crisis. Legislative achievements at the retail level relevant for the single market include the Mortgage Credit Directive (MCD) and the Payment Accounts Directive (PAD). According to one estimate, fully integrated financial markets could induce a rise in GDP of 1.1% in the long run. \uf0b7 The main existing legislation on public procurement was revised during the 7th legislature as part of a comprehensive modernisation package, which could contribute to addressing barriers to a single procurement market. If cost savings already achieved for procurement contracts published at EU level could be achieved for all public procurement, EU GDP could increase by 0.5%, according to one estimate. \uf0b7 The Mutual Recognition Regulation is the main legislative achievement serving to uphold the principle of mutual recognition. According to the impact assessment that accompanied the initial proposal, successfully ensuring the perfect operation of mutual recognition inside the EU could produce a maximum possible one-off increase in EU GDP of 1.8%. \uf0b7 Taxation is also a tool that can contribute to furthering the single market. Among other things, policy action during the 7th legislature has aimed at revising the VAT system. One study has estimated that implementation of the VAT Directive could potentially lead to an increase of 1% in the EU\u2019s GDP, with 0.3% of GDP growth lost due to inefficient implementation. \uf0b7 Competition policy aims to ensure a level-playing field that can facilitate the provision of goods and services across borders and thus strengthen the single market. An achievement of the 7th legislature relates to the ongoing modernisation of state aid policy. In addition, competition decisions taken by the Commission in 2011 concerning horizontal mergers are estimated to have led to consumer savings of EUR 4 billion. \uf0b7 Similarly, an open trade policy is an important complement to furthering the single market, and also holds potential for a major contribution to growth. An agreement to lower barriers between the US and the EU could boost the EU\u2019s GDP per capita by between 2% and 3.5%, although strong concerns exist regarding the impact of such an agreement on consumer protection. 5.1.4. Cross-cutting conclusions As shown above, progress has been made in furthering the single market and improving consumer protection and empowerment through a range of legislative and non-legislative achievements made across all flagship initiatives. The evidence collected shows that the nature of the policy and legislative achievements relevant for the single market and consumer protection varies widely across the flagship initiatives, and across those areas considered not explicitly or comprehensively covered by the initiatives. In particular, in several sectors or sub-sectors a comprehensive legal framework for deepening the single market and/or improving consumer protection and empowerment has already been adopted or has been proposed by the Commission. Such is the case, for example, regarding: \uf0b7 The energy sector (the Third Energy Package adopted); ",
        "Contribution of the Internal Market and Consumer Protection to Growth PE 518.762 147 \uf0b7 The transport sector (the Fourth Railway Package proposed); \uf0b7 The digital sector (the Telecoms Package adopted and the Connected Continent Regulation proposed); or \uf0b7 Industrial products (the Product Safety and Market Surveillance Package proposed). Nonetheless, achievements have been more numerous and wide-ranging in specific flagship initiatives. Those that have seen a comparatively larger number of individual legislative or policy achievements in the single market area are \u2018A digital agenda for Europe\u2019, \u2018Innovation Union\u2019, \u2018Resource-efficient Europe\u2019, \u2018An industrial policy for the globalisation era\u2019 and \u2018An agenda for new skills and jobs\u2019, while flagship initiatives \u2018Youth on the move\u2019 and \u2018European platform against poverty\u2019 have seen comparatively fewer (as indicated in the overview table below). Regarding consumer protection and empowerment, those that have seen a comparatively larger number of individual legislative or policy achievements are \u2018A digital agenda for Europe\u2019, \u2018Resource-efficient Europe\u2019 and \u2018An industrial policy for the globalisation era\u2019, while , \u2018Innovation Union\u2019, \u2018Youth on the move\u2019, \u2018An agenda for new skills and jobs\u2019 and European platform against poverty\u2019 have seen comparatively fewer. Furthermore, as shown in Section 3, in some areas substantial barriers to single market integration or deficiencies in consumer protection remain.

Specifically, and looking towards the 2020 horizon, on the basis of the research identified some of the largest contributions to growth could be achieved in furthering the single market in the goods market, digital markets, energy markets and transport markets. Additional, although likely smaller, contributions to growth could be achieved in furthering the single market for labour (see overview table below). However, as shown in the previous section, while the coverage of the flagship initiatives of areas relevant for the internal market and consumer protection/empowerment can be considered relatively comprehensive, several others do not fall explicitly or comprehensively within the scope of the flagship initiatives (in terms of policy actions to deepen the single market or improve consumer protection).

        "Contribution of the Internal Market and Consumer Protection to Growth PE 518.762 153 5.2. Recommendations 5.2.1. Reigniting growth through the single market and consumer protection The Europe 2020 strategy was developed in the aftermath of the crisis with the overarching priorities of achieving economic growth that is smart (based on knowledge and innovation), sustainable (promoting a more resource-efficient, greener and more competitive economy), and inclusive (fostering a high-employment economy delivering social and territorial cohesion). Specific EU headline targets for 2020 were developed to achieve these goals, which were to be translated into national targets and trajectories, specifically: \uf0b7 75% of the population aged 20-64 should be employed; \uf0b7 3% of the EU's GDP should be invested in R&D; \uf0b7 The \u201820/20/20\u2019 climate/energy targets should be met i.e. greenhouse gas emissions 20% (or even 30%, if the conditions are right) lower than 1990; 20% of energy from renewables; 20% increase in energy efficiency; \uf0b7 The share of early school leavers should be under 10% and at least 40% of 30-34 year olds should have a tertiary degree; and \uf0b7 20 million fewer people should be in or at risk of poverty and social exclusion. The seven flagship initiatives that are the main focus of this study served to catalyse progress towards each of these headline targets. In addition, the single market, as well as financial levers such as the multi-annual financing framework of the EU budget and external policy tools including trade policy, were promoted as EU-level instruments to contribute to achieving these goals in parallel. This thematic approach combining priorities and headline targets was to act as one pillar of the Europe 2020 strategy, combined with a second pillar based on country reporting, involving country-specific recommendations as part of what is now known as the European Semester. The Commission\u2019s stock-taking of the strategy earlier this year has shown that progress towards the headline targets has been mixed, even if results need to be appreciated against the background of the crisis. 449 As growth has been sluggish at best since 2010, and in view of the mid-term review of the strategy in 2015, it makes sense to consider ways in which the strategy could be modified, or even restructured, to better attain the jobs and growth priorities. A single EU market based on the free movement of goods, services, labour and capital has constituted a vital component of European integration for much time, and has developed at a markedly faster pace than political integration. Studies as early as the 1980s, with the publication of the Cecchini report in 1988 on the costs of \u2018non-Europe\u2019, have pointed to the economic costs of not having a single market, and thus at the contributions it has made and could make to economic growth in the EU. Interviewees have also pointed out that, contrary to other policy instruments or tools to boost growth, internal market integration may require comparatively less EU funding, as it is in large part based on political will. In the same vein as the internal market, consumer policy is a key area where the EU has power to legislate to protect and empower consumers in the EU, and thus instil the consumer confidence and trust necessary to sustain consumption, particularly in a cross- border environment. Consumer protection and empowerment thus also make a significant contribution to a well-functioning economy, and go hand-in-hand with any policy to boost growth centred on the single market. This is especially important at this stage of the 449 European Commission, COM (2014) 130 final/2 - Taking Stock of the Europe 2020 Strategy for Smart, Sustainable and Inclusive Growth, 2014. ",
        "Policy Department A: Economic and Scientific Policy PE 518.762 154 market integration process for some sectors (e.g. energy), where advances in integration at the wholesale level are not mirrored by similar levels of retail market integration, underscoring the need for a framework that promotes consumers\u2019 trust in their being protected across EU borders. It follows that the single market, including the accompanying consumer protection and empowerment to uphold it, can be seen as one of the main policy tools or instruments to boost economic growth and jobs in the EU, and thus respond to the need to reignite growth as part of an updated Europe 2020 strategy. And indeed, the results of this study confirm that further deepening of the single market in selected areas has substantial potential to contribute to economic growth, particularly as a result of dynamic benefits resulting from long-term reallocation of capital and labour and the ensuing productivity and efficiency gains. The president of the European Commission, Jean-Claude Juncker, confirmed the potential of the single market in his political guidelines for the new Commission, vowing to \u201cfully exploit its potential in all its dimensions\u201d, and explicitly emphasised furthering the Digital Single Market, a European Energy Union, the internal market in products and services, a Capital Markets Union and the free movement of workers. 450 Nonetheless, the potential costs of the single market, related to e.g. a widening in regional and distributional disparities, or an increase in environmental degradation as a result of higher intensity of cross-border trade and travel, have not been studied. And the need to ensure complementarity with the more traditional drivers of growth, such as increasing employment and boosting investment in innovation and education, should not be overlooked. The key dimensions of the Europe 2020 growth strategy \u2013 smart, sustainable and inclusive \u2013 are therefore highly relevant as directional guides. Actions to deepen the single market and improve consumer protection and empowerment should be combined with the appropriate economic incentives and/or supporting policies to ensure that the economic gains achieved are both environmentally sustainable and distributed in an inclusive manner, while being complementary with other key drivers of growth. Lastly, the single market and consumer protection and empowerment also confer other important benefits in their own right that go beyond economic growth. A truly single market allows for a much greater choice in goods and services, and of a better quality. And strong consumer protection and empowerment among other things function as an outreach policy to citizens showing the benefits of the EU and its single market, while also contributing to increased trust, the upholding of fundamental rights and the protection of those most vulnerable in society. 451 These observations lead to an initial, general recommendation: Recommendation 1: In the context of the mid-term review of the Europe 2020 strategy, the single market and consumer protection should continue to be considered as key tools for reigniting economic growth in the EU, to the extent they remain complementary other key drivers of growth. In parallel, measures should be taken to ensure that the economic gains achieved are both environmentally sustainable and distributed in an inclusive manner. At the same time, the benefits of the single market and consumer protection that go beyond growth - e.g. in terms of consumer choice and trust, an outreach policy to citizens, the upholding of fundamental rights and the protection of those most vulnerable in society - should not be neglected. 450 Juncker, Jean-Claude, Political Guidelines for the next European Commission, Strasbourg, 15 July 2014. 451 In particular as consumer protection is also a right under Article 169 of the Lisbon Treaty.

        "Contribution of the Internal Market and Consumer Protection to Growth PE 518.762 155 5.2.2. Refining the focus of the Europe 2020 strategy and its flagship initiatives on areas where there is untapped growth potential For some flagship initiatives, achieving a single market in the relevant sectors is identified as an explicit priority; such is the case for the \u2018Digital Agenda for Europe\u2019, for which the completion of the digital single market constitutes a key pillar of the initiative, on the basis of 28 specific policy actions. In other flagship initiatives, the goal of achieving a single market is less explicitly identified as a priority; such is the case for the energy and transport sectors under the flagship initiatives \u2018Resource-efficient Europe\u2019 and \u2018An industrial policy for the globalisation era\u2019. Furthermore, as shown above, the deepening of the single market in other areas that offer the potential for significant contributions to economic growth if barriers were removed is not explicitly identified by any flagship initiatives as a priority. Such is the case for the financial services sector, and many of the services falling within the scope of the Services Directive, for example. Moreover, linkages with other cross-sectoral policy instruments featuring mutually reinforcing benefits for the single market and consumer protection and empowerment \u2013 such as competition policy and trade policy \u2013 are not explicit across the flagship initiatives. It is clear that a lack of (sufficiently) explicit identification of the furthering of the single market and improving consumer protection and empowerment in specific areas and related linkages to policy areas as priorities in the flagship initiatives does not preclude the realisation of important achievements in these areas (indeed, as shown in Section 4, some major achievements have been made). However, if the flagship initiatives are understood as thematic frameworks for the main policy actions to catalyse progress towards the headline targets, and thus boost economic growth, it makes sense that they comprise those policy actions that are likely to most contribute to economic growth on the basis of available evidence. It follows that, if policymakers wish to further exploit the growth potential of the single market and related consumer protection and empowerment (as is recommended above), additional emphasis in the Europe 2020 strategy or relevant flagship initiatives of the importance of actions in those areas found to have significant growth potential could be applied. The strategy would also need to incorporate the relevant linkages to other cross- sectoral policy areas, while continuing to address barriers in those areas already well covered. Concretely, this would entail addressing in priority those areas with untapped growth potential. That is, areas where both a) barriers to internal market integration and deficiencies in consumer protection and empowerment have not been sufficiently addressed; and b) evidence exists of a sufficiently high growth potential to warrant specific attention to those barriers and deficiencies. 452 In line with the results of this study, therefore, specific policy actions in the Europe 2020 strategy could be included aiming at addressing barriers in the services sectors covered by the Services Directive, in financial services, and in public procurement, for example, while applying more explicit emphasis on deepening the single markets for energy and transport sectors. In parallel, efforts to develop the appropriate linkages with competition policy and trade policy could be made, while continuing to place strong emphasis on completing the digital single market. 452 Although, as mentioned, selected barriers to the single market and deficiencies in consumer protection may be very important to address in their own right, beyond their economic growth potential, for the reasons outlined in recommendation 1. ",
        "Policy Department A: Economic and Scientific Policy PE 518.762 156 These observations lead to the following recommendation: Recommendation 2: To further exploit the growth potential of the single market and related consumer protection and empowerment, additional explicit emphasis in the Europe 2020 strategy or relevant flagship initiatives should be applied to addressing in priority those areas with untapped growth potential. That is, areas where both a) barriers to internal market integration and deficiencies in consumer protection and empowerment have not been sufficiently addressed; and b) evidence exists of a sufficiently high growth potential to warrant targeted attention to those barriers and deficiencies. In line with the results of this study, specific policy actions in the Europe 2020 strategy could be included aiming at addressing barriers in the services sectors covered by the Services Directive, in financial services, and in public procurement, for example, while applying more explicit emphasis on deepening the single markets for energy and transport sectors. In parallel, efforts to develop the appropriate linkages with competition policy and trade policy could be made, while continuing to place strong emphasis on completing the digital single market. 5.2.3. Improving the clarity in the coverage and presentation of the flagship initiatives and their synergies with other ongoing initiatives The research process undergone for this study, involving a comprehensive literature and document review as well as stakeholder and expert interviews, reveals that the areas and related policy actions covered by the flagship initiatives are in several cases difficult to categorise as being within the scope of a single flagship initiative. For example, while it is understood that the energy and transport sectors are jointly covered by the flagship initiatives \u2018Resource-efficient Europe\u2019 and \u2018An industrial policy for the globalisation era\u2019, the appropriate place of policy actions relating to furthering the single market for energy or transport is unclear, as they are alluded to under both flagship initiatives. In addition, interviewees have offered differing views as to the appropriate labelling of policy actions developed subsequent to the initial outlining of the flagship initiatives in 2010: some have considered them to continue to fall within the scope of the flagship initiative in question, while others have considered them to go beyond the scope of the flagship initiative initially outlined. Furthermore, in a number of cases while there has appeared to be an implicit understanding of the Commission DG responsible for policy actions, explicit indications are missing. This can lead to a lack of clarity as to e.g. the extent to which specific DGs have been able to successfully implement the policy actions for which they are responsible, particularly from an evaluation perspective. These observations point to a need for further clarity in the coverage of the areas and related policy actions by flagship initiatives, the lead institutions/entities implementing the measures outlined under the flagship initiatives, and their overall presentation. An example of a flagship initiative for which coverage of areas, policy actions, related indicators/reporting and responsible units are comparatively more clearly identifiable is the Digital Agenda for Europe flagship initiative. Unlike other flagship initiatives, it is structured according to 101 actions, brought together under 7 pillars (including a specific pillar for the digital single market, as mentioned above). For each action, information is offered as to the progress in its implementation. In addition, the actions as a whole are aimed at attaining 13 specific goals, for which progress is measured on a dedicated Digital Agenda scoreboard. Interviewees have noted in particular that such measures of progress were found helpful by stakeholders for determining their own priorities. The clarity of the Digital Agenda for Europe flagship initiative may also help explain why many Member States (over twenty, according to interviewees) have adopted their own national \u2018digital agendas\u2019, which have reportedly contributed to clarifying targets to be achieved at the national level. ",
        "Contribution of the Internal Market and Consumer Protection to Growth PE 518.762 157 Finally, it should be noted that the Commission\u2019s agenda for simplification of EU law and reduction of administrative burden, the Regulatory Fitness and Performance programme (REFIT), also covers many of the areas that come within the scope of the current flagship initiatives. 453 Where overlaps exist, policy actions under the flagship initiatives should be appropriately synchronised and coordinated with the relevant REFIT programme initiative, to maximise efficiency. The above considerations lead to the following recommendation: Recommendation 3: In the context of the mid-term review of the Europe 2020 strategy, if the overall approach based on flagship initiatives is to be maintained, further clarity should be sought in the coverage of areas relevant for each of the flagship initiatives, in the lead institutions/entities implementing the measures outlined under the flagship initiatives. The overall presentation of the flagship initiatives could be improved by including a clear statement of goals and progress measured. The Digital Agenda for Europe flagship initiative could serve as a benchmark in these respects . At the same time, policy actions under the flagship initiatives should be appropriately synchronised and coordinated with the REFIT programme, where relevant, to maximise efficiency. 5.2.4. Exploiting the potential of recurring Single Market Acts focused on key areas Interviewees indicated that the Single Market Acts I & II have proven to be effective cross- cutting policy instruments to provide short-term impetus to and measure performance in key areas where further work to deepen the single market (and improve consumer protection and empowerment) was deemed necessary, based on specific policy actions. Many of the Single Market Act actions also fall within the scope of the flagship initiatives, as shown in Section 3.8.1. Additional Acts could therefore function as a supporting tool to flagship initiatives, starting with a Single Market Act III, which has already been under discussion for some time. They could be implemented on a short-term, recurring basis, with each new Act refocusing on policy actions aimed at the remaining barriers to unlock untapped growth potential of key areas from a single market and consumer protection/empowerment perspective. These areas could as a starting point include those referred under recommendation 2. Recommendation 4: Additional Single Market Acts could function as a supporting tool to flagship initiatives, starting with a Single Market Act III. They could be implemented on a short-term, recurring basis, with each new Act refocusing on policy actions aimed at remaining barriers to unlock the untapped growth potential of key areas from a single market and consumer protection/empowerment perspective. 5.2.5. Exploiting country-specific recommendations of the European Semester and reinforcing cooperation among national competent authorities to improve enforcement As shown in the study, the nature of the policy and legislative achievements relevant for the single market and consumer protection varies widely across the flagship initiatives, and across those areas considered not explicitly covered by the initiatives. In particular, in several areas a comprehensive legal framework for deepening the single market and/or improving consumer protection and empowerment has already been adopted or has been proposed by the Commission: such is the case, for example, for the energy sector, for industrial products, and for services covered by the Services Directive. In these cases, the 453 See European Commission, COM(2013) 685 final - Regulatory Fitness and Performance (REFIT): Results and Next Steps, 2013 and European Commission, SWD (2013) 401 final - Regulatory Fitness and Performance Programme (REFIT): Initial Results of the Mapping of the Acquis, 2013. ",
        "Policy Department A: Economic and Scientific Policy PE 518.762 158 main priority is ensuring the correct implementation and enforcement of the legal framework in the Member States. And while these priorities are clear regarding internal market legislation, the importance of implementing harmonised consumer protection legislation should not be neglected. Indeed, even if the overall level of protection afforded by EU legislation is high, differences in implementation can cause significant consumer detriment. Interviewees have emphasised that the European Semester could be fully exploited to encourage the correct implementation and enforcement of legislation through the country- specific recommendations provided to Member States. Additional emphasis was placed on reinforcing cooperation between competent authorities and related networks in relevant areas (both in an internal market and consumer protection/empowerment perspective), which would offer an EU-wide coordinated and coherent response in tackling issues of non- compliance. This leads to the following recommendation: Recommendation 5: Where a comprehensive legal framework has already been laid down, country-specific recommendations developed during the European Semester should be fully exploited to catalyse implementation and enforcement of single market and consumer protection-relevant legislation in the Member States, along with further reinforcement of cooperation among relevant national competent authorities and related networks to offer an EU-wide coordinated and coherent response to non-compliance issues. 5.2.6. Developing indicators and targets for the single market and consumer protection Launched in parallel to the Europe 2020 strategy in 2010, the Commission\u2019s Smart Regulation agenda has been successful in fostering a culture of impact assessment and evaluation in the design and appraisal of policy and legislative achievements. A particular emphasis is placed on measuring the magnitude of impacts through the use of well-defined indicators. In line with this, indicators and targets have been increasingly used to respectively assess and stimulate progress in a range of policy areas. In its stock-taking of the strategy, the Commission recognised, despite some limitations, the importance of the headline targets of the Europe 2020 strategy for the overall focus of the strategy, policy anchoring, and monitoring progress. In this regard, and in view of a strategy that more explicitly focuses on the untapped growth potential of deepening the single market and improving consumer protection and empowerment in key areas (in line with recommendation 2), it is reasonable to consider whether policy indicators and targets should be developed specifically for single market integration and consumer protection and empowerment. The new indicators and targets would appear on par with the other headline indicators and targets developed for the policy areas considered under the strategy to be important for smart, sustainable inclusive growth (i.e. employment, education, research and innovation, energy and climate, and social and cohesion policy). A series of sector-specific indicators for single market integration and consumer protection and empowerment at EU level have already been developed and commented on in this study, focusing variously on economic statistics (e.g. intra-EU cross border trade, price convergence, etc.), legal statistics (e.g. delays in transposition of directives, number of directives incorrectly transposed, complaints data from SOLVIT, etc.), survey data (e.g. consumer cross-border purchases, complaints), and other aspects, while work is ongoing to ",
        "Contribution of the Internal Market and Consumer Protection to Growth PE 518.762 159 further refine indicators. 454 In this regard, a well-defined aggregate index constructed with a selection of these indicators (e.g. similar to the index presented in Section 2.1), or alternatively a key specific indicator sufficiently comprehensive in scope, could serve as a basis for a headline target for single market integration and/or consumer protection and empowerment. These observations lead to the following recommendation: Recommendation 6: In order to both measure and stimulate progress to deepening the single market (and improving consumer protection) in key areas, a headline indicator and target for single market integration and/or consumer protection at EU level should be considered. This could be based on a well-defined aggregate index constructed with a selection of indicators , or alternatively a key specific indicator that would be sufficiently comprehensive in scope. 5.2.7. Improving the credibility of quantitative results on economic impacts In the course of the research for this study, a significant number of studies, impact assessments and other literature was identified and reviewed. The quantitative results concerning economic impacts of either specific policy actions or general market changes/reforms offered varying levels of scientific rigour. Indeed, while many studies produced results based on clearly defined and well-known methodologies and datasets, others have appeared to lack clear information as to the methodology applied and data used to justifiably obtain the results claimed, or have neglected to sufficiently indicate potential limitations to the methodology (e.g. accounting for lack of a true counterfactual) or data. Clear and credible ex-ante assessments in particular are especially important as a basis for ex-post assessments, in order to both accurately assess the observed outcomes against those predicted, and further refine the ex-ante assessment methodology in order to arrive at better predictions. Promoting the provision of complete information on the methodology and datasets used in the assessment of economic impacts could therefore be beneficial for several reasons. It will be possible to better ensure the credibility and comparability of the results obtained, better establish the appropriate linkages between ex-ante and ex-post assessments, and point to gaps in the data needed to conduct the assessments. This leads to the following recommendation: Recommendation 7: In the context of assessment of economic impacts, further efforts should be made to promote the provision of appropriate details on the methodology applied and the data used (e.g. a methodological annex, database and a full list of references), in order to ensure the credibility and comparability of the results obtained, establish the relevant linkages with ex-post assessments, and point to gaps in the data needed to conduct the assessments. Ways to streamline and standardise the approach to data collection and assessment of impacts for various sectors could therefore be explored. 455 454 As documented in e.g. Centre for European Policy Studies, Indicators for Measuring the Performance of the Single Market \u2013 Building the Single Market Pillar of the European Semester, 2014. The Commission\u2019s Single Market, Consumer Conditions and Consumer Market Scoreboards could also be of particular relevance in this regard, as they include respectively indicators on transposition and infringements of legislation, data on cross- border sales and enforcement indicators in Member States, and data on consumer perceptions of the performance of specific markets, inter alia. 455 An overview of approaches to ex-ante impact assessment and ex-post evaluation at EU and national level, related shortcomings identified, and ways to better integrate them into a performance-based full policy cycle is presented in M\u00fcller, Patrice et al., Performance-based full policy cycle for the Digital Single Market, Study prepared for the European Parliament\u2019s Committee on Internal Market and Consumer Protection, 2013.

In a number of areas, comparatively less evidence of existing barriers and associated growth potential was identified during the course of the study. From a general perspective these include capital and labour markets, which have seen comparatively less focus than goods and services markets. And at a specific level, this concerns the diverse aspects of the regulatory business environment of the internal market: while public procurement has received substantial focus, comparatively little evidence on the impacts of single market- or consumer protection-related actions in the areas of e.g. company law, accounting and auditing, rating agencies, contract law, insolvency rules, taxation and the customs union has been collected. Yet as a harmonised regulatory and business environment constitutes an important precondition to sustained cross-border private investment, actions aimed at achieving this end could also be expected to result in significant gains in economic growth. This leads to the following, final recommendation: Recommendation 8: Additional research aimed at in those areas for which comparatively less evidence of existing barriers and associated growth potential has been identified, such as capital and labour markets, but also the regulatory and business environment. 5.3.

Key legislative and non-legislative acts adopted during the 7 th legislature and considered to have furthered the single market include the Telecoms Package (updates the regulatory framework for electronic communications); the Roaming Regulations (introduce caps on roaming fees); the Single Euro Payments Area (SEPA) Regulation (establishes a single market for online payments); the Regulation on Cross-Border Payments in the Community (eliminates differences in charges for cross-border and national payments in euro); the Regulation on electronic identification and trust services (creates a European internal market for electronic Trust Services); the Directive on Collective Management of Copyright (establishing common governance, transparency and financial management standards for collective management of copyright); the Directive on Orphan Works (sets out common rules for digitalisation and display of orphan works); the Directive on electronic invoicing in public procurement (harmonises e-invoicing systems for public authorities); the roadmap for the single market for parcel delivery (sets out the most important issues and a number of future objectives) and the revision of public procurement directives (makes use of electronic communication in public procurement mandatory). Key proposals for legislation put forward that are likely to further the single market concern a Connected Continent Regulation (would further update the regulatory framework for electronic communications); new rules on Payment Services (would improve low-cost internet payment services); a Common European Sales Law (would give traders choice to sell products to non-domestic citizens according to a single set of contract law rules); and a General Data Protection Regulation (would further harmonise data protection rules). Achievements relevant for consumer protection & empowerment Under flagship initiative 1, past and potential future achievements relevant for consumer protection and empowerment again relate to electronic communications, e- commerce/online services and data protection/network and information security. Key legislative and non-legislative acts adopted during the 7 th legislature and considered to have improved consumer protection and empowerment include the Telecoms Package (introduces a range of new protective measures for electronic communications, concerning e.g. switching, information requirements, and internet freedom); the Consumer Rights Directive (introduces a range of improved consumer rights applying to goods and services markets and online); the ADR Directive (ensures that disputes between consumers and traders in almost all business sectors can be submitted to an ADR entity); the ODR Regulation (introduces an EU-wide online platform for disputes relating to online purchases); a Recommendation on Collective Redress (sets out a series of common, non- binding principles for collective redress mechanisms); and the Regulation on Cross-Border Payments in the Community (requires ADR procedures for cross-border disputes to be set up by Member States).

        "PE 518.762 164 Key proposals for legislation put forward that are likely to improve consumer protection and empowerment concern a Connected Continent Regulation (would introduce a range of protective measures for electronic communications, concerning e.g. net neutrality, switching, and an end to roaming charges); a new Directive on Payment Services (would protect consumers against fraud and payment abuses); an initiative on online gambling (aims among other things to protect consumers of online gambling services); a General Data Protection Regulation (would introduce a range of enhanced rights for data subjects); and a Directive concerning measures to ensure a high common level of network and information security across the Union (would improve network and information security). Impacts on economic growth Evidence suggests that single-market and consumer protection/empowerment related actions in the digital markets could contribute to a very significant extent to economic growth. One study indicates that the completion of a digital single market could potentially contribute between 2% and 4% to the EU\u2019s GDP in the long term, while another shows that increasing the EU\u2019s ICT capital stock to the same relative level as the United States could increase GDP by 5% by 2020. Studies also point to considerable savings that could be made in various areas, which have the potential to contribute to growth. In particular, evidence shows consumers could potentially save EUR 204.5 billion annually due to the growth of e-commerce and removal of Single Market barriers. Further opening up of national markets (leading to increased competition) could lead to welfare gains of EUR 27-55 billion per year thanks to lower prices and more investment, according to another study. The widespread adoption of e- invoicing could also bring significant savings \u2013 EUR 238 billion over a six year period, based on one estimation. Finally, there are also indications that actions within the scope of the Digital Agenda could boost employment, with one study estimating that policy initiatives in the area of cloud computing could potentially lead to the creation 2.5 million jobs. Another study argues that intervention to support the deployment of next generation access (NGA) could create 0.63 to 2.59 million jobs by 2020. Flagship initiative 2: Innovation Union Achievements relevant for the single market Under flagship initiative 2, past and potential future achievements relevant to the single market relate to the single market for innovation, access to finance for SMEs and the European Research Area. Key legislative and non-legislative acts adopted during the 7th legislature and considered to have furthered the single market include the revised public procurement directives (will boost innovation in procurement); the EU patent package (will create a unitary patent throughout the EU); a Regulation on European Standardisation (aims at modernising and improving the European standards setting); State Aid Modernisation (reforms the legal framework for state aid with the goal of fostering innovation); a Regulation on European Venture Capital Funds (makes it easier for venture capitalists to raise funds across Europe for the benefit of start-ups); the revision of the Transparency Directive (creates new information requirements while aiming to reduce the administrative burden); revision of the Market Abuse Directive (to ensure it remains up-to-date with market developments); the revision of the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (aims to make financial markets more efficient, resilient and transparent); revision of the Prospectus Directive (refines the legal framework in order to increase legal clarity and efficiency); the establishment of a European Framework for Research Careers (allows better comparability for research careers ",

A key proposal for legislation put forward that is likely to further the single market concerns a Regulation on European Long-term Investment Funds (proposes a new investment fund framework for investors who want to put money into projects for the long term). Achievements relevant for consumer protection & empowerment With the exception of the Standardisation Regulation (see summary of \u2018An industrial policy for the globalisation era\u2019 flagship initiative), no specific achievements directly relating to consumer protection and empowerment were identified under flagship initiative 2. Impacts on economic growth There are indications that single market related actions under this flagship initiative have potential to contribute to savings and economic growth. One study estimates that a European patent system could lead to savings of EUR 250 million for European businesses, while another study argues that the creation of a Unified Patent Court could lead to savings of EUR 148 million to EUR 289 million. Furthermore, other research shows that abolishing the obligation of listed companies to present quarterly financial reports could bring savings of EUR 2,000 to EUR 60,000 per year/per issuer for small and medium issuers, and from EUR 35,000 to EUR 250,000 per year/per issuer for large issuers, without even taking into account savings in wage bills linked to the staff involved in preparation of these reports. While quantitative estimates of the economic impact of specific measures could not be found, there nonetheless exists more general research suggesting that they could contribute to growth. For example, it has been argued that standardisation has a positive impact on annual GDP growth ranging from 0.3 to 1 percentage points. There is also evidence that an increase of venture capital investments by 0.1% of GDP could lead to an increase in real GDP growth of 0.3 percentage points. In regard to researcher mobility the evidence is less clear. While one study that looked at the mobility of UK researchers argues that changing jobs had a minimal impact on the scientific performance of the individuals concerned, another study claims that researchers who moved jobs either between European countries or out of Europe had a higher field-weighted citation impact than those who remained in the same country. Flagship initiative 3: Youth on the move Achievements relevant for the single market Under flagship initiative 3, past and potential future achievements relevant to the single market relate to the learning and employment mobility of young people. Key legislative and non-legislative acts adopted during the 7th legislature and considered to have furthered the single market include the Regulation establishing Erasmus+ (combines existing schemes into one integrated programme for education, training, youth and sport); the Council Recommendation on Promoting the Learning Mobility of Young People (recommends Member States to encourage learning mobility); the publication of the first Mobility Scoreboard (provides a framework to assess promotion of learning mobility); the review of the ECTS Users\u2019 Guide (will provide a revision of the 2009 ECTS Users\u2019 Guide); the development of U-Multirank (provides a new ranking system for universities and colleges); publication of guidance of the rights of mobile students in the European Union (summarises the Commission\u2019s interpretation of the law in this area); the launch of the ",
        "PE 518.762 166 European Skills Passport (an electronic folder for qualifications and certificates); the launch of \u2018Your First EURES Job\u2019 (supports young people to find a job, traineeship or apprenticeship in other EU countries); the Council and Parliament Recommendation on the establishment of the ECVET (aims to establish a European Credit system for Vocational Education and Training). Achievements relevant for consumer protection & empowerment No specific achievements relating to consumer protection and empowerment were identified under flagship initiative 3. Impacts on economic growth Quantitative evidence of the contribution of youth mobility-related actions under this flagship initiative to GDP growth could not be located for this study. However an impact assessment conducted by the Commission on the creation of a single EU programme for education, training, youth and sport (later established by the Erasmus + regulation) estimated that the policy could have positive effects on both economic growth and employment. Another impact assessment on a Council Recommendation on Youth Mobility also predicted positive economic and social effects. Furthermore, there is evidence that the \u2018Your first EURES job\u2019 scheme could already be leading to savings, with the benefits per successful work placement ranging from EUR 131 per month in Bulgaria to EUR 2,266 per month in Luxembourg, due to reduced expenditure on unemployment benefit. In addition, several studies suggest that study abroad programmes such as Erasmus can improve the employability of participants. One of these presents evidence that graduates who had taken part in a study abroad programme were 24% more likely to be in employment three years after graduation relative to graduates who did not study abroad. Additionally, former Erasmus students are half as likely to experience long-term unemployment compared with those who have not studied or trained abroad, according to a study prepared for the Commission on the impacts of the Erasmus programme. Flagship initiative 4: Resource-efficient Europe Achievements relevant for the single market Under flagship initiative 4, past and potential future achievements relevant to the single market relate to the energy and transport sectors. Key legislative acts adopted during the 7 th legislature and considered to have furthered the single market include the Third Energy Package (introduces common rules for the generation, transmission, distribution and supply of electricity and gas, inter alia); the Renewable Energy Directive (sets out a common framework for the promotion of energy from renewable sources); the guidelines for development of the trans-European energy infrastructure network (ranks projects eligible for EU assistance and strengthens project coordination); a guidance package to Member States on state intervention in electricity markets (provides guidance to Member States on how to design and reform national support schemes); the Airport Charges Directive (establishes a common framework for airport charges at EU airports); guidelines for development of the trans-European transport network (sets out a framework for identifying projects of common interest); the Coach and Bus services Regulation (harmonises rules on international carriage of passengers by coach and bus within the EU); and the International road haulage Regulation (harmonises rules on the market in the international carriage of goods by road within the EU).

Key legislative and non-legislative acts adopted during the 7 th legislature and considered to have improved consumer protection and empowerment include the Third Energy Package (lays down universal service obligations and a series of consumer rights in relation to electricity and gas provision, relating to e.g. switching, information requirements, dispute resolution); the Energy Efficiency Directive (introduces measures for consumers to better manage energy consumption); European Energy Consumers\u2019 Checklist (provides consumers with clear information on their rights in the energy field); a guidance document on vulnerable consumers (provides guidance to Member States in providing support to vulnerable consumers in the energy sector); European vision for Passengers (provides guidance to stakeholders to better understand EU law in relation to passenger rights); Bus Regulation (establishes rules for the rights of passengers when travelling by bus and coach transport); Waterborne Regulation (establishes rules for the rights of passengers when travelling by sea and inland waterway transport); and the Consumer Rights Directive (aims to increase transparency for passengers, especially when buying transport tickets on-line). Key proposals for legislation put forward that are likely to improve consumer protection and empowerment concern a proposal for a regulation on air passenger rights and a proposal for a Package Travel Directive. Impacts on economic growth In the energy and transport sectors, single-market and consumer protection/ empowerment-related actions could contribute substantially to economic growth. In the energy sector in particular, strong benefits from an increase in EU-wide market integration and competition in the form of increases in GDP and in efficiency/savings from switching, welfare gains and lower prices could be achieved. One estimate found that the opening of EU energy markets to greater competition has resulted in welfare gains of around EUR 2 billion per year. Another study indicated that in the future, an increase of up to 0.8% in EU GDP after 10 years could result from liberalising EU gas and electricity markets, while cost savings of up to EUR 30 billion per year in the EU27 and between EUR 12.5-40 billion per year in the EU27 by 2030 could result from the full integration of gas and electricity markets respectively. Similarly, evidence again indicates the potential for significant economic benefits from single market-related actions in the transport area. In the air transport sector, one study found that over 1993-2003, the GDP of the EU25 increased by up to 4% and would continue to increase over 2003-2025 by 1.8% as a result of specific supply-side effects of growth in air transport due to liberalisation (business investment and underlying productivity impacts), while demand-side effects could lead to an increase of another 1.3%. An impact assessment on the currently proposed policy changes to update the Single European Sky regulations (SES2+) indicated such changes could result in an increase in EU GDP of EUR 750 million per year by 2020 and EUR 900 million per year by 2030. And in the railway sector, it was shown that savings of between EUR 1-2 billion per year could be achieved through further market opening, greater open tendering for public service contracts and continued unbundling until 2034.

        "PE 518.762 168 Flagship initiative 5: An industrial policy for the globalisation era Achievements relevant for the single market Under flagship initiative 5, past and potential future achievements relevant for the single market relate to the internal market for industrial products, as well as other specific areas, such as combating late payments, business services and entrepreneurship. Key legislative and non-legislative acts adopted during the 7th legislature and considered to have furthered the single market include a range of sector-specific industrial products directives, including an Alignment Package (harmonises rules on a wide range of industrial products); the Standardisation Regulation (acts as the legal basis for European product and services standard setting); the Construction Products Regulation (introduces a uniform assessment methods of the performance of construction products); the Single Market for Green Products initiative (proposes common methods to measure the environmental performance of products and organisations); the Late Payment Directive (harmonises rules on combating late payment in commercial transactions); a High Level Group on Business Services (provided recommendation on the internal market for business services); and the Entrepreneurship 2020 Action Plan (supports entrepreneurship in the EU). Achievements relevant for consumer protection & empowerment Under flagship initiative 5, past and potential future achievements relevant for consumer protection and empowerment relate to the internal market for industrial products and standardisation. A key legislative act adopted during the 7 th legislature and considered to have improved consumer protection and empowerment is the Regulation on European Standardisation (improved transparency and stakeholder/consumer participation in standard-making, ensuring mandated standards act in support of EU legislation, including safety, digital interoperability, security, access etc.). A key proposal for legislation put forward that is likely to improve consumer protection and empowerment in the market for industrial products concerns a Product Safety and Market Surveillance Package, which would improve the safety of consumer products circulating in the Single Market and market surveillance concerning all non-food products, including those imported from third countries. Impacts on economic growth Full market integration of the goods markets could contribute significantly to economic growth. According to one study, integration of goods markets in the internal market has yielded 2.2-3.3% higher per capita GDP in the EU. If the current level of integration of goods continues, it indicated, GDP per capita in the long run could increase by between 2.2-8.8% in the EU. Moreover, full removal of existing non-tariff barriers (NTBs) and barriers to foreign direct investment (FDI) could lead to the creation of 4.6 billion jobs, according to another study. Evidence also indicates significant savings to be made as a result of the implementation of relevant actions as part of the flagship initiative, such as EUR 180 billion in savings per year due the obligation of the Late Payment Directive for public authorities to pay for services within 30 days. In addition, qualitative impact assessments from the Commission assess that the implementation of the Alignment Package, as well as that of the Product Safety and Market Surveillance Package, will have a variety of positive economic effects, such as increased competitiveness.

        "Contribution of the Internal Market and Consumer Protection to Growth PE 518.762 169 Flagship initiative 6: An agenda for new skills and jobs Achievements relevant for the single market Under flagship initiative 6, past and potential future achievements relevant for the single market relate primarily to labour mobility. Key legislative or non-legislative acts adopted during the 7th legislature and considered to have furthered the single market include a revised Professional Qualifications Directive (modernises the existing directive); establishing the European Classification of Skills/Competences, Qualifications and Occupations, ESCO (identifies and categorises skills, competences, qualifications and occupations relevant for the EU labour market and education and training); Directive on improving the acquisition and preservation of supplementary pension rights for mobile workers (establishes minimum standards for the protection of mobile workers' supplementary pension rights); the Posting of Workers Enforcement Directive (improves the application of the Posting of Workers\u2019 Directive); the Directive to Improve Enforcement of Workers Rights (aims to improve awareness and enforcement of mobile workers\u2019 rights); and a Decision on enhanced co-operation between public employment services (improves cooperation between Member States\u2019 public employment services). Key proposals for legislation put forward that are likely to further the single market concern a Regulation on EURES (would enhance provision of intra-EU labour mobility support services); and a Roadmap for a Partial Revision of Regulations Nos. 883/2004 and 987/2009 (would improve coordination of social security schemes, in particular for cross- border workers). Achievements relevant for consumer protection & empowerment No specific achievements relating to consumer protection and empowerment were identified under flagship initiative 6. Impacts on economic growth An increase in labour mobility is likely to be positive for economic growth in the EU. One study identified favourable effects that labour mobility could have on countering asymmetrical economic shocks and reducing labour market disparities. Another has estimated that migration within the EU27/EFTA has already led to a reduction in unemployment by up to 6% over the period 2001-2010. It has also been estimated that EUR 1.3 billion was saved by the Spanish government in 2011 alone as the result of avoided expenditure on unemployment benefits for workers who had emigrated to another EU country. Population flows resulting from the expansion of the EU in 2004 and 2007 could also have contributed to growth: it has been estimated that the long-term effect of the immigration of four million people from the countries that acceded to the EU in 2004 excluding Cyprus and Malta (\u2018the EU8\u2019) could be a 0.6% increase in the enlarged EU\u2019s GDP. Other studies estimate the impact of intra-EU mobility between 2004 and 2007 on GDP to be around 0.2% or 0.27% increase in the long run. It should be noted, however, that these economic gains are not distributed equally throughout the Union: while the GDP of receiving countries may rise, the sending countries may suffer from a drop in overall wealth. A further issue is the potential role that migration from the EU8 and Bulgaria and Romania could play in increasing unemployment and depressing wages in the EU15. However, several studies suggest that these effects would be minimal or non-existent, while overall employment and wage/income trends throughout the EU could be positively affected by migration flows.

        "PE 518.762 170 Flagship initiative 7: European platform against poverty Achievements relevant for the single market Under flagship initiative 7, past and potential future achievements relevant to the single market relate to social enterprise, public procurement, retail banking services and disclosure of non-financial and diversity information by businesses. Key legislative acts adopted during the 7th legislature and considered to have furthered the single market include the Regulation on European Social Entrepreneurship Funds (sets out a new \u2018European Social Entrepreneurship Fund\u2019 label and is part of the Social Business Initiative), the Public Procurement Directives (include provisions to boost social inclusion, which is part of the Social Business Initiative) and the Payment Accounts Directive (ensures access to payment accounts, as well as facilitating payment account switching and comparability of payment account fees). A key proposal for legislation put forward that is likely to further the single market concerns a Council Regulation on the Statute for a European Foundation (would create a single European legal form for foundations and is part of the Social Business Initiative). Achievements relevant for consumer protection & empowerment Key legislative acts adopted during the 7th legislature and considered to have improved consumer protection and empowerment include the Payment Accounts Directive (ensures access to payment accounts, as well as facilitating payment account switching and comparability of payment account fees); and the Directive on Disclosure of Non-Financial and Diversity Information by Businesses (improves the transparency of certain large companies on social and environmental matters). Impact on economic growth Actions relevant for the Single Market and consumer protection/empowerment taken as part of the flagship initiative \u2018European platform against poverty\u2019 could also have positive effects on the European economy. For example, an impact assessment conducted by the Commission on the proposal for a Council Regulation on the Statute for a European Foundation claims that this could potentially create 15,000 new jobs, as well as 15,000 volunteer positions. The impact assessment on the proposal for a Regulation on a European Social Entrepreneurship Fund also foresees positive economic effects, predicting that this would lead to higher investment flows to social business. This, in turn, could potentially benefit the wider economy. ",
