        "Abstract Small area estimation for city statistics and other functional areas 3 Abstract The aim of the investigation is to examine the extent to which so-called small area estimation methods are able to increase the precision of estimations of statistical indicators at city level using common European social surveys. In this context, the focus is on the performance of different estimation strategies against the background of various sampling designs commonly used by national statistical institutes for social surveys in Europe. As no census information on the variables of interest is available, the true distribution of said estimators of interest cannot be investigated and evaluated. Therefore, a design-based Monte Carlo simulation study using a synthetic but close-to-reality population is performed to examine the research question at hand. The repetitive drawing of samples using common sampling designs facilitates the comparison of various design-based, model-assisted, model-based and synthetic estimation approaches in a realistic environment mirroring the main properties of the population of the European Union. In the course of the simulation study, after repetitively drawing samples according to the examined sampling designs, the estimation strategies are applied to estimate the at risk of poverty or social exclusion (AROPE) rate per area as target parameter. The model-assisted and model-based estimation approaches both incorporate auxiliary information, which is assumed to be available in practice. The results show that, despite the introduction of a slight bias, all of the investigated estimation approaches are able to increase the efficiency of the estimation at municipality and city level. However, the improvement of the estimation quality critically depends on the underlying sampling design. Furthermore, it can be observed that the potential for improvement by using small area estimation approaches instead of the classical design-weighted estimation techniques decreases with an increasing area-specific sample size. Therefore, the choice of the estimation strategy and whether to apply small area estimation approaches depends on the underlying sampling design of the survey to be used as well as on the sample size of the areas of interest.

        "The need for information on small spatial units 1 Small area estimation for city statistics and other functional areas 8 1 The need for information on small spatial units The demand for reliable information on the level of small spatial units, specifically cities and functional urban areas (FUAs), has increased significantly in recent years. An overview of European cities and communities from 2016 can be drawn from Figure 9 in Appendix B (see also https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/pdfscache/72650.pdf). To this end, Eurostat has set up a city data collection containing data on various variables from registers, censuses, and sample surveys. These data were collected at the level of the cities and their respective functional urban areas. However, cities and functional urban areas are usually not incorporated in the sampling design of social surveys. This implies considerable challenges for the estimation of unknown parameters as the relevant areas (spatial units, which are the focus here) or domains (groups built by certain characteristics) might have unplanned and small sample sizes. Using only data from observations sampled from the area in question and weighting them when computing an estimate, i.e. using a so-called direct design-weighted estimation method (such as the well-known estimator by Horvitz and Thompson (1952)), will lead to unbiased estimates. However, unplanned and small sample sizes due to the disregard of cities and functional urban areas at the design stage of the sample survey might result in imprecise estimates with large standard errors. In a given application, it might even be the case that some areas of interest may not have been sampled at all. So-called small area estimation methods may be used to improve the quality of such estimates. These mostly model-based approaches incorporate additional auxiliary information from further areas by means of a previously defined model. This enables an increase in precision of the estimates and even the estimation for areas which have not been sampled at all. The aim of the project Small Area Estimation (SAE) for city statistics and other functional areas part II was to investigate how small area estimation methods might be used in the context of sample designs used in common European social surveys like the European Union Statistics on Income and Living Conditions (EU-SILC) to estimate statistical indicators like the at risk of poverty or social exclusion rate (AROPE). As opposed to databases available at Eurostat , national statistical institutes (NSIs) have access to spatial identifiers, like LAU-2 codes, and a wealth of auxiliary information and could therefore employ small area estimation methods in a decentralised fashion. Here, the performance of different estimation strategies in combination with different sampling designs will be investigated. A major hurdle for the investigation of any estimation method using sample survey data is that there 1 The need for information on small spatial units ",
        "The need for information on small spatial units 1 Small area estimation for city statistics and other functional areas 9 is hardly ever census information on the variables of interest available. Accordingly, the true distribution of the related estimators (i.e. the distribution of the computed point estimates resulting from drawing all pos sible samples from the population) cannot be known and the estimator\u2019s properties not investigated as a consequence. In survey statistics, this problem is typically overcome by using a design-based Monte Carlo simulation study. The starting point is a large synthetic but close-to-reality population, i.e. a population of vectors of data points that share certain traits of the real population in question. To give an example, if there is a positive correlation between the number of members in a household and the overall household income found in empirical (real) data, such a positive correlation is constructed for the synthetic (non-real) data as well. Once such a population has been built, samples can be repeatedly drawn from it using sampling designs that are quite alike those really used in sample surveys like EU-SILC. Given a large enough number of drawn samples, we can assume that the distribution of point estimates is reasonably close to the estimator\u2019s real distribution. We are then in a position to compare the performance of different estimators (e.g. the performance of a Horvitz-Thompson type estimator to the performance of a small area estimator). For this project, we use such a design-based simulation study. The synthetic population we use here is called AMELIA . Together with the sampling designs under consideration and the specific estimators we compare, it will be described in Section 2. In Section 3 we will present the main findings of our design-based simulation study. As the whole simulation setup is rather extensive, we focus on some crucial points that are of interest to the practitioner at an NSI. Based on these major findings, we discuss the implications for a practical implementation of the methods investigated in Section 4. The authors would like to address an important caveat right at this point. In the greater scheme of things, small area estimation methods are relatively young and a fruitful area of statistical research. A meaningful application of these complex methods necessitates a level of statistical knowledge of the user that is well above that provided by, say, basic courses in descriptive and inferential statistics in typical economics programmes at universities. Therefore, it is impossible to derive a manual including hard-and-fast rules like the following: Given situation X and auxiliary variable Y, use estimator Z . We will point out situations in which small area estimation methods may lead to an improvement of point estimates. However, given the very diverse survey and data situations in Europe (which are themselves subject to changes over time), statisticians at NSIs should be well- trained in order to apply such methods. The actual institutional framework prevailing in the respective member state has a considerable impact as well and should therefore be accounted for. Otherwise, there is a considerable risk of reaching less than desirable outcomes. In this light, this paper tries to shed some light on potential ways to harness small area estimation methods for the estimation of city statistics. ",
        "A framework for the investigation of investigation of different options 2 Small area estimation for city statistics and other functional areas 10 2 A framework for the investigation of different options 2.1 The synthetic population AMELIA As already mentioned in Section 1, the close-to-reality synthetic population AMELIA, which was created to perform design-based Monte Carlo simulation studies in survey statistics, is used as the starting point of our investigation (Burgard et al., 2017b). AMELIA was originally created within the research project Advanced Methodology for European Laeken Indicators (AMELI) which was funded by the European Commission within its Seventh Framework Programme (Alfons et al., 2011). In its generation, mimicking the main properties of the population of the European Union was a main objective. These properties were found in EU-SILC data. After the AMELI project, the AMELIA dataset has been published on the AMELIA platform (see www.amelia.uni-trier.de) which is an outcome of the project Inclusive Growth Research Infrastructure Diffusion (InGRID), to foster open and reproducible research in survey statistics (Merkle and M\u00fcnnich, 2016). Not only the synthetic population itself has been published and made freely available. The population is accompanied by already drawn samples with various underlying sampling designs. A detailed data description is provided on the AMELIA platform (Burgard et al., 2017a). The main properties of AMELIA are listed below: \uf0b7 10,012,600 individuals \uf0b7 3,781,289 households \uf0b7 Regional structure o 4 regions (NUTS 1) o 11 provinces (NUTS 2) o 40 districts (NUTS 3) o 1,592 municipalities (LAU) \uf0b7 Variables on household and individual level Since AMELIA is based on EU-SILC, important poverty-related issues are already covered, i.e. variables that are necessary to calculate the at-risk-of-poverty rate ( ARPR ) consistent with EU-SILC. The ARPR is the share of people living in a household that has less than 60% of the national median equivalised disposable income available (c.f. Eurostat, 2018b). For the simulation study of this 2 A framework for the investigation of different options ",
        "A framework for the investigation of investigation of different options 2 Small area estimation for city statistics and other functional areas 11 project, however, new variables had to be generated. These variables are necessary to calculate the at risk of poverty or social exclusion rate (AROPE, c.f. Eurostat, 2018a) which is a composite indicator comprising three subindicators and the chosen target parameter in our simulation study. A person is only counted once no matter how many of the subindicators apply. One of the subindicators is the ARPR , the other two cover the topics material deprivation and work intensity. All persons in a given household are considered to be severly materially deprivated ( SMD , c.f. Eurostat, 2018c) if this household cannot afford at least four of nine items (c.f. Eurostat, 2010), which had to be generated for this project. A person lives in a household with low work intensity ( LWI , c.f. Eurostat, 2018d) if the household members of working age worked less than 20% of their potential within the last twelve months. All persons between 18-59 are considered as working-age persons with a few exceptions. Students between 18 and 24 are excluded from this group as well as households composed only of children, students under 25, or people aged 60 or above. These are not taken into account at all. Six new variables giving the number of months a person spent in different working situations (like full-time employment, part-time employment, unemployment, etc.) were generated in AMELIA consistent with the EU-SILC definitions (c.f. Eurostat, 2010). The generation of these variables was rather involved and included a discretisation of the original variables, latent class analysis, multinomial logistic regression models and random draws from outcomes. The reader interested in the details of this procedure is referred to Deliverable 1 of this project. 2.2 Construction of large cities in AMELIA Since the specific aim of this research project was an investigation of the potential gains of employing small area estimation methods to estimate certain indicators on the level of cities and functional urban areas, the basic synthetic population dataset, as described in the previous subsection, had to be suitably amended. AMELIA consists of 1,592 municipalities (variable CIT ) of varying degrees of urbanisation (variable DOU ) and varying household- and individual-level population sizes (the average number of households and individuals per municipality being 2,375 and 6,289, respectively). At this point it is worthwhile to remember that the aim of a design-based Monte Carlo simulation study is not a one-to-one reproduction of a real population and its (spatial) structures. The key point is to mimic some important characteristics of the data. Therefore, the absolute size of municipalities and cities is not important but rather their relative sizes. New synthetic large cities had to be integrated into AMELIA. The first starting point for this extension is the degree of urbanisation of municipalities that could either be thinly-populated, have an intermediate population density , or be densely-populated . A given municipality could only be part of a large city if it belongs to the group of densely-populated municipalities. Within this pre-selection of municipalities (covering approximately one third of the overall household ",
        "A framework for the investigation of investigation of different options 2 Small area estimation for city statistics and other functional areas 12 population and one fifth of the municipalities), first the ten municipalities with the largest population of individuals are chosen to be the cores of the new large cities to be constructed. As an assumption made to facilitate the further process, the non-core areas of the large cities have to belong to the same higher-level spatial unit (i.e. one of the 40 districts, variable DIS ) as their respective cores. Additionally, all municipalities forming one large city have to be connected spatially. Following this algorithm, we created ten large cities within AMELIA. These are labelled in descending order of population size and are shown in Figure 1. Further details are given in Table 1, where \ud835\udc41 \ud835\udc3b\ud835\udc3b and \ud835\udc41 \ud835\udc3c\ud835\udc41\ud835\udc37 are the household and individual population, respectively.

For example, a vast majority of countries apply stratification by regional, population size and/or degree of urbanization ( DOU ) variables for the mentioned surveys, but others are used as well. Sampling units most often include households (or related concepts), but in many cases, two-stage sampling is applied such that households are the second stage sampling units (SSUs), while larger regional aggregates are sampled as primary sampling units (PSUs) at the first stage.

        "Estimation strategies 3 Small area estimation for city statistics and other functional areas 15 3 Estimation strategies In the framework of our simulation study, the application of small area estimation methods will be analysed using the share of persons living at risk of poverty or social exclusion (AROPE) per area as target parameter. This section introduces the investigated estimation strategies and their implementation as well as potential adaptations in order to estimate the target parameter given the data situation mirrored in the simulation study. 3.1 Design-based estimation A common method of direct design-weighted estimation is the estimator by Horvitz and Thompson (1952). Let \ud835\udc66 \ud835\udc58 be the variable of interest of unit k and let \ud835\udf0b \ud835\udc58 be the corresponding inclusion probability. The design weight, \ud835\udc64 \ud835\udc58 , is the inverse of the units\u2019 inclusion probability. In addition, \ud835\udc46 \ud835\udc51 is the set of sampled units belonging to area d (while \ud835\udc48 \ud835\udc51 is the set of all \ud835\udc41 \ud835\udc51 units in area d . For each area with the running index \ud835\udc51 = 1, \u2026 , \ud835\udc37 , the total value \ud835\udf0f \ud835\udc51 = \u2211 \ud835\udc66 \ud835\udc58 \ud835\udc58\u2208\ud835\udc48 \ud835\udc51 is to be estimated. The Horvitz-Thompson estimator is an unbiased estimation function for \ud835\udf0f \ud835\udc51 and is given by \ud835\udf0f\u0302 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc3b\ud835\udc47 = \u2211 \ud835\udc66 \ud835\udc58 \ud835\udf0b \ud835\udc58 \ud835\udc58\u2208\ud835\udc46 \ud835\udc51 = \u2211 \ud835\udc64 \ud835\udc58 \ud835\udc66 \ud835\udc58 \ud835\udc58\u2208\ud835\udc46 \ud835\udc51 (1) Thus, the weighted values of the sampled units are summed up. Since this estimator only uses information from the area of interest, the estimation procedure is also referred to as direct estimation. When the area-specific mean \ud835\udf07 \ud835\udc51 = 1 \ud835\udc41 \ud835\udc51 \u2211 \ud835\udc66 \ud835\udc58 \ud835\udc58\u2208\ud835\udc48 \ud835\udc51 is of interest and the area-specific size \ud835\udc41 \ud835\udc51 is known, an unbiased estimator of \ud835\udf07 \ud835\udc51 is \ud835\udf07\u0302 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc3b\ud835\udc47 = \ud835\udf0f\u0302 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc3b\ud835\udc47 \ud835\udc41 \ud835\udc51 = 1 \ud835\udc41 \ud835\udc51 \u2211 \ud835\udc66 \ud835\udc58 \ud835\udf0b \ud835\udc58 \ud835\udc58\u2208\ud835\udc46 \ud835\udc51 (2) 3 Estimation strategies ",
        "Estimation strategies 3 Small area estimation for city statistics and other functional areas 16 In the present application, the estimation of proportions is of interest. Proportions are a special case of the mean, if the variable of interest \ud835\udc66 \ud835\udc58 is dichotomous. This implies that \ud835\udc66 \ud835\udc58 = 1 = if the k th unit has a characteristic of interest, i.e. is living at risk of poverty or social exclusion in this application, and \ud835\udc66 \ud835\udc58 = 0 if the k th unit does not have this characteristic (Lohr, 2009, p. 30). If the estimator (2) is used for the estimation of proportions, it cannot be ruled out that \ud835\udf07\u0302 \ud835\udc3b\ud835\udc47 > 1 . Respective estimates might be corrected downwards to the value 1, whereby however the estimation is no longer unbiased. Alternatively, both \ud835\udf0f \ud835\udc51 and \ud835\udc41 \ud835\udc51 might be estimated and used to estimate \ud835\udf07 \ud835\udc51 . The estimator is also called the weighted sample mean and is given by \ud835\udf07 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc3b\ud835\udc47 \ud835\udc64 = \ud835\udf0f\u0302 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc3b\ud835\udc47 \ud835\udc41\u0302 \ud835\udc51 = \u2211 \ud835\udc66 \ud835\udc58 \ud835\udf0b \ud835\udc58 \u2044 \ud835\udc58\u2208\ud835\udc46 \ud835\udc51 \u2211 1 \ud835\udf0b \ud835\udc58 \u2044 \ud835\udc58\u2208\ud835\udc46 \ud835\udc51 (3) (S\u00c4RNDAL et al., 1992, p. 182). Both approaches will be compared in the simulation study. 3.2 Model-assisted estimation Population registers containing information at the level of households and even persons are an extensive source of auxiliary information. These are highly suitable for the stabilisation of estimation. The generalised regression ( GREG ) estimator is a so-called model-assisted estimation approach. Its purpose is to reduce the design variance of the estimator by using a model that describes the relationship between the variable of interest \ud835\udc66 \ud835\udc58 and the auxiliary variables \ud835\udc65 \ud835\udc58 . The combination with a classical design-based estimator, such as the unbiased Horvitz-Thompson estimator, preserves the property of a low design bias. This asymptotic unbiasedness is given even if the model is misspecified (see S\u00e4rndal et al., 1992, p. 227). The GREG estimator for the total of the variable \ud835\udc66 \ud835\udc58 in area d is given by \ud835\udf0f\u0302 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc3a\ud835\udc45\ud835\udc38\ud835\udc3a = \u2211 \ud835\udc66\u0302 \ud835\udc58 \ud835\udc58\u2208\ud835\udc48 \ud835\udc51 + \u2211 \ud835\udc64 \ud835\udc58 (\ud835\udc66 \ud835\udc58 \u2212 \ud835\udc66\u0302 \ud835\udc58 ) \ud835\udc58\u2208\ud835\udc46 \ud835\udc51 (4) (cf. Lehtonen and Veijanen, 2009, p. 229). Here, \ud835\udc66\u0302 \ud835\udc58 is the estimated variable of interest for each unit k . The first part of the GREG estimator shown in (4) is the sum of the variables of interest predicted from the model \ud835\udc66\u0302 \ud835\udc58 over all units belonging to area d . Although this synthetic estimation component usually has a low variance due to the underlying model, a bias cannot be avoided. However, this bias is corrected by the so-called bias correction term, i.e. by the weighted sum of the residuals from the sample. Thus, the GREG estimator is asymptotically design-unbiased. ",
        "Estimation strategies 3 Small area estimation for city statistics and other functional areas 17 A further modification of the GREG estimator is implemented in the simulation study, which additionally includes the area size \ud835\udc41 \ud835\udc51 . It has a smaller variance than estimator (4) and is given by \ud835\udf0f\u0302 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc3a\ud835\udc45\ud835\udc38\ud835\udc3a_\ud835\udc41 = \u2211 \ud835\udc66\u0302 \ud835\udc58 \ud835\udc58\u2208\ud835\udc48 \ud835\udc51 + (\ud835\udc41 \ud835\udc51 \ud835\udc41\u0302 \ud835\udc51 \u2044 ) \u2211 \ud835\udc64 \ud835\udc58 (\ud835\udc66 \ud835\udc58 \u2212 \ud835\udc66\u0302 \ud835\udc58 ) \ud835\udc58\u2208\ud835\udc46 \ud835\udc51 (5) (cf. Lehtonen and Veijanen, 2009, p. 234). In the simulation study, the model applied to determine the relation between \ud835\udc66 \ud835\udc58 and the auxiliary variables \ud835\udc65 \ud835\udc58 depends on the respective sampling design. If persons are the final sampling units, the variable of interest is dichotomous, i.e. the person is either living at risk of poverty or social exclusion or not. Correspondingly a probit model is used within the GREG estimator. In case households have been sampled as final sampling units, the variable of interest is the number of persons living at risk of poverty in the respective household. In this instance, the relation between the target variable and the auxiliary variables is modelled using a poisson model. 3.3 Model-based estimation 3.3.1 Fay-Herriot estimator The area-level estimator according to Fay and Herriot (1979) is using certain auxiliary information that have been aggregated for the area of interest. Therefore, the model is especially applied in cases where the availability of data on micro level is limited. The area-level model can be divided into two parts: the sampling model and the linking model (see Jiang and Lahiri, 2006, p. 6). The sampling model for each of the D areas of interest with index \ud835\udc51 = 1, \u2026 , \ud835\udc37 , is given by \ud835\udf07\u0302 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc37\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc5f = \ud835\udf07 \ud835\udc51 + \ud835\udc52 \ud835\udc51 (6) with a direct estimator \ud835\udf07\u0302 \ud835\udc51 \ud835\udc37\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc5f . It is assumed that the sampling errors \ud835\udc52 \ud835\udc51 are independent and \ud835\udc52 \ud835\udc51 ~\ud835\udc41(0, \ud835\udf13 \ud835\udc51 ) with the sampling variance \ud835\udf13 \ud835\udc51 . Therefore, it is supposed that \ud835\udf07\u0302 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc37\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc5f is a design- unbiased estimator for \ud835\udf07 \ud835\udc51 . In the context of the linking model, the assumption of a linear relation between the parameter to be estimated, \ud835\udf07 \ud835\udc51 , and true area-specific auxiliary variables is made. Hence, \ud835\udf07 \ud835\udc51 = X \u0305 \ud835\udc51 \ud835\udc47 \ud835\udefd + \ud835\udc63 \ud835\udc51 (7) ",
        "Estimation strategies 3 Small area estimation for city statistics and other functional areas 18 applies with \ud835\udc63 \ud835\udc51 ~\ud835\udc41(0, \ud835\udf0e \ud835\udc632 ) . Here, X \ud835\udc51 designates the population average of the used auxiliary variables in area d . The random effect \ud835\udc63 \ud835\udc51 incorporates variations between the areas that cannot be explained by the fixed effect of the regression term. The variance of the random effects \ud835\udf0e \ud835\udc632 is also called model variance as it measures the variance between the areas, which cannot be explained by the fixed component of the model. X \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc47 \ud835\udefd is the regression term with the vector of regression coefficients \ud835\udefd , which measures the fixed effects over all areas. This is the relationship between the variable to be explained and the auxiliary information. In combination, the sampling model and the linking model result in the linear mixed model \ud835\udf07\u0302 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc37\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc5f = X\u0305 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc47 \ud835\udefd + \ud835\udc63 \ud835\udc51 + \ud835\udc52 \ud835\udc51 (8) with \ud835\udc63 \ud835\udc51 (0, \ud835\udf0e \ud835\udc632 ) ~ \ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc51 and \ud835\udc52 \ud835\udc51 (0, \ud835\udf13 \ud835\udc51 ~ \ud835\udc56\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc51 ) as a basis for the Fay-Herriot estimator. Here, the direct estimator, which has been built on the basis of a sample, forms the dependent variable. By assuming that the model variance \ud835\udf0e \ud835\udc632 is known, the best linear unbiased predictor ( BLUP ) is given by \ud835\udf07\u0302 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc39\ud835\udc3b = X\u0305 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc47 \ud835\udefd\u0302 + \ud835\udc63\u0302 \ud835\udc51 (9) with \ud835\udc63\u0302 \ud835\udc51 = \ud835\udefe \ud835\udc51 (\ud835\udf07\u0302 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc37\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc5f \u2212 X\u0305 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc47 \ud835\udefd\u0302 ) and \ud835\udefe \ud835\udc51 = \ud835\udf0e \ud835\udc632 (\ud835\udf13 \ud835\udc51 +\ud835\udf0e \ud835\udc632 ) (see Rao and Molina, 2015, p. 124). As the so-called shrinkage factor \ud835\udefe \ud835\udc51 measures the relation between the model variance \ud835\udf0e \ud835\udc632 and the total variance \ud835\udf13 \ud835\udc51 + \ud835\udf0e \ud835\udc632 , it might be considered as the uncertainty of the model with respect to the estimation of the area-specific mean values \ud835\udf07\u0302 \ud835\udc51 . The vector of regression coefficients \ud835\udefd is estimated by the weighted least squares method and is given by \ud835\udefd\u0302 = (\u2211 X\u0305 \ud835\udc51 X\u0305 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc47 (\ud835\udf13 \ud835\udc51 + \ud835\udf0e \ud835\udc632 ) \ud835\udc37 \ud835\udc51=1 ) \u22121 (\u2211 X\u0305 \ud835\udc51 \ud835\udf07\u0302 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc37\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc5f (\ud835\udf13 \ud835\udc51 + \ud835\udf0e \ud835\udc632 ) \ud835\udc37 \ud835\udc51=1 ) (10) By plugging into \ud835\udc63\u0302 \ud835\udc51 = \ud835\udefe \ud835\udc51 ( \ud835\udf07 \u0302 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc37\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc5f \u2212 X \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc47 \ud835\udefd \u0302) into \ud835\udf07\u0302 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc39\ud835\udc3b = X \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc47 \ud835\udefd\u0302 + \ud835\udc63\u0302 \ud835\udc51 the BLUP might be transformed as follows: ",
        "Estimation strategies 3 Small area estimation for city statistics and other functional areas 19 \ud835\udf07\u0302 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc39\ud835\udc3b = \ud835\udefe \ud835\udc51 \ud835\udf07\u0302 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc37\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc5f + (1 \u2212 \ud835\udefe \ud835\udc51 )X\u0305 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc47 \ud835\udefd\u0302 (11) As a result of the transformation, it is visible the model-based estimator according to Fay and Herriot (1979) is a weighted average of the direct estimator \ud835\udf07\u0302 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc37\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc5f and the regression-synthetic estimator X \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc47 \ud835\udefd\u0302 . The weight of the single components hereby depends on the shrinkage factor \ud835\udefe \ud835\udc51 . Hence, if the sampling variance of the direct estimators \ud835\udf13 \ud835\udc51 is comparatively high in an area d , the respective \ud835\udefe \ud835\udc51 tends to be comparatively low. As the direct estimator for this area is considered to be unreliable, a correspondingly large weight is placed on the regression-synthetic part of the BLUP . If, on the contrary, a low area-specific sampling variance \ud835\udf13 \ud835\udc51 or a high general model variance \ud835\udf0e \ud835\udc632 is given, the weight increases and more confidence is put in the direct estimator of the respective area. In the practical application, \ud835\udf0e \ud835\udc632 is unknown and has to be estimated as well. For this purpose a number of approaches exist. Within the following estimation, the variance parameter has been estimated by means of the restricted maximum likelihood ( REML ) method. For details with respect to this approach, we refer to Rao and Molina (2015, pp. 102-105; 127-128). By replacing the model variance \ud835\udf0e \ud835\udc632 by the estimated variance of the random effects \ud835\udf0e\u0302 \ud835\udc632 in (9) and (10), the empirical best linear unbiased predictor ( EBLUP ) is obtained. 3.3.2 Battese-Harter-Fuller estimator In contrast to the area-level models described in the previous section, unit-level models do not use aggregate information but micro-level information instead, which enables a more efficient estimation. The standard procedure is the Battese-Harter- Fuller estimator (cf. Battese et al., 1988). The model underlying the Battese-Harter-Fuller estimator and assumed for the population is a special form of the general mixed linear regression model and given by \ud835\udc66 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc58 = \ud835\udc65 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc58 \ud835\udc47 \ud835\udefd + \ud835\udc63 \ud835\udc51 + \ud835\udc52 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc58 , \ud835\udc51 = 1, \u2026 , \ud835\udc37 , \ud835\udc58 = 1, \u2026 , \ud835\udc41 \ud835\udc51 (12) with \ud835\udc63 \ud835\udc51 (0, \ud835\udf0e \ud835\udc63 2 ~ \ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc51 ) and \ud835\udc52 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc58 (0, \ud835\udf0e \ud835\udc52 2 ~ \ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc51 ). The vector of the regression coefficients \ud835\udefd measures the relationship between the variable of interest \ud835\udc66 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc58 and the auxiliary variables \ud835\udc65 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc58 \ud835\udc47 over all areas and units. The term \ud835\udc52 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc58 describes the individual sampling error of the units within the unit-level model. As in (8), the variance of the random effects \ud835\udf0e \ud835\udc632 , also referred to as model variance, measures the variance between the areas that cannot be explained by the fixed component of the model. It is also assumed that \ud835\udf0e \ud835\udc632 and \ud835\udf0e \ud835\udc522 are independent of each other. Assuming that the mixed regression model (12) also applies to the sample, the mean value of the variable of interest per area is estimated by the BLUP according to Battese, Harter and Fuller (1988): ",
        "Estimation strategies 3 Small area estimation for city statistics and other functional areas 20 \ud835\udf07\u0302 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc35\ud835\udc3b\ud835\udc39 = X\u0305 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc47 \ud835\udefd\u0302 + \ud835\udc63\u0302 \ud835\udc51 (13) with \ud835\udc63\u0302 \ud835\udc51 = \ud835\udefe \ud835\udc51 (\ud835\udc66\u0305 \ud835\udc51 \u2212 \ud835\udc65\u0305 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc47 \ud835\udefd\u0302 ) and \ud835\udefe \ud835\udc51 = \ud835\udf0e \ud835\udc632 \ud835\udf0e \ud835\udc632 +\ud835\udf0e \ud835\udc522 \ud835\udc5b \ud835\udc51 \u2044 (cf. Rao and Molina, 2015, p. 174 f.), where \ud835\udc66 \ud835\udc51 and \ud835\udc65 \ud835\udc51 are the sample averages of the variable of interest and the auxiliary variables in area d , respectively. The auxiliary information X \ud835\udc51 , on the other hand, includes both units included and not included in the sample. The BLUP can also be transformed into a composite estimation function: \ud835\udf07\u0302 \ud835\udc51 \ud835\udc35\ud835\udc3b\ud835\udc39 = \ud835\udefe \ud835\udc51 (\ud835\udc66\u0305 \ud835\udc51 + (X\u0305 \ud835\udc51 \u2212 \ud835\udc65\u0305 \ud835\udc51 ) \ud835\udc47 \ud835\udefd \u0302 ) + (1 \u2212 \ud835\udefe \ud835\udc51 )X\u0305 \ud835\udc51 \ud835\udc47 \ud835\udefd \u0302 (14) Here, it has to be recognised that the Battese-Harter-Fuller estimator is a weighted average of the direct sample regression estimator \ud835\udc66 \ud835\udc51 + (X \ud835\udc51 \u2212 \ud835\udc65 \ud835\udc51 ) \ud835\udc47 \ud835\udefd\u0302 and the regression-synthetic component X \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc47 \ud835\udefd\u0302 . The weighting factor \ud835\udefe \ud835\udc51 indicates for each area the share of the model variance in relation to the total variance and determines how much weight is given to the respective components. With a high model variance of \ud835\udf0e \ud835\udc632 or a large area-specific sample size \ud835\udc5b \ud835\udc51 , respectively, much confidence is placed in the direct sample regression estimator. In turn, the BLUP tends to approach the synthetic component if the model variance is low or the sample size is small. Accordingly, for areas in which no unit has been sampled ( \ud835\udc5b \ud835\udc51 = 0 , so \ud835\udefe \ud835\udc51 = 0 ), the BLUP consists entirely of the synthetic estimator. However, this assumes that the auxiliary characteristics of the units of this area are present, so that the area-specific average value X \ud835\udc51 can be taken into account in the estimation. However, since the model variance \ud835\udf0e \ud835\udc632 and the variance of the sampling error \ud835\udf0e \ud835\udc522 are not known in practice, they have to be estimated. There are various methods for estimating the variance components. By replacing the variance components of the BLUP with the corresponding estimated values, the unit-level EBLUP is created according to Battese, Harter and Fuller (1988). 3.3.3 Measurement error model When using model-based small area methods, it is generally assumed that the auxiliary information X \ud835\udc51 is correct and free of errors. However, this is not always the case in practice. Especially in this application, it is mostly inevitable to use covariates from a survey which, however, tend to be subject to sampling errors. Thus, it cannot be guaranteed that the auxiliary variable averages X \ud835\udc51 are actually the true population averages. Ybarra and Lohr (2008) show that the Fay-Herriot estimator can be even more inefficient than the simple direct design-weighted estimator when using incorrect auxiliary ",
        "Estimation strategies 3 Small area estimation for city statistics and other functional areas 21 information X\u0305\u0302 \ud835\udc51 . The solution proposed by Ybarra and Lohr (2008) is a conditionally unbiased estimation procedure based on a so-called measurement error model and used for erroneous covariables. First, it is assumed that X\u0305\u0302 \ud835\udc51 \ud835\udc41 ~ \ud835\udc56\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc51 ( X \ud835\udc51 , \ud835\udc36 \ud835\udc51 ) , where \ud835\udc36 \ud835\udc51 is the known variance-covariance matrix of the estimated mean values of the register variables. Furthermore, X\u0305\u0302 \ud835\udc51 is independent of \ud835\udc63 \ud835\udc51 and \ud835\udc52 \ud835\udc51 (see Rao and Molina, 2015, p. 156). Like the Fay-Herriot estimator, the measurement error estimator is also a linear combination of the direct estimator and a regression-synthetic part: \ud835\udf07\u0302 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc40\ud835\udc38 = \ud835\udefe \ud835\udc51 \ud835\udf07\u0302 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc37\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc5f + (1 \u2212 \ud835\udefe \ud835\udc51 )X\u0305\u0302 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc47 \ud835\udefd (15) The weighting factor \ud835\udefe \ud835\udc51 depends not only on the model variance \ud835\udf0e \ud835\udc632 and the design variance \ud835\udf13 \ud835\udc51 but also on the variability of the estimated auxiliary variables. The optimal weighting factor, which minimises the MSE of the measurement error estimator over all linear combinations, is given by \ud835\udefe \ud835\udc51 = \ud835\udf0e \ud835\udc632 + \ud835\udefd \ud835\udc47 \ud835\udc36 \ud835\udc51 \ud835\udefd \ud835\udf0e \ud835\udc632 + \ud835\udefd \ud835\udc47 \ud835\udc36 \ud835\udc51 \ud835\udefd + \ud835\udf13 \ud835\udc51 (16) The more inexactly X\u0305\u0302 \ud835\udc51 is measured, the greater are \ud835\udc36 \ud835\udc51 and the weight \ud835\udefe \ud835\udc51 , which is put on the direct estimator \ud835\udf07\u0302 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc37\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc5f . If the measurement of X\u0305\u0302 \ud835\udc51 is made without error ( \ud835\udc36 \ud835\udc51 = 0), \ud835\udf07\u0302 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc40\ud835\udc38 is reduced to the Fay-Harriot estimator by \ud835\udefe \ud835\udc51 = \ud835\udf0e \ud835\udc632 /( \ud835\udf0e \ud835\udc632 + \ud835\udf13 \ud835\udc51 ) . Assuming that the parameters \ud835\udefd , \ud835\udf0e \ud835\udc632 , and \ud835\udf13 \ud835\udc51 are known, the MSE of (15) is \ud835\udc40\ud835\udc46\ud835\udc38(\ud835\udf07\u0302 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc40\ud835\udc38 ) = \ud835\udefe \ud835\udc51 \ud835\udf13 \ud835\udc51 (17) Since 0 \u2264 \ud835\udefe \ud835\udc51 \u2264 1 , the MSE of the measurement error estimator is at most as large as the MSE of the direct estimator \ud835\udf13 \ud835\udc51 . The MSE of the Fay-Herriot estimator, on the other hand, can be greater than \ud835\udf13 \ud835\udc51 if incorrect auxiliary information is taken into account (see Ybarra and Lohr, 2008, p. 921). Consequently, the measurement error estimator is an improvement over the general area-level model in which erroneous covariates are ignored. As with the small area estimators presented above, the regression coefficients \ud835\udefd and the model variance \ud835\udf0e \ud835\udc632 are unknown in practice and must be estimated. The model variance is estimated by a simple moment estimator, which is given by ",

Ybarra and Lohr (2008, p. 924) show that \ud835\udefd \u0302 \ud835\udc64 and \ud835\udf0e\u0302 \ud835\udc632 are consistent estimators for \ud835\udefd and \ud835\udf0e \ud835\udc632 respectively, for \ud835\udc37 \u2192 \u221e . Here \ud835\udc64 \ud835\udc51 = 1 (\ud835\udf0e \ud835\udc632 + \ud835\udf13 \ud835\udc51 + \ud835\udefd \ud835\udc47 \ud835\udc36 \ud835\udc51 \ud835\udefd) \u2044 are positive finite weights. The parameters are estimated in a two-step process. First, \ud835\udc64 \ud835\udc51 = 1 . The \ud835\udefd and \ud835\udf0e \ud835\udc632 are then estimated by (18) and (19). Based on the two estimates, the weights \ud835\udc64\u0302 \ud835\udc51 are estimated again, to finally obtain the final estimates \ud835\udefd\u0302 \ud835\udc64 and \ud835\udf0e\u0302 \ud835\udc632 (see ibid). In the simulation study, it is assumed that the area-level auxiliary variables are estimates from another survey and that their variance-covariance-matrix \ud835\udc36 \ud835\udc51 is known. This variance-covariance- matrix has been defined for each area separately taking into account the variables covariances across all areas and a coefficient of variation of 10%. Using the known true values of area-specific covariates X \ud835\udc51 and the defined matrix \ud835\udc36 \ud835\udc51 , the \u2019estimated\u2019 covariates are generat ed randomly in each iteration. The known variance-covariance-matrix \ud835\udc36 \ud835\udc51 is then used within the estimation technique according to Ybarra and Lohr (2008). 3.4 Synthetic estimation by cluster analysis A further possibility is to cluster municipalities, cities or other areas of interest into regions which are homogeneous with respect to selected auxiliary variables that significantly correlate with the target variable. The target variable is then estimated for each cluster separately. This can be done by means of design-based, model- assisted, or model-based estimation techniques. However, it has to be considered that the estimate is identical for the areas that belong to the same cluster and can thus be considered as some type of synthetic estimate. While dealing with this approach, it is indirectly assumed that the variable of interest is homogeneous within each cluster. If this assumption is not valid, the estimators might be biased. As the population age and gender structures of various areas tend to be variables easily accessible and nevertheless meaningful auxiliary variables, a cluster analysis based on this criteria is ",
        "Estimation strategies 3 Small area estimation for city statistics and other functional areas 23 investigated within the simulation. At first, the mean age and the percentage of men is calculated for each area of interest. Both variables are then standardized by centering and dividing them by two standard deviations in order to avoid that one variable significantly predominates the division into clusters. Using the k-means clustering algorithm, all areas of interest are then assigned to clusters. In the simulation study, a total of ten clusters has been proven suitable. For each cluster, a Horvitz- Thompson estimate of the cluster mean is computed using approach (3). Subsequently, the mean estimate is assigned to all areas belonging to the respective cluster. ",
        "Selected results of the simulation study 4 Small area estimation for city statistics and other functional areas 24 4 Selected results of the simulation study The process flow of the Monte Carlo simulation study is depicted in Figure 2. Starting with the synthetic population AMELIA (see Section 2 and Burgard et al., 2017b), the sampling designs described in Table 2 are implemented. R = 2 000 samples are drawn according to each design and the estimation strategies are applied to each sample. The utilized auxiliary information depends on the type of the estimation approach and on the respective sampling design. For approaches using aggregated covariates, such as the Fay-Herriot estimator or the measurement error model according to Ybarra and Lohr (2008), auxiliary variables at area-level assumed to be known in practice are applied to stabilise the estimation. These include the share of persons with an ISCED-level of at least 5 ( ISCED56 ), the unemployment rate ( UER ), the share of native-born persons ( COB_LOC ), the share of persons paying rent ( RENT ), the share of persons with a managerial position ( SUP ), the share of persons under the age of 20 ( U20 ) as well as the AMELIA-region the respective area is belonging to ( REG ). For estimation approaches at the individual data level, such as the GREG estimator or the Battese- Harter-Fuller estimator, information was utilized which seemed realistic to be available at unit-level in practice. Among others, these include data on the age of persons (AGE), the basic activity status ( BAS ), the country of birth ( COB ). In addition, again the AMELIA-region the respective area is belonging to ( REG ) is included as a factor variable. When persons are the final sampling units of the respective sampling designs, these unit-level information are observed at the individual level. In case households have been drawn as final sampling units, the respective unit-level information are aggregated for all members of the respective household. There are various evaluation techniques for the large number of resulting estimates. 4 Selected results of the simulation study ",

In Equations 20 and 21, \ud835\udf03 is the true parameter (known because we use a synthetic population and are able to compute the target parameter using synthetic census data) to be estimated from the samples, and \ud835\udf03\u0302 \ud835\udc5f is the estimate computed using the r-th sample. Before deriving the AROPE estimates at city-level, a reliable estimation of the target variable at municipality-level is required. Subsequently, the estimates are aggregated in order to obtain estimations for the large cities of AMELIA. Figure 3 illustrates the results of three different versions of the Horvitz-Thompson estimator for the estimation of the AROPE rate at municipality-level, i.e. for the 1,592 municipalities corresponding to the LAU level included in AMELIA. Both the relative bias and the RRMSE are depicted depending on selected sampling designs implemented in the simulation. HT_N is the common Horvitz-Thompson mean estimator according to equation (2). It can be confirmed that the estimations according to this approach are unbiased with respect to every sampling design. Nevertheless, the estimates are subject to a remarkable RRMSE indicating that the estimations are unbiased but inefficient, especially when dealing with two-stage sampling approaches. This is due to the fact that, although the target values are proportions, the estimates can take values clearly larger than 1 while the estimates for non-sampled areas have the value 0. Two-stage sampling approaches often have municipalities or some regions consisting of several municipalities as primary sampling units. Therefore, the areas of interest are either not sampled at all or sampled at a comparatively high sampling fraction. In these cases, the estimation of the AROPE rate is certainly unbiased, but either takes the value 0 or a value far above 1. Under the approach HT01 , values larger than 1 have been corrected downwards to 1. This adaptation clearly decreased the relative RRSME, even if the estimates are now no longer unbiased. An improvement of the efficiency can also achieved by the weighted sample mean HT_w (3). ",

Here, the additional estimation of \ud835\udc41 \ud835\udc51 causes a clear stabilisation of the estimation. However, it has to be noted that this representation neglects the sum of non-sampled areas given the respective designs. Therefore, Table 3 lists the percentage share of non-sampled areas for the samples drawn according to the different designs in the simulation study. The large share of non- sampled areas using a two-stage design is particularly high. Hereby, purely design-based estimation strategies cannot be applied at all to the respective areas. At least in such cases, a model-assisted or model-based approach has to be utilised. ",

Focussing at the relative bias at first, slight biases can be observed occasionally, which is not surprising dealing with model-based estimation approaches.

        "Selected results of the simulation study 4 Small area estimation for city statistics and other functional areas 29 Figure 4: Results: Small area estimation at municipality-level under selected simple random sampling and stratified random sampling approaches Sources: see section 5 - References With regard to the RRMSE, all implemented small area estimation approaches induce an improvement compared to the weighted sample mean ( HT ). Especially the synthetic Horvitz- Thompson estimates for clustered municipalities convinces through a remarkable low RRMSE for most areas. However, these results can be explained by the synthetic nature of the population AMELIA and therefore need to be treated with caution. As AMELIA is partitioned into different regions, which have their own structures in terms of age, gender and poverty, these regions also recur in the formed clusters. In reality, the differences between clusters can be considered less hard, which also reduces the potential of the synthetic estimation approach. The results of the Battese-Harter-Fuller estimator are likewise convincing, which emphasizes the potential contained in unit-level information. The Fay-Herriot estimator and the Ybarra-Lohr estimator are largely similar. Despite the utilization of estimated area-level auxiliary variables, the estimator based on the measurement error model ( YL ) therefore seems to compete with the Fay-Herriot estimator employing true covariates.

However, the RRMSE of the estimations for the observed areas based on a two-stage sampling design has clearly decreased when utilizing the GREG estimator or an area-level model estimator, such as the Fay-Herriot or the Ybarra-Lohr estimator. This might be explained by the fact that, in two-stage designs, those areas that have been sampled as a primary sampling unit are sampled to a comparatively high extent. The relatively high sampling fraction in sampled areas might cause a more stable model estimation in case of the respective approaches. ",

Again an underestimation of the target parameter can be observed using the Battese-Harter-Fuller estimator in combination with a sampling design at household-level. The remaining estimations are subject to a relative bias that is comparable to the estimation at municipality-level. Overall, however, it can be observed that the potential for improvement by using the implemented small area estimation approaches declines at city-level. This is due to the fact that the direct estimation using the weighted sample mean is already subject to a comparatively high quality given the increased number of area-specific sampling units. Only the clustering approach and the Battese-Harter-Fuller estimator cause a further reduction of the RRMSE. ",

Here, again, the Battese-Harter-Fuller approach is not convincing in terms of both the relative bias and the RRMSE. The other estimation techniques however cause a clear improvement of the estimation efficiency under a household-level two-stage design. The decrease of the RRMSE under the two-stage sampling at person-level however is only marginal, as the estimation quality is already comparatively high in this case. In general, the performance of different small area estimation approaches clearly depends on the respective sample size of the areas of interest. The expected sample size however also depends on the size of the area itself. To investigate the influence of different areas sizes on the estimation quality, different size categories have been classified. These comprise small AMELIA municipalities (less than 1,000 inhabitants; Mun_S ), medium-sized municipalities (from 1000 to 11,000 inhabitants; Mun_M ), large municipalities (more than 11,000 inhabitants; Mun_L ) as well as the constructed large cities (City).

        "Selected results of the simulation study 4 Small area estimation for city statistics and other functional areas 34 The RRMSE of the estimation approaches in each of the constructed size categories depending on two selected sampling designs is illustrated in Figure 8. Hereby, the different axis scalings have to be noted. In particular, it is of interest to what extent an improvement can be achieved in comparison to the weighted sample mean ( HT ) not including any auxiliary information. Especially when the estimation of the AROPE rate in small municipalities is of interest, the RRMSE of the weighted sample mean in most areas is unbearably high due to comparatively low expected sample sizes in these areas. By incorporating auxiliary information, the examined estimation approaches are able to clearly increase the efficiency of the estimation. The potential for improvement by using the estimation approaches slightly decreases with increasing area size. Focusing on the STSI_P sampling design, it becomes obvious that especially the improvement by using the GREG estimator or the Fay-Herriot estimator declines. The clustering estimation and the Battese-Harter-Fuller estimator however still achieve a clear improvement of the estimation quality. If however the samples have been drawn according to the two-stage design TS_P1 , the potential for improvement decreases throughout all investigated estimation approaches. Especially the estimation using the weighted sample mean in large municipalities ( Mun_L ) is already comparatively reliable due to relatively high expected sample sizes, which enable a direct design-based estimation of sufficient precision. Thus, an estimation using the clustering approach, the GREG estimator or the Battese-Harter-Fuller estimator even causes a decline in the estimation quality for certain areas. Therefore, it has to be noted that the choice of the estimation strategy and whether to apply small area estimation approaches depend on the area-specific sample size, which tends to increase with the size of the areas given the common sampling designs of European social surveys.

        "M a i n t i t l e 2 017 e d i t i o n Small area estimation for city statistics and other functional geographies The city data collection is one the regular data collections of Eurostat and the National Statistical Institutes. The demand for timely and reliable socio-economic data on cities and Functional Urban Areas has significantly increased. Since 2017, the cities and their Functional Urban Areas are legally recognised by the amended NUTS Regulation. To produce socio-economic data coming originally from sample surveys at the level of small units such as cities, Functional Urban Areas and other functional geographies is a complex task which requires the application of small area estimation techniques since those functional geographies are usually not incorporated in the sampling design. This paper aims at investigating on the performance of different estimation strategies against the background of various sampling designs used by the National Statistical Institute. Therefore, a design-based Monte Carlo simulation study using a synthetic but close-to-reality population has been performed. The results show that all investigated estimation approaches are able to increase the efficiency and the quality of the estimates compared to the classical design-weighted estimation techniques.
