Financing under these agreements is provided from the European Development Fund (EDF), EU Member States\u2019 budgets, and EIB own resources, which the Bank borrows on the international capital markets. The Bank is entrusted with the management of the Investment Facility, a revolving fund which meets the financing needs of investment projects in the regions with a broad range of flexible risk-bearing instruments. To support the preparation and implementation of the projects it finances, the EIB is also able to provide grants in the form of interest rate subsidies and technical assistance to its borrowers and final beneficiaries.
