        "1. The role of infrastructure development in fostering regional integration Debate with Amina Mohamed, Cabinet Secretary for Foreign Affairs and International Trade (Kenya) Amina Mohamed, Cabinet Secretary for Foreign Affairs and International Trade (Kenya), pointed out that African regional integration, inclusive sustainable development and economic growth could not become a reality without adequate infrastructure. She underlined that recent progress made in regional road construction remained insufficient as 75 % of Africa\u2019s road network was still unpaved. She therefore called for massive investment in credible regional projects connecting different parts of the continent. Moreover, regional power grids should be put in place, while non-tariff barriers to trade should be eliminated. She described the setting-up of the \u2018Central Corridor\u2019 and the development of an inter-modal connection from Kenya to Cameroon and the Atlantic Ocean, passing through South Sudan, and underlined the importance of developing public-private partnerships (PPPs) and technical skills. On a separate note, she called for the adoption of a UN convention on terrorism, so that the scourge of terrorism could be dealt with more efficiently. Speakers: Mmadi Hassani (Comores), Anna Z\u00e1borsk\u00e1, Joyce Laboso (Kenya), Alpha Ousmane (Burkina Faso), Bodil Valero, Joachim Zeller, Louis H. Straker (Saint Vincent and the Grenadines), Bogdan Brunon Wenta, Tesfaye Daba (Ethiopia), Michael Gahler, Domenico Rosa (Commission) and Stefano Dejak (EU Delegation). Members underlined the importance of developing alternative sources of energy, such as geo-thermal power, for which there was considerable potential in Kenya, and stressed the importance of developing better public transport in major cities. Amina Mohamed responded to questions and wound up the debate. 2. Approval of the minutes of the afternoon sitting of Monday, 19 December 2016. The minutes were approved. 3. How to support the resettlement of migrants in their home country Debate with Georges-Henri Beauthier, barrister and human rights lawyer Georges-Henri Beauthier, a barrister and human rights lawyer, pointed out that Europe had not been dealing with the problem of migration in an appropriate or uniform manner. The importance was highlighted, therefore, of improving the conditions of repatriated people in their countries of origin. The Fondation pour l\u2019\u00e9galit\u00e9 des chances en Afrique supported and promoted basic social, health and educational facilities, as well as more affordable access to microcredit, vocational training in sectors where jobs were available, and the creation of cultural centres. Georges-Henri Beauthier criticised the EU Return Directive for failing to adhere to the Geneva Conventions and for its tendency to lead to the outsourcing of basic services for refugees to external companies, which cannot be controlled. Speakers: Alhaji Sillah (Gambia), Agust\u00edn Diaz de Mera, Alpha Ousmane (Burkina Faso), Ole Christensen, Musa Hussein Naib (Eritrea), Arne Gericke, Joyce Laboso (Kenya), Marielle de Sarnez, Tesfaye Daba (Ethiopia), Maria Lidia Senra Rodriguez, Ahamada Soukouna (Mali), Bodil Valero, Amadou Dioffo (Niger), Louis Aliot, Wamai Jack Wamanga (Uganda), IN THE CHAIR: C\u00e9cile Kashetu KYENGE Acting Co-President Mariya Gabriel, Juan Fernando L\u00f3pez Aguilar, Nathalie Griesbeck, Joachim Zeller, Mohamed Youssouf Goumaneh (Djibouti), Anna Z\u00e1borsk\u00e1, Teresa Jim\u00e9nez-Becerril Barrio, IN THE CHAIR: Mich\u00e8le RIVASI Acting Co-President C\u00e9cile Kashetu Kyenge, Louis H. Straker (Saint Vincent and the Grenadines), Stefano Dejak (EU Delegation) and Domenico Rosa (Commission). The majority of Members insisted on the need to tackle the root causes of migration, but also to create safe and legal migration pathways into the European Union, and implement visa facilitation in order to prevent \u2018death trips\u2019 across the Mediterranean. They also stressed that the long-term impact of migration to Europe could only be positive, in view of the continent\u2019s aging population. Georges-Henri Beauthier responded to questions and wound up the debate. C 170/10 EN Official Journal of the European Union 30.5.2017 ",
        "4. Approval of the minutes of the morning sitting of Tuesday, 20 December 2016. The minutes were approved. 5. Urgent topic No 1: The post-electoral situation in Gabon Speakers: Christine de Peyron (EEAS), Mariya Gabriel, Mmadi Hassani (Comores), Jo Leinen, Rapha\u00ebl Mangouala (Gabon), Mich\u00e8le Rivasi, Louis Aliot, Joachim Zeller and C\u00e9cile Kashetu Kyenge. Members expressed the hope that the acts of violence and human rights violations that took place after the presidential elections of 27 August 2016 would not happen again. To this effect, they urged all political stakeholders in Gabon to participate in an inclusive national dialogue. EP Members in particular criticised the lack of transparency surrounding the elections, notably as regards the centralisation and certification of the results. They condemned the defamation campaign that was orchestrated against the EU Electoral Observation Mission (EOM) and called for the implementation of the recommendations included in the report drafted by the EOM. Members regretted that an agreement could not be found on a compromise text for a motion for a resolution on this issue, despite strenuous efforts made by both sides. 6. Urgent topic No 2: Impact of hurricane Matthew in Haiti Speakers: Domenico Rosa (Commission), Bogdan Brunon Wenta, C\u00e9cile Kashetu Kyenge, Rosa Estaras Ferragut, Agust\u00edn Diaz de Mera, Catherine Bearder, Maria Lidia Senra Rodriguez, Mich\u00e8le Rivasi, Mohamed Youssouf Goumaneh (Djibouti), Charles Allicock (Guyana), Tadeusz Zwiefka and Krzystof Hetman. Haiti was already in a state of severe distress before the hurricane: after the deadly earthquake, which claimed more than 200 000 victims, cholera killed an additional 10 000 people. Hurricane Matthew claimed 546 lives. The Commission immediately allocated a total of EUR 3,5 million for temporary shelters. In addition, 22 projects with a total value of EUR 28 million had been launched so far. A further EUR 30 million would be disbursed over the course of the first few months of 2017. National authorities were at the forefront of implementing these humanitarian projects. Therefore, any NGO disaster response must not be funded outside of the nationally led framework. A need for more effective disaster-prevention systems was identified. The introduction of the \u2018Copernicus\u2019 mapping system was called for. (The sitting adjourned at 12.53 and resumed at 15.08) IN THE CHAIR: Mich\u00e8le RIVASI Acting Co-President 7.

        "I. whereas the lack of technical capacity in developing countries to handle complex matters in the area of taxation is a constraint on both domestic revenue mobilisation and participation in international tax cooperation; J. whereas many ACP States, in line with their economic development and diversification strategies and with a view to legitimately exploiting opportunities from globalisation, have developed or are developing, despite numerous constraints, their financial services sector and are committed to ensuring full compliance with international norms and standards; K. whereas IFF are among a number of global challenges such as the inadequacy of national legal frameworks, the technical and political weakness of national and regional capacities, the weakness of the worldwide architecture for combating IFF, and the opacity of global financial transactions; L. whereas IFF also apply to criminal activities such as human, drugs and arms trafficking, smuggling or financial fraud, as well as unauthorised or unsecured loans, money laundering and manipulation of the stock and bond markets; M. whereas many efforts and initiatives have already been launched at international level, like the OECD Multilateral Convention on Mutual Administrative Assistance in Tax Matters, the OECD Global Forum on Transparency and Exchange of Information for Tax Purposes, the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI), the UN Convention against Corruption, the UN Committee of Experts on International Cooperation in Tax Matters and the African Tax Administration Forum; N. whereas it is welcome that many ACP States are party to these international instruments and are committed to implementing them; O. whereas the explosive increase in the youth population, which will make Africa the most populated region in the world in a few years, could lead to increased unemployment and socio-political instability; 1. Strongly believes that efforts to tackle IFF must primarily be of a political nature, and that the fight against money laundering, tax evasion and avoidance, aggressive tax planning and corruption must remain at the top of the international agenda since they are cause for grave concern in view of the low rates of economic growth in some ACP countries, the high rates of poverty and the growing need for resources in the context of declining public aid; 2. Recalls that measures against IFF require strong international cooperation and the simultaneous involvement of all national and international actors: namely, governments and local authorities, state agencies, the private sector, regional and international organisations and civil society; 3. Recalls the commitment given by the parties to the Busan Partnership Agreement of 2011 to work effectively together in the service of development and to do more to combat corruption and IFF; 4. Acknowledges the many efforts undertaken at international level to combat IFF but notes with concern that the most relevant international conventions and initiatives aimed at fighting corruption and IFF fail to deliver concrete results at their implementation stage; in particular, regrets that those initiatives often lack coordination, especially in the context of asset recovery, and coherence although they have been supported by measures against international terrorism and the subsequent efforts to control its financing; recalls that the prerequisite for defeating terrorist organisations in destabilised countries remains the investigation of their international financial supplies and cutting channels of arms trafficking; 5. Realises that in order to achieve goals, it is necessary to reconcile domestic policies and the global agenda; stresses that policy coherence among both institutions and reforms is needed at domestic and international level; 6. Calls on the Member States and the ACP countries to work under the auspices of the UN to establish a legal obligation covering the whole of the minerals supply chain, thereby taking genuine action to uphold human rights rather than defending the interests of lobbies and big business; 7. Recalls that tax havens, secrecy jurisdictions and IFF erode the tax base, undermine the fairness of the tax system and distort trade and investment; in this context, strongly emphasises that the elimination of all forms of IFF is paramount to achieve the economic and social objectives of the new Agenda 2030 for Sustainable Development; 30.5.2017 EN Official Journal of the European Union C 170/23 ",
        "8. Recalls that domestic resources mobilisation through taxation is the most important source of revenue for financing sustainable development; urges the international community to take all measures necessary to implement effective and transparent tax and trade policies, and to take into account the OECD, G20, G8, G77, African Union, World Bank, IMF and ADB and the critical role of private banks in ensuring financial transparency in ACP countries and around the world; further stresses the need for greater participation of developing countries in global tax governance; 9. Underlines that ACP countries often face major political, legal and administrative constraints in raising tax revenues; believes, therefore, that development assistance should focus on establishing the right regulatory framework and empowering tax administrations, as well as the institutions responsible for combating IFF, by providing technical expertise on resource management, financial intelligence, and anti-corruption regulation, particularly as regards money laundering, organised crime and trafficking, and the return of assets stolen from countries; 10. Stresses the risks faced by African countries in making unbalanced concessions regarding Double Taxation Agreements (DTAs) as well as concession contracts for the extraction of natural resources; deems that the model treaty developed by the United Nations Tax Committee should be supported in order to address abuse in terms of DTAs since it provides for stronger rights to taxation at source than the OECD model; 11. Notes that extractive industries, utilities and infrastructure, health and education are particularly vulnerable to corruption, which is one of the main drivers of IFF; believes that the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI) should be made mandatory; invites ACP States to increase transparency and accountability in resource contracts, companies\u2019 financial reporting and auditing as well as revenue collection and allocation as part of their anti-corruption agenda; 12. Recalls that non-transparent government procurement and supply chains can provide opportunities for corruption- related IFF; accordingly, considers that anti-corruption efforts should also aim at modernising procurement practices; 13. Notes with concern that Development Finance Institutions (DFIs) are still supporting a large amount of investments routed through tax havens, by relying heavily on financial intermediaries; stresses that international and regional development finance institutions and banks have a key role to play in terms of responsible finance and that cooperation should be directed at enhancing good governance and state-building in order to allow an accountable and responsible use of public revenue in ACP countries; in particular, considers that DFIs should only invest in companies and funds that are willing to publicly disclose beneficial ownerships and report back their financial accounts on a country-by-country basis; 14. Calls on the EU to take a more active role in providing financial and technical assistance to developing countries to cope with emerging global standards for fighting tax evasion, including automatic exchange of information; 15. Calls on the EU to make full use of the OECD Model Tax Convention, including an optional provision for assistance in tax collection, which can be included in bilateral conventions where each country agrees to help in the collection of taxes levied by the other country; 16. Insists on the need to combat by means of cooperation and exchanges of information erosion of the tax base and profit shifting to non-cooperative tax jurisdictions and to banks, including banks in developed countries, which apply banking secrecy; calls furthermore on all states and jurisdictions which have not yet done so to adhere to the Common Global Standards for the automatic exchange of information on financial accounts; 17. Calls for information on beneficial ownership of companies to be made publicly available for all corporate structures, including trusts, foundations and shell companies, and reiterates its call for public country-by-country reporting by multinationals to stop base erosion and profit shifting, based on G20 and OECD models; argues that the profits made by multinational companies should be taxed in the country where they were generated; considers likewise that tax incentives should be made public; 18. Recalls that cooperation and exchanges of information between different intelligence services are key and, therefore, calls for regional cooperation to be enhanced in order to jointly draft a model tax information exchange agreement to prevent abuses; C 170/24 EN Official Journal of the European Union 30.5.2017 ",
        "19. Acknowledges the fact that many ACP States, in line with their economic development and diversification strategies and with a view to legitimately exploiting opportunities of globalisation, have developed or are developing, despite numerous constraints, their financial services sector and are committed to ensuring full compliance with international norms and standards; 20. Urges financial centres, including offshore financial centres, with a proven high level of secrecy to cooperate in the global fight against IFF and comply with global agreed transparency standards, and believes that sanctions should be considered in case of non-cooperation, following the exhaustion of all dialogue and consultation with the states and jurisdictions concerned and on the basis of well-defined and internationally acceptable criteria; 21. Invites all ACP States and EU Member States to ensure access to information about the budgets of the state and of local authorities for the public as a way of protecting public funds from being diverted into IFF; 22. Calls on all the ACP countries to establish a peer-review mechanism which covers the fight against illicit financial flows; 23. Recalls that taxation is a reliable source of revenue in developing countries, as efficient and transparent tax regimes provide vital finance that ensures access to basic public services and reduces social inequalities; 24. Instructs its Co-Presidents to forward this resolution to the ACP-EU Council of Ministers, the European Parliament, the European Commission, the European Council, the African Union, the Pan-African Parliament, the regional and national parliaments, the regional organisations relating to ACP countries, and the EIB. 30.5.2017 EN Official Journal of the European Union C 170/25 ",

Calls on governments and donors to suspend or review all policies and projects that directly encourage and facilitate land grabbing or indirectly increase pressure on land and natural resources and can result in serious human rights violations; 2. Recalls that the SDGs include the goal of promoting sustainable agriculture, to be achieved by 2030; 3. Urges the EU Member States to create genuine tools for sustainable development and instruments such as best-practice growing techniques, to support family farming and local economies in sub-Saharan Africa, recalling that family farmers and smallholders produce about 80 % of the world\u2019s food and provide over 60 % of employment in ACP countries; stresses that yields are an essential determinant of income in small-scale agriculture; 4. Calls on the EU, its Member States and the ACP countries to encourage the participation of family farms in programmes supporting innovation and wider application of existing technologies and practices; notes that the development, adaptation and application of new technologies and farm management practices should take into consideration the specific structure of family farming in each country as recommended by the FAO in its report entitled \u2018State of Food and Agriculture \u2014 Innovation in Family Farming\u2019; 5. Stresses that small-scale agriculture accounts for more than 80 % of agricultural production worldwide and plays an important role in food security, poverty alleviation and sustainable management of natural resources; 6. Calls on the ACP countries to do more to encourage young people to support family farming; 7. Notes that an ageing farming population, limited access to social protection, assets, financial services, markets and effective extension services and the weak organisation of farmers are severely constraining the development of small- scale agriculture and limiting opportunities for youth employment in agriculture; 8. Recalls that despite the many constraints it is facing, family farming and small-scale agriculture can still play an important role in food security, economic growth and poverty alleviation and has the potential to create decent jobs for women and men in rural areas; 9. Calls on the EU and its Member States to ensure that EU-based investors respect the rights of local communities and the needs of small farms, through effective implementation of international standards that regulate responsible investment in agriculture, including the AU\u2019s Framework and Guidelines on Land Policy in Africa and its Guiding Principles on Large Scale Land Based Investments in Africa, and abide by the Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights and the OECD\u2019s Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises; C 170/30 EN Official Journal of the European Union 30.5.2017 ",
        "10. Stresses that support is needed not only for small-scale farmers, but also for the rural small and medium-sized enterprises that buy products from small-scale farmers and supply goods to them; 11. Recalls the importance of a healthy and vibrant services sector that connects small-scale farming to wider markets, in order to enable smallholders to upscale their businesses and to develop; 12. Recalls that the 2013 discovery of a large aquifer in Kenya shows that, far from being dry, Africa has abundant water resources; stresses that the problem for farmers is access and that only around 6 % of cultivated land is equipped for irrigation, leaving millions dependent on rain-fed agriculture; 13. Recalls that access to water for farmers in Africa is a major issue and an opportunity for local development, and stresses that another constraint is the lack of detailed hydro-geological mapping for Africa as a whole; 14. Underlines the importance of finding a way to carry out hydro-geological mapping and make the resulting information public or available to smallholders, since this would fundamentally change the agricultural landscape and farming economics; 15. Recalls that when agriculture is able to grow at a local level, farmers are able to earn more capital, which can be reinvested locally, thus enhancing capacity and efficiency and increasing returns; 16. Notes with concern that many land deals breach the principles of free, prior and informed consent (FPCI) of the communities involved; in particular, points out that the decision-making process in the cooperation framework of the New Alliance for Food Security and Nutrition (NAFSN) has not involved all stakeholders, particularly small farmers; 17. Stresses the need to revitalise public investment in ACP agriculture and to prioritise investment in agricultural extension including training, and agro-ecology awareness, in line with the conclusions of the International Assessment of Agricultural Knowledge, Science and Technology for Development (IAASTD), the recommendations of the UN Special Rapporteur on the right to food, and the SDGs; 18. Observes that agricultural investment policies mostly focus on large-scale land acquisitions and on export-oriented agriculture that is unrelated to local economies; calls, therefore, also for the promotion of organic farming in ACP countries; recalls that for a majority of the population of Africa, access to land and tenure security are essential for the enjoyment of the right to food; calls on African countries to recognise all legitimate rights to land, including informal, indigenous and customary tenure rights, to support family and smallholder farming and to combat land grabbing; 19. Stresses that user rights derived from customary tenure, such as those of pastoralists, should be recognised and protected by a legal system, in line with the provisions and rulings of the African Commission on Human and People\u2019s Rights; 20. Recalls that the FAO Tenure Guidelines, including those on pastoralism, recommend secure access to land; calls on the EU to proactively track and monitor land deals involving EU actors; stresses that private companies involved in PPPs, such as the NAFSN, should be accountable for their actions; to this end, calls on parties to the NAFSN to set up a strict accountability and monitoring mechanism, including judicial remedies for local people and communities affected by land deals; 21. Calls for governments and agencies to monitor reliance on wild-caught protein, and to plan for its replacement before the ecosystem is damaged irreversibly; 22. Recalls that farmers\u2019 rights to produce, exchange and sell seeds freely underpins 90 % of agricultural livelihoods in Africa, and is of considerable importance in all ACP countries, and that seed diversity is vital in building resilience of farming to climate change; deplores the corporate requests to strengthen plant breeders\u2019 rights in line with the 1991 International Union for the Protection of New Varieties of Plants Convention, which prohibits the majority of such informal arrangements; 30.5.2017 EN Official Journal of the European Union C 170/31 ",
        "23. Notes that the introduction and spread of certified seeds in Africa, while adding to land productivity and crop yields, may increase the risk of smallholder dependence and indebtedness; 24. Recalls that in Europe, the free movement of goods and services has stimulated food production and strengthened food security; in this respect, stresses the importance of regional free trade agreements and reliable infrastructure that enables small and family farmers to reach beyond their local markets; 25. Urges the Commission to ensure that the commitments made to farmers\u2019 rights by the EU under the International Treaty on Plant Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture are reflected in technical assistance and financial support for seed policy; calls for the EU to support intellectual property rights that enhance the development of locally-adapted seed varieties and farmer-saved seeds; 26. Urges the G8 member states not to support GMO crops in the ACP countries; recalls that the African Model Law on Biosafety sets a high benchmark for biosafety; believes that all assistance from foreign donors in developing biosafety at national and regional levels should be framed accordingly; 27. Calls on the governments of ACP countries to do their utmost to support family farming and smallholders by stressing the need to create policies that foster social justice and develop self-reliant and sustainable farming practices, and to come up with context-specific policies pertinent to each ACP country and to encourage appropriate agricultural research, rural advisory services and training, as well as other relevant technical and financial support; 28. Emphasises the importance of supporting and encouraging the involvement of women farmers in decision-making processes, given that in many ACP countries they bear the main responsibility for looking after their families and at the same time do most of the subsistence farming work; 29. Draws attention to the problems which women farmers face in obtaining capital and gaining access to farmland; notes that easier access to investment capital is the prerequisite for improving the socio-economic situation of women and, in that connection, calls for women\u2019s access to sources of financing and to specific training measures which can facilitate that access to be encouraged, supported and made easier; 30. Notes that social security and legal recognition, in particular as regards title and the right to inherit or bequeath, must be improved for women farmers, so that they are guaranteed the same rights as men; 31. Instructs its Co-Presidents to forward this resolution to the ACP Council of Ministers, the European Parliament, the European Commission, the European Council, the African Union, the Pan-African Parliament, the regional and national parliaments of the ACP countries and the EU Member States, and the regional organisations of ACP countries.

        "DECLARATION ( 1 ) on the parliamentary dimension of the Post-Cotonou ACP-EU relations Declaration of the ACP-EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly on the parliamentary dimension of the Post-Cotonou ACP- EU relations (Adopted at the 32nd session of the ACP-EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly) The ACP-EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly (JPA) calls for the future ACP-EU cooperation post 2020 to build on the acquis and bonds created during over forty years of partnership and to include a strong parliamentary dimension with the Joint Parliamentary Assembly at its centre, whilst adapting to future emerging challenges. The ACP-EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly takes note of the European Commission and EU High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy Joint Communication of 22 November 2016 on \u2018A renewed partnership with the countries of Africa, the Caribbean and the Pacific\u2019 and notably its position that \u2018 it is too early to define the institutional set-up seen at this stage\u2019 . It regrets that the Communication does not attempt to provide any answers at all on the future institutional set-up and that it neither acknowledges nor even mentions the role of the JPA. The ACP-EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly plays an important role, notably in: \u2014 providing for a democratic and comprehensive ACP-EU parliamentary dialogue on issues of high-level importance and mutual concern, \u2014 scrutinising the executive\u2019s work as well as the most effective use of ACP-EU development cooperation spending, \u2014 promoting democracy and human rights, thus making an important contribution to an ACP-EU partnership on an equal footing. The ACP-EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly stresses the importance of building a future ACP-EU partnership on the foundation of the 2030 Sustainable Development Agenda so that it can contribute to addressing the common challenges of tomorrow. In that context, the Assembly calls on the JPA Bureau to develop a more strategic orientation of the Assembly\u2019s work programme and for future JPA Committee reports to make a clear link to the 17 Sustainable Development Goals in order to allow for continuous monitoring of each of these goals. A strengthened JPA in a post-2020 ACP-EU partnership will have to take into account the increased importance of regional integration and regional structures, notably through the organisation of more frequent regional meetings to address specific regional issues and through strengthened dialogue with regional and sub-regional parliaments and structures. The ACP-EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly emphasises that an enhanced parliamentary dimension of ACP-EU cooperation also requires stronger participation and involvement of national parliaments, as well as civil society and other stakeholders, at all relevant stages of ACP-EU policies and activities, from planning and programming to implementation, evaluation and monitoring. The ACP-EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly will examine how to improve JPA scrutiny of development programming and the follow-up to such scrutiny and calls on the Commission and ACP governments to promote the involvement of ACP national parliaments, local authorities and civil society actors in the pre- and post-scrutiny of development programming, and to supply all available information in a timely manner to ACP national parliaments in order to assist them in their exercise of democratic scrutiny.
