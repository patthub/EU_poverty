        "EESC info \u2014 April 2010/4 1 As Europe struggles to pull out of the recession, EESC info met Fran\u00e7oise le Bail, the European Commission\u2019s Deputy Director-General for Enter- prise and Industry, to talk about entrepreneurship in Europe. EESC info : We often hear that Europeans are less inclined to set up businesses than, say, Americans. What do you think discourages or stops people in Europe from becoming start-up entrepreneurs? Fran\u00e7oise le Bail: According to polls, only 45 % of Europeans want Concrete steps wanted to fi ght social erosion after downturn: EESC conference on ways out of crisis It\u2019s about making people realise that entrepreneurship is cool EDITORIAL www.eesc.europa.eu Dear Readers, I am delighted to have been given this opportunity to provide feedback on the conference \u2018EU roadmap for sus- tainable economic and social recov- ery\u2019, which was held at the EESC in the last month. In the company of two Commissioners we had a lively debate on possible ways out of the economic and social crisis. Th e social dimension of the crisis was at the centre of the debate throughout the conference. Our discussions centred on the three main pillars of the roadmap proposal \u2014 support, responsibility and construction. Th e purpose of the conference was not only to hear the views of well-informed experts from various sectors, but also to make practical proposals on how to achieve an environmentally sustainable social market economy, which is one of the goals of the EU 2020 strategy. Although the economic and fi nancial crisis seems to have abated, a full recovery from the severe diffi culties which the crisis has caused for many employers, workers and families in the EU is still some way off . If we want to diminish the impact of the economic and fi nancial crisis on civil soci- ety, it is vital that we continue to support the European public and national governments. It is our common responsibility to develop new, smart pol- icies and instruments which are to be applied in the process of building up an environmentally sustainable social market economy and replenishing government budgets through the transformation of the public fi nances sys- tem. Th is means we must build a smart and more resilient policy framework based on innovation, social capital, low-carbon policies and a modernised fi nancial sector. Th e conference has allowed the Committee to highlight the urgent need for common EU policies that will lead us out of the crisis and create a sus- tainable social market economy. I should emphasise here that it is of utmost importance to enhance the potential of organised civil society and involve citizens at a very early stage in the process to guarantee eff ective implemen- tation of the objectives which have been set out. On behalf of the EESC I would like to thank all the participants who contributed to the EU roadmap conference and who have enriched it with their proposals for an EU economic and social recovery. Mario Sepi EESC President April 2010/4 EN ISSN 1725-1923 to become self-employed, which is substantially less than the level in the USA (55 %). Th e main reason for this is fear of failure. Th is is why the European Commission is imple- menting actions to reduce this fear of failure through the \u2018Small Business Act for Europe\u2019. We are promoting a second-chance policy by encourag- ing Member States to simplify non- fraudulent bankruptcy proceedings or by ensuring that restarters are treated equally with new start-ups, including in support schemes. Another problem is that many Europeans don\u2019t believe in their entrepreneurial abilities or do not know how to use them. Education is linked to this problem: school and university curricula in Europe do not include entrepreneurship or even management building blocks. Even business schools train cor- porate executives rather than entre- preneurs. We are therefore working closely with Member States to intro- duce entrepreneurship as a key skill in school curricula, starting in gen- eral secondary education. In November last year the EESC held a seminar on young European entrepreneurs, at which it launched the idea of a network of young European entrepreneur ambassadors. Do you think that such \u2018soft\u2019 measures can go a long way in instilling a sense of entrepreneurship? You cannot impose entrepreneur- ship by laws. Th erefore, our policies rely a lot on cooperation measures with Member States and various stakeholders. Th is does not mean that these measures are not ambi- tious. Take for instance the \u2018Erasmus for young entrepreneurs\u2019 programme. It off ers the opportunity to nascent entrepreneurs to spend some time with an experienced entrepreneur in another EU Member State. Th e programme aims to increase the chances of success for new enter- prises and create opportunities for the internationalisation of European SMEs. As we speak, some 150 young entrepreneurs are staying in diff er- ent countries and learning with and from a host entrepreneur. Another example: following last year\u2019s success, the EU is organis- ing European SME Week 2010, a One of the most high-profi le events of the last month at EESC was a con- ference to devise a roadmap for a defi nite recovery action in the wake of the most serious economic and social crisis in decades. Entitled \u2018An EU roadmap for a sus- tainable economic and social recov- ery\u2019 and held under EESC auspices on 18 and 19 March, the conference was appropriately timed as it closely followed the publication of Europe 2020 \u2014 A European strategy for smart, green and inclusive growth . Launched on 3 March, the Euro- pean Commission\u2019s plan to boost growth received immediate criticism from the EESC. Th e paper was con- sidered to be lacking in ambitious ideas for the transition from the cur- rent crisis to the new economy and failed to propose better economic and fi scal policy coordination and employment security. \u2018It is an emergency situation now and at times like this, we must come up with concrete solutions,\u2019 EESC President Mario Sepi stressed at the conference. He called for a detailed set of prop- ositions and a real roadmap \u2014 struc- tured in three main steps \u2014 containing precise ways of maintaining necessary support measures while reconciling them with public fi nances and outlin- ing plans on how to relaunch sustain- able growth in Europe. With its fi rst-hand knowledge of the toll the crisis took on civil soci- ety, the EESC urged the inclusion of the social dimension and aspects of the crisis into any roadmap for the next decade. Th e EESC wanted to elevate the concept of secure employment to be among the fl agship initiatives of the programme. Th is is necessary because of the persistent fundamen- tal structural and social problems ravaging the economies and the social tissue of the Member States, stressed EESC speakers. Speaking at the conference, Olli Rehn, Commissioner for Economic and Monetary Aff airs, acknowledged the importance of the EESC in mak- ing citizens aware of the need for inevitable structural changes. >>> page 2 >>> page 2 EE S C in fo European Economic and Social Committee a bridge between Europe and organised civil society Fran\u00e7oise le Bail EDITORIAL Dear Readers, E E S C i n f o i n 2 2 l a n g u a g e s 8 May 2010 Open Day at the EESC 20\u201322 May 2010 Florence, Italy: EESC biennial conference 1 July 2010 Beginning of Belgian Presidency of the EU IN THIS ISSUE Unhealthy inequality \u2014 interview with \u00c1gnes Cser Greener and more competitive transport needed A right is no right without enforcement (and rights awareness) National perspectives on Europe 2020 DIARY DATES 2 4 3 3 Staff an Nilsson and Olli Rehn ",
        "2 EESC info \u2014 April 2010/4 Similarly, a network of young European entrepreneur ambassa- dors could indeed be an excellent initiative: the network could be a key partner for the EU and national institutions on entrepreneurial issues. On an individual level, the young ambassadors could promote entrepreneurship and convey their own success stories to a larger audi- ence. Over the last few years the Commission has launched a number of initiatives to address the dearth of female entrepreneurs, not least the Small Business Act, which has created the European Network of Female Entrepreneurship Ambassadors. What\u2019s the goal of this network? Women are still held back from launching their own companies by a Europe-wide event which will take place from 25 May to 1 June. Th is initiative encourages national and regional actors to organise events promoting what the EU and national, regional and local authorities are off ering as support to SMEs. It also promotes entrepreneurship so that more people, and in particular the younger generation, will seriously consider becoming an entrepre- neur as a career option. We saw over 1 200 events during the 2009 Euro- pean SME Week, organised across the European Union with the help of our national coordinators and our partners in the Enterprise Europe Network. Unhealthy inequality \u00c1gnes Cser for healthy Europeans Continued from page 1 \u2014 It\u2019s about making people realise that entrepreneurship is cool A lawyer and economist by pro- fession, Ms \u00c1gnes Cser has been a member of the EESC since her country, Hungary, joined the Euro- pean Union in 2004. Because of her professional background in health- care and social security, this spring she is chairing the study group that is preparing an opinion on inequal- ities in health. EESC info : What are your most important observations about the Commission communication on inequalities in health? Ms Cser: Th e Commission paper is quite right to highlight this problem. However, we found that although it proposes such things as the cre- ation of a uniform set of indicators to measure the state of health of European citizens, it makes no pro- vision for including health consid- erations in each area of policy, which is an error. People\u2019s health depends on a number of factors, including the economic situation and an indi- vidual\u2019s level of education or culture. Th ese areas, however, are regulated by diff erent parts of the European decision-making machine. Let me give an illustration: babies might not be fed with the most appropriate food because of a lack of money or information on a baby\u2019s needs. Some children lose out even before they are born, as their mothers do not or cannot take care of their own health while they are pregnant. Th e policy areas concerned here range from the economy through employment to education. Why are you talking about inequalities in health? Are the diff erences between Member States really so marked? Th ere are enormous diff erences between the health levels of citizens of the various Member States. Th e fi gures are frightening. For instance, Hun- garian men, on average, die 14 years earlier than Italians. However, exam- ining the data raises another concern that both the Commission and we ourselves feel it is essential to tackle, which is that the indicators used in each Member State should be com- parable and reliable. In several EU countries, for example, the fi gures are deliberately distorted by healthcare institutions to ensure that they receive more government funding. And yet health remains a matter for national governments, and not one to be regulated centrally by the European Union. How do you think the European institutions could still play a role in reducing such gaping inequalities in health? Th e Commission should foster co- operation not only among its Mem- ber States but also with international organisations such as the WHO, so as to encourage the exchange of research fi ndings and best practice. It has to include health as an overarching pol- icy priority in its 10-year growth plan \u2018Europe 2020\u2019. Th e EESC, for its part, can be an invaluable aid for reaching civil society and improving coordin- ation between various non-govern- mental agencies. (eb) \u25cf \u00c1gnes Cser EESC biennial conference to explore education as a means to combat social exclusion More than a quarter of Europeans are aff ected by social exclusion. Its causes are varied and include poverty, disability, membership of an ethnic minority, diffi culties in cultural integration and job inse- curity. Mario Sepi, the President of the European Economic and Social Committee, has decided that, dur- ing the European Year for Com- bating Poverty and Social Exclu- sion, the 2010 biennial conference should address education as a fun- damental tool for combating social exclusion of all kinds. Th e biennial conference will take place from 20 to 22 May in Florence, at the premises of the Isti- tuto degli Innocenti. Th e decision to explore various facets of education is a political choice: social exclu- sion is a phenomenon that society has to deal with through education. Th is choice makes it possible to ask questions about several sectors and range of barriers including education, stereotypes, lack of confi dence and access to start-up fi nance. Accord- ing to recent fi gures from Eurostat, female entrepreneurs constitute only 34.4 % of the self-employed in the EU-25 and only 20 % in industry. Th eir share in start-ups is around 30 %. Th is must change, and we have to encourage more women to lead businesses! In this spirit, we have created the European Network of Female Entrepreneurship Ambassa- dors with the objective of boosting the rate of female entrepreneurial activity across the EU by having successful entrepreneurs campaign- ing on the ground to inspire women of all ages. In the current economic climate it is imperative that Europe does not waste any talent but rather utilises all its sources of economic growth and prosperity for the bene- fi t of its citizens. (mb) \u25cf Continued from page 1 \u2014 Concrete steps wanted to fight social erosion after downturn: EESC conference on ways out of crisis delivering the necessary level of tax revenue, which has become a critical objective aft er the crisis,\u2019 he said. Concluding the debate, President Mario Sepi voiced his concerns of social erosion brought about by the crisis in the entire Union and called for more investment into human capital: \u2018Our main proposal at this conference is to stop the amortisa- tion of social structures in the Mem- ber States and to launch a permanent educational structure for people in order to create human capital that will be able to face the challenges outlined in the Europe 2020 strat- egy.\u2019 (eb) \u25cf \u2018Ultimately the success of Europe 2020 will depend on the credibility of our commitments. Th is will have to be a joint eff ort, at both EU and national levels, and closely involv- ing civil society. Th erefore, this event today with the Economic and Social Committee will be of immense importance.\u2019 Algirdas Semeta, Com- missioner for Taxation and Customs Union, Audit and Anti-Fraud, talked about the strengthening of the single market as a way out of the downturn, and taxation as an important pillar of a well-functioning single market. \u2018Th e ultimate goal is to ensure that taxation systems can profi tably con- tribute to the fostering of employ- ment and long-term growth, while several dimensions of public action where civil society is very active. Th e conference must therefore encourage a dialogue between the institutional, political and civil society players, supplemented by fi rst-hand accounts, in order to generate one or more political mes- sages and specifi c proposals that the EESC will be able to put forward to its fellow institutions. To discuss this broad subject, the EESC as an EU institutional player is position- ing itself as a vector for ideas and good practice. Th e conference will be an opportunity for an exchange between civil society players on the ground and the members of the EESC, and for a discussion with various representatives from the national and European levels. Th e fi nal proposals will be conveyed by the EESC to the EU institutions and will hopefully lead to political action on the issue. On Th ursday 20 May 2010 the conference will open with a plenary session, which will stress the gen- eral, political and scientifi c aspects of the theme of the conference. On Friday, three workshops will be held by EESC members and representa- tives of institutions, civil society, primary and secondary teachers, trainers, social workers, educators, families, employers, trade union- ists, research workers and victims of exclusion. Th e themes of the workshops will be \u2018Education as a gateway to social engagement: the foundations of inclusion\u2019, \u2018Educa- tion as a gateway to the labour market: making inclusion real\u2019 and \u2018Education as an exercise of rights: pro-active inclusion\u2019. Th e purpose of the three workshops is to facilitate meetings that do not frequently occur between \u2018institu- tional\u2019 players and people \u2018on the ground\u2019 where both groups can be mutually enriched by their analyses and experiences. A range of cultural events will take place around the conference. Th ese will include concerts, musical exhibitions and stands set up in the premises where local and national organisations, associations, NGOs and civil society representatives will be able to explain their activ- ities and provide information to both participants and the general public.

        "EESC info \u2014 April 2010/4 3 The market will not save European agriculture Th e EESC is the fi rst institution to put forward a comprehensive vision of the common agricultural policy (CAP) aft er 2013 when the current funding period expires. As divisive as this issue may seem, the EESC opinion was adopted almost unanimously, proving once again that consensus-building is the EESC\u2019s strong point. At a time when a renewed debate on the CAP\u2019s future is about to begin, the EESC insists on focusing fi rst on policy goals before looking at policy tools. Th e question of fi nan- cing should only be addressed as a fi nal step. Th e Committee stresses that the European agricultural model, designed to pro- vide varied and safe bio-food whilst preserving landscape and rural areas, is under threat because it is increasingly subject to market conditions. \u2018Th ere is an ever-growing gulf between the lip-service paid to the European agricultural model and the reality of day-to-day farm life,\u2019 underlines rapporteur Lutz Ribbe (Group III, Various Interests, Germany). Th e Committee notes that, in spite of the fact that market stabilisation is enshrined in the EU Treaty as one of the CAP\u2019s aims, the dramatic drop in the number of stabilisation tools has led to speculation and volatility. Consumers have certainly not benefi ted from this situation and the existing measures have not translated into lower prices. Support measures need to be maintained and beefed up in the light of ongoing devel- opments in agricultural markets, the Committee insists. It calls on the Commission to look into the increasing number of market concentration cases in the retail sector and urges it to use its power to make pricing more transparent. (mb) PLENARY SESSION IN A NUTSHELL Citizen\u2019s initiative takes shape Th e Lisbon Treaty enables a million citizens from a \u2018signifi cant number of Member States\u2019 to make a proposal to the European Commission to put forward a bill. As the Treaty glosses over details, the EESC adopted an opinion that gives a concrete shape to this innovation. \u2018No unnecessary hurdles, but clear, simple rules are needed if the European citizen\u2019s initiative is to become a success\u2019 said Anne-Marie Sigmund (Group III, Various Interests, Austria), rapporteur of the opinion. Th e Committee regards this initia- tive as a formidable tool to encourage people to get involved in European debate, provided it is not lumbered with unneces- sary bureaucracy or excessive requirements. It recommends low thresholds that would make it easier for initiatives to gather the support of 1 million citizens. Th e number of Member States required should be set at a quarter and be combined with a low number of signatures per Mem- ber State, says the Committee. Th e EESC opposes the Euro- pean Parliament\u2019s view that the initiative should be monitored by the Parliament as it would violate the principle of separ- ation of powers. Th e Committee calls for an independent \u2018advis- ory body\u2019 to support those eager to prepare and launch the citizens\u2019 initiative. (mb) Greener and more competitive transport needed European transport policy needs to sustain the sector\u2019s competitiveness and curb greenhouse gas emissions by taking steps that would impact rapidly, directly and tangibly on costs. Th is is the message of the opinion on Euro- pean transport policy in the framework of the Europe 2020 and the sustainable development strat- egies, drawn up Mr St\u00e9phane Buff etaut (Group I, Employers, France) and adopted by the EESC plenary on 17 March 2010. European economic prosperity relies on competitive, reliable, free-fl owing and profi table transport. \u2018However, the entire transport sector has been hard hit by the current economic crisis and realises that it lacks sustainability,\u2019 he said. A future European transport policy should pursue four aims: the promotion of low-carbon transport modes, energy effi ciency, security and independence of supply, and traffi c decongestion. \u2018Local and regional authorities alike need to implement concrete measures. EU action could involve pass- ing legislation, setting new TEN-T guidelines and intervening through the European Investment Bank,\u2019 stressed the rappor- teur. (ds) A right is no right without enforcement (and rights awareness) For more information please consult http://www.eesc.europa.eu/documents/opinions/avis_en.asp?type=en EESC President Mario Sepi meets European Council President Herman Van Rompuy MEMBERS\u2019 NEWS At an informal meeting held in the offi ce of Herman Van Rompuy on 10 March, President Mario Sepi outlined the main parts of the EESC programme to be implemented in the coming months. Par- ticipatory democracy issues were discussed, as was the new role of the EESC in the European institutional framework arising from the entry into force of the Lisbon Treaty. Other subjects addressed included the conference on the EU roadmap for sustainable eco- nomic and social recovery, the progress of preparations for the biennial conference on using education to combat social exclusion, to be held in May in Florence, and President Van Rompuy\u2019s inten- tion to take part in an upcoming EESC plenary session. Read more on that topic at: http://www.eesc.europa.eu/ organisation/president/sepi/blog/index.asp \u25cf Th e rights we enjoy, no matter how good they are, only make sense if properly enforced and duly respected. With this in mind and in a bid to broach the issue of enforcing the rights of consumers, thus ena- bling Europeans to fully profi t from the single market, the EESC organ- ised the 12th European Consumer Day in Madrid on 15 March. As things stand now, the applica- tion of consumers\u2019 rights across the continent leaves a lot to be desired. All too many EU bills are poorly draft ed and consequently diffi cult to enforce. Th e Committee reiterated in Madrid what it had pointed out to the Com- mission earlier on, that \u2018a good law is an enforceable and enforced law\u2019. To make things worse, badly draft ed laws are carelessly or not fully inte- grated into national law, particularly when they seem to run contrary to national customs, and administra- tive cooperation between Member States \u2014 which ought, incidentally, to involve civil society \u2014 is not up to the challenge. Whilst reminding Europeans that their countries are responsible for enforcing European law on their ter- ritories, panellists underlined that educating and informing consum- ers about their rights could go a long way towards ensuring respect for consumer legislation. \u2018Soft measures such as awareness-raising initiatives and information campaigns can pro- duce miracles\u2019, said Jorge Pegado Liz (Group III, Various Interests, Spain), rapporteur for the EESC opinion on enforcement of the consumer rights. Th e Madrid event also addressed the issue of harmonisation of con- sumers\u2019 rights, an idea that the Euro- pean Commission skimmed over in its draft directive in 2008, and is now being debated in the European Parliament and the Council. \u2018Th e fact that we have 27 diff erent legislations means that consumers cannot take full advantage of the single market; whereas the very purpose of the sin- gle market is to serve the interests of consumers,\u2019 said John Dalli, European Commissioner for Health and Con- sumer Policy. As some Member States worry that harmonisation across the board could pull down standards in areas where they are at their most strin- gent and businesses are wary of over- protection, the solution lies yet again in compromise. In a bid to square the circle, Bernardo Hern\u00e1ndez Bataller (Group III, Various Interests, Spain), rapporteur for the opinion on this issue adopted in July last year, stressed that harmonisation \u2018should be limited to areas most aff ected by cross-border trade, namely distance and off -premises sales\u2019. His view was echoed by Viviane Reding, Vice-President of the Euro- pean Commission and Commis- sioner for Justice, Fundamental Rights and Citizenship, who underlined that this solution could overcome people\u2019s reluctance to engage in cross-border e-commerce, which is currently hin- dered by diff erences in national le- gislations. However, diverging national laws could still apply to face- to-face contracts, she said. Anna Maria Darmanin, EESC member, insisted that \u2018some other aspects, such as defi nitions or the rights of online consumers should also be fully harmonised\u2019. Putting the conference in a wider context, EESC President Mario Sepi indicated that \u2018Consumer rights must be debated alongside the need to change our consumption model\u2019, which, in his words, \u2018is not only partly responsible for our current predica- ment, but has also widened the gap between the North and the South, as well as being extremely harmful to the environment\u2019.

Th e participants said that more must be done to support new green jobs in the EU and to \u2018green\u2019 those which already exist. Although the scale of the mid-term potential for green jobs cannot be precisely estimated at present, every eff ort, particularly with regard to education and training at local level, should be made to promote the attractiveness of jobs in the renewable energy and energy effi ciency fi elds. Concerns were voiced, however: new jobs should be of high quality and off er long-term prospects to employees. In addition, transition programmes should be planned to help employees in changing from so-called \u2018black\u2019 jobs (as in coal mines) to new \u2018green\u2019 ones. Th e EU therefore should assume leadership in this area in order to maintain its competitiveness and its long-term employment prospects. All the conclusions will be con- sidered by Edgardo Iozia (Group II, Employees, Italy), the topic\u2019s rapporteur and the initiator of this hearing. (ak) \u25cf Hearing on creativity Responding to the changing economic environment, the hearing in Valencia, Spain, on 19 April aimed to examine the increasing importance of creative and cul- tural industries and what their change entails for the growth of the European economy. \u2018Th ese industries have become essen- tial assets for Europe\u2019s future as the share of manufacturing industries diminishes,\u2019 remarked Claudio Cappellini (Group III, Various Interests, Italy), rapporteur of a study group working on a set of rec- ommendations to be put forward to the policymaking institutions in September. Film-makers, fashion designers and university lec- turers took the fl oor to depict the situation of this knowledge-based sector and to make proposals for promoting it against the institutional background presented by representatives of the European Com- mission. (eb) \u25cf EU\u2013Morocco summit Th e EU and Morocco held their fi rst ever summit in Granada, Spain, on 7 March, where the EESC presented its opinion on EU\u2013Morocco relations. Th e opinion looks into the relationship between the Union and Morocco, a country developing an \u2018advanced status\u2019 partnership with the EU. Th e EESC document underlines the necessity to include civil society in forging the bilateral links. It is for this reason that the EESC urges the Heads of State or Government to approve cooperation between EESC and the future Moroccan ESC. Th e two bod- ies would work to ensure the active participation of organised civil society in EU\u2013Moroccan aff airs. Th e Heads of State or Government took up this recommendation, stating that: \u2018Th e Parties also call upon the European Economic and Social Com- mittee and the Moroccan Economic and Social Council to initiate fruitful cooperation.\u2019 (lw) \u25cf Irish exhibition opened on St Patrick\u2019s Day in the EESC On 17 March, St Patrick\u2019s Day, the EESC hosted an Irish evening off ering a variety of culinary and cultural high- lights. It was an all-Ireland event: the EESC members from Northern Ireland (UK) and the Irish Republic joined together to organise the evening of fun. Part of the cultural programme was the opening of an exhibition titled \u2018Diversity in Unity\u2019, which introduced four female painters with one thing in common: all of them are Irish but based in Belgium, where they live and paint. Open between 17 and 23 March, \u2018Diversity in Unity\u2019 welcomed visitors to see Ireland as it is perceived from abroad. Th e painters\u2019 concepts and visual manifestations were refl ected in a wide spectrum of colours and diff er- ent styles, including both expressionist and abstract, rep- resenting the Irish landscape as well as still life. (sb) \u25cf Student plenary session in the Committee Defying Iceland\u2019s volcanic ash enveloping Europe and the resulting fl ight cancellations and delays, 19 out of 27 stu- dent delegations arrived in Brussels to take part in a day- long mock plenary session of the European Economic and Social Committee. Th eir aim was to discover what it is like to do the job of an EESC Member and to debate and agree on the fi nal wording of an opinion on alcohol- related harm. To prepare the students for the day of action, EESC members visited schools in all Member States in order to discuss European topics with students and answer their questions about the EU, with particular reference to top- ics which interest young people. Schools also received a draft opinion to which they were allowed to table up to three amendments. Th e proposals were then discussed at the plenary session. Th e enthusiastic and spirited negotiations on every detail of the opinion made for an exciting and unusual day for the students in Brussels. (mb) \u25cf Soon in the EESC Polar bears at the EESC!
