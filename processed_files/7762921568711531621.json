        "23.2.2010 EN Official Journ al of the E uropean Un ion C 45 E /3 Tuesday 16 December 2008 G. whereas tourism, while typically the main activity in these regions, positively contributing to social and economic development in terms of increasing GDP and employment levels, can also have adverse terri\u00ad torial effects arising from the seasonal nature of activity, employment of unskilled labour, lack of integra\u00ad tion between coast and hinterland, lack of economic diversification, or the degradation of the natural and cultural heritage, H. whereas there is practically no specific reference to the coastal zones in the various operational pro\u00ad grammes for 2007-2013, and as a result there is a lack of comparable and reliable socio-economic and financial data for coastal tourism, I. whereas, in the absence of reliable comparative data on coastal tourism, it is possible that this sector\u2019s eco\u00ad nomic strength is being underestimated, leading to undervaluation of the economic value of preserving the marine environment and overvaluation of the role of investment in achieving that goal, J. whereas, because of a lack of information on the EU funds invested in the coastal zones it is difficult to make a quantitative assessment of the real impact of the Structural Funds on coastal tourism, K. whereas tourism is located at the intersection of various EU policies which substantially affect its capacity to contribute to social and territorial cohesion, L. whereas, from a qualitative point of view, the Structural Funds can have a positive impact on the devel\u00ad opment of coastal regions, revitalising the local economies, stimulating private investment and promot\u00ad ing sustainable tourism, M. whereas there is a more visible impact in locations such as small islands in the outermost regions or coastal zones where coastal tourism is the main economic activity, N. whereas coastal areas are strongly influenced by their geographical location, and require a structured strat\u00ad egy taking account of their specific characteristics and of the principle of subsidiarity and the need for a decision-making process that applies consistency between sectors, O. whereas, in addition, coastal regions are often also outlying regions such as small islands, outermost regions or tourism-dependent coastal areas whose accessibility is limited outside the high season, where territorial cohesion requires the creation of better infrastructures and more regular transport links between coast and interior, as well as the encouragement, via investment-generating strategies for territorial mar\u00ad keting and integrated economic development, of continued economic activity outside the tourist season, P. whereas the coastal zones, despite having similar problems, do not possess specific instruments which would en able a structured approach an d b etter commun ication amon g the main actors, who frequen tly work independently and in isolation from each other, Q. whereas integrated solutions to real problems can be found and implemented at local and regional level by the public authorities working in cooperation with the private sector and keeping in view both envi\u00ad ronmental an d commun ity in terests, ",
        "C 45 E/4 EN Official Journ al of the E uropean Un ion 23.2.2010 Tuesday 16 December 2008 R. whereas the creation of policy instruments will help contribute to more integrated and sustainable devel\u00ad opment strategies, improving economic competitiveness by preserving natural and cultural resources, meeting social needs and promoting models of ethical tourism, S. whereas this could help create better jobs in the coastal zones, reducing the seasonal element and com\u00ad bining different forms of tourism and other maritime or coastal activities, thus adjusting the supply to the demanding expectations and requirements of modern-day tourists and permitting the generation of skilled employment, T. whereas the European territorial cooperation objective laid down in Article 6 of the Regulation (EC) No 1080/2006 can make an effective contribution to the above priorities, via the funding of cooperation projects and the development of partnership networks between sectoral players and the coastal areas, stressing in this context the importance of utilising the European grouping of territorial cooperation pro\u00ad vided for in Regulation (EC) No 1082/2006 as an instrument for creating ongoing cooperation in the field of the sustainable development of coastal regions, with the participation of local and social partners; 1. Stresses that tourism is a key factor for the social and economic development of the EU\u2019s coastal regions and is closely linked to the objectives of the Lisbon strategy; also emphasises that the objectives of the Goth\u00ad enburg Strategy should be more rigourously taken into account for coastal tourism activities; 2. Encourages coastal Member States to design specific strategies and integrated plans at national and regional level in order to counteract the seasonal nature of tourism in costal regions and ensure more stable employ\u00ad ment and a better quality of life for local communities; emphasises, in this context, the importance of extend\u00ad ing the traditional seasonal business to a year-round activity through product diversification and alternative forms of tourism (e.g. business, cultural, medical, sport, agricultural and sea-related tourism); notes that diver\u00ad sification of products and services will help create growth and employment and reduce environmental, eco\u00ad nomic and social effects; 3. Stresses the need to safeguard workers\u2019 rights in the sector, promoting quality jobs and the acquisition of skills, this entailing, inter alia, suitable training, more extensive use of long-term contracts, equitable and decent wages and better working conditions; 4. Calls for an integrated approach to coastal tourism in the context of the EU\u2019s cohesion, maritime, fisher\u00ad ies, environmental, transport, energy, social and health policies, in order to create synergies and avoid incon\u00ad sistent actions; recommends that the Commission takes into account such an integrated approach to the sustainable growth of coastal tourism, especially in connection with the EU\u2019s maritime policy, as a strategic objective of its work programme for 2010-2015, and also in the context of the mid-term review of the finan\u00ad cial framework for 2007-2013; 5. Calls on the Member States to ensure the full participation of the regional and local authorities respon\u00ad sible for tourism and regional development in coastal zones as well as of economic, social and environmental partners in all permanent structures set up under these policies, and in the cross-border cooperation pro\u00ad grammes involving coastal regions; 6. Highlights the fundamental link between a well-functioning infrastructure and a successful tourist region, and thus calls on the competent authorities to draw up plans for optimising local infrastructure, for the ben\u00ad efit of both tourists and local residents; in this light, strongly recommends that coastal Member States take all measures necessary to ensure that new projects improving infrastructure, including oil plants and other facili\u00ad ties, are always built using the latest available technologies, in order to ensure the reduction of energy use and carb on emissions and improve energy efficiency through the use of renewable energy sources; ",
        "23.2.2010 EN Official Journ al of the E uropean Un ion C 45 E /5 Tuesday 16 December 2008 7. Urges the Commission, the Member States and the regions to promote sustainable mobility chains involv\u00ad ing local public transport, cycle tracks and footpaths, in particular along cross-border stretches of coastline, and to support the exchange of good practices; 8. Recommends that the Commission adopt a holistic approach to coastal tourism in the context of both territorial cohesion and its strategy for an integrated maritime policy, in particular for the islands, the island Member States, the outermost regions and the other coastal zones, notably in view of the high dependence of these areas on tourism; 9. Strongly encourages the Commission and the Member States to include coastal tourism in the list of pri\u00ad orities within the strategic guidelines for the next programming period of the Structural Funds as well as among the policies of the EU\u2019s coastal regions and to define an innovative strategy able to integrate the coastal tour\u00ad ism offer; 10. Welcomes therefore the participation of coastal regions in Interreg IV B and C programmes and projects covering both transnational and interregional cooperation in the field of tourism and invites them to make effective use of EU initiatives and instruments for coastal regions (such as the Mediterranean and Baltic Sea Strategies and the Black Sea Synergy); strongly recommends that the Commission place greater emphasis on coastal regions in the new Interreg programmes for the next programming period; 11. Takes note of the Committee of the Regions\u2019 view concerning the creation of a European coastal fund, and calls on the Commission, in the context of the next financial framework, to examine ways of better coor\u00ad dinating all future financial instruments that cover action in coastal regions; 12. Recommends building up a knowledge pillar as part of the integrated development of the coastal zones, by creating a European sectoral network under the umbrella of the European Institute of Innovation and Tech\u00ad nology provided for in Regulation (EC) No 294/2008 and the Seventh Framework Programme provided for in Decision No 1982/2006/EC; 13. Recommends that the coastal Member States apply the integrated approach at programme level when selecting and executing projects related to the coasts, adopting an intersectoral method and prioritising the cre\u00ad ation of public-private partnerships, in order to reduce pressure on the local authorities concerned; 14. Welcomes the priorities identified by the Commission for coastal and maritime tourism in the above\u00ad mentioned Agenda for a Sustainable and Competitive European Tourism; suggests that the recently-created European Tourist Destinations Portal could include specific information on coastal destinations and networks, especially those which are less well-known and less publicised, with a view to their promotion beyond the EU\u2019s borders, including at regional and local level; 15. Calls on the Commission, in this connection, to recognise coastal and water tourism as an area of excel\u00ad lence for 2010 in the context of its pilot project European Destinations of Excellence; 16. Laments the fact that the current lack of transparency as regards EU expenditure in the coastal zones makes it impossible to quantify the level of investment or to analyse the impact of the supported initiatives in those regions; in this context welcomes the abovementioned Green Paper on future maritime policy\u2019s provi\u00ad sion to create a database for maritime regions that will include information on the beneficiaries of all Com\u00ad munity funds (including the Structural Funds) and calls on the Commission to accomplish this important task without delay; stresses the importance of such an initiative for ensuring transparency in this field; calls on the Commission to activate suitable instruments for making these data available for analytic and statistical pur\u00ad poses and calls on the Member States to fulfil their obligations concerning the publication of the final benefi\u00ad ciaries, thus providing a comprehensive picture of existing projects; ",
        "C 45 E/6 EN Official Journ al of the E uropean Un ion 23.2.2010 Tuesday 16 December 2008 17. Calls on the Commission, the Member States and the regions to draw up jointly an exhaustive catalogue, to be made available on the Internet, of projects funded in the coastal zones, thus enabling the regions to learn from others\u2019 experience and permitting academia, the coastal communities and other interested parties to iden\u00ad tify, publicise and maximise the transfer of best practices to the local communities; in this light recommends the setting up of a forum where interested parties can contact each other and share good practices and of a working group of representatives of Members States to develop action plans on coastal tourism and foster the exchange of experiences at institutional level; 18. Invites the Commission also to use this Internet catalogue to make the public aware of the benefits brought by the EU to the coastal regions, thus contributing to a more positive view of EU funding and enhanc\u00ad ing the EU\u2019s image; 19. Calls on the Commission to ensure that the ongoing compilation by Eurostat of a socio-economic data\u00ad base for the EU\u2019s coastal regions includes data on tourism that is reliable, uniform and up-to-date, since this is essential in order to facilitate decision-making in the public sector and enable comparison between regions and sectors; recommends that the coastal Member States, as a matter of urgency, act to implement the Tourism Satellite Account in their territory; 20. Stresses that there is a close link between the environment and coastal tourism; and that policies to develop tourism should include practical measures in line with a general policy of environmental protection and management; welcomes, therefore, the fact that sustainable development is enshrined in Article 17 of Regulation (EC) No 1083/2006 (on Structural Funds 2007-2013) as one of the key principles applying to the implementation of all structural interventions whose application has to be duly verified through appropriate monitoring activities; strongly recommends that a similar provision be introduced in the Regulations for the next programming period; emphasises the important contribution this would make to fostering eco-tourism; 21. Points out that coastal regions are particularly affected by the impact of climate change and the atten\u00ad dant rise in sea level and sand erosion, plus the increasing incidence and strength of storms; insists therefore that coastal regions devise climate change risk and prevention plans; 22. Points to the impact of climate change on coastal tourism; therefore calls on the Commission on the one hand consistently to integrate the EU targets for reducing CO 2 emissions into transport and tourism policy and, on the other hand, to promote measures to protect sustainable coastal tourism from the impact of cli\u00ad mate change; 23. Emphasises, in this context, the importance of assessing the potential of tourism to contribute to envi\u00ad ronmental protection and conservation; notes that tourism might offer an easy way to raise awareness of envi\u00ad ronmental values through the concerted action of national and regional authorities on the one hand and tourism operators and hotels and restaurants managers on the other; considers therefore, that costal regions should be targeted by such efforts, due to their pre-eminently touristic profile; 24. Stresses the need, in developing tourism, of always ensuring the protection of historical features and archaeological treasures and the preservation of traditions and of cultural heritage in general, fostering the active involvement of local communities; 25. Calls for incentives to be provided for sustainable development, so as to safeguard the cultural and natu\u00ad ral heritage and the social fabric in coastal regions; 26. Calls on the Commission to ensure that active execution in line with the Marine Strategy Framework Directive is a condition for receivin g E U fun ding for coastal projects havin g an impact on the sea; ",
        "23.2.2010 EN Official Journ al of the E uropean Un ion C 45 E /7 Tuesday 16 December 2008 27. Calls on the Commission to use all suitable evaluation instruments to ensure the implementation of this principle in the coastal zones during the present programming period, as well as the sharing of responsibilities between the different decision-making levels; 28. Emphasises that pressure on coastal zones due to excessive physical infrastructure interventions is to the detriment of coastal tourism development and attractiveness, whereas those aspects could be fostered through high quality tourism services, essential for coastal regional competitiveness and the promotion of quality jobs and qualifications; invites, therefore, coastal regions instead to encourage alternative investments such as investments in ITC-based services, new potentials of local traditional products and high-quality training for workers of the tourism sector; calls, also, for the design of training programmes to create a pool of skilled workers, to deal with the increased complexity and variety of the tourism sector; 29. Calls on the Member States to devise appropriate urban development and planning policies that are com\u00ad patible with the coastal landscape; 30. Stresses that hig h quality represen ts the b asic comparative advan tag e of the E U tourism product; calls on the Member States and the regional and local authorities to highlight and strengthen the quality of tourism services in terms of the provision of security, ample and modern infrastructure, the corporate social respon\u00ad sibility of the enterprises involved, and environmentally friendly economic activities; 31. Calls on the Commission to ensure that its policy for maritime clusters includes productive services and sectors of relevance to coastal tourism, thus enabling fruitful interaction among those who use the sea as a resource to increase their competitiveness, sustainability and contribution to coastal economic development; considers, furthermore, that medical, welfare, educational, technological and sporting facilities should be included as coastal services under the maritime clusters, as key elements for the development of the coastal zones; 32. Highlights the importance of accessibility for the development of coastal regions; calls, therefore, on the Commission and national and regional coastal authorities to develop ways to ensure optimal connectivity via land, air and waterway transportation; reiterates its call on the same actors, in view of the high incidence of marine pollution in numerous regions and port cities, to boost incentives for the supply of vessels in port from the land network; invites Member States to analyse the possibility of adopting measures such as reducing air\u00ad port charges, always in accordance with the procedure laid down in its abovementioned position of 23 Octo\u00ad ber 2008, in order to increase the attractiveness of and foster the competitiveness of coastal areas; for the same purpose, stresses the necessity of enhancing the respect of airport and aviation safety standards, including removal of fuel depots near airports, where necessary; 33. Calls on the Member States and regional authorities to promote the upgrading of ports and airports in coastal and island regions in order to meet the needs of tourism, taking due account of the existing environ\u00ad mental possibilities and respect for aesthetic considerations and the natural surroundings; 34. Stresses that territorial cohesion is a horizontal concept covering the EU as a whole, which can enhance the links between coast and hinterland by virtue of the existing complementarities of and mutual influence between coastal and inner areas (e.g. connection of coastal activities to rural and urban tourism, improvement of out-of-season accessibility for tourism, increasing the profile of local products while encouraging their diver\u00ad sification); notes that the abovementioned Green Paper on future maritime policy makes special reference to island regions, acknowledging that they face particular developmental challenges due to their permanent natu\u00ad ral handicaps; emphasises that similar problems are faced by coastal regions in general and calls on the Com\u00ad mission to take account of the need to link coastal tourism to the integrated management of coastal zones and spatial plan ning for the seas in the future implemen tation of territorial cohesion ; ",

Urges the coastal regional and local authorities, similarly, to encourage integrated territorial marketing schemes alongside their partners in the context of sea-and-land based neighbourhood relations and to pro\u00ad mote equity in tourism development and travel with a view to boosting competitiveness in the tourist sector without prejudice to overall competitiveness; 36. Encourages the coastal regions to take part in projects for interregional cooperation, e.g. under Theme IV of the initiative Regions for Economic Change, with the objective of creating new thematic coastal tourism networks and building on those already in place, as well as ensuring the exchange of know-how and best practice; 37. Recommends that the public authorities concerned at national, regional and local level act to promote strategic projects for coastal tourism under their cooperation programmes, providing technical assistance for the preparation of projects, making available suitable levels of funding for such actions and prioritising the use of Structural Funds for developing sustainable, environmentally-friendly tourism in coastal regions, for both Convergence and Competitiveness and Employment areas; in this connection, believes that special attention should be paid to operations aimed at developing communications and IT; 38. Calls on the Commission to organise at least one special event within the next year, preferably on 20 May, European Maritime Day, focusing on coastal tourism, with a view to facilitating communication and fostering contacts between partners and sharing best practice, e.g. in the implementation of the EU\u2019s integrated quality management model; in this context encourages all actors to present their Community-funded projects directly or indirectly relating to coastal tourism; 39. Considers that fostering nautical tourism, also through the promotion of sector-related economical activi\u00ad ties can help citizens of the Union to develop more sustainable habits and higher ecological awareness; invites, therefore, Member States to encourage investments for this purpose in their coastal areas; 40. Calls on the Commission, in addition, to draw up a practical guide to EU financing in the area of coastal tourism, so as to orient interested parties in the phase of seeking funds; 41. Recognises the major potential contribution of increased cruise tourism to the development of coastal communities, provided a balance is struck between risks and responsibilities and between fixed costs for on-shore investments and flexibility for cruise operators, with environmental concerns being correctly met at the same time; 42. Calls on the Commission to support coastal communities in acquiring best practices and in learning to maximise the return to the local communities of the value added generated by cruise tourism in particular and coastal tourism in general; 43. Calls on the coastal regions to set up and support regional or local development agencies, which would help network professionals, institutions, experts and administrations within the same area and between Mem\u00ad b er States an d would offer con sultation an d in formation to poten tial b ene ficiaries from b oth pub lic an d pri\u00ad vate sectors; 44.

Welcomes the abovementioned Commission Communication on media literacy in the digital environ\u00ad ment, but believes that there is room for improvement to the extent that the European approach intended to foster media literacy needs to be more clear cut, especially as regards the inclusion of traditional media and recognition of the importance of media education; 2. Welcomes the Council conclusions of 22 May 2008 on intercultural competences; looks to the Member States to do their utmost to promote media literacy and proposes that the Member States\u2019 contact committee, as provided for in Directive 89/552/EEC, be strengthened through the recruitment of education experts; 3. Urges the Commission to adopt a recommendation, and develop an action plan, on media literacy; urges the Commission to organise a meeting of the contact committee on Audio-Visual Media Services in 2009 with a view to facilitating information exchanges and effective cooperation on a regular basis; 4. Requests the authorities responsible for regulating audiovisual and electronic communications to coop\u00ad erate at the various levels for the improvement of media literacy; recognises the special need to develop at national level both codes of conduct and common regulatory initiatives; highlights the need for all stakehold\u00ad ers to be involved in promoting the systematic study and regular analysis of the various facets and dimensions of media literacy; 5. Recommends that the Commission also use the Media Literacy Expert Group to discuss media education matters and that the Group meet more regularly and consult, on a regular basis, the representatives of all Mem\u00ad ber States; 6. Notes that, in addition to policy-makers, journalists, radio and television broadcasters and media compa\u00ad nies, it is mainly small local entities such as libraries, adult education centres, citizens\u2019 cultural and media cen\u00ad tres, further education and training establishments and citizens\u2019 media (e.g. community media) that can make an active contribution to promoting media literacy; 7. Calls on the Commission, having regard to Article 26 of Directive 89/552/EEC, to devise media literacy indicators with a view to fostering media literacy in the EU in the long term; 8. Notes that media literacy denotes the ability to use individual media unaided, to understand, and bring critical assessment to bear on, the various aspects of media as such and media content, and to communicate \u2014 irrespective of the context \u2014 and create and disseminate media content; notes in addition that, given the many sources available, what is most important is the ability to separate out information from the new media\u2019s flood of data and images and to categorise that information; 9. Stresses that media literacy is a basic element in consumer information policy, awareness of and famil\u00ad iarity with matters relatin g to in tellectual rig hts, the mob ilisation and democratic participation of citizen s an d the promotion of intercultural dialogue; 10.

Maintains that media education activities have to encompass all citizens \u2014 children, young people, adults, older people, and people with disabilities; 12. Points out that acquiring media literacy begins in the home with learning how to select from the media services available \u2014 stressing in this regard the importance of media education for parents, who play a deci\u00ad sive role in the development of children\u2019s media-use habits \u2014 and continues at school and during lifelong learning, and is strengthened by the efforts of national, governmental and regulatory authorities and the work of media professionals and institutions; 13. Notes that the purpose of media literacy is to enable people to use media and their content in skilled and creative ways, critically analyse media products, understand how the media industry works, and produce media content by their own efforts; 14. Recommends that media education should shed light on copyright aspects of media use and on the importance of respecting intellectual property rights, in particular regarding the Internet, as well as on data and privacy security and the right of informational self-determination; stresses the need for new media-literate users to be aware of the poten tial risk s con cerning I T security an d the security of person al data, an d of the risks relating to cyber-violence; 15. Points out that advertising is an important part of the services provided by the media today; stresses that media literacy helps to provide criteria for assessing the tools and practices used in advertising; Giving access to information and communication technologies 16. Calls on European policy-makers to narrow the digital divide between Member States and between town and country by developing the information and communication infrastructure and, above all, setting up broad\u00ad band in areas not fully equipped; 17. Notes that providing access to broadband Internet is also important for services of general interest and should be characterised by variety, a high level of quality, and affordability, and maintains that every citizen should have the possibility of using an inexpensive broadband connection; Media education in schools and as a component of teacher training 18. Maintains that media education should be an element of formal education to which all children should have access and which should form part and parcel of the curriculum at every stage of schooling; 19. Calls for media literacy to be made the ninth key competence in the European reference framework for lifelong learning set out in Recommendation 2006/962/EC; 20. Recommends that media education should, as far as possible, be geared to practical work and linked to economic, political, literary, social, artistic, and IT-related subjects, and suggests that the way forward lies in the creation of a specific subject \u2014 \u2018Media Education\u2019 \u2014 and in an interdisciplinary approach combined with out-of-school projects; 21. Recommends that educational establishments encourage the development of media products (printed page, audio/video new media) in a manner involving both pupils and teachers, as a way of providing practical training in media literacy; ",

Calls on the Commission, when, as announced, it lays down the media literacy indicators, to take into account both the quality of school tuition and teacher training in this field; 23. Notes that, in addition to educational and education-policy considerations, technical equipment and access to new technologies are also of vital importance, and maintains that school facilities need to be sub\u00ad stantially improved so as to enable all schoolchildren to have access to computers, the Internet, and the nec\u00ad essary instruction; 24. Maintains that media education is a matter of particular importance in special schools, given that, when people have disabilities, the media can often do a great deal to overcome obstacles to communication; 25. Recommends that compulsory media education modules be incorporated into teacher training for all school levels, so as to enable the subject to be taught intensively; calls on the relevant national authorities to familiarise teachers of all subjects and at every type of school with the use of audiovisual teaching aids and with the problems associated with media education; 26. Emphasises the need for regular exchange of information, good practices and, in the field of education, pedagogical methods b etween Memb er States; 27. Calls on the Commission to devote a specific section of the successor to the MEDIA 2007 programme to promoting media literacy, as the current programme contributes little to the promotion of media literacy; supports the Commission\u2019s proposal to develop a new programme called \u2018Media Mundus\u2019 to support interna\u00ad tional cooperation in the audiovisual sector; calls for media literacy to feature more prominently in other EU support programmes, especially Lifelong Learning, eTwinning, Safer Internet and the European Social Fund; Media education for older people 28. Maintains that media work with older people has to be done at the places where they are to be found, such as societies, old people\u2019s and nursing homes, assisted living facilities, recreational and enthusiasts\u2019 clubs, action committees, or senior citizens\u2019 groups; 29. Notes that digital networks enable older people in particular to share in everyday life by communicating and to remain independent for as long as possible; 30. Points out that the different kinds of environment in which older people live and their varied spheres of experience, as well as the way they use the media themselves, must be taken into account in media education aimed at them; * * * 31.

        "C 45 E /18 EN Official Journ al of the E uropean Un ion 23.2.2010 Tuesday 16 December 2008 B. whereas these complaints reflect a widespread and concerted pattern of misleading business practices on the part of certain business-directory companies affecting thousands of businesses that are organised across frontiers and thus involve activity in two or more Member States within the European Union and beyond, with a significant financial impact on such businesses, and whereas there is no administrative mechanism or legal instrument enabling the national law-enforcement agencies to work together across borders efficiently and effectively, C. whereas the misleading character of these practices becomes more obvious when they are of an electronic nature and are spread using the Internet (see Petition No 0079/2003), D. whereas the business practices complained of typically consist of an approach made, usually by mail, by a business-directory company to businesses inviting them to complete or update their business name and contact details and giving them the false impression that they will be listed in a business directory free of charge; whereas signatories later discover that they have, in fact, unintentionally signed up to a contract, normally binding them for a minimum of three years, to be listed in a business directory at a yearly charge of some EUR 1 000, E. whereas the forms used in such practices are usually ambiguous and difficult to understand, inducing the erroneous idea of a free listing in a business directory but in fact entrapping businesses into unwanted con\u00ad tracts for advertising in business directories, F. whereas neither specific EU legislation nor national legislation exists in Member States concerning direc\u00ad tory companies in business-to-business relationships, and whereas Member States have a discretion to introduce more comprehensive and far-reaching legislation, G. whereas Directive 2006/114/EC also applies to business-to-business transactions and defines \u2018misleading advertising\u2019 as \u2018any advertising which in any way, including its presentation, deceives or is likely to deceive the persons to whom it is addressed or whom it reaches and which, by reason of its deceptive nature, is likely to affect their economic behaviour or which, for those reasons, injures or is likely to injure a com\u00ad petitor\u2019; whereas, however, different interpretations of what is \u2018misleading\u2019 seem to be a major practical impediment in combating such practices of directory companies in business-to-business relationships, H. whereas Directive 2005/29/EC prohibits the practice of \u2018including in marketing material an invoice or similar document seeking payment which gives the consumer the impression that he has already ordered the marketed product when he has not\u2019; whereas, however, that Directive does not apply to business-to- business misleadin g practices an d therefore, in its curren t form, can not b e relied upon to help the peti\u00ad tioners; whereas, however, that Directive does not preclude a system of national rules on unfair commercial practices that is equally applicable under all circumstances to consumers and enterprises, I. whereas Directive 2005/29/EC does not preclude Member States from extending its application also to businesses through national law; whereas, however, this leads to differing levels of protection for busi\u00ad nesses which are victims of misleading practices by business-directory companies in different Member States, J. whereas Regulation (EC) No 2006/2004 defines \u2018intra-Community infringement\u2019 as \u2018any act or omission contrary to the laws that protect consumers\u2019 interests \u2026 that harms, or is likely to harm, the collective interests of consumers residing in a Member State or Member States other than the Member State where the act or omission originated or took place; or where the responsible seller or supplier is established; or where evidence or assets pertaining to the act or omission are to be found\u2019; whereas, however, that Direc\u00ad tive does not apply to business-to-business misleading practices and therefore, in its current form, cannot be relied upon either to help the petitioners, ",

Considers that the cross-border nature of this problem imposes a duty on the Community institutions to provide an adequate remedy to victims, such that the validity of contracts concluded on the basis of mislead\u00ad ing advertising can be effectively contested, annulled or terminated, and such that victims may obtain reim\u00ad bursement of the mon ey paid b y them; ",

Urges victims to report cases of business scams to national authorities, and calls on Member States to pro\u00ad vide small and medium-sized enterprises with the know-how needed in order to enable them to file complaints with governmental and non-governmental authorities, by ensuring that communication pathways are open and that victims are aware that advice is available so that they can seek appropriate guidance before they settle fees demanded from them by misleading business-directory companies; urges Member States to set up and maintain a centralised database of these complaints; 4. Regrets that, despite the widespread nature of these practices, EU and national legislation does not appear to be adequate when it comes to providing a significant means of protection and an effective remedy, or is not being adequately enforced at national level; regrets that national authorities also seem unable to provide a remedy; 5. Welcomes the efforts made by European and national business organisations to raise awareness among their members, and calls on them to intensify their efforts in collaboration with grass-roots organisations so that fewer people become victims of misleading business-directory practices in the first place; expresses con\u00ad cern that some of these organisations have consequently been pursued through the courts by the misleading business-directory companies specified in their awareness-raising activities on the basis of alleged defamation or similar accusation s; 6. Welcomes the action taken by certain Member States such as Italy, Spain, the Netherlands, Belgium and the United Kingdom, but most notably by Austria, in trying to prevent business-directory companies from engaging in misleading practices; considers, however, that these efforts remain insufficient and that there is still a need for the coordination of control at an international level; 7. Calls on the Commission and on Member States to step up their efforts, in full cooperation with national and European business representative organisations, to raise awareness of this problem so that more people are informed and empowered to avoid misleading advertising which can lure them into unwanted advertising contracts; 8. Calls on the Commission to address the problem of business scams in the context of its \u2018Small Business Act for Europe\u2019 initiative, as proposed in its communication entitled \u2018A Single Market for 21st Century Europe\u2019, and to engage with the Enterprise Europe Network, the Solvit network and the relevant DG portals as a further means of delivering information and assistance regarding these problems; 9. Regrets that Directive 2006/114/EC, which applies to business-to-business transactions such as the one at issue in this case, appears to be either insufficient in terms of providing an effective remedy or inadequately enforced by Member States; requests the Commission to report by December 2009 on the feasibility and pos\u00ad sible consequences of amending Directive 2006/114/EC in such a way as to include a \u2018black\u2019 or \u2018grey\u2019 list of practices that are to be regarded as misleading; 10. Recalls that, whereas the Commission has n o power to en force Directive 2006/114/E C directly ag ainst individuals or companies, it does have the duty, as the guardian of the Treaty, to ensure that that Directive is adequately and effectively implemented by Member States; therefore calls on the Commission to ensure that Member States fully and effectively transpose Directive 2005/29/EC so that protection is guaranteed in all Member States, and to influence the shape of the legal and procedural tools available, as in the case of Direc\u00ad tive 84/450/EEC, which provided tools to Austria, Spain and the Netherlands, thereby fulfilling its duty as guardian of the Treaty in terms of protection for businesses whilst ensuring that the right of establishment and freedom to provide services are not impaired; ",

Calls on the Commission to step up its monitoring of the implementation of Directive 2006/114/EC, most notably in those Member States where misleading business-directory companies are known to be based, but in particular in Spain, where the business-directory company that is most often named by petitioners is established, and in the Czech Republic and Slovakia where a court judgment has been delivered against vic\u00ad tims in a manner which calls into question the implementation of Directive 2006/114/EC in those countries; calls on the Commission to report back to Parliament on its findings; 12. Regrets that Directive 2005/29/EC does not cover business-to-business transactions and that Member States appear reluctant to extend its scope; notes, however, that Member States may unilaterally extend the scope of their national consumer legislation to cover business-to-business transactions, and actively encour\u00ad ages them to do so and also to ensure cooperation between Member States\u2019 authorities as provided for in Regu\u00ad lation (EC) No 2006/2004 in order to make it possible to track down cross-border activities of this kind engaged in by business-directory companies established within the EU or in a third country; moreover, requests the Commission to report by December 2009 on the feasibility and possible consequences of extending the scope of Directive 2005/29/EC to cover business-to-business contracts with specific regard to point 21 of Annex I thereto; 13. Welcomes the example set by Austria, which has introduced a specific prohibition in its national legis\u00ad lation on misleading business directories, and calls on the Commission, in the light of the cross-border nature of this problem, to propose legislation to extend the scope of Directive 2005/29/EC, based on the Austrian model, in a way that specifically prohibits advertising in business directories unless prospective clients are unequivocally and by clear and graphic means informed that such advertisement is solely an offer for a con\u00ad tract against payment; 14. Notes that national legislation is often inadequate to pursue remedies against business-directory com\u00ad panies that are based in other Member States, and therefore urges the Commission to facilitate more active cross-border cooperation among national authorities in order to enable them to provide a more effective rem\u00ad edy to victims; 15. Regrets that Regulation (EC) 2006/2004 is not applicable to business-to-business transactions and there\u00ad fore cannot be relied upon as a means of combating misleading business directories; calls on the Commission to propose legislation to extend its application accordingly; 16. Welcomes the example of Belgium, where all those affected by misleading practices are able to take legal action in their country of residence; 17. Notes that the Austrian experience shows that the right of victims to have collective legal action taken against directory companies by trade associations or similar bodies appears to be an effective remedy which could be replicated in the initiatives currently being contemplated by the Commission\u2019s DG COMP in relation to actions for damages for breach of the EC competition rules and DG SANCO on European-level collective redress for con sumers; 18. Urges Member States to ensure that victims of misleading advertising have a clearly identifiable national authority to which they can make a complaint and from which they can seek a remedy even in cases, such as these, where the victims of misleadin g advertising are businesses; ",

Considers that the EU needs to support the inclusion of the concept of labour mobility in all Community policies, especially those concerning the completion of the internal market, the protection of workers, rules concerning posted workers and protection against non-secure work, which may affect mobility within the EU or combat discrimination; calls on the Commission to treat labour mobility as a priority transversal policy, involving all relevant EU policy areas and all levels of authority in the Member States; 6. Stresses that labour mobility is based on the fundamental principle of the free movement of persons within the internal market as laid down in the EC Treaty; 7. Calls upon the Commission, in order to further promote labour mobility, to draw up a long-term mobil\u00ad ity strategy which takes into account the requirements of the labour market, economic trends and the pros\u00ad pects for enlargement of the EU, as only a long-term strategy can both guarantee free movement of workers without conflict and properly address brain-drain; 8. Calls on the Commission to take into account the specific needs of female workers of all ages wishing to exercise freedom of movement and to include concrete steps to meet their needs in the four areas of the Euro\u00ad pean Job Mob ility Action Plan ; 9. Urges the Commission to prioritise the streamlining of administrative practices and administrative coop\u00ad eration so as to allow synergies to develop between national institutions and authorities whose interaction is decisive when trying to resolve problems between Member States efficiently; in addition, considers that Mem\u00ad ber States should vigorously tackle all legal and administrative barriers and obstacles to geographical mobility at European, national, regional and local levels, such as the non-recognition of mobility-related experiences for career prospects or social security and pensions, particularly within small and medium-sized enterprises; 10. Considers that, while the Commission\u2019s Action Plan covers the main issues relating to mobility, much more action still needs to be taken, notably creating stronger links between education systems and the labour market, providing proper information on mobility, maintaining acquired linguistic abilities for workers and their families preparing for mobility via the teaching of foreign languages and, not least, in vocational training and learning systems; 11. Calls on the Member States actively to promote foreign language teaching (especially for adults), given that linguistic barriers are among the main remaining obstacles to the mobility of workers and their families; 12. Considers that the Member States should ensure that the labour rights and collective agreements of citi\u00ad zens who choose to move to another Member State are fully respected, without discrimination between nation\u00ad als of that Member State and non-nationals; believes that, to that end, the Commission\u2019s measures should focus on ensuring that migrant citizens receive equal treatment and are not turned into a cheap labour force; 13. With a view to creating stronger links between training and the labour market, urges the Commission and the Member States to bring this matter before the sectoral consultation committees; considers that indus\u00ad try an d the trades could provide reg ular in formation ab out the occupational fields most open to mob ility; 14.

Reiterates that labour mobility is a key instrument for the efficient working of the internal market, via the objectives of the Lisbon Strategy and the eight principles proposed on \u2018flexicurity\u2019 in the Commission com\u00ad munication of 27 June 2007; calls, therefore, on the Member States to take appropriate measures to empha\u00ad sise flexicurity on the one hand and to protect workers\u2019 security on the other, bearing in mind the fundamental principles of opportunities, access and solidarity referred to in the renewed social agenda; 17. Calls on the Member States and stakeholders to consider and remove the obstacles to the mobility of women workers, by providing, among other things, fair access to qualified jobs and high-level positions, equal pay, flexible working conditions, adequate healthcare and childcare services, good quality education facilities for children, portable pension rights, and ensuring the elimination of gender stereotypes; 18. Recommends that Member States and regional and local authorities actively promote special employ\u00ad ment, training, educational, distance learning and language programmes to create a more women-friendly labour market and to enable the reconciliation of professional and family life; 19. Calls on the Member States to include both labour and geographical mobility as a priority in their national employment and lifelong learning programmes; 20. Notes with concern that some Member States are maintaining labour market restrictions on workers from the new Member States, despite the fact that economic analyses and statistical data neither justify these restrictions nor support the fears of their citizens and governments; calls on the Council to ensure greater involvement and closer monitoring on the part of the EU institutions, especially the Parliament, with regard to the process of authorisation and justification by Member States of the transitional periods for access to their labour markets for the citizens of the new Member States, including from the first year of membership; 21. Stresses that the mobility of workers should not be construed by some employers as an opportunity to reduce wages, cut back social security or, in general, to downgrade working conditions; urges the Member States to take appropriate measures not only to eliminate all forms of discrimination but also to ensure the best possible conditions for the activities of migrant workers and their families; 22. Notes with concern certain moves by Member States to alter their internal legal frameworks for immi\u00ad gration and interpret and apply the principle of the free movement of labour in a manner that is contrary to the letter and spirit of the Community rules in force; calls for an immediate end to such practices and encour\u00ad ages the Member States to introduce comprehensive schemes for the integration of Union citizens exercising their right of free movement on their territory, where appropriate, in cooperation with the Member States of orig in; ",

Calls on the Member States and the Commission to work together in order to draw up, implement, moni\u00ad tor and evaluate a programme of social reintegration for citizens and their families returning to their Member State of origin after a period spent working in another; 24. Acknowledges that, while mobility can provide a solution to labour shortages in the receiving countries, it may cause labour shortages in the countries from which workers come; draws the attention of the Com\u00ad mission and Member States to the fact that, in every country, the inactive population offers a significant labour potential, whose mobilisation requires EU and Member-State resources in equal measure; 25. Draws the Commission\u2019s attention to the fact that there remain within the EU a large number of admin\u00ad istrative and legislative barriers to labour mobility and to the mutual recognition of qualifications of every level and professional experience; reaffirms its commitment to a solution to these problems, and calls on the Com\u00ad mission to undertake close monitoring of restrictions incompatible with Community law, and to take action against them; 26. Encourages the Member States to carry out, prior to the implementation of new national laws in the field of care and public health and social and fiscal systems, a border impact study to highlight in advance any prob\u00ad lems that will have consequences for labour mobility; 27. Takes the view that border workers occupy a special position in the area of European labour mobility; 28. Encourages the Member States to speed up the implementation of the common framework for qualifi\u00ad cations (European Qualifications Framework \u2014 EQF); considers that, while alignment with this reference sys\u00ad tem is due in 2010, its accelerated implementation in all Member States could reduce the obstacles currently facing workers; 29. Welcomes the Commission\u2019s initiative with regard to EUNetPaS, which is a first step in encouraging Member States and EU stakeholders to enhance collaboration in the field of patient safety; however notes that, throughout the EU, there is still diversity in the regulation of healthcare professionals and calls on the Com\u00ad mission to encourage Member States and their regulatory authorities for healthcare professionals to share infor\u00ad mation and establish standardised accreditation systems for healthcare professionals in order to ensure patient safety throughout the EU; 30. Notes that the lack of a common framework for comparing, transferring and recognising vocational qualifications at EU level is a serious barrier to transnational mobility; welcomes the Commission\u2019s initiative on the establishment of the European Credit System for Vocational Education and Training; 31. Calls on the Commission and the Member States to ensure that employers and trade representatives become involved as quickly as possible in implementing the EQF and hence that the system for the recogni\u00ad tion of qualifications can take effect on the labour market; 32. Calls on the Commission, the Member States, and the two sides of industry to open discussions with a view to harmonising salary scales with the different levels of qualifications laid down in the EQF so as to enable labour mobility to be guaranteed by virtue of wage levels corresponding to workers\u2019 skills; 33. Encourages educational authorities to work together pro-actively on the mutual recognition of qualifi\u00ad cations \u2014 gained from formal, informal and non-formal education \u2014 and professions which correspond to the standards set by Member States; considers it crucial that Member States make full use of the EQF and give appropriate follow-up to forthcoming initiatives on the European Credit system for Vocational Education and Training, so that classification in the levels of the n ational education a l system an d of the Lifelon g Learn ing ",

Regrets that in some Member States insufficient priority is being given and insufficient funding is being dedicated to developing and implementing lifelong learning strategies; encourages Member States to use financ\u00ad ing available from the Structural Funds, and in particular from the European Social Fund more actively in order to develop and implement such schemes; 35. Calls on the Commission to reduce legislative and administrative obstacles, and stresses the need for fur\u00ad ther progress in the recognition and cumulation of social security entitlements and in the portability of pensions; 36. Takes the view that the portability of social security provisions is better coordinated on the basis of Regu\u00ad lation (EEC) No 1408/71 and Regulation (EC) No 883/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 29 April 2004 on the coordination of social security systems ( 1 ) OJ L 166, 30.4.2004, p. 1.

Calls on the Commission to review its visa policy for third country participants in recognised EU vol\u00ad unteer programmes, with a view to introducing a more liberal visa regime especially for volunteers from coun\u00ad tries neighbouring the EU; 39. With regard to the new forms of mobility, considers it necessary to examine existing legislation with a view to determining if it is still up-to-date and finding appropriate means of adapting it to the new flexible conditions on the European labour market, taking account not only of the need to safeguard workers\u2019 rights but also examining additional problems which migrant workers and their families might face; believes, at the same time, that an analysis needs to be made of the real extent of implementation in all Member States of the Community legislation on the free movement of labour and the right of residence of workers and their fami\u00ad lies; considers that, where relevant, recommendations should be drawn up for improving the legislative and operational framework; 40. Advocates a discussion on social security arrangements, inter alia with reference to access to health care and the fact that workforce mobility can, in some cases, lead to the loss of social security benefits; calls on the Commission to examine whether Regulation (EC) No 883/2004, implementing Regulation (EEC) No 574/72 and related administrative practices need adapting to respond to changing patterns and new forms of worker mobility, including short-term labour mobility; 41. Considers that the Commission should investigate the mobility-inhibiting effects that arise as a result of the lack of coordination between tax agreements and the new social security regulation (Regulation (EC) No 883/2004); ",

Supports the Commission in its plans for action to improve its proposal for a directive on minimum requirements for enhancing worker mobility by improving the acquisition and preservation of supplementary pension rights, because, with the increasing expansion of occupational pension schemes, worker-friendly rules on portability must be sought; accordingly calls on the Commission to submit a revised proposal for a direc\u00ad tive on the portability of occupational pensions; 43. Considers that the mobility of workers of both genders with families (meaning children and dependent relatives) depends to a great extent on the availability and affordability of services (such as child care and care for senior citizens, education facilities, day centres, special services); considers, at the same time, that job mobil\u00ad ity should promote personal fulfilment and improve quality of life and work; 44. Considers, however, that the proposal for improving exchanges of information and best practice between national authorities, as well as that concerning an electronic version of the European health insurance card, should be implemented with due protection of data: Member States must guarantee that personal data are not used for purposes other than those relating to social security, except where the party concerned expressly allows it; requests further information on this initiative and how it can enhance workforce mobility; calls on the Commission to examine and contribute to the possibility of creating, in the near future, a single European card including all information relating to the contributions paid by and the social rights of the individual con\u00ad cerned in all Member States where that person has worked; 45. Supports the actions of the TRESS network, and believes that it should undertake an ongoing investiga\u00ad tion of the different types of mobility, with a view to adapting them to Community legislation; calls on the Commission to include employers and trade unions in this network, recalling that it is often employers who support workers over legal issues relating to social insurance or obtaining documents needed in order to work; stresses that the EURES databases need to be easy to access and must be updated regularly and that the widest possible access to them must be ensured; considers that the EURES network should collaborate structurally and institutionally with the TRESS network; 46. Expresses its ongoing support for the contribution of the EURES network to facilitating workforce mobil\u00ad ity in the EU; recommends that EURES services should include information on specific Internet networks and portals for particular sectors, and that it should also cooperate with other information providers, especially specialist bodies in the Member States, with regard to job opportunities in the Union and with particular ref\u00ad erence to national labour authorities, which can directly provide individually tailored advice to job-seekers; 47. Considers that EURES crossborder projects should give priority to carrying out border impact studies and seminars, so that the entry into force of Regulation (EC) No 883/2004 on coordination can take place effec\u00ad tively and efficiently; 48. Supports the objectives announced in the third section of the Action Plan for Work Mobility, in line with the enhancement of the institutional capabilities of EURES; stresses the diverse make-up of the workforce and the need for services adapted to all categories of worker, over and above those listed in the Commission pro\u00ad gramme, namely older and disabled people who are disadvantaged but can be exploited by the labour market, those who possess special legal status in comparison with other workers, the self-employed, workers return\u00ad ing to employment after a break from work, and so on; stresses that all the information available through the E URES n etwork should b e accessib le to disab led people; 49. Calls upon Member States, through their employment authorities, in order to increase mobility, to pro\u00ad vide a one-stop shop for all workers, including those intending to work abroad, so that they can obtain infor\u00ad mation from a single source concerning the possibilities of working abroad, administrative factors, social rights and leg al con ditions; ",

Supports the idea of transforming EURES into a one-stop mobility information portal which would oper\u00ad ate as a centralised helpdesk where potentially mobile workers can obtain information about all aspects of job mobility \u2014 not only about job vacancies, social security, health care, pensions and the recognition of quali\u00ad fications, but also about language issues, housing, employment for spouses, education for children and inte\u00ad gration in general in the target state; points out that, where appropriate, it should be expanded to the benefit of third-country nationals, including those who have not yet acquired long-term resident status; 51. Fully endorses the existing information mechanisms but at the same time suggests that all relevant sites, portals, etc. be checked in terms of efficiency and, if necessary, reorganised, harmonised or regrouped so as to make them more user-friendly; 52. Draws attention to the issue of access to the EURES network for citizens living in rural, island, mountain and remote regions; calls on the Commission and the Member States to ensure that the information on this portal is also made accessible to these population groups; 53. Considers that the supplementary budget of EUR 2 million allocated to innovative mobility projects up to 2013 is too low, given the need to inform as many Union citizens as possible about labour mobility in the Union and the objectives set out in the various programme documents in support of labour mobility in the Union; 54. Underlines the need for comparable and reliable statistics on the mobility flows of workers, students, teachers and researchers in order to improve the Commission\u2019s knowledge of mobility, as well as its monitor\u00ad ing of the abovementioned Action Plan; 55. Believes that, as things stand, there is an information deficit as regards the potential professional and career benefits of spending time working abroad and regarding the employment and social-security condi\u00ad tions for working abroad and how this also promotes European cultural integration; supports the Commis\u00ad sion in its actions to inform the public about these matters; 56. Points to Parliament\u2019s programme of traineeships for people with disabilities, which started in 2007, and the Commission\u2019s programme of traineeships for people with disabilities, which started in the autumn of 2008; considers that such positive measures promote the mobility of people with disabilities and can make a signifi\u00ad cant contribution towards getting them into work; calls on the Member States to support and promote cor\u00ad responding best practice at national, regional and local levels; 57. Draws attention to the fact that Member States should promote and exchange good practice and mutual learning schemes for mobility actions, financed by the cohesion fund, and especially the European Social Fund; 58. Considers that, in addition to online services, supplementary means of supplying information should be explored and put in place in the Member States and in the regions of the EU with a view to the widespread distribution of information on job mobility within Member States; considers that a job mobility call centre related to E URES should b e put in place with a view to promptly providin g work ers with in formation on spe\u00ad cific questions in the national language and at least in a second European language; 59. Expresses its ongoing support for such actions as job fairs, European days for publicising work oppor\u00ad tunities throughout the Union, or European partnerships for labour mobility; considers, however, that the bud\u00ad get allocated to such actions is not sufficient in relation to the goal of publicising the EU\u2019s action in this field; ",

Calls on firms to support worker mobility, for example through flexible working hours and teleworking; 67. Calls upon the Commission to seek instruments by means of which to eliminate the complex obstacles which can prevent workers from opting to work abroad, such as difficulty in finding work for one\u2019s partner or spouse, high relocation costs, language barriers, the gender pay gap and the risk of losing tax advantages or no longer being able to contribute to national pension, health insurance or unemployment insurance schemes; stresses the importance of lifelong learning, with particular reference to the importance of language learning, which is essential in order to meet the changing demands of the labour market; 68. Welcomes the Commission\u2019s intention to follow up the proposal which it submitted in 2005 and its amended proposal of 2007 for a directive laying down minimum requirements for enhancing worker mobil\u00ad ity by improving the vesting and preservation of supplementary pension rights; 69.

Considers that there is an urgent need to clarify the regulatory framework of OLAF in order to further improve the efficiency of anti-fraud investigations and to ensure the necessary independence of OLAF, taking full account of the experiences gained since OLAF was established to replace UCLAF in 1999; 2. Reminds the Council that Parliament\u2019s abovementioned position of 20 November 2008 will lead to con\u00ad siderable improvement in the efficiency and quality of OLAF investigations through the strengthening of pro\u00ad cedural guarantees, the role of the Supervisory Committee, the presumption of innocence, the right of defence of those under investigation and the rights of informers, the adoption of clear and transparent investigative rules and the improvement of cooperation with the competent national authorities and the EU institutions; 3. Urges the French and Czech Presidencies to submit a calendar for negotiations with Parliament, based on Regulation (EC) No 1073/1999, thus confirming that they are making every possible effort to ensure the prompt adoption of a common position by the Council and to avoid any further unjustified delays; 4. Considers that the Council\u2019s position in favour of a simple consolidation of the three existing legal bases for OLAF investigations is not a valid argument for not immediately opening negotiations on Regulation (EC) No 1073/1999, since simple consolidation will not improve the legal framework for OLAF\u2019s anti-fraud inves\u00ad tigations and therefore constitutes a considerable loss of time in efforts to step up the fight against fraud; opts therefore for a recasting of EU anti-fraud legislation, including Regulation (EC) No 1073/1999, Regulation (Euratom, EC) No 2185/96 and Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 2988/1995, which should be based on a revised Regulation (EC) No 1073/1999; 5.

Calls for the establishment of permanent and uninterrupted operational joint surveillance patrols all year round in all high-risk areas, particularly at sea borders where there is a serious risk of loss of life, the right to life being the first inviolable fundamental right; 8. Stresses the importance of harmonising EC law with other international law applicable in this field, so that the Union can contribute effectively to the efforts required in order to help refugees in distress; 9. Calls on the Member States to commit themselves as soon as possible to giving concrete expression to this solidarity principle, particularly by increasing the material resources it makes available to Frontex, espe\u00ad cially in terms of surface assets, and by guaranteeing that they will be unconditionally available in practice in a timely manner; 10.

Welcomes the major cooperation efforts that have been achieved by almost all the third countries with which Frontex has been called on to cooperate on a day-to-day basis, and which have led to very positive results, for example in the Canary Islands; regrets, however, that cooperation on immigration is still lacking in other coun tries, such as Turk ey an d Lib ya; ",

Calls on the Commission and on Member States to redouble their efforts to achieve a higher level of cooperation from third countries, notably through the negotiation of readmission agreements; considers that immigration should be an intrinsic part of any negotiations of agreements with third countries which are coun\u00ad tries of origin or of transit; 17. Stresses the need for Frontex, in cooperation with third countries, to take due account of the opinions of those Member States which have had the most experience in tackling illegal immigration issues relating to the countries in question; participation by a third country in any joint Member State operation coordinated by Frontex must be subject to the approval of the Member State hosting the operation; 18. Calls for the mandate of Frontex to explicitly include an obligation to meet international human rights standards and a duty towards asylum seekers in rescue operations on the high seas, and for cooperation with the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and other relevant non-governmental organi\u00ad sations to be formalised within the mandate; 19.

Calls on Frontex to strengthen and take up its key role in supporting joint return operations and all the aspects involved in these procedures and, in a spirit of solidarity, calls on Member States to involve Frontex when planning and organising joint return flights and identifying the need for joint returns; 22. Calls on the Member States to permit Frontex\u2019s mandate to be reviewed so as to eliminate legal vacuums which could hamper its action, setting out in particular the precise legal conditions for its sea rescue opera\u00ad tions and for its contribution to return operations, and including the option for third countries to use its equip\u00ad ment, in particular by means of pilot projects from which they would benefit; 23.

Considers in particular that, while the rhythm of work and the resources employed do not yet justify cre\u00ad ating a large number of decentralised agencies, consideration might be given at this stage to setting up two distinct external offices \u2014 one coordinating activities at land borders, the other for sea operations \u2014, bearing in mind that land migratory routes on the Eastern border will increasingly represent a major challenge in the future and should deserve increased attention and means; 27. Calls on the Commission and the Member States to consider the feasibility of an EU border guard system; 28. Stresses the need to carry out training for staff deployed in Frontex operations \u2014 particularly training in maritime law, asylum law and fundamental rights \u2014 including, once its mandate has been widened, for staff from the third countries involved; to that end, encourages Frontex to cooperate with other institutions such as the International Organization for Migration, the European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights and the UNHCR, the UN body responsible for the Law of the Sea and NGOs as well as other associations with expe\u00ad rience and know-how in these areas; 29. Calls on the Commission to organise information campaigns on best practice in the Member States on the risks of illegal immigration; 30. Welcomes the current discussions in the Council aimed at setting up the Eurosur border surveillance sys\u00ad tem with a view to optimising the exploitation of all surveillance systems, essentially by extending their exist\u00ad ing cover, which currently reaches only part of the areas where operations need to be carried out; 31. Urges, therefore, that work begin without delay on the upgrading of the national surveillance systems and their interconnection as a network and that, in the interest of coherence, Frontex be given the task of assembling the available tools, and in particular of managing the secure web-based Information and Coordi\u00ad nation Network for Member States\u2019 Migration Management Services (Iconet) ( 1 ) Council Decision 2005/267/EC of 16 March 2005 (OJ L 83, 1.4.2005, p. 48).

Calls on the Member States to ensure that the concrete needs of the border control services are specifi\u00ad cally taken into account in research activities; 34. Considers the objective of truly integrated EU border management as legitimate and agrees that is impor\u00ad tant to continuously develop and strengthen the EU\u2019s common policy on border management; stresses, how\u00ad ever, the need for an evaluation and assessment of existing systems and those under preparation before moving ahead with the new building blocks as proposed by the Commission in its abovementioned Communication entitled \u2018Preparing the next steps in border management in the European Union\u2019; insists furthermore on a com\u00ad prehensive master plan, setting out the overall architecture of the EU\u2019s border strategy as well as the details for how all related programmes and schemes are supposed to collectively function and how the relationship among related programmes can be optimised; ",

Calls for the strengthening of the democratic control of Frontex by Parliament, and calls on Frontex to inform Parliament of negotiations to conclude agreements signed with third countries, to present tactical assessments focused on particular border regions, and to publish evaluation reports on joint operations and other coordinated missions, risk analyses, feasibility studies and statistics on migration trends; points out that democratic oversight of Frontex\u2019s activities would, among other things, enhance its legitimacy; nevertheless the information published in those reports should not contain confidential data that may affect ongoing operations; 37.

Takes the view that the Word Trade Organisation (WTO) system aims to ensure that IPRs are more widely recognised internationally, providing for an agreed level of standards of protection through the Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS), dialogue between Member States and with other institutions such as the World Intellectual Property Organisation (WIPO) and the World Customs Organisation (WCO), as well as a dispute prevention and settlement mechanism; 2. Calls on the Commission to persevere in the TRIPS Council to ensure that the minimum rules incorpo\u00ad rated into national law are accompanied by effective enforcement measures and measures to prevent infringe\u00ad ments;takes the view that the flexibilities provided for in the TRIPS agreement and confirmed in the Doha Declaration on the TRIPS agreement and public health, should be maintained insofar as they are aimed at ensuring a fair balance between the interests of rights\u2019 holders and those of end users; 3. Calls on the Commission to bring forward proposals to the Parliament to ensure that export, transit and transhipment operations are appropriately dealt with in the TRIPS agreement and to examine the case for fur\u00ad ther changes in the agreement, in order to create a fair balance between the interests of owners and those of potential users of IPRs, particularly bearing in mind the level of development of the parties involved and dis\u00ad tinguishing between countries which produce counterfeit and pirated products, those which use them, and those through which the products transit; 4. Welcomes the progress achieved by the European Union in technical assistance programmes which have helped to strengthen IPRs in emerging and developing countries, and stresses the importance of continuing with such programmes, in view of the benefits which they can achieve in terms of sustainable economic devel\u00ad opment and their important role in combating counterfeiting; 5. Calls on the Commission and the Member States to develop specific measures, backed up by appropriate financial coverage, in favour of more widespread consumer education in Europe and also in developing coun\u00ad tries, in order to avert the risks relating to potentially dangerous counterfeit products; 6. Supports the solutions put forward at the Twelfth session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development, within the Creative Africa Initiative, which consider the creative industries to be an essential fac\u00ad tor in the growth of underdeveloped countries, and reaffirm the vital role of IP for the sustainable develop\u00ad ment of such regions; 7. Calls on the Commission and the Member States to propose and support the drafting of a protocol on counterfeiting, in addition to the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organised Crime (Palermo Convention); 8. Points out that in several emerging economies, the production of counterfeit and pirated goods has reached alarming levels; whilst welcoming the cooperation initiatives hitherto implemented, is of the view that special measures are required in order to strengthen coordination between customs, judicial and police authori\u00ad ties with the countries concerned and to encourage the harmonisation of the laws of these countries with those of the European Union; 9. Calls on the Commission to introduce, along the same lines as Article 3(2) ( 1 ) Article 3(2) states that \u2018Those measures, procedures and remedies shall also be effective, proportionate and dissuasive and shall be applied in such a manner as to avoid the creation of barriers to legitimate trade and to provide for safe\u00ad guards against their abuse.\u2019 ( 1 ) of the Directive 2004/48/EC, safeguards at international level in order to guarantee that any extra patent enforcement measures are not used to hinder legitimate trade; ",

Is convinced that in order to step up the fight against counterfeiting, more regular and targeted use should also be made of the WTO\u2019s Dispute Settlement Body, which, together with the Community and national courts, can provide better protection of European industry and consumers by consolidating case-law which enhances the substance and scope of the TRIPS agreement; 12. Reaffirms that any harmonisation of substantive law must respect national sovereignty and international treaties in this area; ACTA and other bilateral and regional EU initiatives 13. Calls on the Commission to continue its fight against counterfeiting and piracy, in parallel with the mul\u00ad tilateral negotiations, also by means of bilateral, regional and multilateral agreements with a view to approxi\u00ad mating and enforcing laws, and by providing for the establishment of efficient dispute settlement systems and penalties in case of failure to comply with the obligations underwritten; 14.

Considers that it is not yet certain whether the EC Treaty provides a legal basis for Community measures prescribing the type and level of criminal penalties and that, as a consequence, the Commission may not have competence to negotiate on behalf of the Community an international agreement which specifies the nature and level of criminal-law measures to be taken against trademark and copyright violators; 16. Stresses that in all intellectual property enforcement agreements foreseen, personal use, that is not for profit, must be distinguished from the fraudulent and intentional marketing of counterfeit and pirated goods; 17. Calls on the Commission to negotiate with third countries on the establishment of task forces to combat counterfeiting; 18. Asks the Commission to ensure that ACTA will not grant public authorities access to private computers and other electronic devices; 19. Welcomes the growing interest shown by a number of WTO countries in the ACTA, believes that efforts should be made to include emerging economies such as China, India, Brazil as well as regional trade blocs such as Mercosur, CARICOM and ASEAN, in order for them to take part in the negotiations of the agreement, invit\u00ad ing them from n ow to commit themselves to g uarantee I PRs\u2019 respect in their territories; ",

Calls on the Commission to avoid the danger of contradictions and overlap between the ACTA, the TRIPS agreement and other international IPR treaties; 21. Calls on the Commission to ensure that ACTA only concentrates on IPR enforcement measures and not on substantive IPR issues such as the scope of protection, limitations and exceptions, secondary liability or liability of intermediaries; 22. Calls on the Commission to ensure that ACTA is not used as a vehicle for modifying the existing Euro\u00ad pean IPR enforcement framework, but fully reflects the balance established by the different directives adopted by the European Parliament and Council in this field, and notably the provision of Recital 2 of the Directive 2004/48/EC; 23. Calls on the Commission and the Council to clarify the role and competence of the Article 133 Com\u00ad mittee and the other committees involved in the negotiation of the ACTA; 24. Believes that the Commission should take into account certain strong criticism of ACTA in its ongoing n egotiations, namely that it could allow trademark and copyright holders to intrude on the privacy of alleged infringers without due legal process, that it could further criminalise non commercial copyright and trade\u00ad mark infringements, that it could reinforce Digital Rights Management technologies at the cost of \u2018fair use\u2019 rights, that it could establish a dispute settlement procedure outside existing WTO structures and lastly that it could force all signatories to cover the cost of enforcement of copyright and trademark infringements; 25. In this context, calls on the Commission to ensure a continuous and transparent public consultation pro\u00ad cess, to support the benefits of such a process with all the negotiating countries, and to ensure that the Par\u00ad liament is regularly and thoroughly informed about the state of play of the negotiations; 26. Recalls that the EC Treaty includes derogations where the negotiation and conclusion of agreements in the field of commercial aspects of intellectual property relates to trade in cultural and audiovisual services; points out that, in such instances, the negotiation and conclusion of agreements falls within the shared com\u00ad petence of the Community and its Member States; further points out that, in addition to a Community deci\u00ad sion taken in accordance with the relevant provisions of the EC Treaty, the negotiation of such agreements requires the common accord of the Member States and agreements negotiated in this way must be concluded jointly by the Community and the Member States; 27. Reminds the Commission of, within the framework of ACTA negotiations, Article 8 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, which concerns the protection of personal data, and Directive 95/46/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 24 October 1995 on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data ( 1 ) OJ L 281, 23.11.1995, p. 31. ( 1 ); 28. Takes the view that the public interest in disclosure of ACTA preparatory drafts, including progress reports, and of the Commission\u2019s negotiating mandate should not be overridden by Article 4 of Regulation (EC) No 1049/2001 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 30 May 2001 regarding public access to European Parliament, Council and Commission documents ( 2 ) OJ L 145, 31.5.2001, p. 43.

Notes with regret that IPR protection in Turkey does not yet meet EU standards and therefore needs to be reviewed; points out that Turkey will only become a credible candidate for accession when it is in a posi\u00ad tion to take on the Community acquis and guarantee full respect for IPRs within its boundaries; ",

Reaffirms the need to step up cooperation with the Chinese customs authorities and to guarantee assis\u00ad tance and support from corresponding European administrative services; 32.

Is of the view that the Trade Barriers Regulation can provide important assistance to European compa\u00ad nies suffering from problems of third-country market access in relation to intellectual property infringements and calls on the Commission to encourage and facilitate its use, especially by SMEs; 36. Takes the view that improved cooperation between the European Union and the Member States in third countries can guarantee more effective exchanges of information, better use of available resources and a greater impact on measures to combat counterfeiting as regards both political-diplomatic action and more strictly technical aspects; 37.

Notes the worrying spread of counterfeiting and piracy, in particular, in a globalised economy, and its serious implications for the competitiveness of the European Union and its businesses, creators and consum\u00ad ers; calls therefore on the Member States to provide consumers with sufficient information on the dangers of counterfeiting and piracy, in particular the considerable health and safety risks which counterfeit products, including medicin es, pose to con sumers; ",

Calls on the Commission to make all efforts to agree common minimum sanctions for serious infringe\u00ad ments of IPRs; 43. Believes that harmonisation of existing national anti-counterfeiting legislation is necessary in order to ensure effective and consistent application of the future ACTA agreement; 44. Stresses the need for improved coordination within the Commission between departments dealing with combatingg counterfeiting and for better dissemination of the Community initiatives the Commission adopts in this regard, given that the fragmentation of sanction arrangements is detrimental to the internal market and weakens the European Union in its trade negotiations; stresses also that the private and public sectors should extend their cooperation to ensure that measures to combat counterfeiting are more active, dynamic and effective; 45. Stresses the n eed to develop appropriate ongoing training courses for customs staff, magistrates and other professionals concerned and to encourage the Member States to set up specialised anti-counterfeiting teams; 46. Notes the acknowledgement by the Commission, in its July 2007 White Paper on Sport, that the eco\u00ad nomic viability of exploiting sports rights is dependent on the availability of effective means of protecting against the activities of intellectual property infringers at national and international levels and calls for the own\u00ad ers of sports\u2019 rights to be taken into account in any action to combat counterfeiting and digital piracy; 47. Recommends further improvement and better coordination of customs procedures in the European Union in order substantially to restrict access of counterfeit and pirated products to the single market; calls also on the Commission to submit a proposal to Parliament and the Council to provide the European Union and its Member States with EU-level statistical data on counterfeiting; 48. Calls on the Commission to take account of the specific aspects of the use of the Internet as a channel for distributing counterfeit products and to measure its impact on the Member States\u2019 economies by develop\u00ad ing statistical tools that can facilitate a coordinated response; 49.

Insists in this connection on the need to mobilise all operators concerned to strengthen the effectiveness of instruments for combating counterfeiting and piracy in the internal market; 57. Calls on the Member States to strengthen their customs teams on their national territories and put in place a service, identifiable to third parties (including Member States, third countries, Community institutions, businesses and individuals) responsible for combating counterfeiting and providing information on this problem; 58. Reminds the Member States of the importance of having a Community patent and a jurisdictional sys\u00ad tem for patents as a way of ensuring compliance with users\u2019 intellectual property rights throughout the Euro\u00ad pean Union, thus permitting innovative businesses to protect their inventions as much as possible and to profit from them to a greater extent; 59.

Further suggests that significant aspects of counterfeiting (product imitation/trademark infringement on a commercial scale) differ from those of piracy (copyright infringement on a commercial scale), and that con\u00ad sideration should be given to dealing with them independently and separately, especially having regard to the urg ent need to address public health and safety aspects prevalent in counterfeiting; ",

It should consist of a series of individual actions as detailed below, some of which might result in legislative proposals, for example for administrative cooperation under Article 66 of the EC Treaty, others in recommendations and others in administrative acts an d decision s. ",
        "23.2.2010 EN Official Journ al of the E uropean Un ion C 45 E /67 Thursday 18 December 2008 (Concrete action for the implementation of the European area of justice) The first step in this direction would of course be providing every judicial authority in the EU with a computer, an email address and an Internet connection. This might appear obvious but unfortunately it is not: in many cases judicial authorities are not provided with this indispensable tool or, even if they are, they cannot or do not want to use it. This situation must be overcome. (Clearly identifying the scope of e-Justice) In order to avoid misunderstandings, it would be appropriate to clearly identify matters covered by EU action by, for instance, using a different definition or prefixing the term \u2018e-Justice\u2019 with \u2018EU\u2019, so as to refer to \u2018EU e-Justice\u2019 or \u2018EU-Justice\u2019. Recommendation 2 (as to the minimum content of the instrument to be adopted) The Action Plan should be made up of at least the following actions: 1. EU-justice Action Plan. In order to avoid fragmentation and to enhance coordination and consistency, the Commission, together with Parliament, should draft an Action Plan on EU-justice geared to the needs of citizens and practitioners, pro\u00ad posing a strategy for the optimum implementation of the European area of justice. From this perspective, EU institutions and Member States should loyally cooperate (in accordance with Article 10 of the EC Treaty) by committing themselves to notifying each other of any relevant information including newly adopted legisla\u00ad tion, as already happens, mutatis mutandis , in the internal market with the exchange of information on national technical regulations. At the same time, whilst any measure aimed at improving mutual understanding of the information is welcome, attention must be paid to clearly defining and circumscribing the use of automatic translation systems, inasmuch as these sometimes produce \u2018translations\u2019 which prove to be misleading. 2. Action to \u2018future-proof\u2019 legislation The Commission should set up suitable machinery to ensure that all future legislation in the field of civil law is designed in such a way that it can be used in on-line applications. For example, steps could be taken to ensure that the proposed European Private Company can be set up using online applications and that proposals on the recognition of instruments such as those dealing with the legal protection of adults and other authentic acts are adapted for online use. Accordingly, where proposals are made involving forms intended to be filled out by citizens, the forms should be designed and formatted ab initio for electronic use and made available in all official languages of the Member States. Action should be taken to reduce to a minimum the need to input free text and to ensure that, where necessary, on-line help is provided in all official languages and on-line elec\u00ad tronic translation services are available. By the same token, where there is a need to provide for service of docu\u00ad ments, provision should be made to ensure that documents can be served and communications effected by electronic mail and signatures provided electronically and, where there is a need for oral testimony, the use of video-conferencing should be encouraged. All future proposals should include a reasoned statement by the Commission that an audit of e-Justice-friend\u00ad liness has been carried out. The Commission should carry out an audit of all existing legislation in the field of civil justice and propose amendments where necessary in order to make existing legislation compatible with the requirements of e-Justice. More specifically, the Commission is asked in this context to examine as a priority the European small-claims procedure, the European en forcement order an d altern ative dispute resolution (ADR) so as to ",
        "C 45 E /68 EN Official Journ al of the E uropean Un ion 23.2.2010 Thursday 18 December 2008 permit citizens and businesses to have direct access to them on-line. Similarly, the Service of Documents Regu\u00ad lation ( 1 ) Council Regulation (EC) No 1348/2000 of 29 May 2000 on the service in the Member States of judicial and extrajudicial documents in civil or commercial matters (OJ L 160, 30.6.2000, p. 37). ( 1 ) and the Civil Evidence Regulation ( 2 ) Council Regulation (EC) No 1206/2001 of 28 May 2001 on cooperation between the courts of the Member States in the taking of evidence in civil or commercial matters (OJ L 174, 27.6.2001, p. 1). ( 2 ) should be revisited. The aim should be to provide a panoply of effective, simple instruments which are useful to and useable by ordinary citizens and small businesses, not a system which only favours commercial litigants processing bulk claims. 3. Action on civil procedure The Commission and the Council should report to the European Parliament on the reform and harmonisation of procedural law and the law of evidence in cross-border cases and cases before the Court of Justice, having regard to developments in the field of information technology. The aim should be simpler, cheaper and faster civil proceedings in cross-border cases. 4. Action on the law of contract and consumer law Here the emphasis should be on preventive law by providing for greater clarity and simplicity and avoiding the pitfalls, problems and expense posed in particular by private international law. In this context, the Commission is asked to get to work on standard terms and conditions for electronic com\u00ad merce. Ultimately, this would allow electronic traders to offer a \u2018blue button\u2019 whereby consumers (or indeed other traders) could accept the application of standard European contract law to their transactions. This could be coupled with an on-line complaints system and access to approved on-line ADR. 5. Action on languages, multilingualism and interoperability A programme should be launched to examine how best to provide on-line translation facilities for the Euro\u00ad pean e-Justice portals. In parallel, a working group should be set up on simplification and standardisation of terminology. Each Member State should provide a database of legal translators and interpreters. 6. Action on European e-Justice portals All the above actions should feed into a coordinating and management unit, responsible also for coordinating the contributions of the various Member States and ensuring that they are interoperable. The coordinating and management unit should also bear responsibility for the design and operation of the European e-Justice portal, which should provide areas for citizens, legal professionals and the judiciary and civil servants, and report to the Commissioner for Justice, Freedom and Security, the European Parliament and the Council. Feasibility studies of the use of electronic signatures in a legal setting, remote accessing of national registers (insolvency registers, land registers, commercial registers, etc) and the creation of a secure network should be started as soon as possible (not later than 2009-2010), taking into account the results already achieved by the Council (interconnection of insolvency registers, possible cooperation with EULIS and EBR). The feasib ility study for a virtual exchan ge platform should b egin in 2011. The feasib ility studies should con \u00ad form to the rules on publicity and access to information laid down in each Member State in order to ensure data protection and legal certainty in respect of information. In carrying out these studies, account should be taken of the work already carried out by the notarial profes\u00ad sion in this field (recognition of signatures, e-Notary, register of wills, etc). The aim is to secure user-friendly tools for citizens, businesses, practitioners, the judiciary and officials responsible for the administration of justice. (a) The European e-Justice Portal for Citizens This multilingual portal should be designed to afford every assistance to citizens and businesses seeking legal assistance and initial legal advice about cross-border legal problems. ",
        "23.2.2010 EN Official Journ al of the E uropean Un ion C 45 E /69 Thursday 18 December 2008 Apart from access to legal databases and electronic remedies (small claims, order for payment) on-line ADR schemes (including Solvit) and ombudsmen, it should incorporate intelligent systems designed to help citizens to find out how to deal with legal problems. Such systems should guide people on how (a) to find a lawyer in another Member State who speaks their language (advocate, notary, solicitor, etc), explaining their respective functions, (b) to ascertain what legal aid, if any, is available and (c) to determine what steps to take in order to carry out certain formalities in the different Member States (e.g. how to set up a company, file accounts, draw up a will, buy/sell a house, etc). They should also be able to give a guide as to what the type of problem is, what procedural steps have to be taken and so on. Where possible, initial free legal advice by e-mail should be provided through, and under the supervision of, national professional bodies. At the very least, directories of lawyers, notaries, bailiffs and process-servers, audi\u00ad tors, nationally licensed experts and legal translators and interpreters in each Member State should be avail\u00ad able, together with links to the competent professional body. Plain guides to the legal system of each Member State should also be to hand. Rapid access to emergency legal assistance and the police should also be possible. In addition, the portal should also afford access to various registers and allow the publication of national Offi\u00ad cial Notices. (b) The secure European e-Justice Portal This portal should be designed for use as a tool by judges, court officials, officials of the national Ministries of Justice and practising lawyers with security ensured by the provision of different access rights. Apart from providing access to legal and legislative databases and the fullest possible range of national regis\u00ad ters, it should also permit secure communication, video-conferencing and document exchange between courts and between courts and parties to proceedings (dematerialisation of proceedings). To this end, it should also enable verification of electronic signatures and make provision for appropriate verification systems. The portal should also afford a means of exchanging information about, for instance, persons who are debarred from working with children or acting as company directors. The contact points of the European Judicial Network in Civil and Commercial Matters in the Member States should be encouraged to play an active role in the development of European e-Justice by contributing to the conception and design of the future portals, including the citizens\u2019 e-Justice portal, as part of the Community\u2019s e-Justice policy, designed in particular to afford direct access to justice for citizens. As an initial step, the Inter\u00ad net sites of the national Ministries of Justice should include a link to the site of the European Judicial Network. The portal should give EU citizens information on the criminal justice system of the Member States, in par\u00ad ticular regarding their rights, and should include practical information on what authority to address and how, on how obtain forms and on legal aid, as well as lists of lawyers able to deal with foreign clients. The portal should also provide legal practitioners with EU legislation and with relevant legislation of the Member States. The websites of European Judicial Training (EJT), the European Judicial Network in civil and commercial mat\u00ad ters (EJN), the European Judicial Training Network (EJTN) and other bodies already offer much useful infor\u00ad mation. Nevertheless, this information is fragmentary and not easy to find. Relevant judicial decisions should be made available. All this information should be available on-line and off-line, and particular attention must be paid to syn chronisation mechan isms offerin g updated in formation (RSS-feed). ",
        "C 45 E /70 EN Official Journ al of the E uropean Un ion 23.2.2010 Thursday 18 December 2008 7. Judicial training In order to spread the European judicial culture and with a view to reaching as many members of the judiciary as possible from the very first moment they join the judiciary, a sort of \u2018survivor\u2019 kit in the form of a CD or USB key containing the EU Treaty and the EC Treaty, as well as the basic texts on judicial cooperation and information on the other Member States\u2019 judicial systems, should be given to any newly appointed member of the judiciary. Consideration should also be given to EU publications addressed to citizens who provide prac\u00ad tical information on EU judicial cooperation and the criminal justice systems of other Member States. In addi\u00ad tion, electronic training tools offered by the EJTN, which represents judicial training schools all over the EU, should be given adequate attention and support by the Commission and the Council. 8. Preventing and fighting transnational crime So far, the most important application of e-Justice in the context of criminal justice is the creation of the Euro\u00ad pean Criminal Records Information System. To be effective, this system needs to be supported by an elec\u00ad tronic structure able to interconnect all national criminal registers ( 1 ) Parliament supports this project and hopes that it will be put in place, taking into account its position of 9 October 2008 on the establishment of the European Criminal Records Information System (ECRIS) (Texts Adopted, P6_TA(2008)0465). ( 1 ) which should be put in place without delay. Another IT application of relevance to the area of justice, freedom and security is the Schengen Infor\u00ad mation System (SIS), a large-scale database enabling the relevant authorities in the Member States to exchange information and cooperate in many ways, including by transmitting, in a secure and extremely fast way, Euro\u00ad pean arrest warrants. As reflected in Parliament\u2019s position of 2 September 2008 ( 2 ) European Parliament position of 2 September 2008 on the initiative of the Kingdom of Belgium, the Czech Republic, the Republic of Estonia, the Kingdom of Spain, the French Republic, the Italian Republic, the Grand Duchy of Luxem\u00ad bourg, the Kingdom of the Netherlands, the Republic of Austria, the Republic of Poland, the Portuguese Republic, the Republic of Slovenia, the Slovak Republic and the Kingdom of Sweden with a view to adopting a Council Decision on the strengthening of Eurojust and amending Decision 2002/187/JHA (Texts Adopted, P6_TA(2008)0384). ( 2 ), Eurojust is a key player in the fight against transnational crime at EU level. Its coordination action is fundamental to tackling serious crime phenomena which increasingly use technological means. Thanks also to its innovative data-processing system (the E-POC system), the number of cases managed by Eurojust in 2008 reached the threshold of 1 000. These examples must be multiplied and funded with EU financial resources. 9. Video-conferencing The use of video-conferences in the context of criminal proceedings in certain Member States is quite com\u00ad mon. It allows evidence to be gathered by taking the statements of accused persons, witnesses or experts in their physical absence whilst at the same time providing adequate protection to those needing protection. The 2000 European Convention on Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters lays down rules on the hearing of wit\u00ad nesses, accused persons and experts by video-conference. It has now been ratified by 24 Member States. The European Parliament calls on Member States to complete the ratification process as soon as possible. No sta\u00ad tistics are yet available on the practical application of video-conferences. It appears that video-conferencing is still not being fully exploited, one of the reasons being the lack of the requisite electronic support. Support and financial assistance by the EU must be delivered as soon as possible. 10. Enhancing fundamental rights and procedural safeguards Any technological progress is welcome in so far as it does not jeopardise fundamental rights. Bearing this in mind, in drafting and implementing the strategy and the Action Plan, attention must be devoted to respect for fundamental rights and notably procedural safeguards and data protection, giving EU citizens the right to access the information stored and shared by the relevant authorities and informing them of the available rem\u00ad edies. A real e-justice strategy cannot function without harmonisation of procedural safeguards and adequate data-protection safeguards applying to cooperation in criminal justice matters. ",

Supports \u2018Responsibility to Protect\u2019 as affirmed by the UN in order to reinforce rather than undermine state sovereignty and stresses that the EU and its Members States should regard themselves as bound by it; stresses that \u2018Responsibility to Protect\u2019 should be considered as a means to promote human security; by stressing that the primary responsibility for the prevention of genocide, war crimes, ethnic cleansing and crimes against humanity against a population lies with the state itself, reinforces the responsibility of each government towards the protection of its own citizens; considers, however, that where governments are unable or unwill\u00ad ing to provide such protection then the responsibility to take appropriate action becomes the collective respon\u00ad sibility of the wider international community; notes further that such action should be preventive as well as reactive, and should only involve the use of coercive military force as an absolute last resort; recognises this as an important new application of the principle of human security; 2. Demands the implementation of then UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan\u2019s declaration made in his report to the 2000 General Assembly: \u2018state sovereignty implies responsibility and the primary responsibility for the protection of its people lies with the state itself; where a population is suffering serious harm as a result of inter\u00ad nal war, insurgency, or state failure, and the state in question is unwilling or unable to halt or avert it, the prin\u00ad ciple of non-intervention yields to the international Responsibility to Protect\u2019; 3. Believes that there are two phases of peace-building and state-building: the stabilisation phase where the emphasis is on security, law and order and provision of basic services; and the second phase of state-building which focuses on governance and the institutions which will deliver it; with the proviso that: (a) the second phase should n ot tak e place un til the coun try is stab ilised, as in stitutions created b efore sta\u00ad bilisation will reflect the character of the conflict and not what the country needs for a stable and endur\u00ad ing peace, (b) in the state-building phase it is important to compromise to conform to the norms and expectations of the citizens of the nation concerned and not the ideals of the interveners, (c) as the state-building phase progresses interveners will need to hand over individual institutions to the domestic authorities; it is at this time that potential setbacks can occur and need to be accepted, provided they are not fundamental to the progress that the country is making; 4. Highlights the importance of addressing the root causes of conflicts in EU political dialogues with third countries and in development cooperation programmes so as to develop mechanisms to provide early warn\u00ad ing signs of failing states by looking at possible predictors or indicators of civil violence such as historic divi\u00ad sions, ethnic and tribal grievances, religious conflicts, inequity and poverty; in this context, stresses in particular the need to allocate new funding to adaptation and environmental protection as a means of preventing the rise of climate and en vironment-related con flicts; ",

Calls the Commission to designate conflict prevention as a cross-cutting issue in development coopera\u00ad tion and to integrate conflict sensitivity and conflict analysis into existing and new policies, into Country and Regional Strategy Papers, and into all the relevant financial instruments for external cooperation; 6. Recalls that peace is not only the absence of war, that there is no peace without justice and that, further\u00ad more, the end of hostilities does not necessarily result in security for men and women; also recalls the impor\u00ad tant role of women in the prevention and resolution of conflicts and in peace-building, and stresses the importance of their equal participation and full involvement in all efforts for the maintenance and promotion of peace and security; 7. Strongly believes that every effort must be made to ensure minimum standards of basic services for those populations affected by conflict, in particular in relation to access to food, clean water and sanitation, medi\u00ad cines, health care (including reproductive health) and personal security; in the immediate term sustainability concerns must be subordinate to providing basic goods and services; 8. Believes that in post-conflict situations there should be coordination among peace-building, humanitar\u00ad ian aid and development activities, in accordance with the \u2018Linking Relief, Rehabilitation and Development\u2019 strategic framework and to ensure coherence in the security and development nexus; 9. Considers it necessary to take into account the gender dimension when dealing with refugees and inter\u00ad nally displaced persons, including in the design of refugee camps; 10. Stresses the need to enhance Civil-Military Coordination; takes the view that in post-conflict situations the transition from military to civilian security must take place as soon as is practicable and that international forces should be gradually supplemented and replaced by a national and regional civilian police force, profes\u00ad sionally trained, ensuring that high priority is given to an even-handed application of the rule of law and administrative procedures to all groups involved in the conflict; 11. Stresses the need to strike a balance between civilian and military components of development aid in order to guarantee the functioning of basic infrastructure and government services without downplaying requirements for reconstruction, rehabilitation and the relaunching of democratic and economic processes; 12. Calls for the promotion of human rights, by supporting human rights training for the army and police (including human and civil rights campaigns for affected sections of the population), the coaching of staff in colleges on international standards of policing and military police, and the creation of a code of conduct for security personnel, delineating areas of responsibility between the police and army, the creation of offices of human rights ombudsmen and human rights commissions as well as human rights training for district authori\u00ad ties and civil servants; 13. Stresses the essential need to continue to develop the military capacity of the European Security and Defence Policy (ESDP) in order for the EU and its Member States to be better able to contribute to the stabi\u00ad lisation an d developmen t of post-con flict societies; 14. Considers it vitally important that the causes of instability and the problems of post-conflict societies be tackled by a combination of civil and military measures; points out that without the security guarantees of peacekeeping forces on the ground the essential precondition for stability in conflict-torn societies (i.e. the secu\u00ad rity of in dividuals and their property) cannot generally be fulfilled; ",

Stresses the importance of SSR and DDR processes as key factors for ensuring long lasting peace and sustainable development; calls on the Council and the Commission to accelerate the implementation on the ground of the EU\u2019s Policy Framework for SSR and the EU Concept for Support to DDR, with a view to increas\u00ad ing the relevance, coherence, and efficiency of the EU\u2019s activities in these domains; calls for increased Com\u00ad munity funding for SSR/DDR, with a special emphasis on those countries where the EU has already deployed ESDP missions; calls for any Community-funded SSR/DDR activities meant to support ESDP operations in a conflict, or post-conflict scenario, to be taken into consideration as soon as possible in the planning steps for the operations, namely in the fact-finding phase or during the development of the Crisis Management Concepts/Concept of Operations; 16. Stresses that SSR can be an effective tool for reinforcing diplomacy and defence while reducing long- term security threats by helping to build stable, prosperous, and peaceful societies; SSR must involve re-establishing or reforming institutions and key ministerial positions that maintain and provide oversight for the safety and security of the host nation and its people; 17. Asks the EU, when supporting post-conflict SSR, to include a gender perspective by providing gender training and expertise on constitutions, elections, the police and the judiciary; 18. Takes the view that former combatant leaders must renounce violence entirely before being brought into formal institutional structures which encourage power sharing, whilst ensuring that the public and all relevant stakeholders are kept actively informed and involved in all debates concerning power sharing arrangements; 19. Stresses the importance of adopting a gender perspective when negotiating and implementing peace agreements, so as to promote the constitutional protection of women\u2019s rights; 20. Calls, due to the fact that a majority of victims in conflict situations are killed by small arms and light weapons (SALW), upon the Council and the Commission to urgently follow up on the Court of Justice deci\u00ad sion of 20 May 2008 on Community competence in combating the proliferation of SALW ( 1 ) Case C-91/05, Commission v Council. ( 1 ) by accelerating the implementation of the European Strategy to combat illicit accumulation and trafficking of SALW and their ammunition, and by stepping up planning for EC funding, namely from the European Development Fund and the Stability Instrument, to be spent on SALW-related programmes on the ground; requests that multilateral and regional financial institutions take measures, where appropriate, to establish SALW programmes in the framework of reconstruction and rehabilitation efforts in post-conflict areas and in efforts to consolidate gov\u00ad ernance issues, to strengthen legislation and to improve the operational capacity of law enforcement agencies regarding SALW; calls on the Council and the Commission to continue promoting the creation of an inter\u00ad national, legally-binding Arms Trade Treaty in all bilateral and multilateral settings; 21. Considers that the voluntary return of refugees and internally displaced people (IDPs) must be a high pri\u00ad ority while ensuring them security in a viable livelihood, in particular by providing functional health and edu\u00ad cation services (including literacy campaigns for women) and job opportunities, and that it must take place by means of inter-group dialogue, peace education, international accompaniment, prejudice reduction and diver\u00ad sity training, ex-combatant-community engagement, processes for handling land claims and trauma healing; provided that the ethnic or religious profile is compatible, considers that IDPs should be spread across the country and resettled in their original villages or towns and not concentrated in large groups which can lead to conflict and violence; 22. Stresses the need for women to resume or further their education and training post-conflict; considers, in this connection, that the resumption of teaching should be actively promoted during nation-building processes; ",

Strongly emphasises the need to consult and support local women\u2019s organisations and international net\u00ad works of women for peace; recommends the provision of political and financial support, training, capacity- building and technical assistance, including on peace negotiations and on non-violent conflict resolution; 24. Is of the opinion that Member States have a moral obligation to shelter refugees fleeing from conflict areas; believes that this obligation can only be fulfilled on the basis of burden-sharing between Member States; further believes that Member States should actively assist refugees wishing to return to their countries of ori\u00ad gin after the end of violent conflict; 25. Affirms the vital importance of fair migration policies towards developing countries; notes that migra\u00ad tion can be turned into a positive force in the development process, notably by means of remittances sent by migrants living in the EU, by curtailing the brain drain, by facilitating return migration and by preventing traf\u00ad ficking in human beings; 26. Stresses that action must be taken to promote family reunification and reintegration of children affected by armed conflict and to ensure access to educational programmes, vocational training and psychological sup\u00ad port, taking into account the specific needs of girls; 27. Calls for the effective implementation of the Commission\u2019s proposal for DDR of former combatants; including the reintegration of combatants into civil society by the provision of food, tents, blankets, medical support and civilian clothes; the transportation of ex-soldiers to their community of origin or destination of choice; support retirement programmes for political or military officers, re-housing of ex-soldiers, and salary support schemes; civic education classes for ex-soldiers and psychological regeneration programmes for ex-combatants with specific allocation of additional resources for employment schemes and job creation programmes; 28. Points out that DDR programmes should include specific provisions for female ex-combatants; 29. Stresses that action to combat both the use of child soldiers and the recruitment of girls into the armed forces and their subsequent subjection to sexual abuse ties in with action to improve the daily lives of women living in regions in which post-conflict peace-building and nation-building are in progress; 30. Takes the view that DDR should also aim to achieve social and economic development, and provide financial assistance programs intended to meet immediate needs; 31. Believes that local ownership of the peace-building process is essential to ensure long-term stability; 32. Considers that international donors should take account of regional and local circumstances when devis\u00ad ing a policy of reconstruction for stability and democracy, starting from the experience acquired in promoting economic development in post-conflict societies; 33. Stresses that a suitable reconciliation strategy needs to take account of the role of women in peace con\u00ad solidation processes; emphasises that reconciliation programmes must incorporate the specific circumstances of children affected by armed conflict; 34. Believes that state legitimacy can only be built through good and effective governance; stresses that insti\u00ad tutions, electoral processes, voter registration and electoral rolls, voter identification and anti-corruption mechanisms must be as transparent and accountable as possible, as they are a prerequisite for defending the rule of law, human rights, democratic institutions, and the dignity of the population as well as for economic development, in vestment an d trade; ",

Considers such factors as the rule of law, sound money, a free market, an efficient and competent civil service, an independent judiciary, and legislative and executive branches free from corruption, to comprise the means by which individuals and communities, through their industry and initiative, can truly increase the wealth of their nations; 36. Calls for the creation of one-stop-shop boards of investment to foster priority sectors where foreign direct investment can be attracted, creating jobs outside of the traditional agricultural sectors by supporting the devel\u00ad opment of liberal investment codes and tax-free industrial zones; 37. Calls on the Commission to create a deregulation unit which can advise countries emerging from con\u00ad flict on how to structure their economic infrastructure so as to remove bureaucratic controls which stop or delay the creation of small businesses, the opening of bank accounts, the registration of land and companies; the deceleration of venture capitals being applied where possible and tax incentives for enterprise formation should be applied particularly through budget support programmes; 38. Considers it crucial to involve women in economic activities in post-conflict societies in order to sup\u00ad port their socio-economic and business empowerment, and stresses the positive role played by micro-credit; 39. Strongly believes that local ownership of EU development cooperation can be strengthened through involvement of national parliaments, including mutual interaction and capacity building between the Euro\u00ad pean Parliament and the parliaments of partner countries; including Information and Communications Tech\u00ad nology support systems, technology capacities to create state-of-the-art voter rolls, the provision of ID cards where birth registrations and other citizenship supporting documents are unavailable; 40. Stresses the need to aid local authorities, providing suitable training and sharing experiences; recalls, in this connection, the European Parliament\u2019s commitment to the principles and practices of parliamentary democracy; 41. Stresses that, when elections are held in a post-conflict country, the participation of women should be supported through specific programmes and with quotas at all levels; 42. Stresses the importance of independent monitoring of transparency and accountability in the use of resources, which can play an important role in post-conflict situations if re-invested in state-building; also underlines the importance of fighting all forms of waste, fraud and corruption, through adequate anti-corrup\u00ad tion mechanisms, with the vigilant support of civil society; 43. Emphasises the need to move forward the implementation of the United Nations Convention against Corruption, to prevent sources of illicit finance from fuelling conflict and endangering the stabilisation of post- conflict situations, since corruption renders institutions ineffective, amplifies social marginalisation, distorts decision-making and disrupts the provision of basic services; 44. Underlines that support to local communities, families, civil society organisations, including women\u2019s organisations, micro-credit organisations and local networks are preconditions for any successful develop\u00ad ment policy; and therefore calls on the Commission and Member States to give political and financial support to local peace and human rights actors, including during times of crisis, particularly through the EU Stability Instrument and its Crisis Response component; 45. Stresses that, in post-conflict situations, registration of land titles and regularisation of land ownership needs to be carried out in accordance with international human rights law, to prevent governments, private companies or ruling elites from illegally appropriating land, often at the expense of the poorest and most vul\u00ad nerable, including returnees and IDPs; further stresses that efforts must be made to strengthen courts so they can better enforce property and commercial law, especially in countries where women have a diminished legal status or are denied basic property rights; ",

Reiterates its commitment to protecting the rights of women and children in post-conflict situations with the ultimate aim of taking the necessary measures for the empowerment of women \u2014 an indispensable requirement for the attainment of lasting peace and stability; 47. Considers that many developing countries possess the basic natural resources to take care of their devel\u00ad opment yet poor management of and corrupt practices related to natural resources such as oil, water, timber and diamonds can drive countries back to the conflict cycle; deplores the involvement of various (local, regional, international and transnational) actors in the misappropriation and exploitation of these resources; urges Member States to promote and support good governance of all natural resources as well as to take action against exploitation and trafficking, especially where it contributes to the outbreak, escalation or continuation of armed conflict; 48. Recognises the achievements of the Kimberley Process, the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative and Forest, Law Enforcement, Governance and Trade and calls for them to be strengthened and more effec\u00ad tively implemented and enforced; 49. Reiterates the conclusions of the paper on Climate Change and International Security, presented on 14 March 2008 to the European Council by the High Representative of the EU and the European Commis\u00ad sion ( 1 ) S113/08. ( 1 ), warning that climate change threatens to overburden states and regions of the world which are already fragile and conflict-prone, creating new immigration flows and intensifying security risks for the EU; urges the Commission to take climate change considerations into account in its peace-building efforts; 50. Considers that justice for victims of conflict is essential and that national courts, as long as the judicial system is functioning, independent and impartial, may be better placed than international war crimes tribu\u00ad nals to ensure ownership of national judicial processes and punishment of perpetrators; in this framework pro\u00ad poses, in post-conflict contexts, to explore the possibility of carrying out a mapping of past human rights violations perpetrated during the conflict; 51. Calls for the strengthening of judicial systems by training judges, general prosecutors, conferences on judicial reform, independent systems for judicial appointments, proper remuneration of judicial personnel, pro\u00ad vision of equipment for the courts, improved court administration, record keeping, budget and personnel man\u00ad agement and acquisition of modern technology including computers for case tracking; 52. Calls for legal aid for vulnerable groups, ethnic minorities, landless peasants and other marginalised groups, and paralegal training to increase access to the judicial system provided by experienced NGOs; 53. Considers it crucial to end the impunity of gender-based crimes of violence and to exclude these crimes, where feasib le, from amnesty provisions, and to ensure that all victims of sexual violence, particularly women and girls, have equal protection under the law and equal access to justice; given the situation of disadvantage that women and children in many societies have in accessing justice, considers that special arrangements should be made whenever necessary; 54. Emphasises the need for women who have suffered from sexual violence to be granted full access to sexual and reproductive health services and to sensitisation programmes which will support those women in tackling the stigmas they face; 55. Welcomes the adoption of UN Security Council resolution 1820, in particular its recognition that sexual violence is a threat to international peace and security; 56.

Commends the interaction between the EU and the International Criminal Court (ICC); stresses that EU support is essential for the enforcement of the ICC mandate; believes that it is vital that all states should sign and ratify the Rome Statute of the ICC in order to make the ICC system more operational, coherent and con\u00ad sistent; urges the EU and AU Member States to address the implementation of all warrants of arrest issued by the ICC in a consistent way immediately in all conflict situations; 58. Urges the Member States to continue the fight against impunity as the most effective means of prevent\u00ad ing future human rights abuses including by supporting the operation of internationally established tribunals; 59. Stresses that sustainable peace is in many ways contingent on community-based involvement and own\u00ad ership of the peace process \u2014 a process which can only be legitimate and succeed if women are equally involved in their important social function and their decisive role in food production and family welfare in developing countries in particular; bearing in mind that women and children account for 80 % of refugees, calls for particular support to be provided for women and for women to be recognised as having a vital role to play in promoting peace and stability, and stresses that the role of the international community in supporting civil society networks that link local, national, and international initiatives is crucial to the peace process; 60. Calls for the establishment of standing Peace Commissions that include influential members of all con\u00ad tending parties so as to pre-empt eruptions of large scale violence; 61. Believes that relevant civil society organisations can be used as facilitators for dialogue among conflict\u00ad ing groups when twinned with training in nonviolent conflict resolution and peace education; supports the creation of opportunities for dialogues by arranging national conferences, round table discussions between contending parties, small group contact meetings at grass roots level, mediation training for local NGOs and community elders, and leaders of traditional institutions; 62. Calls on Member States in pursuing development projects to first appoint a lead partner from among themselves to streamline reporting mechanisms (even if the funds for the project come from a different Mem\u00ad ber State) to achieve donor coordination and coherence; including the establishment of accounting standards for disclosure requirements in respect of national parliaments, local authorities and international organisations; 63. Considers that action should be taken to foster a greater female presence and participation in the media and all public forums enabling women to put their views across; 64. Recalls that birth registration is a fundamental human and citizenship right; stresses that birth registra\u00ad tion is of a crucial importance particularly during and in the aftermath of armed conflict as it helps to protect children against violation of their rights; and must be considered a core development issue; 65. Stresses the need for a conflict-sensitive approach throughout the entire cycle of planning, implement\u00ad ing, monitoring and evaluating of development programmes, in order to maximise their positive and mini\u00ad mise their negative impacts on the conflict dynamics; emphasises the importance of systematically carrying out conflict analysis and understanding the key drivers of conflicts; considers that the introduction of bench\u00ad marks is a useful tool in the evaluation of the impact of development cooperation actions; 66. Calls for the conflict zone\u2019s neighbouring states to be actively involved in the plan for post-conflict devel\u00ad opment and reconstruction, together with the international community; 67.

Intends to continue to take an active part in the work organised by the Commission as part of the follow-up to its abovementioned communication on the EU response to situations of fragility; draws the atten\u00ad tion of the Council and Commission to the fact that it is now urgent that this work, which has been too slow, might swiftly lead to concrete actions to be taken on the ground in such key areas as health and education, and calls on the Commission to keep the European Parliament fully informed of further steps undertaken with regard to the conclusions of country case studies and particularly in terms of the use of these findings for the identification and design of subsequent actions; 69.

This reporting will include information on the progress on the CCS demo plants deployment, progress of CCS technologies development, cost estimates and the development of CO 2 transport and storage infrastructure. Statement by the Commission on draft permit decisions and on draft decisions of transfer pursuant to Articles 10 paragraph 1 and 18 paragraph 2 of the Directive The Commission will publish all opinions on draft permit decisions pursuant to Article 10 paragraph 1 of the Directive, and on draft decisions of transfer pursuant to Article 18 paragraph 2. The published version of the opinions will, however, display no information whose confidentiality is warranted under the exceptions to public access to information under Regulations (EC) Nos 1049/2001 and (EC) 1367/2006 concerning respec\u00ad tively public access to European Parliament, Council and Commission documents (OJ L 145, 31.5.2001, p. 43) and the application of the provisions of the Aarhus Convention on Access to Information, Public Participation in Decision-making and Access to Justice in Environmental Matters to Community institutions and bodies (OJ L 264, 25.9.2006, p. 13). Statement by the Commission on whether carbon dioxide should be a named substance with suitable thresholds in a revised Seveso-Directive CO 2 is a common substance and currently not classified as dangerous. CO 2 transport and storage sites are therefore at the moment not included in Council Directive 96/82/EC of 9 December 1996 on the control of major-accident hazards involving dangerous substances (Seveso-Directive). On the basis of the Commission\u2019s preliminary analysis of the available information, for CO 2 transport, both empirical and modelled evidence for pipeline transport would seem to indicate that the risks presented are no higher than for pipeline transport of natural gas. The same would seem to be true for ship transport of CO 2 as compared with ship transport of liquefied natural gas or liquefied petroleum gas. The indications are also that the accident hazard posed by a CO 2 storage site, whether from rupture at injection or from post-injection leakage, is unlikely to be signifi\u00ad can t. However, the case for con sidering CO 2 as a named substance under the Seveso-Directive will be consid\u00ad ered in more detail when developing the proposed revision of the Directive, scheduled for late 2009/ early 2010. Should the assessment identify a relevant potential accident hazard, the Commission will make pro\u00ad posals to include CO 2 as a named substance with suitable thresholds in the revised Seveso-Directive. In that case, the Commission would also propose changes to Annex III to Directive 2004/35/EC of the European Par\u00ad liament and of the Council of 21 April 2004 on environmental liability with regard to the prevention and rem\u00ad edying of environmental damage (Environmental Liability Directive) as appropriate to ensure that all Seveso in stallations han dling supercritical CO 2 are covered under the Environmental Liability Directive.

        "C 45 E /138 EN Official Journ al of the E uropean Un ion 23.2.2010 Wednesday 17 December 2008 Statement by the Commission on mineral sequestration of CO 2 Mineral sequestration of CO 2 (the fixation of CO 2 in the form of inorganic carbonates) is a potential climate abatement technology which could in principle be used by the same categories of industrial installation as can use geological storage of CO 2 . However, it is at present still in the development stage. In addition to the energy penalty ( 1 ) \u2018Energy penalty\u2019 is the term used to express the fact that a plant applying CO 2 capture or mineralisation uses some of its energy for those processes, and so needs more energy than a plant of equivalent output without capture/mineralisation. ( 1 ) associated with capturing CO 2 , there is currently a substantial energy penalty associated with the mineral carbonation process itself, which will require to be addressed before commercial implementation can be envisaged. As with geological storage, the controls required to ensure the environmental safety of the tech\u00ad nology would also have to be established. These controls are likely to be substantially different from those for geological storage, given the fundamental differences between the technologies. In the light of these consid\u00ad erations, the Commission will follow closely the technical progress with mineral sequestration, with a view to developing an enabling legal framework to allow for environmentally-safe mineral sequestration and its rec\u00ad ognition under the Emissions Trading System, when the technology has reached an appropriate state of devel\u00ad opment. Given the interest in the technology among Member States and the pace of technological change, a first assessment is likely to be appropriate towards 2014, or earlier if circumstances warrant.

(5) The reconciliation of work and family life is also an essential element for achieving the objectives set by the European Union in the Lisbon strategy, particularly for increasing the rate of employment amongst women. The aim is not only to create a more satisfactory working environment, but also to respond better to workers\u2019 demands, in particular those with family responsibilities. A number of amendments contained in this Directive are intended to permit greater compatibility between work and family life. (6) In this context, the Member States should encourage the social partners to conclude agreements at the appropriate level for improving the reconciliation of work and family life. (7) It is necessary to strengthen the protection of the safety and health of workers in view of the challenge of new forms of organisation of working time, to introduce working-time models which provide oppor\u00ad tunities for life-long learning for workers , and also to strike a new balance between the reconciliation of work and family life on the one hand and more flexible organisation of working time on the other. (8) According to the case law of the Court of Justice of the European Communities, the characteristic feature of the concept of \u2018working time\u2019 is the requirement to be present at a place determined by the employer and available to the employer in order to be able to provide services immediately, as nec\u00ad essary.

        "23.2.2010 EN Official Journ al of the E uropean Un ion C 45 E /143 Wednesday 17 December 2008 (9) In circumstances where workers have not been afforded periods of rest, compensatory rest periods must be granted following periods of time spent on duty, in accordance with the relevant law, col\u00ad lective agreement or other agreement between the social partners. (10) The provisions on the reference period for maximum weekly working time must also be re-examined, with the objective of adapting them to the needs of employers and workers , subject to safeguards for the protection of the safety and health of workers . (11) Whenever the duration of the employment contract is less than one year, the reference period should not be longer than the duration of the employment contract. (12) The experience gained in the application of Article 22(1) of Directive 2003/88/EC shows that the purely individual final decision not to be bound by Article 6 thereof is problematic with regard to the pro\u00ad tection of the safety and health of workers and the freedom of choice of the worker. The derogation pro\u00ad vided for in that provision should, therefore, cease to apply. (13) It is important that where a worker has more than one employment contract, measures are taken to ensure that the worker\u2019s working time is defined as the sum of the periods of time worked under each of the contracts. (14) In accordance with Article 138(2) of the Treaty, the Commission consulted management and labour at Community level on the possible direction of Community action in this field. (15) Following that consultation, the Commission considered that Community action was advisable and fur\u00ad ther consulted management and labour on the content of the envisaged proposal, in accordance with Article 138(3) of the Treaty. (16) Following that second phase of consultation, management and labour at Community level did not inform the Commission of their wish to initiate the process which could lead to the conclusion of an agreement provided for in Article 139 of the Treaty. (17) Since the objective of this Directive, namely modernising Community legislation concerning the organi\u00ad sation of working time, cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States and can therefore be bet\u00ad ter achieved at Community level, the Community may adopt measures in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty. In accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in that Article, this Directive does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve that objective. (18) This Directive respects the fundamental rights and complies with the principles recognised by the Char\u00ad ter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union ( 1 ) OJ C 364, 18.12.2000, p. 1 . ( 1 ). In particular, it is designed to ensure full respect for the right to fair and just working conditions referred to in Article 31 of the Charter, and in particu\u00ad lar paragraph 2 thereof, which provides that \u2018every worker has the right to limitation of maximum working hours, to daily and weekly rest periods and to an annual period of paid leave\u2019.

( 2 ), Acting in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 251 of the Treaty ( 3 ) Position of the European Parliament of 17 December 2008. ( 3 ), Whereas: (1) The European Union is pursuing a policy to improve road safety with the objective of reducing fatalities, injuries and material damage. Consistent enforcement of sanctions for road traffic offences which are known to considerably jeopardise road safety is an important instrument for achieving this objective. (2) However, sanctions in the form of financial penalties for certain road traffic offences are often not enforced if they are committed with a vehicle which is registered in a Member State other than the Mem\u00ad ber State where the offence took place because of a lack of appropriate mechanisms. (3) In order to improve road safety throughout the European Union and to ensure equal treatment between resident and non-resident offenders, enforcement should be facilitated irrespective of the Member State in which the vehicle with which an offence has been committed is registered. To this end, a system of cross-border exchange of information should be put in place. (4) Such a system is of particular value in relation to road traffic offences detected by automated devices where the identity of the offender cannot immediately be established, such as speeding or failing to stop at a red traffic light. It is also useful in order to enable the follow-up of offences where verification of the vehicle registration details may be necessary, in the case where the vehicle has been stopped. This is nota\u00ad bly the case for drink driving. (5) The types of road traffic offences to be covered by this system should reflect their seriousness in terms of endangering road safety an d should cover offen ces which are qualified as traffic offen ces in the laws of all Member States. It is accordingly appropriate to make provision in relation to speeding, drink-driving, non-use of a seat-belt, and failing to stop at a red traffic light. The Commission will continue to monitor developments across the European Union in respect of other road traffic offences with serious implica\u00ad tions for road safety . Following the submission of a report on the implementation of this Directive two years after its entry into force, the Commission should, if appropriate , propose a revision of the Direc\u00ad tive regarding the possibility of extending its scope to include any other categories of road traffic infringements . (6) To guarantee a sufficient degree of road safety and to ensure that the financial penalties applicable are proportionate, the Commission should hold discussions with the Member States on the introduc\u00ad tion of harmonised fixed financial penalties for road traffic infringements and should also encourage the exchange of best practices between Member States. ",
        "23.2.2010 EN Official Journ al of the E uropean Un ion C 45 E /151 Wednesday 17 December 2008 (7) In order to ensure its effectiveness, the system of enforcement should cover the phases between the detec\u00ad tion of an offence and the sending of an offence notification, based on a standard model, to the holder of the registration certificate of the vehicle concerned. Once a final decision has been taken, Council Framework Decision 2005/214/JHA on the application of the principle of mutual recognition to finan\u00ad cial penalties ( 1 ) OJ L 76, 22.3.2005, p. 16. ( 1 ) of 24 February 2005 may apply. Where that Framework Decision cannot be applied, for example because sanction decisions do not fall within the scope of criminal law, the effectiveness of the sanctions should nevertheless be ensured by other sanction enforcement measures. A minimum standard ought to be introduced for offence notifications, including the reply form and by using more compatible methods of sending them so that cross-border enforcement becomes more reliable and more effective. (8) Further, the cross-border exchange of information should be carried out rapidly by electronic means. To this end, it is desirable that secure Community electronic networks be set up, enabling the exchange of information to be carried out in secure conditions and ensuring the confidentiality of the data transmitted . (9) Since the data relating to the identification of an offender is personal, Member States must take the mea\u00ad sures n ecessary to en sure that Directive 95/46/E C of the E uropean Parliamen t an d of the Coun cil of 24 October 1995 on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data ( 2 ) OJ L 281, 23.11.1995, p. 31. ( 2 ) is complied with. The offender should be informed accordingly, when notified of the offence, of his or her rights regarding access to, rectification of and deletion of data and of the maximum legal period for which the data can be kept. (10) Apart from the temporary nature of their storage, data collected under this Directive should not, under any circumstances, be used for purposes beyond what is required in order to follow up road safety offences. The Commission and the Member States should accordingly ensure that the processing of personal data and the management of the Community electronic network will serve to prevent any data collected from being used for purposes other than those specifically related to road safety. (11) As far as road safety controls are concerned, Member States should harmonise their methods so that their practices are comparable at EU level. Minimum standards on control practices should thus be developed in each Member State. (12) Technical equipment for road safety controls should also be harmonised in future in order to ensure the convergence of control measures between Member States. Technical harmonisation of this kind should be proposed by the Commission during the revision referred to in Article 14 . (13) The Commission and Member States should take whatever measures are necessary to inform, and raise the awareness of, EU citizens as regards the implementation of this Directive. Appropriate informa\u00ad tion on the consequences of a failure to comply with road safety rules may thus have a deterrent effect upstream on the commission of road traffic offences . (14) The Commission should focus in the future on facilitating cross-border enforcement of road traffic infringements, in particular those related to serious traffic accidents. ",

( 3 ); stresses that these political priorities, as finally expressed in its resolution of 23 October 2008 on the draft general budget of the European Union for the financial year 2009, Section III \u2014 Commission, were the guiding principles for its approach to the budgetary conciliation with Council for Budget 2009; 2. Welcomes the overall agreement on Budget 2009, reached in the traditional budgetary conciliation meet\u00ad ing with Council on 21 November 2008, especially with regard to the financing of the Food Facility; is extremely concerned, however, about the possible effects of a recession on European citizens and regrets, there\u00ad fore, that at the conciliation meeting, the Commission was reluctant to disclose any information on the pos\u00ad sible budgetary impact of its coming proposal on tackling the economic crisis; 3. Takes note of the Commission\u2019s Communication of 26 November 2008 to the European Council, entitled \u2018A European Economic Recovery Plan\u2019 (COM(2008)0800) and: \u2014 points out that this plan, if approved, will have a significant impact on Budget 2009 and requests the Com\u00ad mission to further clarify this impact by providing the European Parliament, as one arm of the budgetary authority, with further details on the scope of its proposal and concrete figures relating to its implemen\u00ad tation particularly in respect of the financial programming; \u2014 undertakes to analyse the related budgetary implications and reiterates the commitment of Parliament and of the Council, as stated at the conciliation meeting, to respond with the appropriate financial means to the current economic crisis; \u2014 invites the Commission and the European Investment Bank to report regularly on their activities to com\u00ad bat the economic crisis; 4. Expresses its strong willingness to enter into negotiations with the Council on the basis of the Commis\u00ad sion\u2019s proposal for a revision of the multi-annual financial framework (MFF) 2007-2013 for EUR 5 billion in the framework of the proposed European Economic Recovery Plan; takes note of the conclusions of the December 2008 European Council in that respect; 5. Insists that the current crisis not be used as a pretext to delay a much needed reorientation of spending towards \u2018green\u2019 investments, but should rather be used as an extra incentive to press ahead with such reorientation; ",
        "C 45 E /170 EN Official Journ al of the E uropean Un ion 23.2.2010 Thursday 18 December 2008 6. Reiterates, in this context, the importance of the budgetary review planned for 2009, which should not be limited to a theoretical vision what the budget could look like after 2013, but which should include bold proposals for a shift in programming at the time of the mid-term review of the multi-annual programmes to respond to the current crisis, taking into account the challenges posed by climate change; 7. Reiterates that initiatives for sustainable development, growth in jobs and support for SMEs and for research and innovation are of the utmost importance in the current economic situation and have to be top priorities reflected in the Union\u2019s budget for 2009; against this background, considers that the support for cohesion amongst regions has to be regarded as a key factor for stimulating economic growth throughout the Union; considers it essential that the political determination to make progress on tackling climate change and providing citizens with a safer Europe also become a budgetary priority, which must moreover be clearly vis\u00ad ible in the EU budget; stresses that, in 2009 and in the years to come, the Union has to be in a position to fulfil its role as a global player, especially given recent challenges such as rising food prices; 8. Supports Letter of amendment No 1 to the Preliminary draft budget (PDB) 2009, in particular as it seems to give a slightly more realistic picture of needs in heading 4 than the PDB; takes note of Letter of amendment No 2/2009 in its traditional aspects of updating the figures underlying the estimate of agricultural expenditure in the PDB; takes note of Letter of amendment No 3/2009 aiming at covering \u2014 within Council\u2019s budget \u2014 the cost (EUR 1,06 million) of the reflection group set up by the European Council on 15-16 October 2008; 9. In respect of overall figures, sets the final level of commitment appropriations at EUR 133 846 million, equivalent to 1,03 % of EU GNI; sets the overall level of payments at EUR 116 096 million, equivalent to 0,89 % of EU GNI; notes that this leaves a significant margin of EUR 7 762 million beneath the payments ceiling of the MFF for 2009; underlines the joint commitment of both arms of the budgetary authority to a prompt provision of additional payment appropriations, particularly in the event of structural policies being more quickly implemented during the budgetary year; 10. Can accept the level of payments agreed with Council as part of the overall package at the conciliation meeting of 21 November 2008, but nevertheless reiterates its growing serious concern about the low pay\u00ad ments and the subsequent disparity between the level of commitments and payments, which will reach an unprecedented extent in 2009; points out that there is some danger of future budgets becoming unrealistic if this development should not be halted; recalls that overall unpaid commitments (reste \u00e0 liquider \u2014 RAL) reached an amount of EUR 139 000 million already in 2007; 11. Points out that Preliminary draft amending budget (PDAB) 10/2008 (COM(2008)0693), adopted by the Commission on 31 October 2008, decreases payment appropriations in budget lines from headings 1a, 1b, 2, 3b and 4, totalling EUR 4 891,3 million; notes that, at the same time, the Commission\u2019s request for the global transfer for 2008 amoun ts to a total of E UR 631 million for paymen ts compared to E UR 426 million in the budgetary year 2007, and concerns 95 budget lines in 2008 compared to 65 budget lines in the global trans\u00ad fer for Budget 2007; is convinced that these manoeuvres in connection with payments in Budget 2008 will necessarily have effects on the level of payments needed in Budget 2009; 12. Attaches crucial importance, therefore, to the ready availability of higher payment appropriations through amending budgets, if those entered in Budget 2009 should prove insufficient, and highlights the com\u00ad mitments made in respect of this by the three institutions in the relevant joint declaration as agreed in the con\u00ad ciliation meeting; 13. Underlines the vital importance of effective budget implementation and of reducing unpaid commit\u00ad ments in light of this very modest overall level of payments; calls on the Commission and on Member States to do their utmost to implement, in particular, lines in heading 1b of the MFF, because this sub-heading not only finances numerous important policies and activities aimed at tackling climate change but also supports growth for jobs initiatives contributing to economic growth; stresses that improvement and simplification measures are needed in order to accelerate the implemen tation of structural an d cohesion fun ds an d in vites ",

Insists that the Commission take the appropriate measures both at political and administrative level to undertake a concrete follow-up to the joint declaration on implementation of cohesion policy, as adopted at the conciliation meeting on 21 November 2008; undertakes to evaluate before the end of March 2009 whether sufficient progress has been made; 15. Welcomes the agreement on the EUR 1 billion financing over three years for the Food Facility, reached in the conciliation meeting; notes that a share of EUR 420 million will be financed by fresh money via the flex\u00ad ibility instrument, while EUR 340 million will come from the Emergency Aid Reserve, partly through an amendment of Point 25 of the Interinstitutional Agreement of 17 May 2006 between the European Parlia\u00ad ment, the Council and the Commission on budgetary discipline and sound financial management (IIA); ack nowledges that the remaining EUR 240 million will be redeployed within heading 4 but expects the Com\u00ad mission to present a revised financial programme to ensure an orderly progression of the amounts planned up to 2013 despite this redeployment exercise and recalls the Commission\u2019s commitment to present to the bud\u00ad getary authority an assessment of the situation within heading 4, accompanied, if necessary, by relevant pro\u00ad posals, in the course of 2009, taking into account political evolution as well as budget execution; 16. Reiterates its conviction that climate change measures are still not satisfactorily included in the EU bud\u00ad get and will support all efforts to increase and concentrate adequate financial resources to boost European lead\u00ad ership in dealing with the consequences of climate change; repeats its first reading invitation to the Commission to present, by 15 March 2009, an ambitious plan to improve the budget capability to deal with climate change issues; would like to seriously reflect on whether the Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS) could not be considered as a potential resource at EU level in the future; 17. Emphasises that Budget 2009 reinforces the safety and security of EU citizens by bolstering related actions and policies which concern mainly competitiveness, small and medium enterprises (SMEs), transport and energy security as well as securing external borders; 18. Has taken note of the Commission\u2019s Letter of Executability regarding the amendments to the draft bud\u00ad get adopted by Parliament at first reading; considers it unacceptable that the Commission presented this docu\u00ad ment at such a late stage in the procedure, thus rendering it far less useful than it could have been; insists that several important political issues require appropriate visibility in the Union\u2019s budget; decides to create new bud\u00ad getary lines on climate change, on the Small Business Act (SBA), on the financial instrument for the adapta\u00ad tion of the fishing fleet to the economic consequences of fuel prices, on the EU Baltic Sea Strategy and on aid for rehabilitation and reconstruction of Georgia ; has decided to take some of the Commission\u2019s comments into account in the second reading of the budget; will, however, abide by its first reading decisions especially in those cases in which sufficient time and effort has already been spent at an earlier stage on assessing how Par\u00ad liament\u2019s amendments can best be implemented, as was the case with pilot projects and preparatory actions; 19. Welcomes the Commission\u2019s efforts to improve the presentation of its financial programming docu\u00ad ments and wishes to stress once more that, in future, it expects to see all modifications the Commission has made to its financial programming clearly reflected in the programming documents to be presented in accor\u00ad dance with Poin t 46 of the I IA; ",

Reminds the Member States of their obligations with regard to national management declarations under Point 44 of the IIA; reminds the Commission also of its responsibilities in that context, especially with regard to the political support it pledged to give to the initiative, but which has so far not materialised; 21. Reiterates that the reductions in the administrative expenditure lines of some multi-annual programmes that the budgetary authority has decided on for 2009 must under no circumstances lead to reductions in the overall co-decided envelopes of the programmes concerned; considers it clear that the Commission should compensate for the amounts reduced in later years of the programme period, preferably on the operational lines of the programmes; Specific issues European Institute of Innovation and Technology 22. Concerning the European Institute of Innovation and Technology (EIT), confirms its decision taken in Budget 2008 to include the EIT in the policy area \u2018Research\u2019 and to finance its governing structure, given its administrative nature, under heading 5 of the MFF; decides to change the nomenclature accordingly; School fruit scheme 23. Deplores the fact that, for the second consecutive year, the Council has rejected Parliament\u2019s proposal for an amendment concerning the creation of a new line 05 02 08 12 \u2014 School fruit scheme; welcomes, how\u00ad ever, the political agreement of the Council on the legal base for such a programme; expects the programme to start as soon as the legal base is adopted and in time for the 2009/2010 school year, as demanded by the European Parliament and agreed by the Council in its political agreement; regrets, therefore, that the Council did not accept the Commission\u2019s proposal to create already a token entry (\u2018p.m.\u2019) in the budget; Food programme for the most deprived persons in the European Union 24. Welcomes the financing proposed by the Commission and approved by the Council to improve the cur\u00ad rent food distribution programme for the most deprived persons in the Union by increasing the budget by two thirds to around E UR 500 million for 2009 an d exten ding the ran ge of products that can b e provided; Communication policy 25. Regrets the lack of consistency and coherence regularly evident in communication measures from the Commission; wishes for an adequate level of harmonisation in presentation of communication policy with the aim of developing one recognisable EU trademark to be used in all communication measures regardless of which Directorate-General of the Commission they come from; welcomes, in this context, the declaration on Communicating Europe in Partnership signed on 22 October 2008 by the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission; 26. Stresses that, in the context of this joint declaration, the European Parliament, the Council and the Com\u00ad mission have identified the information campaign for 2009 European elections as the top inter-institutional communication priority and urges, therefore, the Commission to fully cooperate on the 2009 European elec\u00ad tions campaig n, in cluding b y allocatin g the appropriate fin ancial resources to this in ter-institutional priority; ",

Expresses its regret that, once more, heading 4 has been under steady pressure since its available margins are not sufficient to finance priorities that have arisen in the course of the year without jeopardising its tradi\u00ad tional priorities; reiterates its concerns that the funds available in this heading do not, as they stand, allow the Union to assume its role as a global player despite its various declarations of intent and expects the ongoing mid-term review of the current MFF to provide additional resources for the growing commitments under head\u00ad ing 4; fears that the Union\u2019s credibility in third countries may be irreversibly altered for the worse if, year after year, the budgetary authority is not able to provide the adequate financing to its political commitments; 28. Notes with concern that appropriations for commitments for Palestine in 2009 will amount to EUR 300 million, which represents a decrease of 21 % compared to the level of funds committed in 2008 after transfers; is aware, therefore, that the Commission will likely present transfer requests in the course of 2009 to increase appropriations for Palestine, and reiterates its call for sound and realistic proposals during budgetary procedures in order to avoid, as much as possible, massive transfers between chapters; 29. Notes that appropriations for assistance to Kosovo will only just suffice to keep pace with reforms and investment; recalls its various commitments to EU assistance in Kosovo and at the same time stresses the need for a functioning public administration; insists on a proper follow-up of the conclusions of the final report from the ITF (Investigation Task Force, which closed down its operation at the end of August 2008), as well as on the creation of a successor organisation for combating fraud and financial irregularities; 30. Welcomes the fact that the Union has decided to contribute to the reconstruction process in Georgia and has committed its financial assistance accordingly with a pledge of up to EUR 500 million over 3 years, based on certain political conditions; recalls its intention to identify EU assistance to Georgia within the European Neighbourhood Partnership Instrument (ENPI) on a separate budget line and asks the Commission to provide it regularly with an overview of the funds committed under various instruments as parts of the total pledge; 31. Notes with satisfaction that the Union has committed itself to tackling soaring food prices in developing countries and that an agreement has finally been reached on the financing of a food facility and that comple\u00ad mentarity with the European Development Fund and visibility of EU assistance have been ensured; regrets, nev\u00ad ertheless, that once more, due to the constrained margins in heading 4, a part of the appropriations for financing this food facility could only be found through redeployment within the heading; 32. Takes note of the increasing amount of EU funds being channelled through international organisations; repeats its call for the Commission to make every effort to obtain as much information as possible on external and internal audits of institutions and programmes receiving EU funds; 33. Decides to maintain its first reading position as regards encouraging the economic development of the Turkish Cypriot community; welcomes the support for the exhumation, identification and return of remains of missing persons in Cyprus and undertakes to monitor its implementation; Heading 5 34. Decides to maintain a reduced amount of the Commission\u2019s administrative expenditure (heading 5) in reserve, notably in the areas of staff and building expenditure, pending the fulfilment of the conditions agreed; b elieves that, tak ing in to accoun t the Commission \u2019s g ood work to provide requested in formation so far, the overall volume of these reserves should be manageable from an operational point of view while, at the same time, ensuring the political focus to achieve the necessary results; 35. Restores fully its first reading position as regards the \u2018other institutions\u2019, including the decision to front\u00ad load some building expenditure to 2009; emphasises that this approach, although increasing some outlays in the n ear future, is clearly more econ omical for the tax-payer in the lon ger term; ",

Considers the final package of PP / PA adopted for 2009 to be well balanced and comprehensive and expects the Commission to implement the projects with the utmost care and dedication; expects not to be con\u00ad fronted with sudden obstacles to the implementation of the agreed PP / PA, given the excellent preparatory work that has already taken place within the Parliament and the Commission, but also between the two insti\u00ad tutions, since the presentation of the PDB in spring 2008; 41. Expects the Commission to also report on the implementation of those proposed PP / PA which have not been included in Budget 2009 as such because the activities proposed are understood to be covered by an existing legal base; is prepared to monitor closely the implementation of these projects and actions under their respective legal bases during the financial year 2009; Decentralised agencies 42. Maintains its first reading position as regards restoring the amounts proposed in the PDB for decentra\u00ad lised agencies; insists that those agencies depending to a large extent on revenue generated by fees should still be able to use the instrument of assigned revenues to give them the budgetary flexibility they need and decides to restore its first reading amendments to that end; 43. Decides to maintain the increase in the amounts for operational expenses of Frontex, in order to enable it to run permanent missions all year round; also decides to maintain the increase in the amounts for tackling illegal immigration, as well as for bolstering the European Refugee Fund to facilitate solidarity between Mem\u00ad bers States; ",

Decides to maintain in the reserve 10 % of the amounts for administrative expenses of European Food Safety Authority until it has been informed of the results of the \u2018Staff satisfaction survey\u2019 carried out in 2007 and of the measures taken to implement the conclusions of that survey, and until the responsible committee has given a clear signal in favour of releasing the reserve; 46. Has taken note of the large \u2014 nearly EUR 300 million \u2014 surplus of the Office for Harmonisation in the Internal Market in 2008; invites the Commission to reflect on how to deal with this situation and whether it might be appropriate for any excess income of the Office, being a direct consequence of the Internal Market, to flow back into the EU budget; 47.

The European Parliament, the Council and the Commission agree to the financing of the Food Facility in the fol\u00ad lowing way: \u2014 The total amount of EUR 1 billion available in commitments for the Food Facility will be shared out over the years as follows: EUR 262 million in 2008, EUR 568 million in 2009 and EUR 170 million in 2010. * * * \u2014 EUR 240 million in commitment appropriations will be redeployed within heading 4 from the Instru\u00ad ment for Stability (budget Article 19 06 01 01) of which EUR 70 million in 2009. Regarding the rede\u00ad ployments for 2010, the Commission is invited to present a revised financial programming in order to ensure an orderly progression of the amounts planned over the period 2010-2013, while keeping the annual level of the margin unchanged. The food prices crisis is a new and objective circumstance under the terms of Poin t 37 of the I nterinstitutional Ag reement (I IA) which justifies the redeploymen t from a non programmed crisis instrument. \u2014 EUR 420 million in commitment appropriations will be made available through the mobilisation of the Flexibility Instrument for the 2009 budget. \u2014 EUR 340 million in commitment appropriations will be made available through the Emergency Aid Reserve in the following manner: \u2014 EUR 22 million from appropriations still available in the 2008 budget; \u2014 EUR 78 million from the appropriations budgeted for the year 2009; \u2014 EUR 240 million through a one-off increase in the amount of the Emergency Aid Reserve to be bud\u00ad geted in 2008. * * * \u2014 The Commission will propose an amendment of the Interinstitutional Agreement on budgetary discipline and sound financial management (IIA) of 17 May 2006 as regards Point 25 to provide the additional fund\u00ad ing required for the proposed Food Facility. The one-off increase in the commitment appropriations for the Emergency Aid Reserve for the year 2008 will be formalised by a joint decision of the three institu\u00ad tions amending the IIA of 17 May 2006. \u2014 The budgetary authority will integrate the necessary amendments in the 2008 and 2009 budgets.

Coordination of Community assistance (Food Facility and EDF) \u2018 The European Parliament, the Council and the Commission reaffirm the importance of coherence and con\u00ad sistency in the area of development assistance, in particular regarding the use of funds. Taking into account that ACP-countries could benefit from EU assistance from both the general budget of the European Union and the European Development Fund, the three Institutions declare that, when implementing the Facility for rapid response to soaring prices in developing countries (hereinafter \u201cFood Facility\u201d), special attention should be paid to the coordination of aid originating from these various sources in order to maximise the synergy and the possible results. In this context, the concerned ACP-partner countries should also be encouraged to adapt, if necessary, the objectives and priorities of their programming regarding future cooperation under the EDF, ensuring consistency and complementarity with the objectives as foreseen by the Food Facility. The Commission is invited to present a list of programmes financed by the EDF which could include ele\u00ad men ts related to food security.\u2019 ",

Improving the visibility of Community assistance \u2018 The European Parliament and the Council stress that the visibility of Community assistance in third coun\u00ad tries is a legitimate concern for the European Union and should be fully taken into account for donor\u00ad ship in a multi-annual context. With a view to maintaining public and political support for the EU external action, they call on the Commission to present together with the PDB for the year 2010 a report with a list of initiatives taken to improve the visibility of EU external aid, without compromising its effi\u00ad ciency and effectiveness, especially when implemented through international organisations.\u2019 3. Implementation of the Cohesion policy \u2018Without prejudging the upcoming proposals from the Commission in the context of the economic downturn, the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission : \u2014 Recognise that, in view of the challenges posed by the current economic downturn, the economy may benefit from accelerating the implementation of structural and cohesion funds within the ceil\u00ad in gs of the agreed multiannual financial framework 2007-2013; \u2014 Recognise that, under the established control framework, interim payments cannot take place until management and control systems in Member States have been judged to be compliant with the requirements and, as concerns major projects, until such projects have been adopted by the Commission; \u2014 Encourage the Member states to submit the description of their management and control systems and the compliance assessments as soon as possible so as to allow the Commission to rapidly start their analysis. Within this framework, the European Parliament and the Council : \u2014 Invite the Commission to take the necessary measures, within the existing legal framework, to rap\u00ad idly assess the most critical aspects of the management and control systems (MCS), enabling starting the interim payments; \u2014 Invite the Commission to accelerate the examination of applications for major projects so as to facili\u00ad tate their start and related interim payments; \u2014 Invite the Commission to cooperate closely together with the Member States in order to have a rapid agreement of all aspects of compliance of the MCS; \u2014 Welcome the Commission\u2019s regular information to the budgetary authority through updated sum\u00ad mary tables on MCS and major projects; \u2014 Invite the Commission to submit a monthly report to the budgetary authority on the approval of the MCS and the major projects as well as the level of execution of interim payments for each Mem\u00ad ber State; \u2014 Invite the Commission to present a report on the implementation together with the PDB for the pur\u00ad pose of the b udgetary and discharge procedures; ",

The European Parliament acknowledges that structural improvements and simplification measures are needed to avoid recurrent under-implementation and to ensure that payment appropriations develop in an orderly manner compared to commitment appropriations, as recalled by the Court of Auditors reports.\u2019 4. Agencies \u2018 The European Parliament and the Council have agreed on the Commission proposal for the creation of an Inter institutional working group on agencies and ask for the first meeting to take place as soon as possible.\u2019 5. Payment appropriations \u2018 The European Parliament and the Council ask the Commission to submit an amending budget if the appro\u00ad priations entered in the 2009 budget are insufficient to cover expenditure under sub-Heading 1a (Com\u00ad petitiveness for growth and employment), sub-Heading 1b (Cohesion for growth and employment) as it could b e justified within the curren t leg al framework in the lig ht of a possib le acceleration of the imple\u00ad mentation of structural policies, Heading 2 (Preservation and management of natural resources) and Heading 4 (EU as a global partner). The European Parliament and the Council will consider in that context the appropriate financing of any possible proposal that the Commission could make for new initiatives, particularly regarding the eco\u00ad nomic crisis.\u2019 UNILATERAL DECLARATIONS A. European Parliament declarations 1. Evaluation of heading 4 \u2018 The European Parliament asks the Commission to present in the context of the budget review an evalua\u00ad tion of the situation of heading 4, in order to examine and to review the role of the EU as a global part\u00ad ner in a multiannual context.\u2019 2. Payments and implementation of the Cohesion policy \u2018 The European Parliament expresses its deepest concern as to the extremely low level of payments, far below the MFF, which does not correspond to the real challenges of the European Union in a situation of eco\u00ad nomic crisis. In particular, it expresses its deepest concern as to the unacceptable low level of implementation of the appropriations for the Cohesion policy, although this constitutes one of the fundamental policies of the European Union. Calls on the Commission, and the Members States, responsible for the implementation of these appro\u00ad priations, to adopt all measures possib le to en sure its adequate implementation . \u2019 ",
