        "\u25bc B THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES, Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1085/2006 of 17 July 2006 establishing an instrument for pre-accession assistance (IPA) ( 1 ) and in particular Article 3(3) thereof, Whereas: (1) The purpose of Regulation (EC) No 1085/2006 (hereinafter referred to as \u2018 the IPA Regulation \u2019 ) is to provide pre-accession assistance to beneficiary countries and support them in their tran- sition from Annex II to Annex I of that Regulation and through to membership of the European Union. (2) Given that the IPA Regulation is the sole pre-accession instrument for the 2007 to 2013 period, the rules for the programming and delivery of assistance within the framework of that Regulation should be streamlined and brought together in one single implementing regulation covering all five components established in the IPA Regulation (hereinafter referred to as \u2018 the IPA components \u2019 ). (3) To ensure coherence, coordination and efficiency, especially in the context of the action plan of the Commission towards an Integrated Internal Control Framework, common rules for the implementation of assistance under the IPA Regulation are required for all five IPA components. The specific features of the individual IPA components should nevertheless be taken into account. (4) Differences in the socio-economic, cultural and political contexts within beneficiary countries should also be taken into account, since such differences give rise to a need for a specific approach and differentiated support depending upon a country's status as candidate or potential candidate country, political and economic context, needs, and absorption and management capacities. (5) Assistance granted under the IPA Regulation should be in conformity with Community policies and actions in the field of external assistance. (6) Assistance should fall within the scope laid down in Article 2 of the IPA Regulation. It should be targeted to support a wide range of institution building measures in all beneficiary countries. It should strengthen democratic institutions and the rule of law, reform public administration, carry out economic reforms, respect human and minority rights, encourage gender equality and non-discrimination, promote civil rights and the development of civil society, support advanced regional cooperation and recon- ciliation and reconstruction, and contribute to sustainable devel- opment and poverty reduction, as well as to a high level of environmental protection in these countries. (7) Assistance for candidate countries should additionally focus on the adoption and implementation of the full acquis commu- nautaire , and compliance with the accession criteria; it should also help prepare candidate countries for the programming, management and implementation of the European Regional Development Fund, Cohesion Fund, European Social Fund and Rural Development that will be made available to them upon accession. (8) Assistance for potential candidate countries should promote a degree of alignment with the acquis communautaire and approximation with the Accession criteria, as well as operations of a similar nature to those which will be available for candidate 2007R0718 \u2014 EN \u2014 30.01.2010 \u2014 001.001 \u2014 4 ( 1 ) OJ L 210, 31.7.2006, p. 82. ",
        "\u25bc B countries under the IPA components concerning regional devel- opment, human resources development and rural development. (9) In order to guarantee consistency, complementarity and concen- tration of assistance, the coherence and coordination of actions carried out in a given country under the different IPA components should be ensured at the multi-annual planning level provided for by Article 6 of the IPA Regulation. (10) The Commission and the beneficiary countries should sign framework agreements in order to lay down the principles for their cooperation under this Regulation. (11) It needs to be made clear which of the management methods laid down in Council Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 1605/2002 of 25 June 2002 on the Financial Regulation applicable to the general budget of the European Communities ( 1 ) shall apply in relation to each of the components as provided for under the IPA Regulation. (12) In particular, as the IPA Regulation provides for assistance in the context of the pre-accession process, decentralised management of funds should be applied, where possible, in its implementation, with a view to enhancing ownership of the management of assistance by the beneficiary countries. It should, however, be possible to apply centralised, joint and shared management where appropriate. (13) In the event of decentralised management, the respective roles of and requirements from the Commission and the beneficiary countries need to be made clear. The provisions relating to the beneficiary countries should be included in the framework, sectoral or financing agreements. (14) It is necessary to lay down detailed rules for the financial management of funds under the IPA Regulation according to which management method is to be applied to the implementation of the assistance. The obligations of the beneficiary countries in this respect should be laid down in the framework, sectoral or financing agreements. (15) In addition to the general evaluation of the IPA Regulation as provided for in Article 22 thereof, assistance under the said regu- lation should be monitored and evaluated regularly. The programmes should in particular be subject to evaluation by specific monitoring committees, and the overall implementation of assistance under the IPA Regulation should be supervised on a regular basis. (16) The visibility of the IPA assistance programmes and their impact on the citizens of the beneficiary countries is essential to ensure public awareness of EU action and to create a consistent image of the measures concerned in all beneficiary countries, in line with the action plan of the Commission \u2018 Communicating Europe \u2019 , the white paper of the Commission on a European communication policy and the enlargement communication strategy for 2005 to 2009. (17) As the IPA Regulation applies from 1 January 2007, the Commission rules for the implementation of that Regulation should apply from 1 January 2007 as well. (18) The provisions laid down in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the IPA Committee, HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION: 2007R0718 \u2014 EN \u2014 30.01.2010 \u2014 001.001 \u2014 5 ( 1 ) OJ L 248, 16.09.2002, p. 1.

The selection of operations outside the eligible area as referred to under paragraph 1 shall be confirmed: (a) by the managing authority referred to in Article 102 for programmes or part of programmes implemented in shared management with Member States; (b) by the operating structures referred to in Article 28 for programmes or part of programmes implemented in beneficiary countries under decentralised management; (c) by the Commission for programmes or part of programmes imple- mented in beneficiary countries under centralised management. CHAPTER III Implementation S e c t i o n 1 G e n e r a l p r o v i s i o n s Article 98 Implementing modalities 1. For cross-border cooperation referred to under Article 86(1)(a), the programmes shall in principle be implemented through shared management with Member States by the authorities referred to in Article 102 bearing responsibility for the implementation of the cross-border programme in the participating Member States and bene- ficiary countries. To this end, the Member States and beneficiary countries participating in a cross-border programme must be able to implement the whole of the programme in the entire eligible territory according to the provisions referred to in Section 2 of this Chapter. Prior to the adoption of the cross-border programme in accordance with Article 91(6), the Commission may request from the participating countries any information it deems necessary to ascertain the capacity of the authorities referred to in Article 102 to comply with the obli- gations set under Section 2 of this Chapter. Where Member States and beneficiary countries participating in a cross-border programme are not yet ready to implement the entire programme according to these modalities, the transitional arrangements laid down in Article 99 shall apply. 2. For cross-border cooperation referred to under Article 86(1)(b), the programmes shall be implemented under centralised or decentralised management in accordance with Article 53 of Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 1605/2002, with respectively the Commission or the national authorising officer and the operating structures in each partici- pating country bearing responsibility for the implementation of the programme in the respective country. In this context, the cross-border programmes shall be implemented according to the provisions referred to in Section 3 of this Chapter. For cross-border cooperation referred to under Article 86(1)(b), for all beneficiary countries the objective shall be decentralised management. 2007R0718 \u2014 EN \u2014 30.01.2010 \u2014 001.001 \u2014 54 ",

The financing plan included in the cross-border programme referred to in the first subparagraph of Article 94(2) shall contain: (a) a table covering all participating Member States, and (b) a table for each of the participating beneficiary countries. 3. The part of the cross-border programme concerning the partici- pating Member States shall be implemented according to the provisions referred to in Section 2 of this Chapter. The part of the cross-border programme concerning the participating beneficiary countries shall be implemented according to the provisions referred to in Section 3 of this Chapter, with the exception of Article 142. The provisions concerning the joint monitoring committee of Article 110 shall apply. 4. The implementing provisions contained in the cross-border programme as referred to in Article 94(1)(h) shall differentiate between the modalities applying to participating Member States and those applying to participating beneficiary countries. 5. Following the selection of joint operations in accordance with the provisions of Article 95, the managing authority shall issue a grant to the lead beneficiary of the participating Member States. In the event of decentralised management, the operating structures in the participating beneficiary countries shall issue grants to the lead benefi- ciaries of their respective countries. In the event of centralised management, the Commission shall issue a grant to the lead beneficiary in each participating beneficiary country. Article 100 Termination of transitional arrangements 1. When the participating countries are ready to switch to implemen- tation through shared management in accordance with paragraph 1 of Article 98, they shall submit to the Commission a revised cross-border programme which shall include a single financing plan based on the multi-annual indicative financial framework for the following three years, together with a revised description of the management and control systems accompanied by a revised report and opinion in accordance with Article 117. The Commission shall re-examine the cross-border programme and appraise the documents submitted in accordance with Article 117. It shall decide whether to adopt a new decision amending the programme so that it may be implemented under the arrangements referred to in Article 98(1). 2. The budgetary commitments for the part of the programme concerning the participating beneficiary countries which were taken during the transitional arrangements shall continue to be implemented according to the provisions referred to in Article 99. 2007R0718 \u2014 EN \u2014 30.01.2010 \u2014 001.001 \u2014 55 ",

When a common system applies to several IPA cross-border programmes, the information referred to in point (i) may be grouped in a single report, and the opinion and declaration issued under point (ii) may cover all the cross-border programmes concerned; (d) submitting to the Commission at the latest by \u25ba M1 31 March \u25c4 of the fifth year following the last budgetary commitment a closure declaration assessing the validity of the application for payment of the final balance and the legality and regularity of the underlying transactions covered by the final statement of expenditure, which shall be supported by a final control report. This closure declaration shall be based on all the audit work carried out by or under the responsibility of the audit authority. 2. The audit authority shall ensure that the audit work takes account of internationally accepted audit standards. 3. Where the audits and controls referred to in paragraph 1 points (a) and (b) are carried out by a body other than the audit authority, the audit authority shall ensure that such bodies have the necessary func- tional independence. 4. If weaknesses in management or control systems or the level of irregular expenditure detected do not allow the provision of an unqua- lified opinion for the annual opinion referred to in paragraph 1 point (c) or in the closure declaration referred to in paragraph 1 point (d), the audit authority shall give the reasons and estimate the scale of the problem and its financial impact. Article 106 Audit trail For the purposes of the audits referred to in Article 105(1)(b), an audit trail shall be considered adequate where, for the cross-border programme concerned, it complies with the following criteria: (a) it permits the aggregate amounts certified to the Commission to be reconciled with the detailed accounting records and supporting documents held by the certifying authority, managing authority, intermediate bodies and lead beneficiaries as regards operations co-financed under the cross-border programme; (b) it permits verification of payment of the public contribution to the lead beneficiary and each final beneficiary; (c) it permits verification of application of the selection criteria estab- lished by the joint monitoring committee for the cross-border programme; (d) it contains, in respect of each operation, the technical specifications and financing plan, documents concerning the grant approval, documents relating to public procurement procedures, progress reports and reports on verifications and audits carried out. 2007R0718 \u2014 EN \u2014 30.01.2010 \u2014 001.001 \u2014 60 ",

The audits referred to in Article 105(1)(b) shall be carried out each twelve-month period from 1 July of the year following the adoption of the cross-border programme on a sample of operations selected by a method established or approved by the audit authority in agreement with the Commission. The audits shall be carried out on the spot on the basis of documen- tation and records held by the final beneficiary. The participating countries shall ensure the appropriate repartition of those audits over the implementation period. 2. The audits shall verify that the following conditions are fulfilled: (a) the operation meets the selection criteria for the cross-border programme and has been implemented in accordance with the approval decision and fulfils any applicable conditions concerning its functionality and use or the objectives to be attained; (b) the expenditure declared corresponds to the accounting records and supporting documents held by the final beneficiary; (c) the expenditure declared by the final beneficiary is in compliance with Community and national rules; (d) the public contribution has been paid to the final beneficiary in accordance with Article 40(9). 3.

The necessary preventive and corrective action shall be taken by the relevant authorities. 4. No less than 5 % of the total expenditure declared by lead bene- ficiaries and certified to the Commission in the final statement of expen- diture shall be audited in accordance with paragraph 2 before the closure of a cross-border programme. Article 108 Control system 1. In order to validate the expenditure, each participating country shall set up a control system making it possible to verify the delivery of the products and services co-financed, the soundness of the expen- diture declared for operations or parts of operations implemented on its territory, and the compliance of such expenditure and of related operations, or parts of those operations, with Community, when relevant, and its national rules. For this purpose each participating country shall designate the controllers responsible for verifying the legality and regularity of the expenditure declared by each final beneficiary participating in the operation. Participating countries may decide to designate a single controller for the whole programme area. Where the verification of the delivery of the products and services co-financed can be carried out only in respect of the entire operation, such verification shall be performed by the controller of the partici- pating country where the lead beneficiary is located or by the managing authority. \u25bc M1 2. Each participating country shall ensure that the expenditure can be validated by the controllers within a period of three months from the date of its submission by the final beneficiary to the controllers. 2007R0718 \u2014 EN \u2014 30.01.2010 \u2014 001.001 \u2014 61 ",
