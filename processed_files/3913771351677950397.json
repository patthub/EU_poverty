        "1 I n n o v a t i o n U n i o n p r o g r e s s a t c o u n t r y l e v e l : N o r w a y Summary: Performance in research and innovation The indicators in the table below present a synthesis of research and innovation (R&I) performance in Norway. They relate knowledge investment and input to performance and economic output throughout the innovation cycle. They show thematic strengths in key technologies and also the high-tech and medium-tech contribution to the trade balance. The indicator on excellence in science and technology takes into consideration the quality of scientific production as well as technological development. The Innovation Output Indicator covers technological innovation, skills in knowledge-intensive activities, the competitiveness of knowledge-intensive goods and services, and the innovativeness of fast-growing enterprises, focusing on innovation output. The indicator on knowledge-intensity of the economy focuses on the economy\u2019s sectoral composition and specialisation and shows the evolution of the weight of knowledge-intensive sectors and products. Norway The challenge of structural change towards a more diversified economy Norway has the second highest GDP per capita in Europe. This partly explains the low R&D intensity level, which was only 1.65 % in 2012, well below the EU average (2.07 %). Nevertheless, Norway maintains one of the highest spending levels on R&D per capita. The country\u2019s R&D intensity fluctuated slightly over the period 2007-2012, reaching a high of 1.76 % in 2009 but remaining almost stable between 2010 and 2012, with an average annual growth rate of 0.7 %. To a large extent the Norwegian economy is based on traditional industrial activities related to the extraction of raw materials and natural resources (i.e. oil and natural gas, fish, minerals) and to their industrial processing into bulk products and semi-finished goods. High shares of public R&D financing have been allocated to these activities to improve their efficiency. However, a forward-looking distribution of R&D investments should be considered in order to reduce Norway\u2019s dependence on raw materials and facilitate a gradual change towards a more diversified economy. The knowledge-intensity of the Norwegian economy remains below the EU average although it has been growing at a faster rate in recent years (+2.4 % instead of +1.0 % at the European level). Internationalisation has become an overall priority of the government\u2019s R&I policy in recent years in order to improve the quality of research. The new White Paper on research entitled \u2018Long-term perspectives \u2013 Knowledge provides opportunity\u2019, which was presented in March 2013, states that Norway should commit to strengthening the internationalisation of its research system. Following this line, it has been requested that all activities of the Research Council of Norway (RCN) include clearly defined objectives and plans for international cooperation. Moreover, in terms of funding, there has been a shift from instruments dedicated to internationalisation towards including the internationalisation dimension in all activities. The Norwegian system also shows a high level of S&T excellence (67.6 in 2012 compared to an EU average of 47.8), which is expected to increase further in the following years, thanks to its significant growth rate (+15.7 % between 2007 and 2012). 1 Composite indicator that includes PCT per population, ERC grants per public R&D, top universities and research institutes per GERD and highly cited publications per total publications. 2 Composite indicator that includes R&D, skills, sectoral specialisation, international specialisation and internationalisation sub-indicators.

        "2 R e s e a r c h a n d I n n o v a t i o n p e r f o r m a n c e i n t h e E U Investing in knowledge Norway\u2019s R&D intensity was 1.65 % in 2012, which is still a long way from the EU average. This is partly due to the particular nature of the Norwegian economy \u2013 which is characterised by traditional industrial activities related to the extraction and processing of natural resources \u2013 and partly to its high level of GDP. Nevertheless, following its election in October 2013, the new government has committed to achieving a 3 % target by 2030. While in 2012 Norway\u2019s public R&D intensity was slightly higher than the EU average (0.79 % vs. 0.74 %), the 0.87 % business R&D intensity was much lower than the EU value of 1.31 %, and a long way below the level of the other Nordic countries. However, it is important to mention that the BERD value does not include any form of indirect support, such as tax credits, which is still the largest R&D support scheme for business in Norway. In recent years, Norwegian policy- makers have increasingly recognised that the low level of industrial R&D should be seen against the backdrop of the country\u2019s industrial structure, and the new government has already declared its intention to put more emphasis on stimulating R&D investments in the private sector. The EU\u2019s Seventh Framework Programme is the most important international research programme in which Norway participates. Norwegian institutions and researchers have been participating in EU FPs since 1987. The success rate of Norwegian participants in FP7 is 24.49 %, which means that one in four applicants eventually receives funding. To date, the successful participants have received a total EU financial contribution of EUR 675 million.

        "3 I n n o v a t i o n U n i o n p r o g r e s s a t c o u n t r y l e v e l : N o r w a y Norway\u2019s main strengths are its human resources, public-private cooperation, and the attractiveness of its research system. Although the share of new graduates in science and engineering is lower than the EU average, Norway has a very high number of full-time researchers in the labour force and a strong dynamic of new doctoral graduates. At the same time, it is among the OECD countries with the highest education level, revealing a wide range of employees with higher-education qualifications in both the public and private sectors. Furthermore, the Norwegian higher education system is considered attractive by foreign doctoral students, with numbers continuing to rise since 2000 (+9.6 % annual growth). As regards public-private collaboration, the number of co-publications is much higher in Norway than in other European countries.

While both the BERD intensity and the number of PCT patent applications have increased slightly in recent years, the share of SMEs introducing marketing/ organisational or product/process innovation has decreased even further. A variety of measures targetting SMEs exist in Norway, such as the Skattefunn and the BIA schemes. The first is a tax- credit scheme aiming to leverage R&D activities in businesses, whereas the second one is a funding scheme for business innovative projects without any thematic restriction. Norwegian authorities have also tried to simplify rules and reduce the administrative burden on SMEs in a wide range of fields, such as competition, tax and auditing. ",
        "4 R e s e a r c h a n d I n n o v a t i o n p e r f o r m a n c e i n t h e E U Norway\u2019s scientific and technological strengths The graph below illustrates the areas, based on the Framework Programme thematic priorities, where Norway shows scientific and technological specialisations 3 . Both the specialisation index (SI, based on the number of publications) and the revealed technological advantage (RTA, based on the number of patents) measure the country\u2019s scientific (SI) and technological (RTA) capacity compared to the one existing at the world level. For each specialisation field it provides information on the growth rate in the number of publications and patents. 3 Please note that Norway only became an EPO member state in 2008. The annual report on the condition and evolution of Norway\u2019s higher-education sector published in May 2013 shows that the number of scientific publications has registered a 60 % increase since 2003. Norwegian S&T activities present substantial scientific specialisations in almost all FP7 thematic priorities, the only exceptions being aeronautics, nanotechnologies, materials, new product technologies, and biotechnologies. This scientific activity follows the country\u2019s R&D policy priorities closely. At the same time, Norway\u2019s technology production is quite well in line with the scientific specialisation patterns, showing relative strengths in patenting in many sectors, such as other transport technologies, construction technologies, energy, food, agriculture and fisheries, and environment. This alignment between scientific publications and revealed technology advantages reflects smooth knowledge transfer between academia and private companies, although the level of Norwegian patenting remains below the EU average for both PCT and European Patent Office applications. 06 17 2345 Source: DG Research and Innovation \u2013 Unit for the Analysis and Monitoring of National Research Policies Data: Science-Metrix Canada; Bocconi University, Italy Notes: ( 1 ) Values over 1 show specialisation; values under 1 show a lack of specialisation.

In almost all sectors, the scientific impact of publications is above the world level, with the exception of nanotechnology and security. As in almost all countries, the health bubble dominates strongly. Since the mid-1990s, Norway has seen the most significant rise in scientific impact, and today the proportion of highly cited Norwegian scientific publications is greater than the EU average. Innovation Output Indicator The Innovation Output Indicator, launched by the European Commission in 2013, was developed at the request of the European Council to benchmark national innovation policies and to monitor the EU\u2019s performance against its main trading partners. It measures the extent to which ideas stemming from innovative sectors are capable of reaching the market, providing better jobs and making Europe more competitive. The indicator on innovation focuses on four policy axes: growth via technology \u2013 (patents); jobs (knowledge-intensive employment); long-term global competitiveness (trade in mid/high-tech commodities); and future business opportunities (jobs in innovative fast-growing firms).

        "6 R e s e a r c h a n d I n n o v a t i o n p e r f o r m a n c e i n t h e E U Norway is a medium-low performer in the European innovation indicator. This is mainly due to a very low performance in the export share of medium-/high- tech goods. All other areas are almost in line with or above the EU average, and Norway\u2019s performance is improving slightly. With mineral fuels (oil, natural gas) representing two-thirds of exports, and fish representing another 6 %, the share of medium-/high-tech goods in total good exports is relatively low in Norway (at the lowest position in Europe). Norway performs better (i.e. slightly above the EU average) in knowledge- intensive services exports, mainly as a result of its maritime freight transport sector. The country performs below EU average in the innovativeness of fast-growing firms because of high shares of employment in the mining and quarrying, and construction sectors. However, the share of employment in knowledge-intensive activities is well above the EU average, showing that the quality of Norway\u2019s human capital remains one of its greatest strengths. The production in services accounts for around 76 % of employment (man hours) and 52 % of value added in the Norwegian economy (2010). The construction sector is not included in the figures. The share of services in total value added is lower in Norway compared to many other advanced economies, mainly as the result of a dominant oil sector in the country. In its Review of Innovation Policy in Norway (OECD, 2008) the OECD notes that \u201cNon-R&D based innovation, for instance in the service sector, seems to underlie the exceptional productivity performance of the private service sector\u201d. Innovation Norway and the Research Council of Norway manage several schemes and instruments promoting innovation. Policies aiming to strengthen the framework conditions for innovation and targeted programmes aiming to enhance innovation in enterprises are open to all industry sectors, but there are no schemes exclusively for service innovation. 2012 2010 EU EU EU EU EU EU 75.0 100.0 25.0 50.0 0.0 GOOD SERV Source: DG Research and Innovation \u2013 Unit for the Analysis and Monitoring of National Research Policies Data: Eurostat, OECD, Innovation Union Scoreboard 2014, DG JRC Notes: All data refer to 2012 except PCT data, which refer to 2010.

Very few sectors have significantly increased their R&D intensities (i.e. paper and paper products, fabricated metal products, other non-metallic mineral products, wood and cork, electricity, gas and water), and manufacturing in general has continued to lose its weight in the overall economy. Most of the sectors are grouped near the intersection point of the axes, meaning that small variations in levels of R&D intensity are usually accompanied by small or no variations in shares of value added. In this context, the paper and paper products sector represents a negative exception as its business R&D intensity registered a significant increase (+51.8 %) while the share of value added decreased drastically (- 29.3 %). In recent years, R&D policies and innovation strategies have focused on specific and representative areas of Norway\u2019s economy. These include the strategies for oil and gas, energy, climate, green growth, biotechnologies, nanotechnologies, and the maritime sector.
