        "Welcome to n\u00b047 The European Union is sitting on a goldmine: sixty years of accumulated experience and achievements in investing in people, Europe\u2019s greatest asset. Thanks to the intuition of the \u201cfounding fathers\u201d of the European Economic Community who, back in 1957 ensured that the EEC would be endowed from day one with a European Social Fund (ESF) - A strategic asset in the face of today\u2019s challenges: globalisation, digitalisation and population ageing. Over time, the ESF has grown into a more sophisticated financial instrument, managed in partnership alongside other EU Funds that have been created since. However, its rationale has not changed. More than ever, human capital investment is a strategic priority, a pre-condition for ensuring a smart, sustainable and inclusive growth for Europe. Investing in people requires a special set of skills: an approach combining customisation for each individual with strategic, systemic and accountable funding; an approach associating psychology, sociology, economics, accountancy and many other subject areas. Human capital investment also requires extensive macro- and micro-monitoring, something which is still new in the field of social and employment policy for many EU countries. And it requires perseverance and sense of purpose, as results are not always visible at first sight. The fact that the ESF was one of the first European Fund to be created is therefore an incredible asset. It has allowed the EU and its Member States to accumulate a wealth of experience in the most demanding of all investment areas. And today, when the walls are falling down between education, employment, social and economic policies, to name only those few, the EU can rely on this goldmine to inspire and design the kind of multi-dimensional policies that we need to address the challenges of the coming years \u2013 taking people as the starting point, as the EU has been doing since its inception through the ESF.

        "NEWS IN BRIEF The way forward: The Social Pillar should serve as a compass for renewed convergence within the euro area. The European Pillar of Social Rights: A consolidated version 23 January 2017 The Commission held a European conference on the Pillar of Social Rights on 23 January 2017, in Brussels. It was an important milestone in wrapping up a consultation launched in March 2016 and defi ning the future direction of the European Pillar of Social Rights. A consolidated version of the European Pillar of Social Rights should be presented in 2017. Once adopted, the Pillar should become a reference framework to screen employment and social performance of participating Member States and to drive reforms at national level. More specifi cally, it should also serve as a compass for renewed convergence within the euro area (see page 6). Revision of social security coordination rules: Fairness 13 December 2016 On 13 December 2016, the European Commission presented a revision of the EU legislation on social security coordination within the European Union, which ensures that mobile citizens do not lose their social protection when moving to another EU Member State. The rules exist since 1959 and are regularly modernised to ensure that they are fi t-for-purpose and respond to the social and economic reality in the EU. The new proposal is part of the Commission\u2019s eff orts to facilitate labour mobility, ensure fairness for those who move and for taxpayers, and provide better tools for cooperation between Member State authorities. First European Vocational Skills Week: A success 5-9 December 2016 From 5 to 9 December 2016, the European Commission organised a fi rst European Vocational Skills Week to inspire people to discover, use and improve their talents and abilities through vocational training. It was one of the ten key actions proposed by the Commission under the New Skills Agenda for Europe, presented in June 2016. An estimated 702 250 people took part in more than 900 activities across Europe. The closing ceremony gathered some 600 participants from Vocational Education and Training, business, social partners, chambers of commerce, civil society, think tanks, research bodies and public authorities. \u00a9 B e l g a i m a g e \u00a9 E u r o p e a n U n i o n Using her talent: 702 250 people took part in more than 900 activities across Europe during the fi rst EU Vocational Skills Week. 4 / SOCIAL AGENDA / APRIL 2017 ",
        "Health and safety of workers: A new initiative 10 January 2017 On 10 January, the European Commission took action to promote Occupational Safety and Health (OSH) in the EU. Its new initiative aimed to better protect workers against work-related cancer, to help businesses, in particular SMEs and micro- enterprises, in their eff orts to comply with the existing legislative framework, and to put a bigger focus on results and less on paperwork. On 13 May 2016, it proposed measures to reduce exposure of European workers to 13 cancer-causing chemicals, by proposing changes to the Carcinogens and Mutagens Directive (2004/37/EC). On 10 January 2017, it put forward a second proposal to address exposure to seven more priority chemicals. The Commission will keep looking into other carcinogens to continue protecting workers and improving business conditions across the EU. Working conditions in the fi shing sector: a new Directive 19 December 2016 On 19 December 2016, the EU Council of Ministers adopted a Directive improving the working conditions in the fi shing sector. In 2013, the EU social partners in the fi shing sector reached an agreement, which proposed to align EU law with the \"Work in Fishing\" Convention 2007 of the International Labour Organisation (ILO). On 29 April 2016, the European Commission adopted a proposal translating the agreement into a Directive. It includes minimum requirements for: Work on board (e.g. minimum age, medical certifi cate, information in the employment contract); conditions of service (working time limits, right of repatriation); accommodation and food; and occupational safety and health protection, including medical treatment on board and ashore. European Disability Strategy: Achievements so far 2 February 2017 On 2 February, the European Commission presented its Progress Report on the implementation of the European Disability Strategy 2010-2020. The Strategy is the main instrument to support the EU\u2019s implementation of the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. On 29 November, the Commission celebrated the Day of Persons with Disabilities together with the European Disability Forum. It rewarded the British city Chester for enhancing accessibility in its city life. Chester was chosen out of 43 cities from 21 EU countries, because of its inclusive measures for people with a disability, in particular in the tourism sector. \u00a9 B e l g a i m a g e \u00a9 B e l g a i m a g e \u00a9 B e l g a i m a g e Minimum requirements: EU law is now aligned with the \"Work in Fishing\" International Labour Organisation Convention 2007.

        "SOCIAL RIGHTS Gender equality: equal opportunities was one of the main headings of the Social Pillar outline proposed by the European Commission in March 2016. The European Pillar is taking shape Meeting the challenges of the 21st century requires working out the practicalities of a highly competitive social market economy From one step to the next, momentum is building up for the delivery of a European Pillar of Social Rights, called for by European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker in September 2015: a set of principles which would provide EU countries with a compass to screen and orient their employment and social policies. On 8 March 2016, the Commission published an outline of such a Pillar, covering 20 areas under 3 main headings: equal opportunities and access to the labour market; fair working conditions; and adequate and sustainable social protection and access to high quality essential services. Until the end of 2016, it consulted the stakeholders at EU, national, regional and sometimes even local level. It received 200 position papers, as well as 16 500 replies to its on-line consultation. High-level event This consultation process came to a head on 23 January 2017 with a high-level conference which brought together in Brussels 600 representatives of Member States, EU institutions, social partners and civil society representatives, including 25 national ministers. In a series of workshops, they tackled issues such as turning new economic developments into decent job opportunities, bringing more people into work, ensuring income levels that cater for quality of life, ensuring that all people have access to social protection, safeguarding rights, securing transitions at critical junctures in life and strengthening convergence between Member States, especially in the Eurozone. In spring, the Commission will put forward a social package. It will consist of a policy document containing the principles of the European Pillar of Social Rights, and of an operational part in the form of a series of specific initiatives addressing issues of direct relevance to the Pillar: work-life balance, access to social protection, the implementation of the Working Time Directive of 2003 and a revision of the Written Statement Directive of 1991, establishing the employers\u2019 obligation to inform employees of the conditions applicable to the contract or employment relationship. Other proposals linked to the Social Pillar will be adopted in the months and years to come. \u00a9 B e l g a i m a g e 6 / SOCIAL AGENDA / APRIL 2017 ",
        "SOCIAL AGENDA / APRIL 2017 / 7 Making a point: a genuine community of national authorities, EU institutions and stakeholders is emerging in an atmosphere of intense debate. On 17 November, Jean-Claude Juncker, together with Swedish Prime Minister Stefan L\u00f6fven, will host a \"Social Summit for fair jobs and growth\" with Heads of State and governments in G\u00f6thenburg. A community From Brussels to G\u00f6thenburg, a genuine community of national authorities, EU institutions and stakeholders is emerging in an atmosphere of intense debate. At the 23 January conference, ministers participated actively in the workshops, including in an informal capacity. There were sometimes four or five ministers per workshop. At the time of printing, there was consensus within this community on the fact that the current social and employment situation of the EU needs to be improved - dramatically so, in some parts of the Union - in terms of youth unemployment, long- term unemployment, skill levels and poverty risk in particular. There was also wide agreement \u2013 but no consensus yet - on the fact that social inequality is a brake on economic growth. Progress on both should go hand in hand. Everybody agrees on the ultimate objective of the Social Pillar: helping the EU Member States ensure that labour markets and social protection systems are fit for the challenges of the 21st century, whatever their starting points. How best to get there and, in particular, how to articulate companies\u2019 competitiveness with social investment (investing in people): This is the heart of the debate. Social market The answer is in the EU Treaty, European Commissioner Marianne Thyssen indicated in her opening address to the 23 January conference. The Treaty states that \"the Union shall work for the sustainable development of Europe based on balanced economic growth and price stability, a highly competitive social market economy, aiming at full employment and social progress\". \"This is the essence of the society we want\", the Commissioner stressed, \"where increased competitiveness goes hand in hand with social progress. This is the leitmotif of the Pillar. We need to make sure that our legislation and our policies are still fit for purpose for the reality of today and tomorrow. Fit for purpose means living up to the core set of principles which we agree are at the core of the social market economy\". \u00a9 B e l g a i m a g e More information: http://ec.europa.eu/social/main.jsp?catId=1226&langId=en A fair labour market On 9 September 2015, European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker announced in his State of the Union speech that he wanted \"to step up the work for a fair and truly pan-European labour market (\u2026) I will want to develop a European Pillar of Social Rights, which takes account of the changing realities of Europe\u2019s societies and the world of work\". The Pillar should build on, and complement, the EU social \"acquis\" (the body of social rules that exist in EU legislation today, in areas such as health and safety, working conditions, the fight against discrimination in employment and occupation\u2026) in order to guide policies in a number of areas which are essential for well-functioning and fair labour markets and welfare systems. The principles proposed would not replace existing rights but offer a way to assess and, in the future, approximate for the better the performance of national employment and social policies. ",
        "EMPLOYMENT, SOCIAL AFFAIRS, SKILLS AND LABOUR MOBILITY Marianne Thyssen - making the social dimension more explicit to people From the Rome Treaty anniversary to the adoption of the European Pillar of Social Rights, the European Commissioner explains in what state of mind she is tackling the second half of her mandate European unity: \u201cTogether, we are in a better position to decide on standards and accompany change\u201d. Is the 60th anniversary of the Treaty of Rome, which created the European Economic Community in March 1957, an occasion to turn a crisis into an opportunity? \"Never waste a good crisis\", as the saying goes. But I say: \"Never waste a good anniversary\", to reflect and resettle your thoughts! Let\u2019s be honest: If we look at the problems we are facing today, they are about the a(cid:3)ermath of the crisis, globalisation, population ageing and digitalisation which is a kind of fourth industrial revolution. These are challenges we have in common in Europe and they are far-reaching. It makes people wonder whether they will still be able to live and work according to their values and whether they will have a say at all! This kind of challenge cannot be met by one country alone. We are stronger if we deal with this together. EU Member States have a lot in common \u2013 starting with our social market economy, to name but one. We will only be able to defend our values if we speak with a common voice. Together, we are in a better position to decide on standards and accompany change, instead of undergoing it passively. People understand that, including in other policy areas like security and defence. The Treaty of Rome has some strong social policy components\u2026 Yes like article 119 on gender equality, I know it by heart! This is an area where we received a lot of help from the EU Court of Justice, which gave good interpretations of EU laws. And look at the European Social Fund (ESF) and the kind of actions it supports (see page 14 onwards)! And our legislation to protect workers, we have some of the highest occupational health and safety standards in the world! And there is the social policy Open Method of Coordination: time and again, Member States, \u00a9 E u r o p e a n U n i o n 8 / SOCIAL AGENDA / APRIL 2017 ",
        "New industrial revolution: \"The problems we are facing are about the a(cid:3)ermath of the crisis, globalisation, population ageing and digitalisation which is a kind of fourth industrial revolution\". social partners and labour market institutions like the Public Employment Services tell me how much it is helping them. So we are really supporting social policy developments in the EU countries. Even if, in the end, they make their own choices, they have huge expectations. So it is also the 60th anniversary of the European Social Fund. What is lying in store for it beyond 2020? Reflection is on-going but more result-oriented spending is a must for EU funds. We are talking about taxpayers\u2019 money. It has to be used in the most efficient and effective way possible. If we want to regain citizens\u2019 trust, our policies must show results and citizens must perceive them as such. Simplification is also crucial, so that people who use our funds face less administrative burden. We are looking at ways of doing so. The ESF is already showing how fast we can go with disseminating simplified cost options (see Social Agenda n\u00b042) but we have to go even further. And then there is the fundamental question of human investment: If we look at the changes that are going on and the challenges we are facing, the first thing to do is make sure that people have the right skills. Investing in human capital is the best thing we can do. It must stay on top of our agenda. I do hope that we will keep the ESF as such and not merge it with other funds into one big pot, because investing in people is not the same as investing in infrastructures. Working with people requires a different approach. It involves funding numerous smaller projects. So, I will make sure that we keep our Fund, as result-oriented and as simplified as possible. The ESF is being called upon to implement the Youth Guarantee, the pathway for the long-term unemployed, the New Skills Agenda for Europe and the integration of third-country nationals, including asylum-seekers and refugees, in a more systemic and strategic way but also in a very targeted and customised approach\u2026 This is necessary to help the Member States implement the European Semester country-specific recommendations. The ESF must be used strategically. It\u2019s not just money that you can use for \"nice\" projects. We have enough challenges to address and we know that we have to invest in people, that\u2019s why we have regulations and principles and I think we have to keep them. \u00a9 B e l g a i m a g e SOCIAL AGENDA / APRIL 2017 / 9 ",
        "EMPLOYMENT, SOCIAL AFFAIRS, SKILLS AND LABOUR MOBILITY What form will the Social Pillar take? We are looking for an instrument where we can involve the other institutions, including the European Parliament, because we need all partners on board. This is not just a theoretical exercise launched by the European Commission. We had a big consultation. It was a great success, with more than 16 000 reactions and more than 200 positions in writing, with dedicated hearings of the social partners and a lot was done in the Member States. Organisations and trade unions at local level know what the European Pillar of Social Rights is all about. Many people had the opportunity to influence this file so now we have to come up with a final dra(cid:3). It will be a guiding document, a reference framework, so we have to look at what legal form to give it. There are different options on the table. The review of the posting of workers has revealed an East-West divide in the area of social policy. Will everybody be on board with the Social Pillar nevertheless? That\u2019s what I expect. We are talking about convergence. I would not understand why people in, for instance, Eastern Europe would not like to have guidance on how to come closer to each other and go upwards. This is what the citizens in the Member States that joined the EU in 2004, 2007 and, in the case of Croatia, 2013, expect of course! And I cannot imagine that the other Member States don\u2019t think it\u2019s also in their interest that things work better in other EU countries where the living standards and social protection are presently lower. We all live in one EU. We have an internal market and the countries that are part of the Euro area are even more linked together. So if we want to have more resilience, we also need more social convergence and this is what the Pillar is all about. Will the Social Pillar be for EMU countries only, to start with? As the Commission President said at the high-level conference in January (see page 6), we need it first and foremost for the EMU because there, we are in a currency union. The Euro area countries are in a kind of \"straightjacket\" in terms of monetary policy. They have less instruments to adapt in case of asymmetric shocks. They therefore need the Social Pillar even more urgently. Of course social problems are waiting for solutions everywhere too and we have also an internal market, so the Social Pillar will be accessible to all the Member States, although we might have to go deeper for the Euro area. The Social Pillar is designed to be a compass The European Pillar of Social Rights is materialising just when we are celebrating the Rome Treaty\u2026 The Social Pillar is designed to be a compass for the future. We want upward social and employment convergence between the Member States. The Pillar comes as a reference framework that should guide us for the coming years. Let me be crystal clear: the Social Pillar as such will not be a Directive or a Regulation. It will be a commitment to a set of principles encapsulating the values we share, indicating in which direction we are going. It will serve to screen employment and social policies and check whether they are fit for purpose for the future. Knowing that we live in times that are changing, we will have to adapt if we want to preserve the essence of our social market economy. Therefore it is important that it is created just when we celebrate the Rome Treaty anniversary, because it expresses and underlines the fact that the EU and its Economic and Monetary Union (EMU) have a social dimension. When European Commission President, Jean-Claude Juncker, said that the EMU should earn a triple A rating on the social side, that is what it is all about. We have to show this. We did so in the past, of course, but when we went through the deepest moments of the crisis, everybody was busy with the budget and the economic side. There was less talk about the social dimension but it was never far away. We have to make it more explicit and show that we have a clear line, that Europe has a social dimension, because in the end citizens is what Europe is all about! We have to make that more clear than in the past to people, even more to those who are afraid of becoming the losers of all these changes. You have many people - and I do understand them and we have to respect their feelings - who are afraid of those changes: will my job still be there in the future; what about my children; will we have it as good as in the past? What are we heading for? We have to show them and citizens at large that we share their concerns and that we are looking for solutions. We will guide this evolution and not wait passively until something happens and then try and do some repair. 10 / SOCIAL AGENDA / APRIL 2017 ",
        "Are you optimistic about youth employment? Of course I am more optimistic now because we see that our policies are paying off. My favourite moment every month is when I see the employment statistics from Eurostat. The first thing I do then is to make comparisons and I see that, month a(cid:3)er month, it\u2019s getting better, both youth and general unemployment. Our general employment rate is again at 71% so we see now that the objective of 75% by 2020 is again within reach; having said that, our policies address structural causes so the full return on investment will come later. We have to continue working with the Member States and we see that we still have big problems with youth unemployment. You cannot be happy with an unemployment figure of more than 18% or when you see that in certain countries it is as low as 7% and in others as high as 40%. That\u2019s why I proposed to prolong the Youth Employment Initiative till 2020. But it is also about implementing the New Skills Agenda for Europe and all the other policies, and let\u2019s not forget job creation! We can help of course with our policies because I am sure that, if we have the right people ready to take up a job, you will create more jobs. But the macroeconomic policies must be there too: investment, innovation\u2026 The whole Commission is working together to deliver and we have to continue to do so. Citizens is what Europe is all about: \"The European Pillar of Social Rights expresses and underlines the fact that the EU and its Economic and Monetary Union have a social dimension\". I am a great believer in social dialogue In 2015 and 2016 you re-launched the social dialogue and then the civil one. The social partners and NGOs played a great part in the consultation on the Social Pillar\u2026 I am a great believer in social dialogue. If you can develop your policies together with social partners, who know the reality on the ground, you stand a better chance of having good policy design and you have them on board when it comes to implementing the policy. We consult them a lot more than before. We changed the agenda of the European Semester so that we can consult the European social partners in due time and that they are consulted at national level too. And we do so beyond purely social issues, such as energy policy, digital policy\u2026 Of course they don\u2019t always agree amongst themselves and we don\u2019t expect them to always come up with a common readymade position. There are tensions and differences of opinions but this enriches the debate and, as such, is a good thing. You also have subsidiarity on the other side, so we must give social partners room for manoeuvre. \u00a9 B e l g a i m a g e SOCIAL AGENDA / APRIL 2017 / 11 ",
        "EMPLOYMENT, SOCIAL AFFAIRS, SKILLS AND LABOUR MOBILITY The planes in the air must land With the Recommendation on the long-term unemployed, the Skills Agenda, you are really reaching out to those who feel excluded from globalisation? Yes, the long-term unemployed Recommendation is based on the success factors in some Member States. It\u2019s not just about giving people some money to survive. People need services and that\u2019s why we recommended having an individual assessment, a customised pathway to come and see what problems they have, a one- stop shop so that they receive support to go back to the labour market. Because, in the end, that\u2019s what everybody wants to do: feeling included in society, have a job. It is a question of being in or out. The longer you are unemployed, the bigger the problem is because you are further away from the labour market. Your skills become obsolete, your motivation is going down and you risk losing perspective. The first stage of the Skills Agenda is the Skills Guarantee, an upskilling pathway. We cannot forget those who don\u2019t have the basic skills because it starts there, so we look at those who are having problems or who may have problems in the future. But we also look at the other side of the coin: a big group of people, not just those who are very low-skilled or who were early school leavers that we have to pick up again. We all must ask ourselves: what about my skills, what lifelong learning do I need, which opportunities can I seize? This concerns everybody. We also have to see that the school curricula are relevant for the labour market. Employability is not a dirty word, at any level of education. Being employable is giving yourself a better chance on the labour market, just as feeling happy and getting a job that suits you is part of life. There is a social dimension in everybody\u2019s life and it\u2019s not only about earning your living, it is also about being part of society, feeling included.

        "Our policies are paying off : \"It's getting better, both for youth and general unemployment but you cannot be happy with a youth unemployment fi gure of more than 18%\". You try to reconcile a customised pathway with systemic and strategic funding. It\u2019s a combination of the two that is required? Yes of course but you have to choose your battles. You cannot do everything and we don\u2019t have to do everything. We look at the problems across Europe, identify where we can best help the Member States and then we do so with the tools that are at our disposal. As youth unemployment was the big problem after the crisis, we had to work on that as a matter of priority. Even when we had the Youth Guarantee supported by the Youth Employment Initiative, it wasn\u2019t getting off the ground due to the low level of pre- financing. Frontloading the money gave the Member States the liquidities they needed to launch their projects. As far as skills are concerned, all EU countries are tackling this issue. We bring them together with our News Skills Agenda. We solve cross-border issues and help them learn from each other, recognise each other\u2019s qualifications more easily and bring industries and universities together. In particular we want to make vocational education and training more attractive and see more people go in that direction because these are the skills we need. Doing this together at European level is so much richer and more supportive. So we look for ways of bringing an added-value. So how do you feel at this stage, how do you see the second half of your mandate? I am very happy with this portfolio: it\u2019s about people and I think this is the most important thing you can do! Since the beginning of this mandate, all our employment and social initiatives so far have sought to advance this goal: putting people at the heart of everything we do. And all our future proposals in the second half of the mandate will stay on this course. But it is not enough to launch proposals in order to achieve results for citizens; we also need to finish them. The planes in the air must land. This will also be a big priority for the second half of our mandate. \u00a9 B e l g a i m a g e SOCIAL AGENDA / APRIL 2017 / 13 ",
        "SPECIAL FEATURE European Social Fund \u2013 Investing in people since 1957 Human capital investment is more than ever crucial for the EU\u2019s future Making a difference: Created by the treaty of Rome, signed in 1957 (picture), the European Social Fund has been making a real difference in the lives of Europeans ever since. Created by the Treaty of Rome in 1957, the European Social Fund (ESF) is more than ever relevant as an instrument of \"human capital\" investment, as we put it nowadays. In the words of European Commissioner Marianne Thyssen, \" if we look at the changes that are going on and the challenges we are facing, the first thing to do is make sure that people have the right skills. Investing in human capital is the best thing we can do\" (see page 8). In partnership with the Member States and stakeholders, the ESF co-funds projects that assist people of all ages and backgrounds so that they have a better chance of finding work. They also help disadvantaged people out of low paid jobs, while improving their access to vital services. They provide lifelong learning and vocational training schemes, avoid children dropping out of school and reform public administrations and the judiciary so as to make them more transparent and easily accessible for citizens and companies. On the frontline Today, the ESF is very much on the frontline to help the Member States implement the country-specific recommendations that stem from the European Semester, the EU\u2019s economic and social policy coordination yearly cycle, and from the latest employment and social policy developments, in particular : the Youth Guarantee (providing young people with a quality job, apprenticeship or traineeship within four months of leaving school or being made redundant, see Social Agenda n\u00b046); the common framework for a customised pathway for the long-term unemployed; the New Skills Agenda for Europe; and the Action Plan for the integration of third-country nationals, including asylum-seekers and refugees. On 5 January 2017, the Commission published a series of evaluation reports on the investments carried out through the ESF from 2007 to 2013. \"It proves that the ESF makes a real difference in the lives of Europeans\", Marianne Thyssen commented on this occasion. \"It is our main instrument to invest in human capital. Thanks to European support, millions of people have found a job, improved their skills or found their way out of poverty and social exclusion. It is solidarity at its best\".

        "60 years of unceasing developments From a mere reimbursement instrument to an ever more strategic human capital investment fund It is a dual anniversary, as the European Social Fund (ESF) was born with the European Economic Community (EEC) a(cid:3) er Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, Luxembourg and the Netherlands signed the treaty of Rome on 25 March 1957. Since the very beginning, the ESF was set up to improve workers\u2019 mobility and employment opportunities. Until 1970, it reimbursed Member States 50% of the costs of vocational training and resettlement allowances for workers aff ected by economic restructuring. New rules were introduced in 1971, requiring that Member States submit advance applications for assistance. ESF resources were substantially increased and its projects started to focus more on particular categories or groups of people. Multiannual partnerships From the signing of the Single European Act of 1986 onwards, the ESF was programmed on a multiannual basis. The EU institutions, national administrations, social partners, civil society and local organisations deliver ESF-backed projects on the ground and work together in partnership to achieve the ESF\u2019s objectives. The ESF also became part of cohesion policy and more than half of its funding was channelled to boosting employment in the poorer regions and countries, including Greece, Spain and Portugal which joined the EEC in 1981. In 1992, it was decided to double the funding channelled through the structural funds, including the ESF (see box), starting with the budgetary period of 1994-1999. Vital in the new Member States: The ESF plays a crucial role in funding deep social and employment policy reforms in the countries which joined the EU in due course. SPECIAL FEATURE \u00a9 B e l g a i m a g e SOCIAL AGENDA / APRIL 2017 / 15 ",
        "One of five EU structural funds Five funds make up the European structural and investment funds: The European Social Fund, supporting employment-related projects throughout Europe and investing in people; the European Regional Development Fund, promoting infrastructure development; the Cohesion Fund, funding transport and environment projects in countries where the gross national income per inhabitant is less than 90% of the EU average (in 2014-20, these are Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Greece, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Malta, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia and Slovenia); the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development, which focuses on resolving the particular challenges facing EU's rural areas; and the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund, helping fishermen to adopt sustainable fishing practices and coastal communities to diversify their economies, improving quality of life along European coasts. The Amsterdam Treaty, which came into force in 1999, introduced the European Parliament into the ESF decision-making process (co-decision between the Parliament and Council, with qualified majority voting in the Council). It also enabled the EU and its Member States to draw up a European Employment Strategy. From the 2000-2006 period, the ESF supported this strategy by promoting active labour market measures and entrepreneurship, and enhancing the skills of the existing workforce (with an emphasis on young people and the long-term unemployed), especially in the information and communication technology and the environmental sectors etc. On 1 May 2004, ten new countries, all from central and eastern Europe except Cyprus and Malta, joined the EU. The ESF played a crucial role in funding deep social and employment policy reforms in these new Member States (see page 18). From 2007 onwards, all ESF co-funded projects were required to promote social innovation. The ESF scope was extended to include the strengthening of public institutions\u2019 capacities and a \"simplified cost option\" was introduced to reduce the administrative burden for beneficiaries (see Social Agenda n\u00b0 42). Adapting to the crisis When the financial and economic crisis broke out in 2008, the ESF had a key role to play in supporting the EU\u2019s economic recovery initiatives. In 2010, the Europe 2020 strategy for a smart, sustainable and inclusive growth was adopted. For the first time, it included a target in the social policy area: li(cid:3)ing 20 million people out of the risk of poverty by 2020. It also renewed the EU commitment to a 75% employment rate for the 20-64 age group. The Europe 2020 headline employment and social targets served as benchmarks for implementing the European Employment Strategy. They also became part of the European Semester process of economic policy coordination which, every year, produces country-specific recommendations. The Member States use the ESF to help them implement the recommendations related to employment and social affairs. Job fair for refugees: The ESF supports EU initiatives such as the 2016 Action Plan for Integrating Third-Country Nationals, including asylum-seekers and refugees. \u00a9 B e l g a i m a g e SPECIAL FEATURE 16 / SOCIAL AGENDA / APRIL 2017 ",
        "Since 2014, all five European Structural and Investment Funds (see box page 16) are governed by a set of common rules and principles for implementation. Fund- specific regulations define areas of intervention and other particularities. Social inclusion For the 2014-2020 period, the role of the ESF has been reinforced through the introduction of a compulsory minimum ESF share of 23.1% of total EU cohesion funding. With an overall allocation of at least \u20ac74 billion (to be completed, as always, by funding on the part of the Member States), the ESF co-finances four \"thematic objectives\": promoting sustainable and quality employment and supporting labour mobility; promoting social inclusion, combating poverty and discrimination; investing in education, training and vocational training for skills and lifelong learning; enhancing the institutional capacity of public authorities and stakeholders and efficient public administrations. At least 20% of ESF funding must be devoted to social inclusion. The ESF is also one of the funding sources of the Youth Employment Initiative, which supports young people neither in employment, education nor training in regions experiencing youth unemployment rates above 25%. And it supports the implementation of the 2015 Recommendation on the integration of the long-term unemployed in the labour market, as well as the New Skills Agenda for Europe and the Action Plan for integrating third-country nationals (including asylum-seekers and refugees) of 2016. Over the years, ESF investment has therefore become ever more targeted and strategic, focusing increasingly on systemic reforms which can benefit as many people as possible, in a social investment approach.

Its theme was: \"ESF past, present and future\". This anniversary comes just at the right time, as the EU has started reflecting upon the future of human capital funding: looking back at 60 years of achievements provides a good framework to discuss the ESF\u2019 relevance for the future. A high mark of the celebrations is also the \"Europe in my Region\" campaign, taking place in May: right across Europe, thousands of projects will open their doors to the public. The ESF anniversary must be seen in the wider context of celebrating the treaty of Rome creating the European Economic Community and its \"common market\", which was signed on 25 March 1957 ( #EU60), six years a(cid:3)er the Treaty of Paris creating the European Coal and Steel Community. Reinforced role: The European Social Fund must now amount to 23.1% of total EU cohesion funding and 20% of the ESF must go to social inclusion. \u00a9 B e l g a i m a g e SOCIAL AGENDA / APRIL 2017 / 17 ",
        "What the ESF means in practice In federal, centralised or decentralised old and new EU Member States In a founding Member State like Germany, support provided by the European Social Fund (ESF), put together with the other four European Structural and Investment Funds (see page 16), amounts to only 4% of national public investment (defi ned as gross capital formation + investment grants + national expenditure on agriculture and fi sheries) for 2014-2020. Nevertheless, the ESF fulfi ls an important role as an innovation booster. It fi nances niches and experiments with new methods and approaches of labour market integration and helps tackle current challenges, such as integrating refugees. Although labour market policy is mainly managed at federal level, since 2000 the regions also manage part of the ESF budget dedicated to this policy. \"Encouraging Youth in the Neighbourhood\" is an example of a programme which is presently being co-funded by the ESF in Germany. It aims to test how diff erent actors within municipalities may better cooperate with each other to improve the way they provide support to young people living in disadvantaged areas; for example by breaking silos between jurisdictions, State and non-State bodies and one- to-one youth assistance and micro-projects. SPECIAL FEATURE Job prospects: in Germany, an ESF-backed programme is testing how diff erent local actors cooperate to better help young people in disadvantaged areas. 18 / SOCIAL AGENDA / APRIL 2017 ",
        "Ultimately, the aim is to stabilise young people through better intra-municipal cooperation and to give them labour market integration prospects through a traineeship or a job. New VET system When Portugal joined the EU in 1986, the ESF was used in particular to develop vocational education and training (VET). A(cid:3) er the 1974 revolution, VET was associated with the former regime\u2019s hierarchical approach to education. From 1986, a new VET system was therefore created, with pathways to the general education system. Higher education also received massive ESF support, for example in the form of scholarships for PhD students. With the economic crisis of 2008 and the resulting adjustment programme Portugal went through, the emphasis was then put on modernising social services in the face of rising poverty. An example of ESF co-funding in Portugal is INOV contacto, which was launched in 1997 and prolonged under successive programming periods. By February 2015, it had helped 5 000 unemployed young people obtain a traineeship in another EU country: university graduates up to the age of 30, who were looking for their fi rst job and willing to work abroad. The project also helped the participating companies, for example by handling the selection on their behalf. INOV contacto has set up an online platform to allow past and present participants to network and encourage partnerships between companies. School-leaving prevention In Sweden, which joined the EU in 1995 together with Austria and Finland, the ESF only represents approximately 1.5 % of public investment in labour market policy. In this decentralised country, most of the income tax is levied at local level, as the municipalities are in charge of schools and social care, including that of young people up till the age of 20. Record-holding ESF programme The largest ever European Social Fund (ESF) co-funded initiative to have been carried out so far is the Human Capital OP (Operational Programme) , which was implemented in Poland from 2007 to 2013. It achieved 47 500 projects with a total value of nearly \u20ac113 billion. Thanks to projects carried out within the Human Capital OP, 299 nurseries were created, as well as 49 children day care institutions and 30 children\u2019s clubs. 5 800 pre- school centres were subsidised and 170 000 pre-school age children were supported in rural areas. 17 000 school development projects were implemented. 472 000 young people participated in the projects and 45 500 received grants for starting a business. 3 900 vocational education and training schools and institutions also benefi ted from the programme. 245 000 students carried out traineeships or apprenticeships and close to 94 000 students were able to start studying in areas such as robotics, biotechnology, construction, design and computer science. 234 000 companies were created. Nearly 100 000 women set up their own business. 173 000 workers aged 50 or more were trained and 23 000 of them set up their own business. 200 000 businesses benefi ted from the programme\u2019s training system, involving 1.5 million people. 167 000 people at risk of social exclusion benefi ted from the Human Capital OP, as well as 14 000 social economy entities. The programme also enabled the creation of more than 721 social cooperatives. \u00a9 B e l g a i m a g e SOCIAL AGENDA / APRIL 2017 / 19 ",

Indeed, the extent to which services are connected and the level of resources available, vary from one municipality to the other. It is also helping Sweden in welcoming \"newly arrived young people\" (young asylum-seekers or refugees) in the face of the present refugee crisis. This includes helping second-generation migrants who are still struggling to integrate the labour market, although they were born in Sweden. An emblematic example of an ESF project co-funded in Sweden is \"Plug In\", which has been prolonged until 2020 under the name \"Plug In 2.0\". Its aim is to help young people complete their secondary education. It involves 47 municipalities spread across a big part of the country. With the support of a national and of a regional structure, they run 80 methodological workshops focusing on secondary school grade 1 pupils, with a strong emphasis on preventing early school leaving. As a result of the project, new approaches have been developed at local level, which the municipalities have integrated into their organisational processes. New structures have also been created to help regions and local actors cooperate better in the fight against early school leaving. Active policies Poland joined the EU in 2004, together with Cyprus, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Lithuania, Latvia, Malta, Slovakia and Slovenia. In this country, the first ESF interventions focused on capacity-building, training the civil servants and administrative personnel at central, regional and local level in absorbing huge amounts of money from the ESF (\u20ac2 billion in 2004, \u20ac10 billion as from 2007) and designing and implementing active labour market policies; in the national ministries right through to the local public employment services. During the 2007-2013 programming period, two-thirds of the ESF budget were dedicated to the regional level and one third to the central government level. At central level, it was mostly used to improve governance and test labour market activation measures as well as social inclusion ones, like providing support to very specific groups (Roma people, young excluded people, convicts\u2026). A big part of the allocation was dedicated to improving the quality of education and reforming the higher education system, as well as the VET system which is receiving further impetus in the current 2014-2020 programing period. \u00a9 B e l g a i m a g e 20 / SOCIAL AGENDA / APRIL 2017 ",
        "Newly arrived: In Sweden, the ESF is helping welcome young asylum-seekers or refugees in the face of the present refugee crisis. While the part of the ESF budget managed at regional level was used to provide direct support to people in the traditional policy areas supported by the ESF but also social innovation and transnational cooperation at regional and local level. A great emphasis was placed on creating an enterprise- friendly environment. In particular, the ESF played a huge role in building the social economy sector and funding adaptability measures for people working in small and medium-size enterprises (SMEs). More emphasis is now being placed on youth employment, through the Youth Employment Initiative and the Youth Guarantee, and on the health sector: For example, mapping the health offer provided by the hospitals and the health needs of the population, in an integrated care approach. A project co-funded by the ESF in Poland, called \"Academy of Social Economy Development\", won the RegioStars Awards 2016: A European Commission prize rewarding projects that stand out as a source of inspiration and innovation. Its aim was to develop professional support for the social economy in the Malopolska region. It helped centralise cooperation between private entities such as cooperatives, non-profit organisations, social enterprises and charities \u2013 and the public sector.

During this programming period, ESF co-funding helped EU countries set-up policies that they would otherwise have found difficult to support financially. It provided more than 70% of resources for active labour market policies in Bulgaria, Estonia, Greece, Latvia, Lithuania, Malta, Romania and Slovakia and more than 5% of education and training expenditure in Portugal and the Czech Republic. It also helped the Member States reach out to categories of people such as the low-skilled (representing 40% of participations in ESF actions), young people (30%) and the disadvantaged (at least 21%). Taken as a whole, the participations were evenly spread between the inactive (36%), the employed (33%) and the unemployed (30%). On the qualitative side, the ESF triggered new ways of working between stakeholders. It supported local and regional innovations which were then mainstreamed at national level. It also played a great role in supporting the modernisation of public employment services. In less developed regions, the ESF supported reforms in the education, judiciary and general public administrations, giving an impetus to the business environment and creating more inclusive societies. Single Act Although the ESF was created by the Treaty of Rome in 1957 (see page 15), evaluating it in a systematic way - not just for accountability purposes but to show its achievements and identify ways to improve its impact - only started in earnest a(cid:3)er the Single European Act was signed in 1986. This Treaty turned the ESF into a cohesion policy instrument, alongside new Funds that were created to support other aspects of cohesion (see article p.15). It also changed the ESF from an annual to a multi-annual Fund, co-managed by the European Commission and the Member States. Evaluations of Structural and Cohesion Fund programmes are being conducted at defined stages in the programming cycle: ex-ante to justify the choices they make in their Operational Programmes (OPs); during the implementation of these OPs to establish any need for corrective action; and ex-post to assess the outcomes and draw lessons. The European Commission supported the national managing authorities from the onset in this endeavour, by providing them with guidelines and monitoring tools and meeting them regularly. It is encouraging them to shi(cid:3) the focus of evaluations from the management process to the concrete impact of operations (see box). The Commission is in charge of evaluating ex-post the entire programming period, including from a thematic angle. For the 2007-2013 period, it also evaluated how well the ESF managed to adapt to the consequences of the unforeseen financial and economic crisis which broke out in 2008. In fact, the ESF proved to be quite flexible, thanks in part to simplification measures that were mainstreamed for the first time during that programming period.

Indeed, each Member State must carry out at least one impact evaluation before the end of the period. One promising method to assess impacts is called counterfactual impact evaluation (CIE). It consists in comparing the outcomes of people who have benefited from a policy or programme, with a group of people similar in all respects except that they have not benefited from the policy or programme. It uses micro data on ESF participants to ascertain, for example, whether the participants to an ESF operation found a job with a higher probability than without participating in the project. And it helps to determine whether the policy objectives have been met and the resources were used efficiently. The answer is fed back into the design and implementation of future ESF operations and budgetary decisions, in a policy implementation life-cycle. ",
        "EMPLOYMENT Boosting the fight against youth unemployment European Solidarity Corps, ErasmusPRO: The EU is implementing a whole range of measures Youth unemployment might be decreasing but it remains extremely high in some regions while in the EU as a whole, four million young people are still in a very difficult situation. In his State of the Union speech on 14 September 2016, European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker called for an accelerated and deeper implementation by EU countries of the Youth Guarantee (YG) for a quality offer for a job, continued education, apprenticeship or traineeship within four months of becoming unemployed or leaving formal education, and of the Youth Employment Initiative (YEI) which provides direct support to young people neither in employment, education no training living in regions experiencing youth employment rates above 25% in 2012. In October, when the Commission adopted a Communication highlighting the main achievements of the YG and YEI since they were adopted in 2013, European Commissioner Marianne Thyssen proposed to prolong the YEI budget until 2020 with an extra budget of \u20ac2 billion (see Social Agenda n\u00b046). Solidarity Jean-Claude Juncker also called for the creation of a European Solidarity Corps, stating that \"solidarity is the glue that keeps our Union together (\u2026) Young people across the EU will be able to volunteer their help where it is needed most, to respond to crisis situations (\u2026) They will be able to develop their skills and get not only work but also invaluable human experience\". Two days a(cid:3)er his speech was delivered, the Heads of State and governments of all the EU countries (except that of the United Kingdom) met for the first time since the British referendum, in Bratislava. There, they issued a declaration on the future of the EU which, inter alia, calls for decisions to be adopted in December 2016 \"on EU support for Member States in fighting youth unemployment and on enhanced EU programmes dedicated to youth\". On 7 December 2016, the European Commission presented a \"youth package\" which combines immediate measures to address employment needs, together with structural ones to improve the quality of education and training. The most immediately operational part of this package is the European Solidarity Corps: young people between 18 to 30 years old can already register on its website to volunteer or do an internship, an apprenticeship or carry out a paid job in another EU country for placements ranging from two to twelve months. As far as internships and apprenticeships are concerned, there will be an employment contract. Travel costs are covered and a subsistence allowance is paid for. For a job placement, for which travel costs are also covered, there will be an employment contract and a wage according to national laws. Quality The quality of traineeships is already covered by an EU Recommendation (see Social Agenda n\u00b046). To underpin the apprenticeship component of the European Solidarity Corps and of the Youth Guarantee, the Commission has submitted to the EU social partners an initiative to create a common minimum understanding across the EU of what a quality apprenticeship should involve (e.g. clear learning outcomes, qualified trainers and decent working conditions). The aim is to ensure quality apprenticeship opportunities that increase the employability of young people, providing them with relevant skills, while preventing them from falling into a cheap labour trap. Apprenticeships can be enhanced by a cross-border stint. The EU\u2019s Erasmus+ programme already supports 120 000 Vocational education and training (VET) learners, including apprentices, to study or to carry out work placements in another EU country each year. However, this represents only a small fraction of the demand, because only one-third of the applications to Erasmus+ VET mobility can be financed, due to lack of resources. And the average mobility period is approximately 34 days, in spite of the fact that Erasmus+ stays may last up to a year. 24 / SOCIAL AGENDA / APRIL 2017 ",
        "ErasmusPRO In a bid to boost the number of long-duration VET placements abroad, the Commission is launching ErasmusPRO. From 2018 onwards, it will provide extra financial incentives for apprentices\u2019 placements of six months\u2019 minimum duration. Finally, the Youth Package contains measures which will help EU countries modernise and improve their school, higher education and vocational education and training systems, in the spirit of the New Skills Agenda for Europe (see Social Agenda n\u00b045). This entails providing comparative data, strengthening the evidence base, carrying out analyses, promoting mutual learning and sharing knowledge about good practice. European Solidarity Corps: an occupational strand At the core of the youth package of proposals adopted in December 2016 by the European Commission, is the creation of a European Solidarity Corps: cross-border placements lasting between 2 and 12 months to engage in solidarity activities (placements in one\u2019s own country will be possible in a medium to long term perspective). The Corps\u2019 website was launched in December 2016 and 100 000 people aged between 18 and 30 years old are expected to join by 2020. The Corps has two strands: volunteering and occupational (in the form of a job, a traineeship or an apprenticeship). A consortium of public employment services and non governmental organisations is being selected by the European Commission. It will in turn select the candidates for joining the Corps. The occupational strand should become operational in May. Responding to crisis situations: The European Solidarity Corps launched by the European Commission has an occupational strand, as well as a volunteering one. \u00a9 B e l g a i m a g e More information: European Solidarity Corps website https://ec.europa.eu/info/eu-solidarity SOCIAL AGENDA / APRIL 2017 / 25 ",
        "OTHER VOICES Growing up with the European Social Fund \u00a9 R e b e c c a L e e In 1978 I started in my first job. It was a community employment scheme for disadvantaged youths sponsored by the European Social Fund (ESF). So I can\u2019t claim to have seen the developments of the ESF over its 60 years but I can say that for 40 years, ESF has been an important presence in my life. The project concerned may not have been a \u2018best practice example\u2019 but in 1970\u2019s rural Ireland it was a start, when jobs were hard to find. In the late 80\u2019s and early 90\u2019s I managed projects with Travellers, with the support of ESF. I hope the projects had a community and personal development led approach. They had the chance to build on the principles that were developed in work with Roma and Travellers under the much missed EU poverty programmes: respect for cultural identity, partnership, participation, and empowerment. Evidence such as the increase in visible Traveller leaders, the major improvements in Traveller school completion rates, the enhanced anti-discrimination legislation (building on the EU Directive) testify to the importance of such work. In the mid-90\u2019s I was employed by \u2018Area Development Management\u2019, an intermediary company, to manage ESF and ERDF funds. My role was to establish multi-stakeholder \u2018Local Partnership Boards\u2019 to develop and implement area-based development plans, with the support of EU structural funds. These Boards were set up in \u2018disadvantaged areas\u2019 and played an important role in addressing inequalities between and within regions in Ireland. In this period I also participated in the national ESF committee to monitor the use of structural funds for inclusion. This was an important illustration of the partnership approach. Unfortunately this approach weakened during the so called \u2018celtic tiger\u2019 period when it seemed the fight against the \u2018poor\u2019 took precedence over fighting poverty. Anti-poverty network I have been active in the European Anti-Poverty Network (EAPN) since 1990. EAPN has played a role to advocate for, share experiences and monitor the use of structural funds for the fight against poverty, exclusion and discrimination. Most recently EAPN, with other social actors, successfully campaigned for the ring fencing of 20% of the ESF funds for social inclusion. EAPN\u2019s first Barometer Report monitoring the follow-up of this commitment is available at www.eapn.eu. Presently I am the thematic expert for inclusion under the ESF Transnational Platform (see http://ec.europa.eu/esf/ transnationality/).This is an opportunity to support learning exchanges and encourage transnational cooperation on topics such as: promoting deinstitutionalisation; how to reach groups and communities experiencing poverty; Active Inclusion (comprehensive approaches to ensure adequate incomes, accessible services and pathways to employment). One thing that strikes me as different from earlier periods, is the reluctance of many Member States to recognise the value of trans-national exchange and not just to focus on their own patch. So a(cid:3)er forty years with ESF what can I say? Happy birthday ESF, may you expand your role to be a visible sign of solidarity in the EU, may you continue to address inequalities within and between regions, may you continue to support targeted work to ensure the inclusion of those who experience poverty and discrimination. I hope your role to ensure support for social, cooperative and community led development is strengthened. I hope you can invest in the participation of people and communities experiencing poverty and exclusion. I know EAPN will be there to play a part in such a future mission for the ESF.

You speak five languages (German, English, French, Spanish and a bit of Russian) on top of Italian, your native language\u2026 No wonder you started in the European Commission by working with the Translation Directorate-General (DG), before moving on to the one dealing with External Relations! Yes. I learnt German and French at school and from the age of 12, I would go to another country every summer to study its language. I did a degree in French studies in Grenoble and studied international relations in Brussels. In the DG which was then in charge of information, communication and culture, you launched Europe Direct, a platform where citizens can ask questions directly to the European Commission. This was two years a(cid:4)er the launch of the Europa website which, to start with, only had a single mail box. Europe Direct provided a series of mail boxes, one per policy area, as well as a free phone number to call the Commission. At a second stage, all Commission information points in the EU Member States were transformed into a single Europe Direct network. Why are there still communication problems between the EU institutions and citizens? Europe Direct caters for people who are already aware of the existence of the European Commission and who try by themselves to get in touch with it, to obtain practical information about their rights as EU citizens etc. or raise more complex policy-related issues. However, there are still many people who know absolutely nothing about the EU. We must reach out to them. This cannot be done from Brussels alone: European, national, regional and local authorities must work hand in hand to communicate about what is happening at EU level, in a plain language and in a coherent way. You also know how to communicate with young people in particular, as you were in charge of Netd@ys from 2001 to 2003\u2026 We worked with schools in particular, in a multimedia approach including the Internet, which was new at the time. It was all about stimulating participation, dialogue and contact, using the new potential offered by the worldwide web to communicate with other schools, including in other countries. Reaching out to young people is all the more crucial today in the face of youth unemployment\u2026 Indeed, as we try to do through the Youth Guarantee and the Youth Employment Initiative (see Social Agenda n\u00b046). We need to communicate about the positive aspects of European integration and the values the EU stands for. \u00a9 E u r o p e a n U n i o n INTERVIEW SOCIAL AGENDA / APRIL 2017 / 27 ",
