LRAs are in the frontline of ensuring children rights\u2019 on a daily basis and have key competences in this field; \u2014 calls on the Member States to pay more attention to ensuring the Rights of the Child, including respecting the basic conditions required for the development of children. In this regard, the LRAs have a un ique opportun ity to develop their own policies, an d serve as examples b oth for their own countries and the EU itself; \u2014 calls on all relevant stakeholders to gather more complete sources of information and further improve the data collection and analysis techniques of the Rights of the Child indicators. LRAs should be consulted at all stages of this process, both as providers of quantitative and qualitative input as well as in their capacity as key final users of this tool; \u2014 notes the positive role played by National Children\u2019s Ombudsmen and other similar bodies in the area of child rights protection, as well as the possible benefits which the LRAs and other relevant stakeholders can gain from two-way communication and close cooperation with these officials; \u2014 Child poverty can deprive children and their families of their rights and limit future opportunities.

        "1.10.2010 EN Official Journ al of the E uropean Un ion C 267/47 Rapporteur : Mr Arnoldas Abramavi\u010dius (LT/EPP), Mayor of Zarasai District Municipality I. POLICY RECOMMENDATIONS THE COMMITTEE OF THE REGIONS 1. notes that children represent one fifth of the European Union\u2019s population, therefore the creation of favourable condi\u00ad tions for their growth and development, including the protection and promotion of their rights, should be among the main priori\u00ad ties of the EU, its institutions and the Member States; 2. notes that Article 24 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union explicitly recognises the rights of the child; moreover , the fundamental Rights of the Child represent a horizon\u00ad tal, cross-cutting issue, touching upon multiple dimensions, and must therefore be mainstreamed as a cross-cutting horizontal pri\u00ad ority in to all relevan t E uropean an d n ational policies. Believes that the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child could be used as a framework that would not just come into play where rights are being violated, but also be broadly applied to promote the devel\u00ad opment and opportunities of all children and young people; 3. notes that the institutional and legal framework for the respect of the Rights of the Child, including the ratification of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child and the European Con\u00ad vention on Human Rights as well as other key international agree\u00ad ments in this area by all Member States, is sufficiently well developed within the European Union. However, this does not prevent new challenges and threats manifesting themselves in this area, which thus requires new policy measures, well-coordinated actions and the constant monitoring of all these; 4. notes that the objective to effectively respect the Rights of the Child cannot be achieved without a comprehensive partnership which includes all the actors concerned, in particular the EU insti\u00ad tutions, the Member States, NGOs and other players active in this field, including the children themselves, but first and foremost the Local and Regional Authorities (LRA). LRAs are in the frontline of ensuring children rig hts\u2019 on a daily b asis an d have k ey compe\u00ad tences in this field; 5. notes that implementation of the Rights of the Child falls pre\u00ad dominantly under policy areas where both the EU and the Mem\u00ad ber States enjoy competences (e.g. social policy, education and youth, health, the area of freedom security and justice etc.); there\u00ad fore stresses the importance that action taken at the EU level respect the subsidiarity and proportionality principles and be implemented in the spirit of multilevel governance; EU action should take such a form as to foster debate, the exchanges of best practice, as well as comparative research, monitoring and evaluation; 6. supports the intention of the European Commission to focus as a matter of priority on the fight against violence, the protec\u00ad tion of vulnerable groups of children such as unaccompanied min ors and victims of trafficking, and those faced with the risk of poverty and social exclusion. However, the CoR notes that in all these areas, it will not be possible to achieve the set goals if there is no partnership with all the relevant actors, especially LRAs; 7. notes that there is also a need for early health promotion efforts to pre-empt some of the problems which can arise when children and young people live in risk environments; 8. welcomes the Commission\u2019s aim to prepare a Communica\u00ad tion on the Rights of the Child as well as the methodology cho\u00ad sen for this goal \u2013 the organisation of a public consultation on this issue. Moreover, the CoR looks forward to cooperating with the Commission in the framework of the Steering Group of the EU Forum on the Rights of the Child and within the Forum itself; 9. welcomes the provisions of the Stockholm Programme (Multi-annual Programme for an Area of Freedom, Security and Justice and Protecting the Citizen), adopted by the European Council in 2010, which have included the protection and promo\u00ad tion of the fundamental rights of children as a priority issue; 10. while regretting that LRAs and their role has not been explicitly mentioned in the Stockholm Programme, stresses the importance of taking the needs and knowledge of LRAs into account when formulating the Action Plan on the implementa\u00ad tion of the Stockholm Programme; 11. actively supports the Annual Dialogue on Multi-level Pro\u00ad tection and Promotion of Fundamental Rights, co-organised by the European Commission, the EU Agency for Fundamental Rights (FRA) and the Committee of the Regions, as a tool for overcoming the shortcomings in the implementation of a Euro\u00ad pean strategy on the rights of the child and to ensure the effective involvement of LRAs in European cooperation on the issue of children\u2019s rights; 12. welcomes the Rights of the Child (hereinafter RoC) indica\u00ad tors, developed by the European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights as an important step towards implementing more informed and evidence-based policies. However, draws attention to the remaining shortcomings of these indicators; they only briefly touch on the LRAs\u2019 area of competence, and are therefore of limited use for LRAs; 13. reg rets that althoug h all E U Memb er States are parties to the International Labour Organisation\u2019s (ILO) Worst Forms of Child Labour Convention, it is unclear how many children are victims of trafficking and labour exploitation. Therefore, as part of the 2010 European year for Combating Poverty and Social Exclusion, the CoR emphasises the need to ensure better coordination between relevant bodies and specialised agencies at all levels so that they can more effectively man age child exploitation ; ",
        "C 267/48 EN Official Journ al of the E uropean Un ion 1.10.2010 14. notes the need to further stress the key role played by LRAs in the area of child rights protection, in particular regarding access to education, health care, social protection and young people\u2019s access to the job market; 15. notes that LRAs shall be considered to be essential partners under the EU\u2019s consultation procedures, especially as they are well-placed to inform public opinion and encourage dialogue with local communities, in order to strengthen the level of pro\u00ad tection of child rights and organise information campaigns on the rights of the child launched at regional and local level with finan\u00ad cial support from the EU, with a view to raising children\u2019s aware\u00ad ness about their rights; 16. notes the valuable role played by European and national level NGOs active in the field of the Rights of the Child; 17. welcomes policy labelling initiatives, such as the UNICEF concept of the Child Friendly City, which provides for the imple\u00ad mentation of the UN Convention of the Rights of the Child in action at local level and includes both measures to assure the rights of the child and their integration in relevant decision mak\u00ad ing processes; 18. recommends that LRAs fully exploit existing structures facilitating cooperation and the exchange of best practice, such as organised civil society, academia and policy makers active in the field of the rights of the child. In this respect, innovative measures to promote cooperation and more effective partnerships between LRAs across different EU Member States should be supported at European level and the exchange of good practices promoted therein; 19. calls on the Commission to include examples of best prac\u00ad tices across the Member States in European Union documents in the area of the protection of children\u2019s rights. Accordingly, the provisions of the European Charter of Child-Friendly Cities and those of the CoE Policy Guidelines on the National Integrated Strategies for the Protection of Children against Violence should be reflected in the EU strategy of the Rights of the Child, while highlighting the need to place more emphasis on the best way of translating policy commitments into practice; 20. notes the important role played by the Council of Europe in the field of the Rights of the Child and urges the EU institutions to strengthen cooperation with the CoE; Legal and administrative framework 21. taking into account the complexity and multidimensional nature of the concept of children\u2019s rights, the CoR stresses the need to tackle this issue first and foremost as a tool for ensuring a safe, comprehensive and beneficial environment for child devel\u00ad opment to help them become full-fledged, conscious and socially responsible members of their respective local communities, Mem\u00ad b er States as well as the en tire multicultural E uropean society; 22. calls on the Member States to pay more attention to ensur\u00ad ing the Rights of the Child, including respecting the basic condi\u00ad tions required for the development of children. In this regard, the LRAs have a unique opportunity to develop their own policies, and serve as examples both for their own countries and the EU itself; 23. notes that some of the most vulnerable groups of children are exempt from the measures used to ensure the rights of the child. This is particularly important in the case of the so-called \u2018invisible children\u2019 \u2013 the children from families without legal resi\u00ad dence status as well as street children; 24. notes that it is of crucial importance to ensure that the Member States\u2019 police authorities work together effectively and to fully exploit the potential of softer society-based measures, such as the Missing children hotline 116000. The CoR calls on the Member States to make free \u2018116 numbers\u2019 publicly available, and promote them among citizens; 25. calls on all relevant stakeholders to gather more complete sources of information and further improve the data collection and analysis techniques of the Rights of the Child indicators. LRAs should be consulted at all stages of this process, both as providers of quantitative and qualitative input as well as in their capacity as key final users of this tool; 26. taking into account the lack of comprehensive information on the protection of the Rights of the Child in the Member States, calls on the Commission to develop, publish and regularly update a \u2018Rights of the Child Scoreboard\u2019, as a tool covering the improved Rights of the Child indicators and providing reliable, comparable and up-to-date information on the level of RoC in the Member States. The Scoreboard could be based on the methodology of the already-existing Internal Market Scoreboard, indicating the trans\u00ad position of Internal market directives. This tool would not only serve as a referen ce point for research, but also - by highlighting best practice - could become an important impetus for policy change in the Member States, overcoming the lack of mandatory acquis , acting via the Open Method of Coordination, as promoted in the White Paper on European Governance; 27. calls on the Commission to promote the concept of the Rights of the Child as well as the cooperation of EU and non-EU local authorities in this field within the framework of the EU\u2019s extern al policies. To this en d, cooperation should b e en couraged with the Council of Europe as well as with other EU external cooperation frameworks, including but not limited to the Euro\u00ad pean Neighbourhood Policy, Union for the Mediterranean, EU-Africa dialogue and cooperation with African, Caribbean and Pacific countries, thus contributing to an improvement in the quality of life in EU partner countries, first and foremost focusing on the coun tries alon g the E U\u2019s extern al b orders; ",
        "1.10.2010 EN Official Journ al of the E uropean Un ion C 267/49 Ensuring basic rights and coping with the key challenges 28. notes the positive role played by National Children\u2019s Ombudsmen and other similar bodies in the area of child rights protection, as well as the possible benefits which the LRAs and other relevant stakeholders can gain from two-way communication and close cooperation with these officials;. At the same time, it calls on the Member States to strengthen the institution of the Children\u2019s Ombudsman in line with the recommendations made by the Euro\u00ad pean Parliament and international organisations; 29. notes that poverty can represent a decisive impediment to universal access to equal opportunities that must be tackled in order to ensure the effective protection of children\u2019s rights. Child poverty can deprive children and their families of their rights and limit future opportunities. Action must therefore first and fore\u00ad most focus on children from the most vulnerable social groups and ensure the right to quality education for all, so that every child is given the proper opportunity to develop; 30. notes that LRAs could help tackle this issue effectively by promoting child-sensitive and multi-dimensional social protec\u00ad tion systems, as children can be better protected if they and their parents also have access to decent living conditions and health\u00ad care. The most cost effective approach involves both prevention and social protection. In particular, measures such as fee-waivers for orphans and vulnerable children has enabled increased access to educational and health services. The CoR therefore recom\u00ad mends that European institutions, international organizations, specialised associations and national public authorities are strongly encouraged to support the capacity of LRAs to carry out these crucial activities; 31. urges the Commission to prepare and adopt recommenda\u00ad tions on tackling child poverty. This could be developed on the basis of wide public consultations in order to ensure the widest possible coverage, the maximum involvement of relevant stake\u00ad holders and to reflect the variety of possible approaches; 32. in the context of the increasing mobility of the EU work\u00ad force and intra-EU labour migration, the CoR notes the need to ensure the rights of migrant children, especially as regards the competences of LRAs. This includes but is not limited to assis\u00ad tance in the process of migrant family reunification, family coun\u00ad selling, social, education and healthcare services for migrant children, assisting them in the process of adaptation with life in their destination country and integration within local and school\u00ad ing communities; 33. notes the potential benefits arising from the successful inte\u00ad gration of in tra-EU mig rant children in to the relevan t social strata of the destination countries. Successful action in this field can result in increased knowledge of both native and migrant children about other EU Member States, augmented social capital, increased tolerance both in migration origin and destination countries. The CoR therefore calls on LRAs and the Member States to pay more attention to this issue and to convert the challenges posed by intra-EU migration into opportunities; 34. notes the threats posed by the sadly still existing phenom\u00ad ena of human trafficking, particularly where this concerns chil\u00ad dren. Calls on the Commission and the Member States to devote all possible effort \u2013 including the enactment of pertinent EU level legislation - to combat this type of crime and to ensure the maxi\u00ad mum possible protection to its victims in close cooperation with LRAs, as they are primarily responsible for the provision of important assistance such as education, social care and psycho\u00ad logical therapies as well as strengthening cooperation with law enforcement and judicial bodies; 35. notes the need to provide adequate protection for unaccom\u00ad panied minors; 36. notes the need to improve juvenile justice, to develop age- appropriate methods for juvenile crime prevention, intervention and reintegration, and to separate juvenile offenders both physi\u00ad cally and in organisational terms from the adult offenders; Information and edu cation measu res 37. stresses the importance of providing comprehensive educa\u00ad tion for all, including both adults and children, on the issues of the Rights of the Child, thus contributing to a better understand\u00ad ing of the very nature of children\u2019s rights, and the process of rais\u00ad ing the awareness and consciousness of young citizens; 38. taking into account the indivisibility of social rights and responsibilities, the CoR recommends paying more attention to the wider context in which the Rights of the Child exist \u2013 namely the concept of human rights and social responsibilities. Further\u00ad more, it recommends promoting the concept of the responsibili\u00ad ties that children have towards their family, community, country, parents, elders, younger children, less advantaged people, the environment as well as other key structures within contemporary society; 39. underlines with regard to RoC policies that children shall be treated as partners, capable of providing valuable feedback. This feedback should be used for national and European policy updates. LRAs can play a key role in this respect, as intermediar\u00ad ies and facilitators, using already existing good practices such as local children\u2019s councils, enabling them to have an appropriate institution for making their views heard; 40. welcomes the Commission\u2019s initiative to develop six plat\u00ad forms for communication, enabling children and young people to state their views and stresses the need to develop this initiative and to include LRAs as the actors who have the best local exper\u00ad tise and capacity to maintain this structured communication; 41. notes the need to ensure the right of the child to access qual\u00ad ity education, live in a safe and comfortable environment and to enjoy protection from all forms of physical and psychological vio\u00ad len ce, and notes the key role of LRAs in assuring these rights; ",
        "C 267/50 EN Official Journ al of the E uropean Un ion 1.10.2010 42. notes the need to ensure the right to quality education for both physically and mentally disabled children as well and restates the importance of initiatives aimed at promoting their indepen\u00ad dence and ensuring their full integration into the social environ\u00ad ment, as set out in Article 26 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union. Two diverging concepts exist in the field of education: one, which proposes the development of special teaching and training programmes, and another which proposes the maximum possible integration of disabled children into gen\u00ad eral mainstream schooling. The CoR calls on the LRAs, national authorities, pedagogical academia, NGOs as well as on all relevant stakeholders to engage in a Europe-wide debate on possible solu\u00ad tions and best practices in this field, and to make its results avail\u00ad able to all those who wish to improve their expertise in this field. To this end, attention is drawn to experiments with integrating disabled children that offer real opportunities to all and do not generate any form of marginalisation or exclusion, and which should be encouraged; 43. notes the importance of quality education and continuous training for social and other specialists who work with children; 44. notes the concerns relating to violation of the Rights of the Child, reflected in a number of ways, ranging from bullying that tends to generate a copycat effect reproducing inappropriate behaviour, to other forms of psychological and physical violence exerted by children towards other children, and all types of abuse, especially at school; 45. considers that children\u2019s proper development is at risk if they spend too much time on virtual social networks and immersed in computer games and virtual worlds. Such virtual activities often reduce children\u2019s opportunities for developing social skills and acquiring the knowledge they need. All the insti\u00ad tutions concerned should therefore take due steps to ensure that children develop an understanding that information technologies and virtual worlds are primarily tools for achieving real-world goals; 46. draws attention to the benefits that \u2018street life\u2019 can have on the comprehensive development of children, such as learning to use public space, and to grow, socialise and interact with each other and their commun ities, an d poin ts to the reverse dan gers of such street life, which in some areas and cities of Europe can degenerate into youth gangs; 47. in the context of the above two points, the CoR calls on the LRAs of the Member States to engage more actively in the exchange of best practice on the organisation of extracurricular activities for children, as a means of developing their social and professional skills. Examples of best practice shall be further pro\u00ad moted at national and European level, fostering respective orien\u00ad tation of national and European instruments; 48. calls on the Commission to involve as many stakeholders as possible in the process of developing the Rights of the Child Scoreboard, including the relevant European Union agencies, non-governmental organisations, LRAs and the Committee of the Reg ions; 49. considers that in view of the rapid development of Infor\u00ad mation Technologies (IT) and the technological possibilities for using such technology to perpetrate various forms of child abuse, the promotion of a safer internet should be considered to be a key task for the EU; 50. stresses the fact that the concept of a safer internet should include the fight against child abuse and child-pornography on the internet, as well as other, widespread forms of violence which occur in the virtual world, such as cyber bullying; 51. considers that the education of children and adults who interact with and influence children can significantly help prevent and tackle internet-related child abuse. Key attention must be paid to training children and adults, especially those who work with children - such as professionals in the area of healthcare, educa\u00ad tion and social work - on the safe use of the internet, recognizing cyber crimes and other internet-based malevolent activities, and on how to report to the relevant authorities; 52. draws attention to the need to protect children from nega\u00ad tive social environments, and in particular from environments that promote the consumption of psychotropic substances (alco\u00ad hol, tobacco, drugs and other substances that are harmful to men\u00ad tal and physical health). Local and regional authorities have a key role here: they are the first link in the social security chain, work\u00ad ing to ensure the peaceful and safe development of children. The local and regional authorities have a responsibility to observe, identify and assess potential risks and to use all available resources to avert them. National and European institutions, for their part, including the Children\u2019s Ombudsmen, non-governmental organi\u00ad sations and other social and economic partners, need to support local and regional authorities in this field in various ways and to promote negative social attitudes towards the consumption of psychotropic substances. Financial and support measures 53. Stresses that LRAs shall be regarded as essential partners in the development and implementation of the European Strategy on the Rights of the Child, as well as in the other European ini\u00ad tiatives in the field of children rights; 54. considers that all programmes and tools developed within this Strategy must be available to regional and local administrations; 55. welcomes the positive effect of European funding and sup\u00ad port instruments, such as the Daphne programme towards the protection of the Rights of the Child, yet regrets the scarcity of resources, inadequacy of information on financing and support possibilities provided. The results of this programme shall be stra\u00ad tegically linked to the implementation of the EU Strategy on the Rights of the Child an d used to shape future policies; ",
        "1.10.2010 EN Official Journ al of the E uropean Un ion C 267/51 56. draws attention to the fact that local and regional authori\u00ad ties across Europe have already accumulated significant experi\u00ad ence in using EU assistance for the protection of the Rights of the Child, in partnership with other actors. The results of such activi\u00ad ties shall be strategically linked to the implementation of the EU Strategy on the Rights of the Child, regularly published, discussed and used as valuable input for relevant policy updates; 57. calls on the Commission to improve the communication and information on existing support and funding schemes available for LRAs, foreseeing the support possibilities for initiatives related to the Rights of the Child, both explicitly ori\u00ad ented, such as the Daphne III Programme, as well as those where it can be identified among other priorities, such as the cross- border cooperation programmes, urban development pro\u00ad grammes, (e.g. URBACT II), etc. All financial resources, available under different EU budget headings and in different fields, should be made clearer and be communicated more effectively, avoiding duplication, thus increasing the efficiency of the activities carried out. Brussels, 10 June 2010. The President of the Committee of the Regions Mercedes BRESSO "
