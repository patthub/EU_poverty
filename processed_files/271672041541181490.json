        "Errors do not mean that EU money is lost, wasted or affected by fraud - the Commission has zero tolerance to fraud . The EU budget has an advanced framework for evaluating and reporting on performance, with clear objectives, indicators and monitoring arrangements. Rules give guidance about how the money should be spent, what results should be achieved and make sure the process is monitored strictly. The Commission works hand in hand with Member States along the way, collecting data and making sure every euro achieves results in areas that matter to citizens \u2013 such as jobs, growth, security and migration. The Commission implements the EU budget in a complex environment , with a wide variety of partners, such as Member States (75% of the EU budget), international organisations, NGOs, and universities. The Commission\u2019s aim is to effectively protect the EU budget and ensure that, once a programme is closed and all controls carried out, the remaining risk of errors is below 2% - the level considered by the European Court of Auditors as material. Multiannual control systems reduce the risk of mismanagement and protect the EU budget. The Commission reports annually on the results of audits and actions taken to improve systems. For 2018, the Commission estimates that, after corrections and recoveries, the remaining risk of error for the EU budget is below 1% . THE COMMISSION WELCOMES THE 2018 ANNUAL REPORT OF THE EUROPEAN COURT OF AUDITORS \u201cThe Commission gives the highest priority to ensuring that every euro from the EU budget is spent to the benefit of the citizens and creates EU added value. We make sure that the rules are fully respected and errors are brought down to the minimum. The European Court of Auditors is an important partner for achieving these objectives\u201d.

        "GLOBAL EUROPE \u20ac9.5 BILLION ADDRESSING CHALLENGES \u2022 The implementation of development and humanitarian funds is complex , as it is often carried out with external partners, and at times in high-risk areas. Crisis situations, political volatility and economic instability can jeopardise programme implementation. The Commission is in dialogue with its partners and in this context follows up on the findings of the European Court of Auditors. RESULTS \u2022 The EU continued to be the world\u2019s leading provider of Official Development Assistance . \u2022 The Commission provided over \u20ac1.4 billion in humanitarian aid to the most vulnerable people across more than 90 countries, with over 144 million beneficiaries. \u2022 The EU also provided leadership and support on the Iran nuclear deal, the Paris climate-change agreement and the 2030 Agenda to eradicate poverty. THE 2018 EU BUDGET \u2013 RESULTS AND CHALLENGES \u2022 As in previous years, the European Court of Auditors found this area to be free from material error . ADMINISTRATION \u20ac9.9 BILLION 13.7% 37% 6% 6% 34.8% 2% \u20ac156.7 billion SECURITY AND CITIZENSHIP \u20ac3.1 BILLION RESULTS \u2022 European Border and Coast Guard Agency operations helped rescue 37,000 migrants and catch almost 1,200 people smugglers. \u2022 The total number of irregular border crossings detected in 2018 was 92% below the total for 2015, the peak year of the migratory crisis. \u2022 The EU Civil Protection Mechanism was activated in response to 9 emergencies (such as forest fires) within the EU territory and 11 emergencies outside the EU. \u2022 Weaknesses have been found in Member States\u2019 checks of public procurement procedures . The Commission is following up with Member States to help them improve their management and control systems. ADDRESSING CHALLENGES EU REVENUE IN 2018 The Commission welcomes the 2018 results and is taking action to address challenges. RESULTS \u2022 Erasmus+ enabled around 800,000 teachers, education staff and youth workers to acquire new skills abroad. \u2022 The Enterprise Europe Network helped an estimated 250,000 small and medium-sized enterprises develop their business outside their home country, which resulted in 2,611 international partnership agreements signed between them. \u2022 Horizon 2020 is the largest publicly funded Research and Innovation funding program in the world. With \u20ac77 billion budget over the period 2014-2020 \u2013 it is already supporting more than 300,000 researchers, including 17 Nobel Prize laureates, and innovators. More than 555 patents have already been granted with another 800 pending approval. \u2022 Youth unemployment decreased from 24% in 2014 to 14% in December 2018. ADDRESSING CHALLENGES \u2022 The outcome of research and innovation projects is by nature uncertain. Projects are monitored and assessed and appropriate action taken, if required. \u2022 Respecting rules can be particularly challenging for new or smaller beneficiaries like SMEs \u2013 the Commission has simplified rules and launched communication campaigns to help newcomers access EU funding. COMPETITIVENESS FOR GROWTH AND JOBS \u20ac21.4 BILLION ECONOMIC, SOCIAL AND TERRITORIAL COHESION \u20ac54.5 BILLION RESULTS \u2022 Cohesion policy funds have helped create 1.3 million jobs in the EU over the last 10 years. Over 8.9 million people have gained a new qualification. \u2022 More than 1 million projects all over Europe had been selected by December 2018; projects are supporting regions and citizens for example by investing in education and health, by connecting territories and by protecting their environment. \u2022 Cohesion policy has been a major source of public investment in many Member States providing, for example, almost 9% of general government capital expenditure on average in the EU28 in 2015-2017. ADDRESSING CHALLENGES \u2022 As national/regional authorities are implementing 419 programmes , a high quality of their work is key to protecting the EU budget. Member States should ensure that the expenditure they declare for reimbursement to the Commission does not contain errors. The Commission audits, provides guidance, and ensures exchanges of best practices. Based on all available audit results, including those of the European Court of Auditors, the Commission interrupts/suspends payments if necessary and requests systems to be improved . It can also apply financial corrections. \u2022 The absorption of funds in some programmes is still slow. The Commission monitors these programmes and assists concerned Member States to improve the situation. Figures source: European Commission Own resources As in previous years, the European Court of Auditors found this area to be free from material error . Gross national income Customs duties Value added tax Other revenue 13% 10% 66% 11% Payments made in 2018 SUSTAINABLE GROWTH: NATURAL RESOURCES ADDRESSING CHALLENGES \u2022 Positive audit results should be maintained. Progress has been made in many Member States. Some challenges remain, particularly in the field of rural development. The Commission actively monitors the implementation of Member States\u2019 action plans. \u2022 Measuring results of the CAP is complex. The Commission has proposed a performance-based delivery model for the CAP post-2020. \u20ac58 BILLION RESULTS \u2022 More than 6.5 million farms, covering 90% of farmed land , benefited from direct payments. \u2022 20.7% of the budget was earmarked for spending on climate action across all EU programmes, including the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP). The European Court of Auditors\u2019 audit results are good, showing that direct payments in the CAP (\u20ac41.5 billion in 2018) are free from material error. ",

The timely adoption of the next MFF is essential for the sustained implementation of EU programmes. A strong focus on European added value A more transparent structure of the future budget making it easier to understand Simpler rules enabling beneficiaries\u2019 easier access to EU funds. Greater flexibility to ensure rapid reaction in a fast-changing world This publication covers selected messages from the Commission replies to the 2018 Annual Report of the European Court of Auditors as well as from the Commission\u2019s 2018 Integrated Financial and Accountability Reporting. The Commission fully or partially accepts all recommendations made by the European Court of Auditors in the Annual Report. The detailed replies of the Commission are included at the end of the European Court of Auditors\u2019 report (www.eca.europa.eu). What are the key challenges for measuring performance? Agreement on the objectives . Acceptance that the policy context evolves and might lead to priority changes. Wise use of available indicators measuring performance. Quantitative indicators cannot be used mechanically but have to be put in the right context and be combined with qualitative information. Acknowledgement that the evaluation of the multi-annual programmes takes time . Yearly snapshots do not provide for a credible picture. Are the outstanding commitments problematic? No, contrary to frequent claims, the EU budget is not at risk because of the committed money which is not yet paid. This actually is the RAL (reste \u00e0 liquider in French). It is a normal feature of all multi-annual budgets. With projects lasting several years before they are completed, it is normal to have a time lag between the initial commitments and actual payments. The time lag depends mainly on the duration of projects financed and rules applied to each programme. The Commission strictly monitors the RAL and takes action whenever it considers that the implementation of the EU budget is too slow. It takes the developments into account in the planning, e.g. in the proposal for the next long-term budget. Why do the European Court of Auditors and the Commission have different audit approaches? Two different purposes : the European Court of Auditors provides an annual audit opinion for the EU budget overall while the Commission wants assurance on the functioning of its multiannual management and control systems. The European Court of Auditors estimates a level of error based on a sample. The Commission builds assurance \u2018bottom-up\u2019, involving the results of hundreds of thousands of checks on EU expenditure. The Commission needs detailed information to identify problems and take appropriate action, e.g. asking a Member State to improve its management and control systems. The Commission estimates risk at two stages : at payment and at closure. The Commission\u2019s aim is to ensure that, once a programme is closed and all controls carried out, the remaining risk of error remains below 2%. In 2018, this risk was below 1%. What is the potential financial risk to the EU budget? The EU budget\u2019s exposure to such risk comes mainly in the form of potential obligations that may lead to EU budget payments in future years if they materialise (contingent liabilities). Contingent liabilities have increased in recent years due to the modern use of the EU financial means. To maximise the potential impact of the EU budget , we use it increasingly to leverage external funds. This happens in the form of budgetary guarantees that generate future potential obligations. A robust risk management framework by the Commission ensures an effective oversight of the financial risk. Contingent liabilities are disclosed in a transparent manner in the EU annual accounts. "
