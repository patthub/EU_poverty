INTRODUCTION 1. On 29 May 2018, the Commission adopted the proposal for the Common Provisions Regulation (CPR) 1 . The CPR sets out common provisions for seven shared management funds: the Cohesion Fund, the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund, the European Regional Development Fund, the European Social Fund Plus, the Asylum and Migration Fund, the Border Management and Visa Instrument and the Internal Security Fund. 1 Doc. 9511/18 + ADD 1. ",
        "10879/20 AFG/MP/cs 2 ECOMP.2 EN 2. The CPR was presented to the Structural Measures Working Party in June 2018 during the Bulgarian Presidency. The detailed examination of the CPR took place under the Austrian and the Romanian Presidencies. In order to make the discussions more effective and efficient, work within the Council on the CPR was divided in thematic blocks. The Permanent Representatives Committee endorsed (partial) mandates for negotiations with the European Parliament on the various CPR blocks 2 on 17 December 2018 under Austrian Presidency, and on 15 February, 3 and 17 April, and 29 May 2019 during the Romanian Presidency. 3. On 14 January 2020, together with the proposal for establishing the Just Transition Fund (JTF), the Commission proposed various amendments to the CPR 3 in order to embed the JTF as a new fund under the umbrella rules of the CPR. On 28 May 2020, following the COVID- 19 outbreak, and as part of the revised MFF 2021-27 and of the Recovery Package, the Commission proposed various amendments to the Cohesion policy legislative package 2021- 2027, including additional amendments to the CPR 4 . Both amended Commission proposals for the CPR were presented to the Structural Measures Working Party on 4 June, during the Croatian Presidency, followed by detailed examination on 15 June. The Structural Measures Working Party discussed the Presidency compromise proposals on the amended CPR at its meetings on 3, 9 and 16 July, under the German Presidency. On 22 July 2020, the Permanent Representatives Committee endorsed a (partial) mandate for negotiations with the European Parliament as regards both amended Commission proposals for the CPR 5 . 4. The partial mandate for negotiations has to be updated to take account of the European Council Conclusions adopted in the special meeting of the European Council of 17, 18, 19, 20 and 21 July 2020. 2 Doc. 11149/19 (consolidated version of all CPR partial mandates). 3 Doc. 5259/20 + ADD1. 4 Doc. 8399/20 + ADD1. 5 Doc. 9428/20.

        "10879/20 AFG/MP/cs 3 ECOMP.2 EN II. WORK WITHIN THE COUNCIL 5. Updates reflecting the European Council Conclusions were discussed in the Structural Measures Working Party in its meetings on 8, 11, 15 and 18 September 2020. These include both provisions on the Articles of the CPR as well as on Annex XXII on the allocation methodology. 6. Concerning the amendments to other Annexes of the CPR as proposed by the Commission in its January and May 2020 amending CPR proposals, an adjustment to Annex I CPR is also incorporated in this partial mandate, while other Annexes (particularly Annex II, V and VII) may still require further update at technical level and are thus excluded from this partial mandate. 7. Substantial progress has been made at working party level on the updates of the CPR reflecting the European Council Conclusions. Following the Structural Measures Working Party on 18 September, the Presidency is of the view that, based on the principle that \"nothing is agreed until everything is agreed\", a balanced compromise text has emerged which has been supported by a majority of Member States. III. WAY FORWARD 8. The Permanent Representatives Committee is, therefore, invited to agree on a partial mandate for negotiations with the European Parliament and to confirm the compromise proposed by the Presidency on the updates of the CPR reflecting the July European Council Conclusions, as set out in the Annex to this note.
