        "1 1 Local Governance and Non-state actors Support Programme - LGNSP Background 1.1 Introduction The Government of Lesotho, through the Ministry of Local Government (MoLG), is pur- suing the policy of decentralisation to strengthen public service delivery at the local level, to entrench democratic roots and to realise the goals set in the national vision (2020) of the country. The process is driven by the government to achieve the reforms needed to deepen de- mocracy and improve service delivery in the districts. Although the Local Government Act was enacted in 1997, the process only began effectively in 2005 with the local gov- ernment elections and the subsequent creation of the local councils. The MoLG, holding the overall responsibility for the process, articulated according to the Local Government Act the devolution of responsibilities to: a) the municipality (only Maseru), b) the districts, and c) the Community Councils. \u2022 The Municipality (only Maseru) \u2022 The Districts \u2022 The Community Councils The European Commission (EC) recently launched the Local Governance and Non-state actors Support Programme (LGNSP) to strengthen local government structures at Dis- trict and Community Council level and to promote greater involvement and effective participation of Non-State Actors (NSAs) in local governments. In this context, the EC is working closely with the LGNSP to develop district and com- munity council profiles in the northern districts of Lesotho in order to assist District Councils (DC), the Community Councils (CC) and the Community-based Organisations (CBOs) in their planning, budgeting and monitoring capacities.

        "District Council Mokhotlong 1 2 This handbook is the result of a profiling exercise to assist the development planning efforts of the MoLG. It contains detailed, up-to-date, relevant, accessible and accurate information describing the major characteristics of the subject district. The main aim of this handbook is to create a baseline survey for further local develop- ment interventions and to serve as a planning tool at community and district level, as well as to serve as a reference guide for all stakeholders involved in district planning efforts. 1.2 Methodology The profiling exercise entailed conducting several appraisals in the field of the physical and geographic features of the region. This was followed by a broad review of secondary sources and standard national statistics from different official sources. These data were corroborated with surveys, discussions, workshops and interviews with major stakehold- ers at the national, district and Community Council level. The information was collected through various means of validation, workshops in Com- munity and District Councils, and quantitative questionnaires to complete a set of data templates. Key informant interviews were also conducted to contribute to the qualitative aspect of the study. The District and Community profiling assignment was developed in four sequential phases as shown in Table 2.1.1. The respective outputs of each phasecontributed to the overall composition of the District and Community Council information profiling.

        "1 7 Local Governance and Non-state actors Support Programme - LGNSP D i s t r i c t p r o fi l e 2.1 Introduction Mokhotlong is a Sesotho term meaning the place of the bald ibis. The Mokhotlong district includes the highest terrain in the Maloti ranges and is also the source of the Senqu River \u2013 Lesotho\u2019s and Southern Africa\u00b4s primary watershed. The district has an area of 4.075 km\u00b2 and a population of approximately 95,441 1 \u2013 which represents 5% of the total popu- lation of Lesotho. Primarily a rural district, the Mokhotlong district is one of the poorest and most remote areas of Lesotho and of Southern Africa. The capital and only town in the district is Mokhotlong, with an estimated population of 7,400. In the east, Mokhotlong borders on the KwaZulu-Natal province of South Africa. The northern point borders on the Free State province. Domestically, it shares borders with the following districts: \u2022 Botha-Bothe district - northwest \u2022 Leribe district - west \u2022 Thaba-Tseka district - south 2.2 Administrative structure of the district Local government in Lesotho enjoys constitutional status. According to the constitu- tion of the country (Section 106.1), \u2018Parliament shall establish such local authorities as it deems necessary to enable urban and rural communities to determine their affairs and to develop themselves. Such authorities shall perform such functions as may be con- ferred by an Act of Parliament 2 \u2019. In 1997, the parliament passed Local Government Act no 6, and in1998 the Local Govern- ment Election Act. In 2004, amendments were enacted in the Act to reduce the number of local councils, and to ensure that one third of all seats was reserved for women. According to the local government legislation, urban areas have single-tier municipal or urban councils. In rural areas, directly elected Community Councils are the lower tier and the indirectly elected District Councils representing Community Councils are second tier. There are ten administrative districts, 128 Community Councils, ten District Councils, and the municipal council of the capital city of Maseru. Local government elections were held on 30 April 2005 based on a first-past-the-post electoral system. This was a significant democratic development. The establishment of local government was adopted by the Cabinet on 10 February 2004, envisioning the Local Government system as based on political devolution and decentralisation of functions, staff, and finances within the framework of a unitary state. 1 Census of Population and Housing.

        "1 8 District Council Mokhotlong D i s t r i c t p r o fi l e The aim was therefore to bring democracy and its opportunities closer to the communi- ties. Key local functions as stipulated in the Local Government Act are: natural resources, land allocation, grazing rights, markets, building permits, local administration of central licences and regulations, bus terminals, burial, fire protection, education, family welfare and public health, physical planning, roads and public transportation, cemeteries, environ- ment, parks, sports and recreation, forestry and agricultural improvement. Table 2.2.1: Lesotho local government structure A District Council (DC) consists of members who are indirectly elected. Two members are nominated by each Community Council from among its members, one of whom must be the chairperson of the Community Council. Traditional authorities are repre- sented through two gazetted chiefs of the district, who also have to be members of the Community Councils. According to the law at least one third (33%) of the members of all councils must be women. The District Council elects a chairperson and vice chairper- sons. The chairperson serves as the head of the elected body, presides over all meetings of the council and is responsible for giving policy directives to the DC Secretary. ",

Senqu 2.3 History The Mokhotlong district sits at the top of the rainy, cold and windblown Drakensberg ridge, which includes Southern Africa\u2019s highest mountain - Thabana Ntlenyana (3,482 m). The mountains have represented a frontier, largely empty and inhospitable, where the only inhabitants were the remnant bands of San hunter-gathers. For centuries, the great chiefs of the Leribe used the mountain\u2019s untouched pastures as refuge for their livestock. In order to avoid conflict with neighbouring tribes and Free State Afrikaner settlements, livestock was driven by herders to the distant valleys. The real population expansion into the settlements of the Lesotho mountains began in 1880 after the Gun War. By the turn of the century, the San had also been effectively assimilated into the Basotho nation and the mountains had been colonised. Initially, there were no permanent mountain settlements. The herders moved the live- stock up to the high altitude areas for the summer and brought them down to the foot- hills for the winter, following the traditional transhumance pattern associated with the Basotho. The earliest villages were established in the 1890s and Mokhotlong town, on the banks of Mokhotlong River, started out as a police post in 1905. Gradually, Mokhotlong developed into a trading centre supplied by South Africa\u2019s Natal province by ponies crossing the Drakensberg. The Leribe chief maintained control over grazing in Mokhotlong until 1940 when the Mokhotlong district was created. D i s t r i c t p r o fi l e ",
        "2 1 Local Governance and Non-state actors Support Programme - LGNSP A second wave of settlement started in 1920 with the establishment of chiefs under the British colonial government. This was seen as a mechanism of indirect rule of its govern- ance by the British. This included the placing of the chief Seeiso as the principal chief of Thabang in 1925 \u2013also a period in which many villages in the district were founded. 2.4 Agro-ecological characteristics Map 2.4.1: Agro-ecological zone The Mokhotlong district, with an area of about 4,075 km 2 , lies on the northeastern side of Lesotho, submerged within the mountain Agro-ecological zone which ranges between 2,130 m to 3,482 m. Mokhotlong is therefore placed in the higher lying mountains and boasts some of the highest peaks in Southern Africa, such as Thabana-Ntlenyana which stands at 3,482 m.

        "2 3 Local Governance and Non-state actors Support Programme - LGNSP Arable land constitutes less than 5% of the total arable land in the country, but is known to be gradually shrinking due to severe soil erosion and land degradation. Table 2.4.2: Arable land in the Northern Districts District Arable land in hectares Lesotho total 283,198 Botha-Bothe 13,284 Leribe 52,114 Mokhotlong 14,629 Source: Department of Crops, 2009 Most of the district is covered by a high altitude plateau and mountains which are mainly suitable for grazing. The arable land occupies the lower lying valleys and only comprises a small proportion of the rangeland, which is used predominantly for grazing domestic livestock. The production of crops is limited by the short growing season, and common crops found in the area (by order of importance) are: wheat, maize, peas, beans, pota- toes and sorghum. In general, weather patterns that result from the interaction of physiographic features and the combined influence of the Indian and Atlantic oceans reduce the duration of the growing season in the northern districts, and place severe limitations on potential crop/ land productivity by limiting the adaptability and distribution of different types of crops that can be grown in the district. This is particularly the case during the winter season. Mokhotlong District is predominantly mountainous, covered by isolated highlands where winds and rainfall are sporadic and unreliable. As a result of these Agro-ecological limita- tions and large capital outlays (that agriculture in the country calls for today), produc- tion for the market has mainly been limited to producers of traditional products such as wool and mohair. Additionally, there are a handful of richer peasants who produce grain crops mainly on a share-cropping basis, and very few enterprising poultry and vegetable farmers, usually retired civil servants or retired migrant workers, who have the necessary capital to invest. The vast majority of the farmers in the northern districts of Lesotho no longer engage in agriculture as a full-time activity, producing mainly for subsistence, and selling only occasionally to meet emergency needs of households.

The soil is fragile, with thin horizons of rich black loam which are not present in bottom valley soil. There are a number of soil associations or classifications in Lesotho. Most of these are found in the lowlands. Mokhotlong district\u2019s soil classification is not elaborate, since it is an entirely mountainous area.

This type of soil occurs at elevations above 2,000 m. The highest elevation where this soil is found is in Thabana Ntlenyane, located about 29 km south east of Mokhotlong camp. The arable soils of this association are cultivated for maize, wheat, potatoes, and peas. However, the majority of these soils are not suitable for tillage agriculture. Mat\u0161ana \u2013 Fusi-Popa Association is found in the mountain uplands and valleys in the Mokhotlong District. The soils are generally dark, shallow to deep. They occupy the basaltic mountains in the district, at elevations above 2,000 m. This soil is naturally fertile with a high humus content and is generally cultivated for maize, wheat, peas, beans and sorghum. Only peas and wheat have been proven to be adaptable to the short frost-free growing season in Mokhotlong. There is also an intermediate zone, which can be subdivided into two sub-zones: Table- lands \u2013 flat to gently rolling areas with free-draining soils, which are exposed to sun, wind and snow. Maize occupies over 80% of the area and households may or may not have ac- cess to summer grazing in cattle posts; and lateral valleys \u2013 deeply incised along the river tributaries, whose micro-climate tends to be moister in summer and more sheltered from frost, wind and snow in winter. Speciality crops such as peas, beans and potatoes are grown on rich alluvial soils in the valley bottoms. Willows and poplars line the banks of the streams and fruit trees thrive. The rangeland is generally divided into 3 distinct grazing areas. Area A is the cattle post used for summer grazing. This is the uppermost grazing area 2,500 m above sea level where there are no permanent settlements. Area B is situated in the foothills close to the village itself and is grazed as winter approaches. The area around the fields and val- ley bottom is called C and is grazed in winter. In most cases livestock spend about three months in one area before they have to move to another area. ",

The Senqunyane River rises from the Maluti Mountains in the northwest of the country, and flows south for 120 kilometres before joining the Senqu River in the southwest. The Mokhotlong and the Sanqebethu are the two major rivers. The Sanqebethu River is one of the important habitats of Maloti minnow (Pseudobarbus quathlambae), which is endemic to Lesotho. The area also contains several wetlands and bogs which are impor- tant sites located in areas of water surplus, mainly in the upper valley heads and along streams. The ecological importance of these wetlands, together with their key role as grazing resources in the livestock system, is widely recognised. The low-growing wetland vegetation is dominated by a mixture of grasses such as Agrotis spp, Poa annua, and Trifolium burchellianum. L i na k eng R v ",

At national level, 38% of children under five are \u2018undersized\u2019 (stunted), with the percentage of severely stunted exceeding 15%. Almost 50% of the children in the Mokhotlong district are undersized and more than 22% are severely undersized. Nationally, 4.3% of children are \u2018wasted\u2019, and 1.2% severely wasted (approximately the same patterns as in Mokhotlong). 20% of children under five years of age are underweight in Lesotho, while the percentage is much higher (26%) in the Mokhotlong district. Another determinant of poverty in Lesotho is livestock ownership. Analysis suggests that less than 40% of households own livestock and more than 13% of households do not have access to land. These factors, along with declining livestock numbers, stock theft, falling remittances from migrant workers, HIV/AIDS, social problems and inad- equate physical and social infrastructure, are the main causes of poverty in the district. The per capita \u201cpoverty line\u201d 1 in Lesotho is 146 Maloti per person per month, an amount based on actual expenditure 2 incurred on non-food items by households from the more deprived segments of the population. The \u201cultra poverty line\u201d was defined by half of this level, at 73 Maloti per person per month. ",

        "3 4 District Council Mokhotlong S o c i a l i n d i c a t o r s mountain areas of Mokhotlong are significantly poorer on all indicators. Extreme poverty is concentrated in the rural areas not only as a proportion of the population but also in absolute numbers. Gender also explains significant disparities in poverty in the Mokhotlong district. An estimated 40% of households in 2009 were headed by women who were single, divorced, widowed or abandoned by their husbands. Female-headed households have the highest incidence of poverty (65%) and vulnerability because they are typically headed by ageing widows, who may have lost assets they once possessed or are less likely to own agricultural assets such as livestock, and have difficulties securing cash income. 3.2.4 Coping strategies Coping strategies during lean periods include assistance from neighbours and relatives (ho sobelana), relief programmes (including cash-for-work), school supplementary fee- ding schemes, casual labour, small business activities, and small savings groups (burial societies). \u201cMafisa\u201d is a custom whereby animals are borrowed from and shared with one another. This custom is an important source of income for households without livestock. The owner lends and shares animals for, in return, access to herders and better grazing. The recipient benefits by using these animals for labour and even enjoys certain limited products (eg. milk). \u201cLesielo\u201d the lending of female animals in order to share the offspring \u2013 is a similar customary practice which may benefit poorer households. The following chapters present how Mokhotlong, along with other mountain districts, lags behind the national average in key social indicators such as education, health or wa- ter and sanitation. 3.3 The economy of the northern districts Over the past decade, the northern districts of Lesotho have experienced three impor- tant external shock factors that have had a significant impact on the economy. The first shock relates to activities associated with the Lesotho Highlands Water Project (LHWP). The project, initiated in the 1990s, was a massive infrastructure scheme to di- vert abundant water from Lesotho\u2019s highlands to one of South Africa\u2019s largest industrial provinces. During its implementation, LHWP contributed to an overall expansion of the economy and to the development of the private sector. The construction sub-sector, which benefited substantially from the LHWP, became unusually large \u2013 accounting for 23% of the GDP, but unfortunately did not bring enough wealth to the district. ",
        "3 5 Local Governance and Non-state actors Support Programme - LGNSP S o c i a l i n d i c a t o r s With the completion of the LHWP, activities associated with the export of water and electricity have continued to provide jobs and foreign exchange; however most construc- tion workers that were involved now needed to look for alternative employment. The second shock relates to retrenchments that befell South African gold mines, which had traditionally employed more than a third of the male Basotho labour force. In the last decade this has yielded two negative effects: \u2022 A dramatic decline in Basotho miners\u2019 remittances from 46% in the 1980s to 21% of GNP this decade; and \u2022 An increasing number of retrenched miners returning to Lesotho unable to find em - ployment. The northern districts were home to a high percentage of these migrants In addition to the offer of the government concerning tax incentives and provision of infrastructure in enclaves, the market-opening opportunities provided by agreements such as the Africa Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA) and the Multi-Fibre Agreement (MFA) enabled Lesotho\u2019s exports to enter the United States (US) market on a preferen- tial basis so that Lesotho\u2019s exports increased almost fivefold in six years, reaching USD 321 million in 2002 and USD 456 million in 2004. This has been particularly acute in Leribe where most of the industry has been located. But between 2005 and 2006 there was an increase in the number of firms from 48 to 52 in the region while total employment, including migration from Mokhotlong and Botha- Bothe, also increased by over 8,700 workers. One of the outcomes of the rapid inflow of garment-related FDIs is a striking dichotomy in the private sector of the Northern Districts. On the one hand, there are close to 50 foreign-owned garment factories providing close to 50,000 jobs, well connected to global supply chains and exporting almost all of their output, mostly to the US market. There is also a small Basotho-owned private sector comprising mostly micro and small firms that provide goods and services to the domestic market. This sector must compete with imports. These small service providers, mostly in Leribe are engaged primarily in trade, services, local construction, sandstone quarrying and, to a limited extent, manufacturing. These companies are disconnected from the regional supply chains of South Africa and other Southern African Development Community (SADC) countries. ",
        "3 6 District Council Mokhotlong S o c i a l i n d i c a t o r s 3.4 Gender As described in the previous chapter, a high percentage of men in Mokhotlong work in wage employment outside the district, and this means that half of the households are headed by women for the major part of the year. Such women have had to develop an extraordinary degree of self-reliance and initiative, in managing household and community affairs. As heads of households, women end up with increased social and economic responsibilities. Despite new amendments in 2006 in the institutional framework regarding the capac- ity of married people, married women are still widely regarded as legal minors and must have their husbands\u2019 permission to engage in certain economic activities such as obtaining loans. In certain instances women encounter income problems. It is es- timated that 90% of miners do not arrange for regular payments to be sent home. Women are thus strained to engage in alternative income-generating activities such as brewing, street vending or producing food to sell. The enrolment of girls in schools is higher than that of boys mainly because boys are required for extra activities such as herding, initiation school and other services. Boys are more likely to drop out of school early. The high attendance in the highlands and the mountains correlates very closely to most poverty indicators. The proportion of girls sent to school is higher than boys. In poor families, boys are used to herd animals, whilst educated girls are considered as good bride-wealth when they are married (by means of lobola). The tradition of attending initiation schools tends to keep rural-based boys out of schools. Today in 2009, according to this profiling exercise, more than 30% of households are officially headed by women. Female-headed households have the highest incidence of poverty and vulnerability, because they are headed by ageing widows, who due to customary ancestral traditions lose agricultural assets and livestock whilst, at the same time, they battle to secure cash income.

A further 25,000 were employed in other industries. Half of the gross national income was generated from remittances. The number of mine-workers remained at that level until 1990 but there was subsequently a sustained decline and there are now only approximately 60,000 miners. More than 14% of males and 4% of females 4 over the age of 15 currently work in South Africa, which is the equivalent of approximately 120,000 people. It is estimated that 35% are from the Mokhotlong District. Between 1986 and 1996, the Mokhotlong district had the second largest out-migration rate in Lesotho. Out-migration to work in mines is declining but there has been an increasing rural-urban migration to Maseru. The relative improvement of communication with the highlands has resulted in stimulated migration for economic opportunities and education. 4. According to the 2007 Lesotho Demographic Survey. ",

The govern- ment has to a certain extent been held to account for this, as it subsidises cereal crop production. On the other hand, over the years households have also subsidised their agricultural costs by diverting income from mine remittances to crop production. In a self-subsistence framework, few households keep proper records and are aware that costs often exceed their returns.

        "4 2 District Council Mokhotlong A g r i c u l t u r e In the mountains, where direct agricultural costs are lower because people tend to use animal traction, manure and their own seeds, crop production is profitable but the amounts grown fall far short of the requirements. Altogether, fewer than 5% of house- holds produce enough cereals to feed their families throughout the year, with the re- mainder having to purchase part or all of their cereals. Diagram 4.2.2: Planted area for wheat in Mokhotlong Source: Ministry of Agriculture, 2008 Mokhotlong produces around 30% of the total food required to feed its population in a normal year. This means that 60% of the annual cereal requirement has to be imported at the going regional market price. Household purchasing power therefore plays an im- portant role in household food security. This in effect means that, overall, households are more vulnerable to increases in the price of maize than they are to low crop production as a result of erratic weather patterns.

        "4 3 Local Governance and Non-state actors Support Programme - LGNSP A g r i c u l t u r e Most rural dwellers face food income deficits and interventions have been poised to pro- vide more than food aid. This is because the current food access problems in Mokhotlong are a result of low food production, increases in the price of staple foods and depressed employment markets. The decline in mine remittances has had an impact on food production as far fewer households have the necessary income to invest in the required inputs. For poor house- holds, the annual practice of procuring the required inputs for cereal production is al- most insurmountable. In the past this would have been overcome through sharecropping with other households, but as the number of people without wage employment grows, the prospects for sharecropping have declined. Because of changing weather patterns and the harsh conditions of the highlands in Mokhotlong, the Basotho live far from their fields and their cattle. The pattern of set- tlement is such that people and animals are separated from the land which they use to produce their food. The most serious implication of this is that it is virtually impossible to maintain fertility as the distances between the sources of soil nutrition (manure) and the fields are excessive. Fertility and soil conditions steadily decline as the majority of families are unable to find the means to transport manure to the fields and are unable to afford artificial fertilisers. Depletion of organic matter in the soil results in a reduction of the soil\u2019s capacity to retain moisture, which in turn means that crops are increasingly vulnerable to dry spells, that they might otherwise have survived in the past. 4.3 Livestock production and marketing Livestock production is the most important component of the agricultural sector in Mokhotlong. Livestock represents a source of cash income, food, draw power, manure and transport. Livestock is also an important part of the Basotho culture, and an impor- tant reserve of wealth and security.

        "4 4 District Council Mokhotlong A g r i c u l t u r e Since the 1980s, livestock numbers in the district have declined due to the following reasons: low conception rates, high abortion rates, high mortality rates, high prevalence of disease and poor access to veterinary services. However the most important reason cited thus far is that of livestock theft. For the most part, cattle breeding is not controlled and the number of improved bulls is very limited.

Average life expectancy has declined (presumably due to HIV/AIDS). Poverty has increased and with it the infant mortality, under-five child mortality, and maternal mortality rates. Morbidity and mortal- ity from communicable diseases such as tuberculosis, HIV/AIDS and non-communicable diseases have all increased in recent years. The HIV/AIDS epidemic in Lesotho (29 per- cent of the population aged 15-49 are infected with HIV5) has contributed to these nega- tive trends in Mokhotlong, but there is an overall sense that the quality of health services has also declined compared to the higher quality primary care system that existed in the 1980s. 5 Annual Joint Review Report 2007/08 FY. 5 C H A P T E R ",

Primary enrolment fell from 71% of children aged 6 to 12 in 1996 to 61% in 1999. In the year 2000, the GoL introduced free primary education to reverse the trend, which is being implemented every year. By 2002, this had raised enrolment to 85% of children between 6 and 12. As can be seen in the annexes, enrolment increased dramatically and the gap between boys and girls narrowed. However, at the same time there was an increase in the pupil-teacher ratio and a decline in the percentage of qualified teachers. The educational system in Mokhotlong shows high repetition and dropout rates, with at least one half of primary enrolment traditionally dropping out before completing the pri- mary cycle and about two thirds of secondary enrolment dropping out before graduating. 6 C H A P T E R ",

The programme, spearheaded by the Department of Rural Water Supplies (DRWS), was closely integrated with sanitation and health education, all of which attracted substantial donor funding, leading to a sharp increase in coverage from 15% of the population in 1984 to 56% in the mid-1990s. The objective was to supply 30 litres of clean water per capita per day within a distance of 150 metres. This important programme has suffered setbacks with the phasing out of donor support. Coverage fig- ures are said to have gone down due to system failures that resulted from poor mainte- nance and management problems. Most of the rural water supplies in Mokhotlong are extracted from ground water sour- ces and the choice of technology is given serious consideration. Gravity-fed systems are preferred where they are technically and economically feasible since they are found to be more reliable and involve lower maintenance costs than hand and electric/diesel pumps. For reticulation, the preferred choice is the provision of a communal standpipe or hand pump for every 100 persons in a village.When funds are a constraint, rural communities are provided with a source protection as an interim measure.

        "5 9 Local Governance and Non-state actors Support Programme - LGNSP W a t e r s e c t o r 7.3 The rural sanitation programme Official figures show that only 20% of the population in Mokhotlong has access to ad- equate sanitation facilities. The coverage for sanitation is lower in the mountains, where less than 10% of the population has adequate sanitation. The ventilated improved pit latrine is by far the most popular sanitation technology in the district, as shown in the figures. In fact, on-site sanitation systems will remain the most cost-effective technological solu- tion to environmental protection in the foreseeable future. Sewer toilet facilities are con- fined to isolated settlements such as mission schools and also confined to urban areas where less than 5% of the population has access. Pit latrines do not cause serious environmental problems in Lesotho since ground water tables are generally \u00b130 metres deep. However, only 25% meet the ventilated improved pit latrine standard that requires pit latrines to have a fly screen, concrete slab, and intact door. Associated with this is the fact that in peri-urban areas, inadequate designs of conservancy tanks and their poor maintenance and infrequent emptying pose serious threats to the environment and health. Blockages, overflows, leakages and offensive odours have become very frequent in recent years as the urban population grows faster than facilities. Less than 20% of households have proper ventilated improved pit latrines \u2013 considered to be the only standard that affords adequate protection from a health point of view.

        "6 2 District Council Mokhotlong R o a d s e c t o r 8.1 Introduction Mokhotlong is an isolated mountainous district that poses a challenge in accessing com- mercial, urban areas as well as the capital \u2013 Maseru. Road transportation links are vital to any district development strategy. Given Mokhotlong\u00b4s landlocked location and mountai- nous terrain, it is critical to have an efficient transport system that ensures cost-effective accessibility to economic opportunities, markets and basic services, as well as reliable links to external markets and ports. 8.2 Roads and road transport Roads and road transport are the backbone of the transportation system in Mokhotlong. Private vehicle ownership is relatively low; however public transport is operated by private companies and individuals. Most of the roads in Mokhotlong are concentrated in the lowland portions of the district. Roads are very few in the mountain district of Mokhotlong. Although there is an arterial road that connects the districts of Leribe and Botha-Bothe with Mokhotlong, very few rural roads connect villages and towns within the district in the mountainous parts of Mokhotlong, which comprise 75% of the total area of the district and where 8% of the total population live. This extreme isolation results in poor access to basic services and commodities, as well as market opportunities. Poor access through the mountain zones also hinders com- munication within the country, and prevents continuous outlets to ports beyond the country\u2019s surrounding borders with South Africa. The Mokhotlong district consists primarily of villages connected only by gravel roads and bridle paths. A small percentage of the population has vehicles: most people travel on horseback and use public transport if they have to travel long distances. ",

Almost 90% of energy con- sumption in the rural areas is sourced from indigenous biomass fuels consisting of shrubs, firewood, crop residues and animal waste. This has resulted in the depletion of reserves of woody plants and animal droppings that might have been used to enrich the soil. Elec- tricity access was limited to about 14% of households in 2005 and most connections are found in the lowlands.

Other fuels such as liquefied petroleum gas and coal play a minor role in rural areas. A few rural households use photovoltaic (PV) systems or diesel/petrol generators.

Questionnaire CWIQ Survey, 2002 The poorer the household, the more time spent per day collecting fuel. The wealthiest households spend an average of eight minutes a day collecting fuel, compared to more than two hours a day for the poorest. In some mountain areas, school children spend almost one day a week collecting fuel for the school kitchen. The percentage of house- holds that depend on collected fuel in Mokhotlong is around 66%. Table 9.1.2 shows the main energy sources of households for the years 1996 and 2001. The percentages of households that reported wood and dung as their main sources of energy for cooking and heating increased during these 5 years, probably as a result of deepening poverty. During the same period, the percentage of those who were using electricity for cooking and heating declined, despite the fact that electricity is a cleaner and more convenient energy source. Many households used electricity merely for lighting as it made economic sense. While the percentages of households that used natural gas and paraffin for cooking increased slightly, the percentage of those that used these for heating decreased. The Lesotho Electricity Company (PTY) LTD (LEC) is in charge of electricity connec- tions and maintenance. The profile shows how electricity connection coverage is limited to the Mokhotlong town centre and the adjacent small village of Mapholaneng.

In the last five years, the number of fixed telephone lines (21,000) has been exceeded by mobile phones (27,000). In mid-2005 mobile telephone subscribers totalled 35,000 with an average of 1.35 mobile phones per 100 people. There are 21,416 fixed telephone network connections, or one telephone line per 100 people. Maseru accounts for 71% of the main telephone lines, leaving the other nine districts to share the remaining 29%. Moreover, public telephones are only found in urban areas, confirming that telephone communication is very limited in rural areas. The challenge ahead is to ensure, through proper regulation, that the operators do not neglect rural areas in their bid to maximise profits in the more commercially attractive urban areas. Radio plays a key role in promoting various development initiatives. The broadcasting service covers about 75% of the country with the larger percentage in the urban areas. ",
        "6 9 Local Governance and Non-state actors Support Programme - LGNSP N o n - S t a t e A c t o r s ( N S A s ) Non-State Actors (NSAs) 11.1 Introduction Many NSAs in Lesotho are actively involved with providing a means for expressing and actively addressing the varied and complex needs of different social groups. There are several Non-State Actors operating in the district of Mokhotlong. These include development partners, private sector organisations, local and foreign Non- governmental Organisation (NGO), represented either as umbrella bodies or individual entities, and Community-based Organisations (CBOs). Development partners operating in this district are mostly funding agents of various de- velopment programmes and activities from infrastructure development to save lives. The major partners are the European Commission (EC) and Irish Aid, which provide funding to implementing agencies of development programmes. Given Mokhotlong\u2019s harsh climatic conditions, the government is fully present in the district with an office of the Disaster Management Authority (DMA). The DMA provides rescue and humanitarian support to affected communities during the perennial disas- trous snowfall occurrences of the winter months in partnership with other humanitarian organisations, namely: Lesotho Red Cross and WFP. The latter two also support school fee- ding schemes and distribute supplementary feeding to HIV/AIDS affected and vul- nerable people. The Highlands Water Development Project (HWDP) is another NSAs that has been active in the western part of the Mokhotlong District, specifically in the Matsoku area where the people have generally benefited from infrastructure develop- ment and related community activities, while others benefited from compensation they received for relocation of their families. 11 C H A P T E R ",
        "7 0 District Council Mokhotlong N o n - S t a t e A c t o r s ( N S A s ) There is a spread of over thirty NGOs operating in the Mokhotlong District. They comprise international organisations, local entities, faith-based organisations, and varied CBOs. These CBOs run programmes largely focusing on improving livelihoods and food security, poverty alleviation, job creation, environmental protection and combating HIV AIDS. One of the oldest NGOs working in Mokhotlong is the Gardening for Rural and Organi- sational Well-Being (GROW) programme which has been involved in the supervision of community health and nutrition, and in community and household agricultural projects including mobilising communities to promote improved gardening techniques. It gives support by assisting people living with HIV/AIDS and provides life-style and nutrition education. There is also support for AIDS orphans including infants, and support groups in eight villages within the Liphamola Community Council. Another such NGO is the Maluti Drakensberg Development Programme (MDDP) which deals with environmental sustainability. It has worked with mountain communities in the design, operation, moni- toring and evaluation of local programmes for better environmental management. Since the retrenchment of Basotho men from the South African mining companies, the former miners have had to continue playing their bread-winner roles (due to societal expectation) and find livelihood for their families. In this regard, the Basotho Mineworkers Labour Cooperatives established across Lesotho empower ex-miners economically through poultry and block making projects and skills development. Some NGOs also advocate the interests and needs of marginalised groups including women, youth, the disabled and the poor. The Lesotho National Association of Physically Disabled Persons (LNAPDP) exists in Mokhotlong mainly for raising awareness on the plight of disabled people through the collection and processing of their information. The Lesotho National Council of Women (LNCW) and its member organisations exist to meet women\u2019s welfare needs to ensure food security and health care for their house- holds. Mobilisation and strengthening economic empowerment efforts through advocacy, awareness creation and training are undertaken in districts by NGOs under the Lesotho Council of Non governmental organisations (LCN). Mokhotlong is no exception where FIDA WLSA, LNCW, CCL, Justice and Peace and TRC have focused on training women and men on issues of gender justice to create awareness on issues of rights, political participation and empowerment as part of their thematic programme areas. They have been engaged by the ministry of local government for capacity building of community councillors. ",
        "7 1 Local Governance and Non-state actors Support Programme - LGNSP N o n - S t a t e A c t o r s ( N S A s ) Issues of health and HIV/AIDS seem to be more of a concern to many NSAs in Mokhotlong. These bodies mobilise financial, technical and human resources within their expertise of coordination, prevention, home-based care and awareness creation to name a few. In Mokhotlong they include the National AIDS Commission (NAC) which is the body coordinating national response to HIV/AIDS in Lesotho. The NAC is very well resourced and is represented in all 10 districts of Lesotho where it works in collaboration with the private sector, NGOs and local communities including 20 support groups in Mokhotlong close to Mokhotlong Hospital and the Health Centres of Malefiloane and Semenanyana These groups drive the NAC strategic programmes of prevention, treatment, care support and impact mitigation (i.e. impacts of HIV such as increase in OVC) and management and coordination (including M&E and resource mobilisation). NAC also works with the DC and together they have produced an action plan for the district. Care Lesotho, UNICEF and the Lesotho Red Cross provide work with orphans and vulnerable children through educational and general welfare assistance. There are also a number of food security interventions in support of people living with HIV/AIDS. In this regard the World Food Programme (WFP), based in Leribe, distributes food to these groups using local health centres to ensure adherence to current targeting and monitoring. Community-based Organisations are indigenous entities that take care of the socio- economic needs of their members. They are usually voluntary and grassroots-based. The most common are cooperatives and farmers associations, burial associations and, of late, the community support group. These groupings are found to exist in many communities and villages in Mokhotlong. By working closely with NAC, health centres and Community Council support groups, CBOs appear to be seeking partnerships with other stakeholders beyond cost sharing for the whole development process, including management support and service provision. There are also some groups targeting certain social interest groups within communities such as the Lesotho Society of Mentally Handicapped Persons (LSMHP), which advocates services for children with mental disabilities.

Standard Lesotho Bank (SLB) has a branch in the town centre for the provision of commercial and personal financial services. There is also a Post Bank office for savings and financial transactions for old age pensioners. These branches are not easily accessible to most of the district\u2019s population. Other actors in the business sector are also relatively few. The Lesotho Chamber of Commerce and Industry (LCCI) acts as a business interest group representing its members in different relevant areas for supporting business development in the district. It operates as a branch of the LCCI headquarters based in Maseru. Other businesses in Mokhotlong include operators such as the Lesotho Brewing Company, Lesotho Funeral Services, Lesotho Milling Co.

There is also the Lesotho Mounted Police Service (LMPS) which reports to the Minister for Home Affairs. The National Security Service (NSS) also features on the security list and is also directly accountable to the Prime Minister and private security companies. The Lesotho Defence Force, responsible for national security and the protection of the royal family has an army, an air force and a newly formed paramilitary wing. The paramili- tary LMPS is responsible for internal policing. Apart from police services and the military, Mokhotlong has a limited number of private security firms. These firms were initially used only to protect businesses, but are now being used also by a growing number of households. The increase in the number of private security firms is believed to be directly related to negative perceptions of crime. Mokhotlong has a low crime rate which is attributed to the fact that it is rural based and has a low population density. Serious cases of crime in the district include; murder, attempted murder, rape, robbery, housebreaking, stock theft, armed robbery and car theft. Table 13.1.1 presents the statistics of crime in the district. From this table it is clear that Mokhotlong has low crime prevalence with only 6.2% of the national total. 13 C H A P T E R ",

Mokhotlong offers a very different tourism experience, with the potential of the tourism sector lying in its natural beauty, rich flora and fauna and cultural heritage. The appeal of this extraordinary district is rarely found in more commercialised destinations. Mountains, valleys, and rivers provide memorable scenery for tourists. Mokhotlong is where Lesotho gets its crystal clear water as well as green pastures for livestock. Tourism in Mokhotlong is increasing annually. Mokhotlong\u2019s formidable terrain is created by the sheer walls of the Drakensberg and Maluti Mountains, which give sanctuary to a unique developing region. The friendly Basotho from the mountains are one of the few mountain people in Africa. They have developed a rich culture, often in isolated villages. The entire district of Mokhotlong lies 1,000 m above sea level and boasts the highest peak in Africa south of Kilimanjaro \u2013 the Thabana-Ntlenyana at 3,482 m. Outdoor activities and hiking are without doubt the biggest attraction in Mokhotlong. For bird-watching enthusiasts, Mokhotlong is renowned for its large raptor population, including the Cape Vulture, the rare Bearded Vulture, the Steppe Buzzard and the Black Eagle. The Sani Pass lies on the border with South Africa and is the only viable road into Lesotho from the Kwazulu-Natal side. There is a trekking route to Thabana-Ntlenyana, on horseback. The road is suitable for 4x4s vehicles, but weather permitting, 4x2 vehicles could also drive up. 14 C H A P T E R ",
        "8 0 District Council Mokhotlong T o u r i s m The tourism sector is one industry which stands to benefit from the LHWP. It has been actively promoted by LNDC. A number of hotels, mountain lodges and a national park have been developed in recent years. It is marketed as a haven for those who enjoy back-to-nature adventures with a wide range of activities offered. The majestic beauty of its rugged mountains and the simple way of life are a major drawcard. Tourist accommodation is being continually developed. For the growing backpacker demand, there are inns and youth hostels as well as traditional Basotho-thatched rondavels. The Lesotho Tourist Board (LTB) operates overland adventure tours from Maseru which take in the scenic and historical highlights as well as offering visits to craft centres, pony trekking, skiing at Oxbow and swimming in bilharzia-free mountain streams. The development of the Katse Dam, a 45 km long water feature, will become a further attraction in the region offering water-based recreational facilities, bird watching and trout fishing. In the winter, short range skiing at Oxbow is a growing attraction. This year, 2009, will also see two new programmes implemented by the Ministry of Tour- ism. A feasibility study on the establishment of a High Altitude Training Centre at Mohale has already started. It is expected that the Centre will offer training facilities to the vari- ous sport disciplines to all sportspeople worldwide. The second programme is the development of Ski Resorts. The Kotisephola Skiing site at Sani in the Mokhotlong district has been declared a special development area for Tourism. An investor has been identified and an agreement has been reached for the development of the site. Mahlasela has also been identified for the establishment of a skiing resort.

Analysis of the occupancy rates reveals that Mokhotlong has a relatively high rate of 23% compared to neighbouring districts.

        "About LGNSP The Local Governance & Non State Actor Support Programme (LGNSP) is a European Union funded initiative implemented in partnership with the Ministry of Finance and Development Planning. It aims to deepen local democracy, improve local governance and reduce poverty through the creation of a supportive and enabling environment at community and district level which strengthens dialogue around effecting social change and furthers citizen participation in Lesotho. To this end, the programme broadly aims to enhance the active participation of citizens, local authorities and non-state actors in Lesotho in the debate about local governance and decentralisation legal and regulatory framework. It aims also at generating confidence in the government reform and the institutions of democracy, ensuring the promotion and protection of political, socio and economic rights, and supporting a culture of accountability, transparency and equity. It also operates a grant-making fund for local development initiatives, capacity building and organizational development interventions. About this publication The handbook presents detailed, up-to-date, relevant, accessible and accu- rate information describing the major characteristics of the district, serving as a useful reference guide for all stakeholders involved in district planning efforts. This handbook is the result of a methodological process of both quantitative and qualitative investigation. The profiling exercise started by conducting field work appraisals of the physical and geographical features of the region, followed by a broad review of existing secondary sources of available data and standard national statistics from different official sources. This data was combined with surveys, discussions workshops and interviews of major stakeholders at national, district and community council level. L S - 8 0 - 0 9 - 6 0 4 - E N - C "
