        "Foreword 3 Foreword There is no doubt that global peace and stability is largely underpinned by our ability to feed people and provide a basis for good health. However, guaranteeing food and nutrition security in a changing world has become a huge challenge, due to the compounded effects of climate change, resource scarcity and population dynamics. Access to food is a major driver in the current migration crisis that Europe is experiencing. These developments provide a framework for action, reflected in the Commission priorities, COP 21 climate commitments and the UN Sustainable Development Goals. It also provides an opportunity for Europe to take a leadership role in transforming and future-proofing our food systems. It was on this basis that I and the Commissioner for Agriculture Phil Hogan, during the 2015 MILAN EXPO, launched the first phase of the FOOD 2030 initiative. It set out a debate with a wide diversity of stakeholders on the role of Research and Innovation (R&I) in future- proofing our currently unsustainable food systems. The result was the publication of a baseline assessment of EU food and nutrition security R&I in 2016. We are now entering the second phase of FOOD 2030 that will prepare the ground for the next EU R&I Framework Programme and outlook towards 2030. This publication provides a glimpse of how European R&I actually contribute to the systemic transformation of food value chains. It continues to encourage an open debate amongst stakeholders; to break down silos and engage in meaningful conversations about the future food systems we want. Furthermore, the publication clearly demonstrates the relevance of EU R&I to policy development and societal needs. I invite readers to take part in this process, to engage in the FOOD 2030 initiative to help us build a more coherent EU R&I policy that places sustainable food systems at its heart. Hippocrates said \u201cLet food be thy medicine and medicine be thy food\u201d. Together we can make food the new health for both humanity and the planet.

        "FOOD 2030 4 Food and nutrition security (FNS) \u2013 having access to sufficient, safe and nutritious food \u2013 supports society and communities by ensuring good health, sustainable jobs and lifelong enjoyment. To ensure that future generations achieve FNS, certain global pressures, such as population growth, urbanisation, resource scarcity and climate change, must be addressed. For example, feeding an estimated global population of 9 billion by 2050 will require a near 60 % increase in food demand. At the same time, the global and growing appetite for meat and animal protein is becoming unsustainable and is leading to a further rise in greenhouse gas emissions from the sector. The European Commission aims to tackle the FNS challenge with research and innovation (R&I) policies designed to future-proof our food systems to make them sustainable, resilient, diverse, inclusive and competitive for the benefit of society. This systemic approach, which aims to connect, scale-up and boost EU R&I, is referred to as FOOD 2030, and will provide solutions to four overarching priorities: Introduction INT-FOOD-DEF.indd 4 5/10/17 10:34 ",
        "Introduction 5 These priorities are being addressed through public and private investments, open science, research breakthroughs and increased global cooperation. The FOOD 2030 initiative connects the \u2018whole food value chain\u2019 by linking: land and sea; producers to consumers; and \u2018farm-to- fork to gut and back\u2019. In doing so it focuses heavily upon on scale up, digitisation, and promoting open innovation, education and skills. The initiative is also closely aligned with the EU commitment to the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). In this respect FOOD 2030 endorses the \u201cthe wedding cake\u201d approach to viewing the economic, social and ecological aspects of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). INT-FOOD-DEF.indd 5 5/10/17 10:34 ",
        "This implies that economies and societies are seen as embedded parts of the biosphere. This moves development away from the current sectorial approach where social, economic, and ecological development are seen as separate parts towards an economy serving society within the safe operating space of the planet. Using this model one can argue that all the sustainable development goals are directly or indirectly connected to sustainable and healthy food. In conclusion this publication outlines the FOOD 2030 philosophy towards a coherent and focused food-system approach, whereby R&I can flourish, European competiveness can grow, and global challenges can be addressed. It also provides an insight into past and ongoing efforts to build more sustainable food systems by showcasing a wide variety of EU R&I achievements across the different food chain sectors as illustrated below. They in turn provide the basis and inspiration for identifying future food systems R&I challenges. FOOD 2030 6 INT-FOOD-DEF.indd 6 5/10/17 10:34 ",

        "FOOD 2030 8 The first FOOD 2030 priority focuses on fostering R&I on nutrition for sustainable and healthy diets. The challenges under this priority include tackling malnutrition and obesity; improving nutrition for healthy ageing; sourcing protein alternatives to reduce meat consumption; developing new food authenticity and safety systems; reviving forgotten crops for nutrition and resilience; and supporting healthier and more sustainable diets in Africa. This priority aims at supporting the further development and implementation of EU food safety policies, the EU Nutrition Policy Framework and relevant targets of the Sustainable Development Goals 2, 3, 8 and 10.

        "Nutrition for sustainable and healthy diets 9 2 Tackling malnutrition and obesity Unhealthy and unsustainable diets impact human health, the environment and the economy. In Europe, some 33 million people are at risk of malnutrition while over 20 % of the adult population is obese. Almost half of the world\u2019s adult population is expected to be overweight or obese by 2030. Adopting healthy and sustainable diets is in line with SDG 3 (Ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages). Childhood obesity leads to an increase in the risk of being obese in adulthood. In addition, obesity increases the risk of disease and ill health. The rise in childhood obesity may lead to 60 million obese children by 2020. Early exposure to environmental factors, such as the nutritional environment in utero and early post-natal nutrition can influence the risk of childhood obesity. Reducing childhood and infant obesity relates to the UN\u2019s call to address the nutritional needs of adolescent girls, pregnant and lactating women, and older persons, one of the targets of SDG 2 (End hunger, achieve food security and improved nutrition and promote sustainable agriculture). 2 Improving nutrition for healthy ageing The number of Europeans over 65 will double in the next 50 years while the over 80s will almost triple. While life expectancy will continue to increase, unhealthy ageing can place a heavy burden on both healthcare systems and families. Heart attacks, strokes, diabetes and cancer cost EU economies EUR 115 billion or 0.8 % of GDP annually. Improving healthy ageing through nutrition is relevant to achieving one of the targets of SDG 10 (Reduce inequality within and among countries), which aims to empower and promote the social, economic and political inclusion of all by 2030. 2 Supporting protein alternatives to meat The ever-increasing global demand for protein cannot be sustainably met through conventional farming alone, given its large carbon footprint. This has created an opportunity for the alternative proteins market, which is set to double by 2024. R&I support for alternative proteins can help end hunger and ensure everyone has access to safe, nutritious food by 2030, one of the targets of SDG 2. 2 Ensuring food authenticity and developing future safety systems Food safety remains a global concern, with related social and economic costs unacceptably high. Almost one- third of all deaths from food-borne diseases occur in children under five, although they make up just 9 % of the global population. Setting up increasingly robust and ICT-enabled fraud and food safety systems \u2013 including early warnings and coordinated management of national and global health risks \u2013 would help to strengthen the capacity of all countries for early warning, risk reduction and managing health risks, a target of SDG 3. 2 Recovering forgotten crops for nutrition and resilience Most of the global population is fed on only 30 crops, some of which are sensitive to disease and are water intensive. Increasing diversity by reviving forgotten crops is one of the targets of SDG 2, which aims to maintain the genetic diversity of seeds, cultivated plants and animals by 2030. 2 Promoting healthy and sustainable African diets Hunger and malnutrition are still prevalent in Africa. Improving the diet and ensuring better access to nutrition and diversified foods would contribute to SDG 8 (Promote sustained, inclusive and sustainable economic growth, full and productive employment and decent work for all). RELEVANT R&I ACHIEVEMENTS A range of EU-funded initiatives has been launched to tackle these challenges and provide sustainable nutrition and health for all. The EU projects showcased herein focus on reducing hunger and malnutrition, providing high-quality, affordable and nutritious produce, ensuring high levels of food safety and traceability, reducing the incidence of non-communicable diet-related diseases, and helping all citizens and consumers adopt sustainable and healthy diets for good health and well-being.

        "FOOD 2030 10 Printing healthy meals for elderly patients The challenge of ensuring nutritional well-being among the elderly will only increase given Europe\u2019s ageing pop- ulation. Many senior citizens are affected by dysphagia \u2013 dif- ficulties in swallowing or chewing food. The EU-funded PERFORMANCE project addressed this condition by devel- oping and validating a personalised food supply chain for those in nursing care, assisted living facilities or at home. The process works like this. Individual food preferences are sent to manufacturers via specially developed so\u00ab- ware, which results in specially textured meals prepared using an innovative 3D printer. Digestible food is cre- ated from easy-to-swallow ingredients then reshaped to replicate the real thing: for example, a pureed chicken fillet can be \u2018printed\u2019 into a fillet shape. Meals can also be tailored for portion size, nutritional value and texture FP7\u0152KBBE > Specific Programme \u201cCooperation\u201d: Food, Agriculture and Biotechnology PERFORMANCE \u201d312092\u2022 > Development of Personalised Food using Rapid Manufacturing for the Nutrition of elderly Consumers CORDIS > http://cordis.europa.eu/project/rcn/105482_ en.html HORIZON\u0152MAGAZINE > https://horizon-magazine. eu/article/transforming-mealtimes-3d-printed-food_ en.html WEBSITE > http://www.performance-fp7.eu/ By harnessing the potential of smart 3D print technology, EU- funded researchers have developed tailored meals for elderly patients with swallowing disorders. This pioneering work has made an important contribution towards improved nutrition for healthy ageing. preferences. Food items are then packed and shipped frozen, ready to be heated in the microwave. This innovative process could dramatically improve the quality of life of people with dysphagia, who are o\u00aben fed a porridge-like pureed mix of ingredients. This can significantly impair enjoyment and lead to nutritional deficiencies if meals are avoided. In nursing homes, it is estimated that up to 60 % of people suffer from the condition. The 3D printing technology pioneered by PERFORMANCE could open up a new high-growth market in Europe for appetising, cost-effective personalised meals for the elderly, bringing benefits to a vulnerable segment of so- ciety. Completed in 2015, many of the products devel- oped within the project have the potential to be brought to market as single standalone solutions.

        "Nutrition for sustainable and healthy diets 11 Creating a market for quality plant protein There is increased awareness in Europe that global meat demand is unsustainable, which might explain why more and more consumers are willing to replace animal pro- tein with plant-based protein. This project has sought to support this dietary transition by improving the quality and quantity of plant-based protein, and by developing adapted plant sources that have a positive impact on the environment and biodiversity as well as on human health. PROTEIN2FOOD began in 2015 by selecting highly nutri- tious seed crops and legumes with high protein quantity.

By offering an attractive alternative to animal protein, the project will contribute towards improved nutrition and enhanced environmental protection. tal assessments, researchers are attempting to achieve a better understanding of the genetic mechanisms that drive protein formation in seeds, as well as the condi- tions that influence plant performance. Researchers are also interested in how plant protein in- teracts with other components in the food matrix, and what this means for final food products. Support for protein-rich food prototypes with exceptional market potential will be offered towards the end of the project. Ultimately, the team hopes to enhance protein produc- tion by 25 % through new effective breeding techniques and increase by 10 % arable land in the EU destined for protein-crop production.

The project\u2019s evidence sets the stage for eff ective food- based strategies to address this preventable threat. Finding solutions to vitamin D defi ciency Vitamin D plays a key role in helping the body absorb calcium and phosphorous and is vital for ensuring bone density and strong teeth, as well as proper foetal devel- opment and a resilient immune system. For humans, the major source of vitamin D is sunshine. But due to weather and other issues such as staying indoors most of the day for work or school, European residents of all ages, genders, life-stages and ethnicities are not getting enough exposure to the sun\u2019s rays to absorb their fair share of the nutrient. The EU-funded ODIN project determined that about 13 % of Europeans are vitamin D defi cient, providing fi rm evidence of a signifi cant public health risk. Accord- ing to the research, those most in danger of developing low levels include ethnic minorities, pregnant women and infants, as well as adolescents and young adult Caucasians. ODIN found that vitamin D fortifi ed foods can help counter defi ciency. One such study of postmenopausal women in Greece found that vitamin D-enriched, re- duced-fat Gouda cheese prevented a lack of the nutrient during winter months in the Mediterranean country. An- other study showed that vitamin D-enriched eggs could also have a benefi cial eff ect in sunlight-sparse months. INT-FOOD-DEF.indd 12 5/10/17 10:34 ",

The innovation provides a low cost solution to help tackle Europe\u2019s high levels of childhood obesity, as well as other food\u2013related problems such as food allergies and food intolerance. It also suggests that future food authenticity and safety systems could soon be placed in the hands of citizens themselves. Developing award- winning food scanners of the future The Commission launched the competition in order to address the lack of low-cost food intake management solutions on the market. The winning solution had to be portable and mobile and capable of analysing food com- position, nutrition facts and potentially harmful ingredi- ents precisely, quickly and effi ciently. It also had to be able to provide feedback to users on their health and lifestyle. Horizon Prizes reward breakthrough solutions \u2013 achieved through the EU\u2019s Horizon 2020 Programme \u2013 to major societal challenges. According to the European Academy of Allergy and Clinical Immunology about 17 million Eu- ropeans suff er from food allergies, with 3.5 million under 25 years of age. Around 43 million preschool children or nearly 7 % of all under-fi ves are overweight. A total of three innovators were recognised as delivering breakthrough food scanning solutions. The winner, Finn- ish start-up Spectral Engines, developed a food scanner prototype based on near infrared spectroscopy, with a Bluetooth connection to a mobile device and data con- nection to a Cloud server. The prototype is compact and provides real-time results at a low price. The two runners-up were SCiOscan of Israel (one of the countries associated to Horizon 2020) and Tellspec, a London-based branch of a Canadian company. The Commission noted that their solutions also represented a positive step forward towards non-invasive food scan- ning. All three winning companies will now use prize money totalling EUR 1 million to further develop their products for the market. INT-FOOD-DEF.indd 13 5/10/17 10:34 ",

The second priority of FOOD 2030 addresses this challenge through R&I to make climate-smart food systems that are adaptive to climate change, conserve natural resources, and contribute to climate change mitigation. For example, the Commission supports R&I projects that demonstrate sustainable aquaculture approaches, make precision farming techniques available for small farmers, develop photosynthesis for food & energy, and encourage the sustainable use of land to keep soils healthy. This priority is relevant to the Common Agriculture Policy, the EU Strategy on Adaptation to Climate Change, EU environmental policies, the Paris climate agreement (COP21) and relevant targets of the Sustainable Development Goals 2, 7, 14 and 15.

There is room for improvement here. The EU is the largest global importer of seafood products, and accounts for 24 % of the total value of world trade. The EU aims to increase its self-sufficiency through the sustainable production of high quality seafood that makes the best use of marine space with minimal environmental impact. Demonstrating sustainable aquaculture will contribute towards the UN call for countries to sustainably manage and protect marine and coastal ecosystems by 2020, one of the targets of SDG 14, which aims at conserving and sustainably using the oceans, seas and marine resources for sustainable development. 2 Enabling precision farming for small farmers Agricultural inputs such as water, energy, fertilisers, and pesticides are o\u00a3en inefficiently used. While precision farming \u2013 which relies on satellite images and other observing and information technologies \u2013 can achieve operational efficiencies, these tools are o\u00a3en too expensive for small farmers. Rural areas also suffer from low broadband and 4G connectivity. To overcome these barriers, affordable precision tools targeted at small and medium-sized farms, are needed. This high- tech agricultural transition will help to attract innovative young farmers into the industry and also encourage urban-rural linkages and co-ownership. This objective contributes to one of the targets of SDG 2, which aims at doubling the agricultural productivity and incomes of small-scale farmers by 2030. 2 Boosting photosynthesis for food & energy Enhancing natural photosynthesis and artificial photosynthesis could help increase crop yields and boost alternative energy production. In the case of enhanced photosynthesis, plants can be engineered with enzymes to speed up the process of converting carbon dioxide into sugars, with an estimated increase of up to 60 % in rice and wheat yields. Furthermore, bacteria and algae can be used to make fuels from sunlight, carbon dioxide and water. Such innovations could drastically decrease land use for the production of biofuels and reduce competition with food and feed production. Artificial photosynthesis further allows the development of biofuel cells and bio-batteries, contributing to SDG 7, which aims at ensuring access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all. 2 Fighting climate change through healthy soils While up to 90 % of the food we produce is grown on soil, up to 25 % of this valuable resource has already been degraded. Billions of tonnes continue to be lost to erosion every year. Ensuring responsible land use is vital if we are to adequately feed an estimated world population of about over 9 billion in 2050, with limited land and increasing competition from biomass. In addition, physical methods of CO 2 storage face public criticism and their sustainability has still to be proven, while the carbon sink potential of soils and biomass has the potential to be further exploited. Lastly, the world needs sustainable ways to protect biodiversity and ensure land use and management for competing uses through better governance, management practices, implementation of the \u2018food first\u2019 principle, and efficiency-based biomass cascading with a more holistic approach to linking primary production and end users. Properly managing land will help combat desertification, and halt and reverse land degradation and halt biodiversity loss, one of the targets of SDG 15, which aims at protecting, restoring and promoting sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems, sustainably managing forests, combating desertification, reversing land degradation and halting biodiversity loss.

Throughout the modelling and mapping pro- cess, dialogue with industry will take place in the form of workshops, focus groups and interviews to ensure that CERES\u2019 outputs are as relevant as possible to the actual situation on the ground \u2013 and in the water. Strengthening sustainable aquaculture using climate models Climate change will affect both Europe\u2019s inland and ma- rine waters. To minimise risks and maximise benefits, the seafood industry needs information about how climate change is likely to impact stocks of fish, as well as aqua- culture productivity. Identifying mitigation measures at an early stage means that potentially negative climate change impacts can be avoided. CERES, which ends in 2020, is analysing projected cli- mate-related changes to inland and marine waters, and the likely responses of species such as salmon, sea bass, mussels, oysters and tuna. All industries dependent on these species will be able to directly benefit from sug- gested solutions. Targeted sectors include fisheries and aquaculture, both inland and marine, across Europe, from the high-latitude oceans to the Mediterranean.

        "Nutrition for sustainable and healthy diets 19 The EU-funded FATIMA project seeks to implement sustainable crop production through monitoring and optimising the use of inputs like water, energy, nutrients and fertilisers. By putting precision farming tools in the hands of farmers, the project is demonstrating how high yields and increased farm incomes can be achieved while using fewer resources. From the beginning, the project has sought to bring to- gether leading-edge agronomic knowledge, crop mod- elling and information and space technology to provide farmers with easy-to-use timely information on crop input requirements. FATIMA has worked with a range of end users including farmers, managers, agricultural de- cision makers and the agribusiness sector, to develop tools for a wide range of farm types. Direct practical applications range from high-resolution precision farming for high-value crops to soil organic matter restoration practices. These provide maps of fertiliser and water requirements that can be used for precision farming and to manage crop water consump- tion. The project has also developed a range of other products to support sustainable crop management techniques backed by innovative water-energy foot- print frameworks. Precision farming means that farmers achieve a better return on their investment by saving on water, pesti- cide and fertiliser costs. In addition, the project team has worked on innovative policy instruments that can be combined with these innovative technologies to pro- mote the transition towards sustainable farming sys- tems. The project team is currently implementing and demon- strating these tools in eight pilot areas representative of key European intensive crop production systems in Spain, Italy, Greece, Netherlands, Czech Republic, Aus- tria, France and Turkey. Due for completion in 2018, the project will integrate and make available all gathered information through a participatory online platform.

Improved photosynthesis could help achieve a 60 % increase in yields of certain crops, enabling European farmers to contribute towards climate-smart and environmentally sustainable food systems. Meeting the needs for a growing food security in a changing climate is one the key challenges facing agri- cultural research, and in particular the impact of heat- waves on food production. Given that photosynthesis is one of the greatest contributors to crop yield, its de- crease under heat stress can severely affect food pro- duction. The risk of rising global temperatures means that heat stress has become an increasingly important factor for wheat farmers to consider. The HEATWHEAT project was launched in 2016 based on the understanding that photosynthesis is highly sus- ceptible to even moderately elevated temperatures. This susceptibility can be mostly attributed to the enzyme RuBisCO activase (RCA). This is one of the least thermo- stable photosynthesis proteins, and also the principal activation partner for the photosynthetic core enzyme Rubisco, which drives carbon fixation and hence plant growth. The project\u2019s main aim has been to experiment with RCA to improve photosynthetic performance, and there- fore the yield potential of wheat. This will be achieved through the sourcing and transfer of heat-stable vari- ants of RCA from relatives of wheat that have evolved in hot climates. Improved variants of wheat RCA will be incorporated into elite wheat germplasm by means of genetic modi- fication and breeding programmes. Due for completion in 2018, the project has huge potential to dramatically improve yield production in wheat under future climate scenarios.

        "Nutrition for sustainable and healthy diets 21 The production of a carbon-rich conditioning product that can help keep soil healthy and encourage more sustainable land use is being scaled up thanks in part to EU funding. The innovative technology, called Novihum, replaces natural humus in degraded and arid soils, significantly increasing crop yields while reducing water use and pollution. Soil is a vital \u2013 though o\u00aben neglected \u2013 tool for increasing the resilience and security of food production, as recognised by the UN\u2019s declaration of 2015 as the International Year of Soils. Healthy soil helps to reduce erosion, enhance drought tolerance and ensure long-term land fertility. However, in- tensive farming is depleting soil of crucial nutrients that are needed to grow food, and around 1 000 km 2 of land is taken every year for buildings, roads and other infrastructure. Novihum, which is achieved by enriching abundant lignite (brown coal) in a highly efficient industrial process, is cur- rently being run through a new pilot facility in Germany, where profitable commercial production can be tested and refined. Due to end in 2018, the project aims to suc- cessfully demonstrate Novihum\u2019s potential benefits to the agricultural sector, which is under increasing pressure to use land efficiently and sustainably. The commercial potential of a product such as Novi- hum \u2013 which is affordable, easy to use and good for the environment \u2013 is therefore significant. As demand for food production increases and available arable land de- creases, the issue of soil quality will become ever more important. Global annual sales of such a soil humus con- ditioning product for the agriculture, horticulture, urban farming and landscape sectors in the EU, US and Mid- dle East have been estimated to be in the order of up to EUR 360 million. The European Enterprise Network, co-financed under the EU\u2019s programme for the competitiveness of SMEs (COSME), will help to establish a sophisticated global customer base and facilitate successful market entry.

        "FOOD 2030 24 The third FOOD 2030 priority aims to foster R&I to achieve circularity and resource efficiency in food systems. Circularity implies sustainable, resource- efficient food systems that, for example, would reduce the 1.3 billion tonnes of food lost and wasted per year along the food chain globally. Challenges in this area include: achieving zero food waste in food systems; tackling waste streams from primary production; efficiently recycling food waste; rethinking food packaging and labelling to engage consumers; and responding to an increasing demand for more tailored and local food. This priority aims at supporting the modernisation of the Common Agricultural Policy, the EU Circular Economy Package including the Waste Directive and Climate Action policies and relevant targets of the Sustainable Development Goals 2, 8 and 12.

        "2 Achieving zero food waste Food waste is a problem along the entire food supply chain. One third of the global food supply ultimately goes uneaten, costing the global economy billions every year. This uneaten food accounts for about 8 % of greenhouse gas emissions. If food loss and waste were attributed to a single country, it would be the world\u2019s third largest emitter a\u00a3er China and the USA. Achieving zero food waste would help to feed a fast growing global population, while reducing the food sector\u2019s environmental footprint. Zero waste food systems can help achieve SDG 12, which aims at ensuring sustainable consumption and production patterns. 2 Tackling primary production waste streams Improving farm operations will help to reduce a significant amount of waste produced throughout the food system. Around 1.4 billion tonnes of manure is produced in the EU annually. Only about 25 % of the phosphorous contained in wastewater is currently reused. The aquaculture sector is also responsible for releasing antibiotics into the environment. With some 65 % of seafood consumption expected to come from aquaculture by 2030, this is an issue that needs to be addressed. 2 Converting food waste into bio-based products Some 88 million tonnes of food was wasted in the EU in 2012, with 11 % of this attributed to the primary production phase. In addition, about one third of the global food supply ultimately goes uneaten, costing the global economy billions. Developing end uses for this waste will help return nutrients into the food supply chain and create new economic opportunities through added value products. In turn this will help the EU meet SDG 8, which aims at promoting sustained, inclusive and sustainable economic growth, full and productive employment and decent work for all. 2 Rethinking food packaging and labelling Engaging consumers through reformulated food packaging and labelling will help to reduce the amount of waste produced in households across Europe. While over 311 million tonnes of plastic were produced in the EU in 2014, over 40 % of this was for single-use packaging. The end result is that 8 million tonnes of plastic waste ends up in the sea each year. Reducing unnecessary packaging waste can substantially reduce waste generation through prevention, reduction, recycling and reuse by 2030. This is one of the targets of SDG 12. 2 Sharing data for short-circuit food systems Europe requires food systems that respond directly to local consumer food demand. In fact, 34 % of consumers are interested in personalised food and groceries, while 22 % would be happy to share data in return for more personalised products and services. In addition, 52 % of European consumers check if their food is local. Customised, localised and diversified food supplies would help the EU ensure one of the targets of SDG 2, which aims at ensuring the proper functioning of food commodity markets and their derivatives and facilitating timely access to market information, including on food reserves, to help limit extreme food price volatility. RELEVANT R&I ACHIEVEMENTS The research projects showcased in this section demonstrate how resource-efficient circular economy principles can be implemented across the whole food system, while reducing their ecological footprint.

Another project goal was the recovery and conversion of waste by-products into high-value products such as gel- atine, hydrolysates and functional peptides. Acid/alkali and enzymatic hydrolysis methods were used to extract proteins from waste skin and bones including from UK salmon and Lake Victoria\u2019s Nile perch. Other work focused on quality control parameters, risks, nutritional properties and the carbon footprint of fish products. The information gained was compiled into a quality management tool for conducting safety and risk assessments and ensuring nutritional and functional quality. The project aimed to reduce post-harvest losses in com- munities heavily dependent on fishing while achieving economic and environmental benefits. SECUREFISH de- livered innovative tools that enable processors to ex- tract nutritional proteins and peptides from fish discards. These ingredients can then be sold to manufacturers as ingredients for nutritious food products. The project also introduced renewable energy sources to ensure that new production techniques are environmen- tally and economically sustainable, and helped to build up local SME skills to increase self-reliance. Fish-preserving technologies were first developed based on traditional approaches. These included a hybrid wind (or biomass) and solar tunnel drier, a modified solar-en- ergy-assisted extruder and an atmospheric freeze-drier. The quality of dried fillets was then enhanced by add- ing plant polyphenols extracted from local seaweeds. A Turning fish waste into functional food The EU-funded SECUREFISH project has developed novel technology that turns fish discards into value added products, helping to reduce waste and encourage resource efficiency. The technology was developed with a focus on low- and middle-income countries.

This solution was tested at full scale at a production line with a variety of vegetables. The project also developed a water-efficient washing machine for fresh-cut food. Technology demonstrations showed that the new machine reduced water consump- tion from 1.8 litres per kg to 1.3 litres per kg. The new machine reduces water consumption by channelling water from the outfeed belt back into the machine. This machine was nominated for the 2015 Food Tech Innovation Award.

PHBOTTLE focused on juice processing wastewater be- cause it contains high amounts of organic substances, including fermentable sugars such as glucose, fructose and maltose. The concentration of these fermentable sugars can reach 70 % of the total organic load, which researchers realised makes juice wastewater an ideal and cheap source of raw material to produce PHB (poly- hydroxybutyrate), a type of biopolymer. PHB has several useful properties as a raw material for food packaging. It is moisture and vapour resistant, and does not dissolve on contact with water. The material has see-through properties and offers protection against oxygen entering a package. All these factors help to stop food from spoiling, which makes this organic com- pound useful for making biodegradable juice packaging. Use waste water to produce biodegradable packaging The EU-funded PHBOTTLE project has successfully developed a new biodegradable material from waste streams that can be used in plastic packaging. Made from the fermented wastewater of processed juice, the innovation could save industry millions in production costs and tap into growing consumer demand for environmentally friendly products.

EU policy recommendations to support the national im- plementation of food waste policy frameworks will also be developed, as will technological innovations designed to improve valorisation of food waste during food pro- cessing. Finally, ICT-based platforms and tools will help to support the uptake of new and existing solutions to reduce food waste long a\u00aber the project is completed in 2019. Taking cooperative action to reduce food waste Some 88 million tonnes of food intended for human con- sumption are lost annually along the EU supply chain, equivalent to 20 % of all food produced in the EU. About half of this is household food waste. Achieving reduc- tions here will go some way towards the objective of reducing food waste across Europe by 30 % by 2025, cutting waste management costs, and maximising the value from unavoidable food waste and packaging ma- terials. REFRESH began by seeking to gain a better understand- ing of the drivers of food waste, focusing in particular on insights from behavioural sciences.

These include motivational videos, which will be dis- tributed via online channels in the pilot countries, as well as a number of awareness raising events where citizens can meet local food redistribution organisations and participating donors. For food donors specifically, the project has designed a food waste calculator that allows owners of a restaurant, a supermarket or a shop to easily calculate how much money he would actually save by joining SavingFood. The tool also calculates how much CO 2 emissions can be avoided. The project has developed various offline and online interventions to better understand and support food surplus behaviour in Hungary, Belgium, UK and Greece. Central to this is the project\u2019s ICT platform, co-designed with stakeholders, which aims to remove current practi- cal barriers to food redistribution. For example, by enabling food donors to describe their donation in terms of type of food and quantity and by giving charities the opportunity to describe their exact food needs, matching offer and demand of food surplus can be done in a more efficient way. Notifications about crucial actions in the process of food surplus redistri- bution, another characteristic of the platform, allows volunteers to be reminded of food saving activities they registered for, while pilot coordinators can follow the status of food surplus transactions.

Through closer partnerships with industry and society, markets can function in a responsible manner, foster fair trade and pricing, inclusiveness and sustainability. Challenges in this area to be addressed by R&I include: achieving sustainable and accessible food in cities and regions, engaging citizens in food science and policy, developing a sharing economy for food production and consumption, and implementing data-driven food and nutrition systems.

Some 75 % of EU citizens live in urban environments. This share is expected to rise to 80 % by 2020. Many European cities have to deal with food poverty and food deserts \u2013 areas where nutritious food such as fresh fruit and vegetables are not available due to a lack of outlets. Providing sufficient, accessible, safe and nutritious food can be a complex challenge. By connecting producers to consumers and citizens in food systems however, new solutions such as urban and vertical farming can emerge. Investment in related R&I contributes to achieving inclusive and sustainable urbanisation and capacity for participatory, integrated and sustainable human settlement planning and management, one of the targets set for SDG 11, which aims at making cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable. 2 Engaging citizens in food systems and science policy European citizens o\u00a3en feel that their views are not integrated into science and policymaking. A key challenge is to connect citizens with scientists and policymakers in order to increase trust and ownership of both \u2018problems\u2019 and \u2018solutions\u2019. Tackling this challenge from a food systems perspective will help to ensure responsive, inclusive, participatory and representative decision-making at all levels, one of the targets of SDG 16, which aims at promoting peaceful and inclusive societies for sustainable development, providing access to justice for all and building effective, accountable and inclusive institutions at all levels. 2 Fostering a sharing economy for food production and consumption Rural or semi-rural areas account for about 88 % of the EU\u2019s area and 55 % of all jobs. These areas play a key economic role in every European country. However, small farmers face a variety of specific challenges, such as accessing expensive production equipment that is not used by other farmers. Likewise, a great deal of food is wasted by consumers during the \u2018last mile\u2019 of the food supply chain. Connecting local small producers with citizens \u2013 through sharing equipment and logistic services for example \u2013 can help to reduce food waste and create local food hubs. Investment in related R&I helps the EU and other countries develop quality, reliable, sustainable and resilient infrastructure, including regional and trans-border infrastructure, to support economic development and human well-being, with a focus on affordable and equitable access for all. This target contributes to SDG 9, which aims at building resilient infrastructure, promoting inclusive and sustainable industrialization and fostering innovation. 2 Implementing data-driven food and nutrition systems A huge variety of data is generated throughout the food system. However, the value of this data is not fully realised in a way that could help to strengthen consumer trust. Big data could also help the food and drink sector to better target R&I investments, which currently represent only 0.27 % of the sector\u2019s turnover. This is half as much as in the US and only a third as much as in Japan. Tackling this problem would also help the EU adopt measures to ensure the proper functioning of food commodity markets and their derivatives and facilitate timely access to market information, including on food reserves, in order to help limit extreme food price volatility. This target is part of SDG 2, which aims at ending hunger, achieving food security and improved nutrition and promoting sustainable agriculture.

The project has shown how data-driven food and nutrition systems can bring sustainable benefits. Establishing sustainable food systems \u2013 particularly in increasingly concentrated urban areas \u2013 requires in- novative technology and planning. FOODMETRES de- veloped three metropolitan footprint tools based on state-of-the-art European datasets in order to frame, communicate and manage the impacts of urban food consumption on metropolitan regions. Two of these tools \u2013 the Metropolitan Foodscape Planner (MFP) and the Metropolitan Areas Profiles and Scenario (MAPS) tool \u2013 allow the provision of detailed insights on the ecological footprint of urban food consumption as well as indications of optimal food sheds for higher food security. A Common Operational Data Protocol (CODP) was established for case study research, and a FOODMETRES data repository made available to stake- holders. Through these European data-driven tools, the project has sought to bridge the gap between trade and consumption on one hand and regional reality and local actors and consumers on the other. The project team applied these tools to different food chains ranging from community-backed agriculture in London, Ljubljana and Berlin, to subsistence farming methods in Nairobi and large-scale greenhouse glass production in Rotterdam-Westland. Stakeholder work- shops were held in order to establish new production networks and ensure dissemination of research results. It is hoped that the project\u2019s pioneering new technol- ogy will influence the development of sustainable urban food production chains in Europe and beyond.

        "Nutrition for sustainable and healthy diets 37 Innovative ICT solutions are being developed by the EU-funded CAPSELLA project, which will enable farmers\u2019 communities and networks to develop more sustainable food systems. This in turn will help European society move beyond conventional, industrialised food production that has o\u203aen been characterised by inefficiencies and high external inputs like water and fertiliser. Conventional food production has become increasingly unsustainable due to unacceptable levels of food waste and shrinking farmers\u2019 incomes. Alternative data-driven systems are needed that reduce external inputs, pro- mote agricultural biodiversity and engage consumers more in the food supply chain. The CAPSELLA project is addressing these challenges through raising awareness within farming communities and the broader public about the benefits of using open data, and by promoting the use of ICT to achieve effi- ciencies. These tools will address three key scenarios: promoting functional agro-biodiversity in cropping sys- tems; increasing on-farm genetic diversity conservation and informal seed systems; and achieving transparency of the food chain in the processes related to the produc- tion, including the distribution and consumption of food. The key deliverable will be the CAPSELLA cloud plat- form. This will include a rich set of components and a number of added-value functions providing data for targeted communities. Infrastructure will be offered for building innovative ICT applications, enabling and en- couraging the development of smart applications from the ground up. Community-driven data-powered ICT solutions will be tested by the communities engaged in the project through a number of pilots. CAPSELLA, which also has a strong societal and business sustainability focus through various incubation activities, ends in 2018.

The ultimate goal is to help organisations implement local community activities with citizens and stakeholders responsible for R&I. Will there be enough fertile land to grow the food for an increasing population? Is it possible to adapt food production to climate change? And how do we define responsible research and innovation in relation to food security? The Big Picnic project wants citizens to debate the issues and articulate their views. The project aims to encourage grassroots engagement to achieve this. Big Picnic, a three-year project ending in 2019, has iden- tified a need for both in-depth familiarisation with the issues surrounding food security and a deeper under- standing of the context in which grassroots engagement can be fostered. It brings together botanic gardens, uni- versities, an institute for art, science and technology and an international NGO, spanning 12 European countries along with Uganda. These partners are designing fi\u00abeen travelling exhibi- tions, which will offer information, activities and partic- ipatory events to spread the word about food security and get people talking. Partners have been encouraged to try out new approaches and to identify their target audiences and goals. Co-creative methods \u2013 the idea that everyone is an expert on one issue or another \u2013 should inform participatory processes that involve insti- tutions and community partners. Communities will also take part in around 90 Science Caf\u00e9s, which are designed to inspire debate and capture public opinion. Through the face-to-face interactions, the project is expected to reach around 8 000 people. Technology, take home challenges and social media will expand Big Picnic\u2019s potential audience to 300 000.

        "Nutrition for sustainable and healthy diets 39 The EU-funded SHARECITY project is guiding cities towards more sustainable pathways through applying the sharing economy to food production and consumption. This will help to conserve resources, prevent waste and provide new forms of socio-economic relationships. Understanding how and why people consume \u2013 and the nature of relationships they develop with the prod- ucts they acquire and use \u2013 has long been a focus of social scientists. While the cultural diversity and long history of food sharing has been well documented, mod- ern ICT is pushing this concept into new spaces. How- ever, little is known about these emerging food sharing practices and their impacts. The SHARECITY project aims to establish the significance and potential that food sharing economies can bring to cities by developing a deeper theoretical understanding of contemporary food sharing and generating compar- ative international empirical data about food sharing activities within cities. It will also assess the impact of food sharing activities and explore how food sharing in cities might evolve in the future. SHARECITY, due for completion in 2020, will provide conceptual insights that bridge sharing, social practice and urban transitions theories. The project will gener- ate a typology of food sharing economies; a database of food sharing activities in 100 global cities; in-depth food sharing profiles of seven cities from the contrasting contexts of USA, Brazil and Germany, Greece, Portugal, Ireland and Australia; and a sustainability impact toolkit to enable examination of city-based food sharing initi- atives. It will also offer up scenarios for future food sharing in cities a\u00aber assessing current food sharing and open new opportunities to better understand how, why and to what end people share food within cities in the 21st Century.
