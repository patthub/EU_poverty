        "January II - 2003 The Week FOREIGN AFFAIRS Iraq - support for UN resolutions Motions for resolutions on the situation in Iraq Doc: B5-0075/2003, B5-0077/2003, B5- 0079/2003 Debate: 29.01.2003 Vote: 30.01.2003 Vote Parliament adopted a joint resolution on the situation in Iraq with 287 votes in favour, 209 against and 26 abstentions. Parliament reaffirmed its commitment to peace, democracy and respect for human rights and international law and reiterates the need for full application of and compliance with United Nations Security Council resolutions in order to guarantee international peace and security. MEPs state that they fully supports the work of Mr Hans Blix, and Mr El Baradei, and their team of inspectors in charge of the UN enhanced inspection regime as stipulated in UNSCR 1441. MEPs believe that breaches of UNSCR 1441 currently identified by the inspectors with regard to weapons of mass destruction do not justify military action and considers that any further steps must be taken by the Security Council after a full assessment of the situation. Parliament expresses its opposition to any unilateral military action and believes that a pre emptive strike would not be in accordance with international law and the UN Charter and would lead to a deeper crisis involving other countries in the region; stresses that everything must be done to avoid military action. Furthermore, Parliament urges the Council and the Member States to take the initiative in proposing that the International Criminal Court should investigate the responsibility of the Iraqi leader's regime for the genocide against the Marsh Arabs and other crimes of war and crimes against humanity. MEPs call on the Iraqi Government to comply with UN Security Council Resolution 1441 and continue to allow UNMOVIC inspections, unconditionally and with unimpeded access, and to cooperate fully and respond to the remarks made by the Head of UNMOVIC in its report. MEPs call, furthermore, for all available pertinent information, from all sources, to be forwarded without delay to UNMOVIC. MEPs call for all political and diplomatic avenues to be explored in order to secure a peaceful settlement to the conflict and stresses the necessity of securing and preserving peace and international security. Finally, the House stresses the European Union's commitment to the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Iraq, Kuwait and neighbouring countries. Debate With many MEPs holding up cards with words such as \"no war, new Europe, and no war for oil\", Javier SOLANA, the EU's High Representative for its Common Foreign and Security Policy opened the debate on Iraq and stated this had been an important week for the international community's efforts to achieve the peaceful disarmament of Iraq. He recalled that Dr BLIX and Dr EL BARADEI had submitted an update of the results of the inspections so far to the UN Security Council. The reports from the inspectors, he said, contained a mixed message on Iraq's co operation up to now. He then reminded the House that the External Relations Council discussed Iraq at its meeting earlier in the week. The Council, he said, reached agreement on a set of conclusions. The Council set out the EU policy on Iraq in the current situation, without entering into any speculation on next steps. Indeed, he underlined that the EU believes that the UN Security Council is the right body to examine the inspectors' reports and to decide on possible future steps. He also stressed the importance of the close co-ordination between EU's members of the Security Council: France, United Kingdom, Germany and Spain. Just prior to the External PE 317.924 ",
        "The Week January II - 2003 Relations Council, he stated that the recent meeting had been very useful. The Council's discussions, he stated, confirmed significant convergence in the positions of Member States on the basic guiding principles on the Iraq issue. Important differences remain he said, but there is unanimity on the following of key principles: \u2022 first, that the goal remains the effective and complete disarmament of Iraq's weapons of mass destruction, as stated in Security Council resolutions, particularly UNSCR 1441; \u2022 second, that it is the responsibility of Iraq to co-operate fully and actively with UNMOVIC and the IAEA in this final opportunity to resolve this crisis peacefully; \u2022 thirdly, that the inspectors should be supported in their efforts to continue and intensify their operations and so complete their mission; \u2022 finally, that the responsibility of the UNSC in maintaining international peace and security must be respected. He then turned to public opinion, stating that there was a contradiction with the desire to prevent war and at the same time to prevent dictators from ruling countries. Resolving this contraction, he said, would be the key to the crisis. Turning to the Middle East following elections in Israel, Mr Solana began by congratulating the Israeli people on the fact that, despite the trauma of the last two years, their democracy remained vigorous and healthy. Although the final results were not yet known, it was clear that Mr Sharon had won a clear victory. He offered him his congratulations. He then made two comments, first he said, with the elections over, the international community should move as quickly as possible to finalising and publishing the roadmap of the \"Quartet\". There were no good reasons for further delay, and plenty of good reasons for moving ahead, he said. Second, he said the election does not show that Israelis have lost faith in peace, but rather that they have lost faith in the mechanisms for arriving at that peace. Whatever the complexion of the future Israeli Government, he remarked, polling evidence pointed to the fact that the overwhelming majority of Israelis continue to support a peace settlement based on two states and a withdrawal from the occupied territories. He then turned to the Balkans, where the regional picture, he said, had improved dramatically. The Copenhagen decisions on enlargement have, however, raised the spectre of marginalisation and \"enlargement fatigue\" in the region, he commented. It was, therefore, extremely important to keep the Balkans high on the EU's agenda and to send a strong message confirming that the European vocation of the Balkans is real. But eventual membership will, however, require hard work and genuine commitment to reforms by the countries of the region. This was the double message that the EU needs to send during the coming months. He looked forward to working closely with the Greek Presidency with a view to a successful Thessaloniki Summit, which should mark a new milestone in the special relationship between the European Union and the Western Balkans. The launching of the EU police mission in Bosnia, and second, the preparations now underway for an EU military mission in FYROM were important developments. These two missions, he said, were important both in a regional context and as a measure of the Union's increasing capacity to act in line with our ambitions. On North Korea, the High Representative said that he had been encouraged by the South Korean authorities to undertake a diplomatic mission to Pyongyang in order to lend the European Union's weight to international efforts to reduce tension on the peninsula and to help resolve the current crisis. The Council, he said, had agreed in principle to such a mission. In his address to the House, Commissioner Chris PATTEN, after paying tribute to international processes put in place to PE 317.924 ",
        "January II - 2003 The Week guarantee peace over the last fifty years and EU achievements in areas such as Bosnia, noted that the international community had failed to create a system to prevent the spread of nuclear, chemical and biological weapons, Nevertheless, turning to the present crisis over Iraq, he emphasised the importance of working through the United Nations. Saddam's government had an appalling record on human rights, as could be seen in Parliament's own report on the region, but now it was vital to take note of the work being undertaken by both UN and the International Atomic Energy Agency inspectors. Every effort should be made to ensure that Saddam allow inspectors to undertake their work. Unfortunately, as he put it, the problem was how to deal with Saddam's attitude to the international community. This problem had indeed been recognised by Hans Blix who noted that Iraq had not yet accepted the need to disarm, yet the fact was, it was far preferable for the UN inspectors to persuade him to do this than looking at any other alternative. His other concern was with international aid workers who could work far more effectively under the umbrella of the UN and departing from this approach could only make their task that much harder and heighten risks. effective but he too supported an active role for the \"old\" united Europe. He warned of the dangers of a human catastrophe extending to a disaster on the economic front and urged every effort be made to avoid war. He felt there was a need for more proof of the existence of weapons of mass destruction in Iraq. Graham WATSON (South West), for the ELDR group, pointed out that the EU currently had 4 Member States on the UN Security Council, including France as President. He urged the EU to speak with one voice and wondered whether wide co ordination meetings would be a regular occurrence or just a one off. He stressed the importance of taking the UN multilateral route, stating that the international community's efforts had prevented a pre emptive strike by the US. For his group, war would always be the last resort, but he did not accept the possibility of Saddam going into exile in return for impunity. He stressed that Saddam Hussein was a war criminal and should be tried before the International Criminal Court. He called for more time for the inspectors, but warned that resolution 1441 \"would have to be enforced\", if the inspectors failed. It was then the turn of EPP/ED leader Hans-Gert POETTERING (D) to reaffirm what he termed \"the wisdom of the old continent of Europe\". He too emphasised the need to work for peace through the United Nations. At the same time, he recognised the violations committed in Iraq and Saddam's use of weapons of mass destruction against his own people. He then paid tribute to the USA for its role in leading the coalition attack on Iraq after the invasion of Kuwait, but he felt that action now should concentrate on trying to persuade Saddam to disarm, although he too noted that following Hans Blix's report, the Iraqi leader was not yet ready to do this. For the PES, Enrique BAR\u00d3N CRESPO (E) too emphasised the need for a multinational approach through the UN. He admitted, however, that sanctions had not proved Francis WURTZ (F), for the GUE/NGL group, welcomed the agreement to give more time to the weapons inspectors and said that their work should be applauded rather than criticised as the US had been doing. He called the US Secretary of State's remarks as \"irresponsible when it came to not ruling out the use of nuclear weapons\". He called for Europe to take a stand against the US position and not to simply to fall in behind it. For the Greens/EFA group, Daniel Marc COHN-BENDIT (F) questioned whether international law had been respected and at what point it would be justifiable legally to go to war. He said that he had supported the first Gulf War, military intervention in Afghanistan and in Kosovo. Saddam Hussein, he said, was now a weak leader, that was not capable of a serious threat; he further saw inconsistencies in the international PE 317.924 ",
        "The Week January II - 2003 community's view to other more \"dangerous\" states such as Iran, and North Korea. He said for the international community to be credible in the region, a solution to the Palestinian question would have to be reached. Luis QUEIRO (P) for the UEN group said that the international community should demonstrate a credible threat of military force, but at the same time give more resources to the UN inspectors, He too said that war was a last resort and that the international community had not yet reached that stage. Bastiaan BELDER (NL) for the EDD group stated that Saddam Hussein was a permanent potential threat to the region, but war could make the situation worse and there was no guarantee that his successor would bring stability to the region. Jean-Marie LE PEN (F), a non-aligned Member, stated that the semantics surrounding the debate were wrong, stating that there was no Iraqi crisis but rather a crisis of the international community since President Bush had been \"war mongering.\" Iraq could not, in his opinion, be a threat to the world, since its leadership had been crushed by the first Gulf War and its people by sanctions. Jill EVANS (Greens/EFA, Wales) noted that the most powerful country on earth, as she put it, now seemed determined to wage war in Iraq with or without UN approval or indeed evidence of the existence of weapons of mass destruction. Such an action, she contended, would be \"immoral, unjustifiable and illegal\" and leave the world a more dangerous place with the victims being innocent civilians, especially children. But she pointed to growing opposition to war and the international peace demonstration planned for 15 February. Baroness Emma NICHOLSON (ELDR, South East) pointed out that Iraq was in material breach of several UN resolutions. Iraq, she said, was guilty of supporting terrorist organisations possibly including Al- Quaeda. Resolution 1441 gave Iraq one last slender chance, she said, but Iraq had refused to take it. She further pointed out the Iraqi refugee crisis had led to 4.5 million refugees being displaced in the surrounding countries including, Jordan, Syria and Turkey. Niall ANDREWS (UEN, Dublin), while not doubting that Saddam Hussein was a danger to his own people took the view that George Bush was a threat to the whole world. There was, he said, no evidence of a link between Al-Quaeda and Iraq. Pointing to the 7 million people who had died in the region since the Gulf war, Mr Andrews was convinced that the forthcoming US action was about oil and he held out the possibility of a widening conflict later encompassing neighbouring countries such as Iran. Jonathan EVANS (EPP-ED, Wales) said that Iraq had been in breach of several UN resolutions for over 10 years. Responsibility, he said, was for Iraq to disarm, the emphasis, he continued should be on Iraq to demonstrate that it had no weapons of mass destruction rather than on the UN inspectors finding weapons. He was disappointed that the UK government had not sufficiently outlined the threat that Saddam Hussein posed to the world. If the international community failed in disarming Iraq, he said, the credibility of both the US and the UN would be severely undermined. A second UN resolution before any possible military action would be the optimal situation, but he recalled that Iraq was already in breach of previous resolutions. He said that the diverse opinions on the Iraqi question had demonstrated that the idea of a common European foreign and security policy was fallacious. Gary TITLEY (PES, North West) reminded the House that the USA was a democratic country, whose citizens had laid down their lives in two world wars during the past century and that Iraq was a dictatorship where there was no respect for basic freedoms. As to future action, he pointed out that the existing UN resolution 1441 did state that Iraq was in breach of its obligations and warned that 8 PE 317.924 ",
        "January II - 2003 The Week failure to comply would lead to \"serious consequences\". The question to be decided was what the UN considered this to mean. Failure to act if Saddam continued not to comply would threaten the whole credibility of the UN, he said. If another UN resolution was required, then it was vital for this to be supported by the EU. Caroline LUCAS (Greens/EFA, South East), on the other hand, felt that it was the European Parliament's duty in the face of mass opposition by the European public to war, to send a clear message that any US military action would be illegal and immoral and she warned such action would be counter productive and only fuel terrorism. Nevertheless, she felt the EU had a key role to play in promoting alternatives such as compliance with the international nuclear non proliferation treaty and the strengthening of the convention on chemical and biological weapons. Proinsias DE ROSSA (PES, Dublin) stated that he was clearly against unilateral war against Iraq although he declared he was not a pacifist. Unilateral war, he said, was the road to anarchy and recalled the old adage that \"war was the failure of politics.\" He called for the inspectors to be given more time and for the Iraqi authorities to co-operate fully and proactively with them. He said he would be travelling with a group of MEPs to Iraq this weekend and would put as much pressure as possible on to the Iraqi authorities in order to avoid military action. Javier Solana concluded the debate by saying that he understood the difficulties and political sensitivities surrounding the debate since after all it was a matter of life and death and war and peace. He warned not to be too pessimistic about the EU's position, for example, as compared to September last year, when many thought that the US would act unilaterally, the situation had dramatically improved. He said that the contribution of the EU to the passing of resolution 1441 by the UN Security Council should not be underestimated. He paid tribute to the work of Dr Blix, and said that he was a \"great European\" in favour of the EU playing a greater role in resolving the crisis. More assistance and resources, he said, should be given to the weapons inspectors and finally he recalled that the weapons inspectors would report again to the UN Security Council on 14 February and, following this, the European Parliament would again have the opportunity to offer its views on avoiding war if at all possible.

It deplored the election of Libya to chair the UNCHR this year and strongly regretted the EU Member States' abstention during this vote. Parliament called on the EU presidency to sponsor or support resolutions during the upcoming session on: China, in particular addressing the situation in Tibet and Xinjang; Russia, in particular addressing the situation in Chechnya; Algeria, Tunisia, Libya, the human rights situation in the Israeli Occupied Territories and in the area under the Palestinian Authority, Saudi Arabia, Iraq, Iran, Congo, Burundi, the Central African Republic, the Ivory Coast, Sudan, Cuba, Colombia, North Korea, Burma and Nepal. Parliament in particular condemns the execution by China of Lobsang Dhondup from Tibet and urges the suspension of the death penalty against Lama Tenzin Delek. MEPs also advocated a resolution inviting all states to introduce a moratorium on executions with a view to abolishing the death penalty completely. They requested the United States, China, Saudi Arabia, Sudan, Congo-Brazzaville, the Democratic Republic of Congo and Iran in particular once again to end all executions immediately. In this respect, MEPs congratulated governor George Ryan of Illinois for having commuted the sentences of all 167 inmates on death row in his state. The European Parliament asks the EU presidency to sponsor a resolution calling on the US immediately to clarify the situation of prisoners in Guantanamo, including those who have lately been transferred to other parts of the US, and to release prisoners against whom there are no retainable charges. Parliament, furthermore, condemned the use of stoning, all forms of degrading and cruel punishment and all legalised forms of torture, notably as practised in Iran, Saudi Arabia, Sudan and some states of Nigeria. Among other things, Parliament also called for a resolution on all forms of forced work, e.g. forced prostitution of children, women and men, forced child labour, child soldiers, slavery-like conditions of work and trafficking in human beings. It also warned that the fight against terrorism should in no way endanger the protection of fundamental human rights and must be based on international humanitarian law.

The issue of access to and control of key mineral resources such as diamonds, copper, cobalt, coltan and gold is one of the main causes of the civil war in the DRC. Parliament condemns the illegal exploitation of the DRC's natural resources by its neighbours and by private international companies, and calls for concrete steps to end this state of affairs. The House wants the International Criminal Court, under powers now vested in it, to investigate acts of genocide and crimes against- humanity committed in Africa and elsewhere, where such acts were perpetrated to illegally secure natural resources, such as conflict diamonds and timber. MEPs welcome the EU's accession to the Kimberley Process Certification Scheme for the international trade in rough diamonds, and call on all States involved in this trade to join the Scheme and calls for independent monitoring of compliance with the guidelines concerning the trade in diamonds. Finally, the House calls, with a view to compliance with the principle of good governance, for those persons found guilty of pillaging the resources of the DRC to be dismissed from their posts and to be excluded from office during the transitional period which will precede the establishment of democracy.

MEPs deplore the fact that the Mugabe land redistribution programme has only served to worsen the region's food crisis, by triggering the collapse of Zimbabwe's agricultural production and economy. Concerning the EU's trade policy with developing countries, Parliament welcomes the Council's decision to give free access to the European Union market for all products, except arms, from the least developed countries, emphasises that the full application of this initiative by the end of 2003. MEPs also call for the other developed countries, in particular the United States, to take similar measures. Furthermore, the House considers that LDCs should in some cases be allowed to protect their economy and proceed to selective market opening, in order to develop their own industries and to ensure their food independence and the survival and development of their small farming. Finally, MEPs want the Commission to help the LDCs to increase their technological, production, administrative and logistical capacity so that they can take full advantage of their free access to EU markets and develop their technological capability so as to be able to export finished products as well.

Thanks to the efforts of Parliament's delegation to the conciliation negotiations, the new directive will ensure that national defence projects are no longer automatically excluded from the EU environmental impact assessment directive. In exchange, Parliament agreed with Council that plans and projects drawn up under specific environmental directives (e.g. on hazardous waste) should be exempt from the new legislation if they are intended solely for national defence purposes or civil emergencies. Parliament also succeeded in inserting a reporting and review clause committing the 12 PE 317.924 ",

This new directive on public participation in environmental planning - which aligns the EU 's environmental legislation with the UN Aarhus Convention on the same subject - amends the directives on environmental impact assessment (EIA) and integrated pollution prevention and control (IPPC) to give the public a greater role. It also opens up specific EU directives, including those on batteries and accumulators, hazardous waste and packaging, to public consultation. The Member States will have two years to implement the new directive - steered through Parliament by Eija-Riitta KORHOLA (EPP- ED, FIN) - after it enters into force.

At Parliament's insistence, the timetable for requiring off-road machinery and tractors to use sulphur-free fuel has been aligned with the timetable for on-road vehicles. Another of Parliament's achievements is a reference in the text to fiscal measures \"at the appropriate national or Community level\" as incentives to introduce cleaner fuels.

In response to this situation, Parliament's is calling for a proactive EU policy to combat these diseases. Parliament adopted a resolution by 508 votes in favour, 3 against with 7 abstentions, which backs a Commission proposal for a regulation which provides for a global approach to fighting these illnesses. Given the urgency of the situation, MEPs are hoping that the regulation can be adopted swiftly and if possible at first reading (under the co- decision procedure). However, budgetary questions are the main stumbling block. Parliament is asking for far higher funding. An increase is needed so that EU policies to combat these diseases are properly carried out and also to enable the EU to make a major contribution to the Global Fund to fight AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria. Regarding the budget of \u20ac351 million for the programme supported by Parliament, the Commission said it was unable to accept this amount due to budgetary constraints. The other amendments stress that prevention, care and treatment are interdependent. A co ordinated approach is needed between co operation, research and health policies to fight the diseases effectively. Health care systems in developing countries will also have to be improved. Apart from the cost of medicines, the question of whether they even exist often arises. Only 10% of research activity is devoted to the diseases which account for 90% of the world's ailments. MEPs believe that, where the market fails to generate solutions, public research should be stimulated and incentives found to encourage the private sector to invest in these areas. The Parliament also wants to make key medicines more affordable, which would mean producing them locally. The Doha declaration on TRIPS and Public Health allows this under certain conditions even if the product is under licence. In addition, the House stresses the right of members of the WTO to use the flexibility allowed by TRIPS to protect public health and to ensure access to medicines to all.

The percentage amounts to 10%, some 2% up on the figure for the year 2000 and is mainly found in regional fund spending affected by complex bureaucratic procedures. MEPs point out that some 80% of the budget is managed by the Member States and recognises efforts being made by the Commission to improve management procedures. Parliament adopted the resolution in response to the Commission's reactions to previous criticisms by MEPs of its management of the 2000 budget. It is particularly critical of the Commission's failure to recover some \u20ac2.245bn illegally paid out of the budget. The House remains concerned about incidents of fraud, especially in the agricultural sector. The Commission is asked to come up with a strategy to reduce opportunities for fraud in this area.
