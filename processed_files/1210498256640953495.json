The assessment of applicability shall, without prejudice to the definition laid down in point (33) of Article 2, take account of the principle of proportionality in accordance with Article 4(5) having regard to the level of support allocated, where appropriate. The assessment of fulfilment shall be limited to the criteria laid down in the Fund-specific rules and in Part II of Annex XI. 2. The Partnership Agreement shall set out a summary of the assessment of the fulfilment of applicable ex ante conditionalities at national level and for those which, pursuant to the assessment referred to in paragraph 1, are not fulfilled at the date of submission of the Partnership Agreement, the actions to be taken, the bodies responsible and the timetable for the implementation of those actions. Each programme shall identify which of the ex ante conditionalities laid down in the relevant Fund-specific rules and the general ex ante conditionalities set out in Part II of Annex XI are applicable to it and, which of them, pursuant to the assessment referred to in paragraph 1, are fulfilled at the date of submission of the Partnership Agreement and programmes. Where the applicable ex ante conditionalities are not fulfilled, the programme shall contain a description of the actions to be taken, the bodies responsible and the timetable for their implementation. Member States shall fulfil those ex ante conditionalities not later than 31 December 2016 and report on their fulfilment not later than in the annual implementation report in 2017 in accordance with Article 50(4) or the progress report in 2017 in accordance with point (c) of Article 52(2). 3. The Commission shall assess the consistency and the adequacy of the information provided by the Member State on the applicability of ex ante conditionalities and on the fulfilment of applicable ex ante conditionalities in the framework of its assessment of the programmes and, where appropriate, of the Partnership Agreement. That assessment of applicability by the Commission shall, in accordance with Article 4(5), take account of the principle of proportionality having regard to the level of support allocated, where appropriate. The assessment of fulfilment by the Commission shall be limited to the criteria laid down in the Fund-specific rules and in Part II of Annex XI, and shall respect national and regional competences to decide on the specific and adequate policy measures including the content of strategies. 4. In the event of disagreement between the Commission and a Member State on the applicability of an ex ante conditionality to the specific objective of the priorities of a programme or its fulfilment, both the applicability in accordance with the definition in point (33) of Article 2 and the non-fulfilment shall be proven by the Commission. 5.

The failure to complete actions to fulfil an applicable ex ante conditionality which has not been fulfilled at the date of submission of the Partnership Agreement and the respective programmes, by the deadline set out in paragraph 2, shall constitute a ground for suspending interim payments by the Commission to the priorities of the programme concerned that are affected. In both cases, the scope of suspension shall be proportionate, taking into account the actions to be taken and the funds at risk. 6. Paragraph 5 shall not apply in the event of agreement between the Commission and the Member State on the non-applicability of an ex ante conditionality or on the fact that an applicable ex ante conditionality has been fulfilled, as indicated by the approval of the programme and the Partnership Agreement, or in the absence of Commission observations within 60 days of the submission of the relevant report referred to in paragraph 2. 7. The Commission shall without delay lift the suspension of interim payments for a priority where a Member State has completed actions relating to the fulfilment of ex ante conditionalities applicable to the programme concerned and which had not been fulfilled at the time of the decision of the Commission on the suspension. It shall also without delay lift the suspension where, following amendment of the programme related to the priority concerned, the ex ante conditionality concerned is no longer applicable. 8.

Article 21 Performance review 1. The Commission, in cooperation with the Member States, shall undertake a review of the performance of the programmes in each Member State in 2019 (the 'performance review'), with reference to the performance framework set out in the respective programmes. The method for establishing the performance framework is set out in Annex II. 2. The performance review shall examine the achievement of the milestones of the programmes at the level of priorities, on the basis of the information and the assessments presented in the annual im\u00ad plementation report submitted by the Member States in the year 2019. Article 22 Application of the performance framework 1. The performance reserve shall constitute between 5 and 7 % of the allocation to each priority within a programme, with the exception of priorities dedicated to technical assistance and programmes dedicated to financial instruments in accordance with Article 39. The total amount of the performance reserve allocated by ESI Fund and category of region shall be 6 %. The amounts corresponding to the performance reserve shall be set out in the programmes broken down by priority and, where appropriate, by ESI Fund and by category of region. 2. On the basis of the performance review, the Commission shall within two months of the receipt of the respective annual implemen\u00ad tation reports in the year 2019 adopt a decision, by means of implemen\u00ad ting acts, to determine for each ESI Fund and Member State, the programmes and priorities which have achieved their milestones, setting out that information by ESI Fund and by category of region, where a priority covers more than one ESI Fund or category of region. 3. The performance reserve shall be allocated only to programmes and priorities which have achieved their milestones. Where priorities have achieved their milestones the amount of the performance reserve established for the priority shall be considered to be definitively allocated on the basis of the Commission decision referred to in paragraph 2. \u25bc B ",

Where priorities have not achieved their milestones, the Member State shall propose the reallocation of the corresponding amount of the performance reserve to priorities set out in the Commission decision referred to in paragraph 2, and other amendments to the programme which result from the reallocation of the performance reserve, no later than three months after the adoption of the decision referred to in paragraph 2. The Commission shall approve, in accordance with Article 30(3) and (4), the amendment of the programmes concerned. Where a Member State fails to submit the information in accordance with Article 50(5) and (6), the performance reserve for the programmes or the priorities concerned shall not be allocated to the programmes or the priorities concerned. 5. The Member State's proposal to reallocate the performance reserve shall be consistent with thematic concentration requirements and minimum allocations set out in this Regulation and the Fund-specific rules. By way of derogation, where one or more of the priorities linked to thematic concentration requirements or minimum allocations have not achieved their milestones, the Member State may propose a reallocation of the reserve, which does not comply with the aforementioned requirements and minimum allocations. 6. Where there is evidence, resulting from the performance review for a priority, that there has been a serious failure in achieving that priority's milestones relating only to the financial and output indicators and key implementation steps set out in the performance framework and that that failure is due to clearly identified implementation weaknesses, which the Commission had previously communicated pursuant to Article 50(8) following close consultations with the Member State concerned, and that Member State has failed to take the necessary corrective action to address such weaknesses, the Commission may, not earlier than five months after such communication, suspend all or part of an interim payment of a priority of a programme in accordance with the procedure laid down in the Fund-specific rules. The Commission shall without delay lift the suspension of interim payments when the Member State has taken the necessary corrective action. Where the corrective action concerns the transfer of financial allocations to other programmes or priorities, which have achieved their milestones, the Commission shall approve, by means of an implemen\u00ad ting act, the necessary amendment of the programmes concerned in accordance with Article 30(2). By way of derogation from Article 30(2), in such case the Commission shall decide on the amendment no later than two months after the submission of the Member State request for amendment. 7. Where the Commission, based on the examination of the final implementation report of the programme, establishes a serious failure to achieve the targets relating only to financial indicators, output indi\u00ad cators and key implementation steps set out in the performance framework due to clearly identified implementation weaknesses, which the Commission had previously communicated pursuant to Article 50(8) following close consultations with the Member State concerned, and the Member State has failed to take the necessary corrective action to address such weaknesses, the Commission may notwithstanding Article 85 apply financial corrections in respect of the priorities concerned in accordance with the Fund-specific rules. \u25bc B ",

Financial corrections shall not be applied where the failure to achieve targets is due to the impact of socio-economic or environmental factors, significant changes in the economic or environmental conditions in the Member State concerned or because of reasons of force majeure seriously affecting implementation of the priorities concerned. The Commission shall be empowered to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 149 to establish detailed rules on criteria for determining the level of financial correction to be applied. The Commission shall adopt implementing acts, laying down the detailed arrangements to ensure a consistent approach for determining the milestones and targets in the performance framework for each priority and for assessing the achievement of the milestones and targets.

Such contributions of land or real estate shall be eligible provided that the conditions laid down in Article 69(1) are met. 11. VAT shall not constitute eligible expenditure of an operation, except in the case of VAT which is non-recoverable under national VAT legislation. The treatment of VAT at the level of investments made by final recipients shall not be taken into account for the purposes of determining the eligibility of expenditure under the financial instrument. However, where financial instruments are combined with grants under paragraphs 7 and 8 of this Article, the provisions of Article 69(3) shall apply to the grant. 12. For the purposes of the application of this Article, the applicable Union State aid rules shall be those in force at the time when the managing authority or the body that implements the fund of funds contractually commits programme contributions to a financial instrument, or when the financial instrument contractually commits programme contributions to final recipients, as applicable. 13.

This Article shall apply to operations which generate net revenue after their completion. For the purposes of this Article, \u2018net revenue\u2019 means cash in-flows directly paid by users for the goods or services provided by the operation, such as charges borne directly by users for the use of infrastructure, sale or rent of land or buildings, or payments for services less any operating costs and replacement costs of short-life equipment incurred during the corresponding period. Operating cost-savings generated by the operation, with the exception of cost-savings resulting from the implementation of energy efficiency measures, shall be treated as net revenue unless they are offset by an equal reduction in operating subsidies. \u25bc B Where not all the investment cost is eligible for co-financing, the net revenue shall be allocated pro rata to the eligible and non-eligible parts of the investment cost. 2. The eligible expenditure of the operation to be co-financed from the ESI Funds shall be reduced in advance taking into account the potential of the operation to generate net revenue over a specific reference period that covers both implementation of the operation and the period after its completion. 3. The potential net revenue of the operation shall be determined in advance by one of the following methods chosen by the managing authority for a sector, subsector or type of operation: (a) application of a flat rate net revenue percentage for the sector or subsector applicable to the operation as defined in Annex V or in any of the delegated acts referred to in the second, third and fourth subparagraphs; \u25bc M6 (aa) application of a flat rate net revenue percentage established by a Member State for a sector or subsector not covered by point (a). Before the application of the flat rate the responsible audit authority shall verify that the flat rate has been established according to a fair, equitable and verifiable method based on historical data or objective criteria; \u25bc B (b) calculation of the discounted net revenue of the operation, taking into account the reference period appropriate to the sector or subsector applicable to the operation, the profitability normally expected of the category of investment concerned, the application of the polluter-pays principle and, if appropriate, considerations of equity linked to the relative prosperity of the Member State or region concerned. The Commission shall be empowered to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 149 in duly justified cases to amend Annex V by adjusting the flat rates established therein taking into account historical data, the potential for cost recovery and the polluter-pays principle where applicable. The Commission shall be empowered to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 149 establishing flat rates for sectors or subsectors within the fields of ICT, RDI and energy efficiency. The Commission shall notify the delegated acts to the European Parliament and the Council not later than 30 June 2015. \u25bc B ",

Where the method referred to in point (a) of the first subparagraph is applied, all the net revenue generated during implementation and after completion of the operation shall be considered to be taken into account by the application of the flat rate and shall therefore not be deducted subsequently from the eligible expenditure of the operation. When a flat rate for a new sector or subsector has been established by the adoption of a delegated act in accordance with the third and fourth subparagraphs, a managing authority may choose to apply the method set out in point (a) of the first subparagraph for new operations in relation to the sector or subsector concerned. The Commission shall be empowered to adopt delegated acts, in accordance with Article 149, laying down the method referred to in point (b) of the first subparagraph. Where that method is applied, the net revenue generated during implementation of the operation, resulting from sources of revenue not taken into account in determining the potential net revenue of the operation, shall be deducted from the eligible expenditure of the operation, no later than in the final payment claim submitted by the beneficiary. \u25ba C1 4. The method by which the net revenue is deducted from the expenditure of the operation included in the payment application submitted to the Commission shall be \u25c4 determined in accordance with national rules. \u25bc M6 5. As an alternative to the application of the methods laid down in paragraph 3 of this Article, the maximum co-financing rate referred to in Article 60(1) may, at the request of a Member State, be decreased for a priority or measure under which all supported operations could apply a uniform flat rate in accordance with point (a) of the first subparagraph of paragraph 3 of this Article. The decrease shall be not less than the amount calculated by multiplying the maximum Union co-financing rate applicable under the Fund-specific rules by the relevant flat rate referred to in that point. \u25bc B 6. Where it is objectively not possible to determine the revenue in advance based on any of the methods set out in paragraphs 3 or 5, the net revenue generated within three years of the completion of an oper\u00ad ation, or by the deadline for the submission of documents for programme closure fixed in the Fund-specific rules, whichever is the earlier, shall be deducted from the expenditure declared to the Commission. 7. Paragraphs 1 to 6 shall not apply to: (a) operations or parts of operations supported solely by the ESF; (b) operations whose total eligible cost before application of paragraphs 1 to 6 does not exceed EUR 1 000 000; (c) repayable assistance subject to an obligation for full repayment and prizes; (d) technical assistance; \u25bc B ",

In addition, paragraphs 1 to 6 shall not apply to operations for which support under the programme constitutes State aid. \u25bc B CHAPTER II Special rules on support from the ESI Funds to PPPs Article 62 PPPs The ESI Funds may be used to support PPP operations. Such PPP operations shall comply with applicable law, in particular concerning State aid and public procurement. Article 63 Beneficiary under PPP operations 1. In relation to a PPP operation, and by way of derogation from point (10) of Article 2, a beneficiary may be either: (a) the public law body initiating the operation; or (b) a body governed by private law of a Member State (the \"private partner\") selected or to be selected for the implementation of the operation. 2. The public law body initiating the PPP operation may propose that the private partner, to be selected after approval of the operation, be the beneficiary for the purposes of support from the ESI Funds. In that event, the approval decision shall be conditional on the managing authority satisfying itself that the selected private partner fulfils and assumes all the corresponding obligations of a beneficiary under this Regulation. 3. The private partner selected to implement the operation may be replaced as beneficiary during implementation where this is required under the terms and conditions of the PPP or the financing agreement between the private partner and the financial institution co-financing the \u25bc B ",

In that event the replacement private partner or public law body shall become the beneficiary provided that the managing authority satisfies itself that the replacement partner fulfils and assumes all the corresponding obligations of a beneficiary under this Regulation. 4. The Commission shall be empowered to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 149 laying down additional rules on the re\u00ad placement of a beneficiary and on the related responsibilities. 5. The replacement of a beneficiary shall not be considered a change in ownership within the meaning of point (b) of Article 71(1) if that replacement satisfies the applicable conditions set out in paragraph 3 of this Article and in a delegated act adopted pursuant to paragraph 4 of this Article. Article 64 Support for PPP operations \u25ba C1 1. In the case of a PPP operation where the beneficiary is a public law body, expenditure under a PPP operation which has been incurred and paid by the private partner may, by way of derogation from Article 65(2), be considered as incurred and paid by a beneficiary and included in a payment application to the Commission \u25c4 provided that the following conditions are met: (a) the beneficiary has entered into a PPP agreement with a private partner; (b) the managing authority has verified that the expenditure declared by the beneficiary has been paid by the private partner and that the operation complies with applicable Union and national law, the programme and the conditions for support of the operation. \u25ba C1 2. Payments to beneficiaries made in respect of expenditure included in a payment application in accordance with paragraph 1 shall be paid \u25c4 into an escrow account set up for that purpose in the name of the beneficiary. 3. The funds paid into the escrow account referred to in paragraph 2 shall be used for payments in accordance with the PPP agreement, including any payments to be made in the event of termination of the PPP agreement. 4. The Commission shall be empowered to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 149 laying down the minimum requirements to be included in PPP agreements which are necessary for the application of the derogation laid down in paragraph 1 of this Article, including provisions related to termination of the PPP agreement and for the purpose of ensuring an adequate audit trail.

In the case of costs reimbursed pursuant to points (b) and (c) of the first subparagraph of Article 67(1), the actions constituting the basis for reimbursement shall be carried out between 1 January 2014 and 31 December 2023. 5. By way of derogation from paragraph 4, the starting date in relation to costs reimbursed on the basis of (b) and (c) of the first subparagraph of Article 67(1) for actions under the YEI shall be 1 September 2013. 6. Operations shall not be selected for support by the ESI Funds where they have been physically completed or fully implemented before the application for funding under the programme is submitted by the beneficiary to the managing authority, irrespective of whether all related payments have been made by the beneficiary. 7. This Article shall be without prejudice to the rules on eligibility of technical assistance at the initiative of the Commission set out in Article 58. 8. This paragraph shall apply to operations which generate net revenue during their implementation and to which paragraphs 1 to 6 of Article 61 do not apply. The eligible expenditure of the operation to be co-financed from the ESI Funds shall be reduced by the net revenue not taken into account at the time of approval of the operation directly generated only during its implementation, not later than at the final payment claim submitted by the beneficiary. Where not all the costs are eligible for co-financing, the net revenue shall be allocated pro rata to the eligible and non-eligible parts of the cost.

For the purposes of determining staff costs, an hourly rate may be calculated by dividing the latest documented annual gross employment costs by 1 720 hours for persons working full time, or by a corresponding pro-rata of 1 720 hours, for persons working part-time. 3. When applying the hourly rate calculated in accordance with paragraph 2, the total number of hours declared per person for a given year shall not exceed the number of hours used for the calcu\u00ad lations of that hourly rate. The first subparagraph shall not apply to programmes under the European territorial cooperation goal for staff costs related to individuals who work on a part-time assignment on the operation. \u25bc M6 ",

Where annual gross employment costs are not available, they may be derived from the available documented gross employment costs or from the contract for employment, duly adjusted for a 12-month period. 5. Staff costs related to individuals who work on part-time assignment on the operation may be calculated as a fixed percentage of the gross employment costs, in line with a fixed percentage of time worked on the operation per month, with no obligation to establish a separate working time registration system. The employer shall issue a document for employees setting out that fixed percentage. Article 68b Flat-rate financing for costs other than staff costs 1. A flat rate of up to 40 % of eligible direct staff costs may be used in order to cover the remaining eligible costs of an operation without a requirement for the Member State to execute any calculation to determine the applicable rate. For operations supported by the ESF, the ERDF or the EAFRD, salaries and allowances paid to participants shall be considered additional eligible costs not included in the flat rate. 2. The flat rate referred to in paragraph 1 shall not be applied to staff costs calculated on the basis of a flat rate. \u25bc B Article 69 Specific eligibility rules for grants and repayable assistance 1. Contributions in kind in the form of provision of works, goods, services, land and real estate for which no cash payment supported by invoices, or documents of equivalent probative value, has been made, may be eligible on condition that the eligibility rules of the ESI Funds and the programme so provide and that all the following criteria are fulfilled: (a) the public support paid to the operation which includes contributions in kind does not exceed the total eligible expenditure, excluding contributions in kind, at the end of the operation; (b) the value attributed to contributions in kind does not exceed the costs generally accepted on the market in question; (c) the value and the delivery of the contribution can be independently assessed and verified; (d) in the case of provision of land or real estate, a cash payment, for the purposes of a lease agreement of a nominal amount per annum not exceeding a single unit of the currency of the Member State, may be made; (e) in the case of contributions in kind in the form of unpaid work, the value of that work is determined by taking into account the verified time spent and the rate of remuneration for equivalent work. \u25bc M6 ",

Depreciation costs may be considered as eligible where the following conditions are fulfilled: (a) the eligibility rules of the programme allow for it; (b) the amount of the expenditure is duly justified by supporting documents having equivalent probative value to invoices for eligible costs where reimbursed in the form referred to in point (a) of the first subparagraph of Article 67(1); (c) the costs relate exclusively to the period of support for the operation; (d) public grants have not contributed towards the acquisition of the depreciated assets. 3. The following costs shall not be eligible for a contribution from the ESI Funds and from the amount of support transferred from the Cohesion Fund to the CEF as referred to in Article 92(6): (a) interest on debt, except in relation to grants given in the form of an interest rate subsidy or guarantee fee subsidy; (b) the purchase of land not built on and land built on in the amount exceeding 10 % of the total eligible expenditure for the operation concerned.

Subject to the derogations referred to in paragraph 2 and the Fund-specific rules, operations supported by the ESI Funds shall be located in the programme area. Operations concerning the provision of services to citizens or businesses which cover the whole territory of a Member State shall be considered as being located in all programme areas within a Member State. In such cases, expenditure shall be allocated to the concerned programme areas on a pro-rata basis, based on objective criteria. The second subparagraph of this paragraph does not apply to the national programme referred to in Article 6(2) of Regulation (EU) No 1305/2013 or to the specific programme for the establishment and the operation of the national rural network referred to in Article 54(1) of that Regulation. 2.

Where operations financed from the Funds and the EMFF are im\u00ad plemented outside the programme area in accordance with this paragraph and have benefits both outside and within the programme area, such expenditure shall be allocated to those areas on a pro rata basis based on objective criteria. Where operations concern the thematic objective referred to in point (1) of the first paragraph of Article 9 and are implemented outside the Member State but within the Union, only points (b) and (d) of the first subparagraph of this paragraph shall apply. 3. For operations concerning technical assistance or information, communication and visibility measures and promotional activities, and for operations concerning the thematic objective referred to in point (1) of the first paragraph of Article 9, expenditure may be incurred outside the Union provided that the expenditure is necessary for the satisfactory implementation of the operation. 4. Paragraphs 1, 2 and 3 shall not apply to programmes under the European territorial cooperation goal. Paragraphs 2 and 3 shall not apply to operations supported by the ESF. \u25bc B Article 71 Durability of operations 1.

An operation comprising investment in infrastructure or productive investment shall repay the contribution from the ESI Funds if within 10 years of the final payment to the beneficiary the productive activity is subject to relocation outside the Union, except where the beneficiary is an SME. Where the contribution from the ESI Funds takes the form of State aid, the period of 10 years shall be replaced by the deadline applicable under State aid rules. 3.

Commission officials or authorised Commission representatives may carry out on-the-spot audits or checks subject to giving at least 12 working days notice to the competent national authority, except in urgent cases. The Commission shall respect the principle of propor\u00ad tionality by taking into account the need to avoid unjustified duplication of audits or checks carried out by Member States, the level of risk to the budget of the Union and the need to minimise the administrative burden on beneficiaries in accordance with the Fund-specific rules.

The budget commitments relating to the performance reserve in each programme shall be made separately from the remaining allocation to the programme. \u25ba C1 The decision of the Commission adopting a programme shall constitute a financing decision within the meaning of \u25ba M6 Article 110(1) of the Financial Regulation \u25c4 \u25c4 and once notified to the Member State concerned, a legal commitment within the meaning of that Regulation. For each programme, the budget commitments for the first instalment shall follow the adoption of the programme by the Commission. The budget commitments for subsequent instalments shall be made by the Commission before 1 May of each year, on the basis of the decision referred to in the second paragraph of this Article, except where Article 16 of the Financial Regulation applies. Following application of the performance framework in accordance with Article 22, where priorities have not achieved their milestones, the Commission shall where necessary decommit the corresponding appro\u00ad priations committed to the programmes concerned as part of the performance reserve and shall make them available again for the programmes for which the allocation is increased as a result of an amendment approved by the Commission in accordance with Article 22(5). \u25bc M6 ",

Payments by the Commission of the contribution from the ESI Funds to each programme shall be made in accordance with budget appropriations and subject to available funding. Each payment shall be posted to the earliest open budget commitment of the Fund concerned. 2. Payments related to the commitments of the performance reserve shall not be made prior to the definitive allocation of the performance reserve, in accordance with Article 22(3) and (4). 3. Payments shall take the form of pre-financing, interim payments and payment of the final balance. 4. For forms of support under points (b), (c) and (d) of the first subparagraph of Article 67(1) and under Articles 68 and 69, costs calculated on the applicable basis shall be regarded as eligible expenditure. Article 78 Common rules for calculating interim payments, and payment of the final balance The Fund-specific rules shall lay down rules for the calculation of the amount reimbursed as interim payments, and of the final balance. That amount shall be a function of the specific co-financing rate applicable to the eligible expenditure. Article 79 \u25bc C1 Payment applications \u25bc B \u25ba C1 1. The specific procedure and information to be submitted for payment applications in relation to each ESI Fund \u25c4 shall be laid down in the Fund-specific rules. \u25ba C1 2.

Article 82 Clearance of initial pre-financing The amount paid as initial pre-financing shall be totally cleared from the Commission accounts not later than when the programme is closed. Article 83 Interruption of the payment deadline 1. The payment deadline for an interim payment claim may be inter\u00ad rupted by the authorising officer by delegation within the meaning of the Financial Regulation for a maximum period of six months if: (a) following information provided by a national or Union audit body, there is clear evidence to suggest a significant deficiency in the functioning of the management and control system; \u25bc C1 (b) the authorising officer by delegation has to carry out additional verifications following information that has come to that officer's attention alerting him or her that expenditure in a payment appli\u00ad cation is linked to an irregularity having serious financial consequences; \u25bc B (c) there is a failure to submit one of the documents required under \u25ba M6 Article 63(5), (6) and (7) of the Financial Regulation \u25c4. The Member State may agree to an extension of the interruption period for another three months. The Fund-specific rules for the EMFF may lay down specific bases for interruption of payments linked to non-compliance with rules applicable under the Common Fisheries Policy, which shall be proportionate, having regard to the nature, gravity, duration and recurrence of the non-compliance. 2. The authorising officer by delegation shall limit the interruption to the part of the expenditure covered by the payment claim affected by the elements referred to in the first subparagraph of paragraph 1, unless it is not possible to identify the part of the expenditure affected. The authorising officer by delegation shall inform the Member State and the managing authority in writing immediately of the reason for interruption and shall ask them to remedy the situation. The interruption shall be ended by the authorising officer by delegation as soon as the necessary measures have been taken.

The Commission shall make financial corrections by cancelling all or part of the Union contribution to a programme and effecting recovery from the Member State, in order to exclude from Union financing expenditure which is in breach of applicable law. 2. A breach of applicable law shall lead to a financial correction only in relation to expenditure which has been declared to the Commission and where one of the following conditions is met: (a) the breach has affected the selection of an operation by the body responsible for support from the ESI Funds or in cases where, due to the nature of the breach, it is not possible to establish that impact but there is a substantiated risk that the breach has had such an effect; (b) the breach has affected the amount of expenditure declared for reimbursement by the budget of the Union or in cases where, due to the nature of the breach, it is not possible to quantify its financial impact but there is a substantiated risk that the breach has had such an effect. 3. When deciding on a financial correction under paragraph 1, the Commission shall respect the principle of proportionality by taking account of the nature and gravity of the breach of applicable law and its financial implications for the budget of the Union. The Commission shall keep the European Parliament informed of decisions taken to apply financial corrections. 4. The criteria and the procedures for applying financial corrections shall be laid down in the Fund-specific rules. CHAPTER IV Decommitment Article 86 Principles \u25ba C1 1.

The part of commitments still open shall be decommitted if any of the documents required for the closure have not been submitted to the Commission by the deadlines established in the Fund-specific rules. 5. The budgetary commitments in respect of the performance reserve shall be subject only to the decommitment procedure set out in paragraph 4. Article 87 Exception to the decommitment 1. The amount concerned by decommitment shall be reduced by the amounts equivalent to that part of the budget commitment for which: (a) the operations are suspended by a legal proceeding or by an admin\u00ad istrative appeal having suspensory effect; or \u25ba C1 (b) it has not been possible to make a payment application \u25c4 for reasons of force majeure seriously affecting implementation of all or part of the programme. The national authorities claiming force majeure under point (b) of the first subparagraph shall demonstrate the direct consequences of the force majeure on the implementation of all or part of the programme. For the purpose of points (a) and (b) of the first subparagraph, the reduction may be requested once, if the suspension or force majeure lasted no longer than one year, or a number of times that corresponds to the duration of the force majeure or the number of years between the date of the legal or administrative decision suspending the implemen\u00ad tation of the operation and the date of the final legal or administrative decision. 2.

The actions supported by the Funds shall also contribute to the delivery of the Union strategy for smart, sustainable and inclusive growth. 2. For the purpose of the mission referred to in paragraph 1, the following goals shall be pursued: (a) Investment for growth and jobs in Member States and regions, to be supported by the Funds; and (b) European territorial cooperation, to be supported by the ERDF. Article 90 Investment for growth and jobs goal 1. The Structural Funds shall support the Investment for growth and jobs goal in all regions corresponding to level 2 of the common clas\u00ad sification of territorial units for statistics ('NUTS level 2 regions') estab\u00ad lished by Regulation (EC) No 1059/2003 amended by Regulation (EC) No 105/2007. 2.

The classification of regions under one of the three categories of regions shall be determined on the basis of how the GDP per capita of each region, measured in purchasing power parities (PPS) and calculated on the basis of Union figures for the period 2007 - 2009, relates to the average GDP of the EU-27 for the same reference period. 3. The Cohesion Fund shall support those Member States whose GNI per capita, measured in PPS and calculated on the basis of Union figures for the period 2008 - 2010, is less than 90 % of the average GNI per capita of the EU-27 for the same reference period. The Member States eligible for funding from the Cohesion Fund in 2013, but whose nominal GNI per capita exceeds 90 % of the average GNI per capita of the EU-27 as calculated under the first subparagraph shall receive support from the Cohesion Fund on a tran\u00ad sitional and specific basis. 4. Immediately following the entry into force of this Regulation, the Commission shall adopt a decision, by means of an implementing act, setting out the list of regions fulfilling the criteria of the three categories of regions referred to in paragraph 2 and of Member States fulfilling the criteria of paragraph 3. That list shall be valid from 1 January 2014 to 31 December 2020. 5. In 2016, the Commission shall review the eligibility of Member States for support from the Cohesion Fund on the basis of Union GNI figures for the period 2012 - 2014 for the EU-27. Those Member States whose nominal GNI per capita falls below 90 % of the average GNI per capita of the EU-27 shall become newly eligible for support from the Cohesion Fund and those Member States which were eligible for the Cohesion Fund and whose nominal GNI per capita exceeds 90 %, shall lose their eligibility and shall receive support from the Cohesion Fund on a transitional and specific basis.

The Member State shall notify the Commission of the date and form of the designations, which shall be carried out at an appropriate level, of the managing authority and, where appropriate, of the certifying authority prior to the submission of the first application for interim payment to the Commission. 2. The designations referred to in paragraph 1 shall be based on a report and an opinion of an independent audit body that assesses the fulfilment by the authorities of the criteria relating to the internal control environment, risk management, management and control activities, and monitoring set out in Annex XIII. The independent audit body shall be the audit authority, or another public or private law body with the necessary audit capacity, which is independent of the managing authority and, where applicable, of the certifying authority, and which shall carry out its work taking account of internationally accepted audit standards. Where the independent audit body concludes that the part of the management and control system, concerning the managing authority or the certifying authority, is essentially the same as for the previous programming period, and that there is evidence, on the basis of audit work done in accordance with the relevant provisions of Regulation (EC) No 1083/2006 and Council Regulation (EC) No 1198/2006 ( 1 ), of their effective functioning during that period, it may conclude that the relevant criteria are fulfilled without carrying out additional audit work. \u25bc B ( 1 ) Council Regulation (EC) No 1198/2006 of 27 July 2006 on the European Fisheries Fund (OJ L 223, 15.8.2006, p. 1).

The Commission shall decide whether to request those documents on the basis of its risk assessment, taking into account information on significant changes in the functions and procedures of the managing authority or, where appropriate, the certifying authority compared to those in place for the previous programming period, and relevant evidence of their effective functioning. The Commission may make observations within two months of receipt of the documents referred to in the first subparagraph. Without prejudice to Article 83, the examination of those documents shall not interrupt the treatment of applications for interim payments. 4. Where the total amount of support from the Funds to an opera\u00ad tional programme exceeds EUR 250 000 000 or from the EMFF exceeds EUR 100 000 000 and there are significant changes in the functions and procedures of the managing authority or, where appro\u00ad priate, of the certifying authority compared to those in place for the previous programming period, the Member State may, at its own initi\u00ad ative, submit to the Commission, within two months of the notification of the designations referred to in paragraph 1, the documents referred to in paragraph 3. The Commission shall make observations on those documents within three months of their receipt. 5. Where existing audit and control results show that the designated authority no longer fulfils the criteria referred to in paragraph 2, the Member State shall, at an appropriate level, fix, according to the severity of the problem, a period of probation, during which the necessary remedial action shall be taken. Where the designated authority fails to implement the required remedial action within the period of probation determined by the Member State, the Member State, at an appropriate level, shall end its designation. The Member State shall notify the Commission without delay when a designated authority is put under probation, providing information on the respective period of probation, when, following implementation of remedial actions, the probation is ended, as well as when the desig\u00ad nation of an authority is ended. The notification that a designated body is put on probation by the Member State, without prejudice to the application of Article 83, shall not interrupt the treatment of applications for interim payments. 6. Where the designation of a managing authority or a certifying authority is ended, Member States shall designate, in accordance with the procedure provided for in paragraph 2, a new body, to take over the functions of the managing authority or of the certifying authority, and shall notify the Commission thereof. 7. The Commission shall, in order to ensure uniform conditions for the implementation of this Article, adopt implementing acts concerning the model for the report and opinion of the independent audit body and the description of the functions and procedures in place for the managing authority and, where appropriate, the certifying authority.

The Commission shall, in order to lay down uniform conditions for the implementation of this Article, adopt implementing acts setting out the model for the accounts referred to in this Article. Those im\u00ad plementing acts shall be adopted in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in Article 150(3). Article 138 Submission of information For each year from 2016 until and including 2025, Member States shall submit, by the deadline set out in \u25ba M6 Article 63(5), and the second subparagraph of Article 63(7), of the Financial Regulation \u25c4, the documents referred to in that Article namely: (a) the accounts, referred to in Article 137(1) of this Regulation, for the preceding accounting year; (b) the management declaration and the annual summary referred to in point (e) of the first subparagraph of Article 125(4) of this Regu\u00ad lation, for the preceding accounting year; (c) the audit opinion and the control report referred to in points (a) and (b) of the first subparagraph of Article 127(5) of this Regulation, for the preceding accounting year.

The Commission shall accept the accounts where it is able to conclude that the accounts are complete, accurate and true. The Commission shall reach such a conclusion where the audit authority has provided an unqualified audit opinion regarding the completeness, accuracy and veracity of the accounts unless the Commission has specific evidence that the audit opinion on the accounts is unreliable. 3. The Commission shall inform the Member State by the deadline set out in Article 84 as to whether it is able to accept the accounts. 4. If, for reasons attributable to Member State, the Commission is unable to accept the accounts by the deadline set out in Article 84, the Commission shall notify the Member States specifying the reasons in accordance with paragraph 2 of this Article and the actions which are required to be undertaken and the time period for their completion.

The procedure for examination and acceptance of the accounts shall not interrupt the treatment of applications for interim payments and shall not lead to suspension of payments, without prejudice to Articles 83 and 142. 6. On the basis of the accepted accounts, the Commission shall calculate the amount chargeable to the Funds and to the EMFF for the accounting year and the consequent adjustments in relation to the payments to the Member State. The Commission shall take into account: (a) the amounts in the accounts referred to in point (a) of Article 137(1) and to which the co-financing rate for each priority is to be applied; (b) the total amount of payments made by the Commission during that accounting year, consisting of: (i) the amount of interim payments paid by the Commission in accordance with Article 130(1) and Article 24; and (ii) the amount of the annual pre-financing paid under Article 134(2). 7. After the calculation carried out under paragraph 6, the Commission shall clear the respective annual pre-financing and pay any additional amount due within 30 days of the acceptance of the accounts. Where there is an amount recoverable from the Member State, it shall be subject to a recovery order issued by the Commission which shall be executed, where possible, by offsetting against amounts due to the Member State under subsequent payments to the same oper\u00ad ational programme. \u25ba C1 Such recovery shall not constitute a financial correction and shall not reduce support from the Funds and the EMFF to the operational programme. \u25c4 The amount recovered shall constitute assigned revenue in accordance with Article 177(3) of the Financial Regulation. \u25bc M9 By way of derogation from the first subparagraph, the Commission shall not issue a recovery order for amounts recoverable from the Member State for the accounts submitted in 2020. Amounts not recovered shall be used to accelerate investments related to the COVID-19 outbreak and eligible under this Regulation and Fund-specific rules. The amounts not recovered shall be cleared or recovered at closure. \u25bc B 8. Where, after applying the procedure set out in paragraph 4, the Commission is unable to accept the accounts, the Commission shall determine, on the basis of the available information and in accordance with paragraph 6, \u25ba C1 the amount chargeable to the Funds and the EMFF for the accounting year, and shall inform the Member State. Where the Member State notifies the Commission of its agreement within two months of the transmission by the Commission of the information, paragraph 7 shall apply. In the absence of such agreement, the Commission shall adopt a decision, by means of implementing acts, setting out the amount chargeable to the Funds and the EMFF for the accounting year. Such decision shall not constitute a financial correction and shall not reduce support from the Funds and the EMFF to the operational programme \u25c4. On the basis of the decision, the Commission shall apply the adjustments to the payments to the Member State in accordance with paragraph 7. 9. The acceptance of the accounts by the Commission, or a decision by the Commission under paragraph 8 of this Article, shall be without prejudice to the application of corrections under Articles 144 and 145. \u25bc B ",

Without prejudice to the rules governing State aid, \u25ba C1 the managing authority shall ensure that all supporting documents regarding expenditure supported by the Funds and the EMFF on operations \u25c4 for which the total eligible expenditure is less than EUR 1 000 000, are made available to the Commission and the European Court of Auditors upon request for a period of three years from 31 December following the submission of the accounts in which the expenditure of the operation is included. In the case of operations other than those referred to in the first subpara\u00ad graph, all supporting documents shall be made available for a two year period from 31 December following the submission of the accounts in which the final expenditure of the completed operation is included. A managing authority may decide to apply to operations for which the total eligible expenditure is less than EUR 1 000 000 the rule referred to in the second subparagraph. \u25bc C1 The time period referred to in the first or second subparagraph shall be interrupted either in the case of legal proceedings or by a duly justified request of the Commission. \u25bc B 2.

The Member States shall in the first instance be responsible for investigating irregularities and for making the financial corrections required and pursuing recoveries. In the case of a systemic irregularity, the Member State shall extend its investigation to cover all operations potentially affected. 2. Member States shall make the financial corrections required in connection with individual or systemic irregularities detected in oper\u00ad ations or operational programmes. Financial corrections shall consist of cancelling all or part of the public contribution to an operation or operational programme. The Member States shall take into account the nature and gravity of the irregularities and the financial loss to the Funds or the EMFF and shall apply a proportionate correction. \u25ba C1 Financial corrections shall be recorded in the accounts for the accounting year in which the cancellation is decided. \u25c4 3. The contribution from the Funds or the EMFF cancelled in accordance with paragraph 2 may be reused by the Member State within the operational programme concerned, subject to paragraph 4. 4. The contribution cancelled in accordance with paragraph 2 may not be reused for any operation that was the subject of the correction or, where a financial correction is made for a systemic irregularity, for any operation affected by the systemic irregularity. 5. The Fund-specific rules for the EMFF may lay down specific bases for financial corrections by the Member States linked to non-compliance with rules applicable under the Common Fisheries Policy, which shall be proportionate, having regard to the nature, gravity, duration and recurrence of the non-compliance. \u25bc B ",

The Commission shall make financial corrections, by means of implementing acts, by cancelling all or part of the Union contribution to an operational programme in accordance with Article 85, where, after carrying out the necessary examination, it concludes that: (a) there is a serious deficiency in the effective functioning of the management and control system of the operational programme which has put at risk the Union contribution already paid to the operational programme; (b) the Member State has not complied with its obligations under Article 143 prior to the opening of the correction procedure under this paragraph; (c) expenditure contained in a payment application is irregular and has not been corrected by the Member State prior to the opening of the correction procedure under this paragraph. The Commission shall base its financial corrections on individual cases of identified irregularity and shall take account of whether an irregu\u00ad larity is systemic. Where it is not possible to quantify precisely the amount of irregular expenditure charged to the Funds or the EMFF, the Commission shall apply a flat rate or extrapolated financial correction. 2. The Commission shall, when deciding on a correction under paragraph 1, respect the principle of proportionality by taking account of the nature and gravity of the irregularity and the extent and financial implications of the deficiencies in management and control systems found in the operational programme. 3. Where the Commission bases its position on reports of auditors other than those of its own services, it shall draw its own conclusions regarding the financial consequences after examining the measures taken by the Member State concerned under Article 143(2), the notifications sent under Article 122(2), and any replies from the Member State. 4. In accordance with Article 22(7), where the Commission, based on the examination of the final implementation report of the operational programme for the Funds or the last annual implementation report for the EMFF, establishes a serious failure to achieve the targets set out in the performance framework, it may apply financial corrections in respect of the priorities concerned, by means of implementing acts. \u25bc C1 5. When a Member State does not comply with its obligations under Article 95, the Commission may, in relation to the degree of non-compliance with those obligations, make a financial correction by cancelling all or part of the contribution from the Funds or the EMFF to the Member State concerned. \u25bc B ",

The Fund-specific rules for the EMFF may lay down specific bases for financial corrections by the Commission linked to non-compliance with rules applicable under the Common Fisheries Policy which shall be proportionate having regard to the nature, gravity, duration and recurrence of the non-compliance. Article 145 Procedure 1. Before taking a decision on a financial correction, the Commission shall launch the procedure by informing the Member State of the provi\u00ad sional conclusions of its examination and requesting the Member State to submit its comments within two months. 2. Where the Commission proposes a financial correction on the basis of extrapolation or a flat rate, the Member State shall be given the opportunity to demonstrate, through an examination of the docu\u00ad mentation concerned, that the actual extent of irregularity is less than the Commission's assessment. In agreement with the Commission, the Member State may limit the scope of this examination to an appropriate proportion or sample of the documentation concerned. Except in duly justified cases, the time allowed for that examination shall not exceed a further period of two months after the two-month period referred to in paragraph 1. 3. The Commission shall take account of any evidence provided by the Member State within the time limits set out in paragraphs 1 and 2. 4. Where the Member State does not accept the provisional conclusions of the Commission, the Member State shall be invited to a hearing by the Commission, in order to ensure that all relevant information and observations are available as a basis for conclusions by the Commission on the application of the financial correction. \u25bc C1 5. In the event of an agreement, and without prejudice to paragraph 7 of this Article, the Member State may reuse the Funds concerned or the EMFF in accordance with Article 143(3). \u25bc B 6. In order to apply financial corrections the Commission shall take a decision, by means of implementing acts, within six months of the date of the hearing, or of the date of receipt of additional information where the Member State agrees to submit such additional information following the hearing. The Commission shall take account of all information and observations submitted during the course of the procedure. If no hearing takes place, the six month period shall begin to run two months after the date of the letter of invitation to the hearing sent by the Commission. \u25bc B ",

The assessment of serious deficiencies in the effective functioning of management and control systems shall be based on the applicable law when the relevant management declarations, annual control reports and audit opinions were submitted. When deciding on a financial correction the Commission shall: (a) respect the principle of proportionality by taking account of the nature and gravity of the serious deficiency in the effective func\u00ad tioning of a management and control system and its financial impli\u00ad cations for the budget of the Union; (b) for the purpose of applying a flat rate or extrapolated correction, exclude irregular expenditure previously detected by the Member State which has been the subject of an adjustment in the accounts in accordance with Article 139(10), and expenditure subject to an ongoing assessment of its legality and regularity under Article 137(2); (c) take into account flat rate or extrapolated corrections applied to the expenditure by the Member State for other serious deficiencies detected by the Member State when determining the residual risk for the budget of the Union. 8. The Fund-specific rules for the EMFF may lay down additional rules of procedure for financial corrections referred to in Article 144(7). Article 146 Obligations of Member States A financial correction by the Commission shall not prejudice the Member State's obligation to pursue recoveries under Article 143(2) of this Regulation and to recover State aid within the meaning of Article 107(1) TFEU and under Article 14 of Council Regulation (EC) No 659/1999 ( 1 ). \u25bc C1 ( 1 ) Council Regulation (EC) No 659/1999 of 22 March 1999 laying down detailed rules for the application of Article 93 of the EC Treaty (OJ L 83, 27.3.1999, p. 1).

Operations for which the total eligible expenditure does not exceed EUR 400 000 for the ERDF and the Cohesion Fund, EUR 300 000 for the ESF or EUR 200 000 for the EMFF shall not be subject to more than one audit by either the audit authority or the Commission prior to the submission of the accounts for the accounting year in which the operation is completed. Other operations shall not be subject to more than one audit per accounting year by either the audit authority or the Commission prior to the submission of the accounts for the accounting year in which the operation is completed. Operations shall not be subject to an audit by the Commission or the audit authority in any year if there has already been an audit in that year by the European Court of Auditors, provided that the results of the audit work performed by the European Court of Auditors for such operations can be used by the audit authority or the Commission for the purpose of fulfilling their respective tasks. By derogation from the first subparagraph, operations for which the total eligible expenditure is between EUR 200 000 and EUR 400 000 for the ERDF and the Cohesion Fund, between EUR 150 000 and EUR 300 000 for the ESF and between EUR 100 000 and EUR 200 000 for the EMFF may be subject to more than one audit, if the audit authority concludes, based on its professional judgment, that it is not possible to issue or draw up an audit opinion on the basis of statistical or non-statistical sampling methods referred to in Article 127(1) without carrying out more than one audit of the respective operation. \u25bc B 2.

INTRODUCTION In order to promote the harmonious, balanced and sustainable development of the Union and to maximise the contribution of the ESI Funds to the Union strategy for smart, sustainable and inclusive growth as well as the Fund-specific missions of the ESI Funds, including economic, social and territorial cohesion, it is necessary to ensure that policy commitments made in the context of the Union strategy for smart, sustainable and inclusive growth are underpinned by investment through the ESI Funds and other Union instruments. The Common Strategic Framework (CSF) shall therefore, in accordance with Article 10, and in compliance with the priorities and objectives laid down in the Fund-specific Regulations, provide strategic guiding principles in order to achieve an integrated devel\u00ad opment approach using the ESI Funds coordinated with other Union instruments and policies, in line with the policy objectives and headline targets of the Union strategy for smart, sustainable and inclusive growth and, where appropriate, the flagship initiatives, while taking into account the key territorial challenges and specific national, regional and local contexts. 2. CONTRIBUTION OF ESI FUNDS TO THE UNION STRATEGY FOR SMART, SUSTAINABLE AND INCLUSIVE GROWTH AND COHERENCE WITH THE UNION'S ECONOMIC GOVERNANCE 1. To support effective targeting of smart, sustainable and inclusive growth in the Partnership Agreements and programmes this Regulation identifies eleven thematic objectives, set out in the first paragraph of Article 9, corresponding to the priorities of the Union strategy for smart, sustainable and inclusive growth which shall receive support from the ESI Funds. 2. In line with the thematic objectives set out in the first paragraph of Article 9, Member States shall, in order to ensure critical mass necessary to deliver growth and jobs, concentrate support in accordance with Article 18 of this Regulation and with the Fund-specific rules on thematic concentration, and shall ensure the effectiveness of spending. Member States shall give particular attention to prioritising growth-friendly expenditure, including spending on education, research, innovation and energy efficiency and expenditure to facilitate the access of SMEs to finance, and to ensure environmental sustainability, and the management of natural resources and climate action as well as to modernise public administration. They shall also take account of main\u00ad taining or reinforcing the coverage and effectiveness of employment services and active labour market policies in order to combat unemployment, with a focus on youth and tackle the social consequences of the crisis, and promote social inclusion. 3. To ensure consistency with priorities established in the context of the European Semester, in preparing their Partnership Agreements, Member States shall plan the use of the ESI Funds taking into account the National Reform Programmes, where appropriate, and the most recent relevant country-specific recommendations adopted in accordance with Article 121(2) TFEU and relevant Council recommendations adopted in accordance with Article 148(4) TFEU in accordance with their respective roles and obligations. Member States, where necessary, shall also take into account relevant Council recommendations based on the Stability and Growth Pact and the economic adjustment programmes. \u25bc B ",

In order to determine the way in which the ESI Funds can most effec\u00ad tively contribute to the Union strategy for smart, sustainable and inclusive growth, and to take account of the Treaty objectives, including economic, social and territorial cohesion, Member States shall select the thematic objectives for the planned use of the ESI Funds within the appropriate national, regional and local contexts. 3. INTEGRATED APPROACH TO AND ARRANGEMENTS FOR THE USE OF THE ESI FUNDS 3.1 Introduction 1. In accordance with point (a) of Article 15(2) the Partnership Agreement shall indicate an integrated approach to territorial development. Member States shall ensure that the selection of thematic objectives and investment and Union priorities addresses development needs and terri\u00ad torial challenges in an integrated manner in line with the analysis set out in section 6.4. Member States shall seek to make maximum use of the possibilities for ensuring coordinated and integrated delivery of the ESI funds. 2. Member States and, where appropriate in accordance with Article 4(4), regions shall ensure that the interventions supported through the ESI Funds are complementary and are implemented in a coordinated manner with a view to creating synergies, in order to reduce the admin\u00ad istrative cost and burden for managing bodies and beneficiaries in accordance with Articles 4, 15 and 27. 3.2 Coordination and complementarity 1. Member States and managing authorities responsible for the implemen\u00ad tation of the ESI Funds shall work closely together in the preparation, implementation, monitoring and evaluation of the Partnership Agreement and programmes. In particular, they shall ensure that the following actions are carried out: (a) identify areas of intervention where the ESI Funds can be combined in a complementary manner to achieve the thematic objectives set out in this Regulation; (b) ensure in accordance with Article 4(6), the existence of arrangements for the effective coordination of the ESI Funds in order to increase the impact and effectiveness of the Funds including, where appro\u00ad priate, through the use of multi-fund programmes for the Funds; (c) promote the involvement of managing authorities responsible for other ESI Funds and relevant ministries in the development of support schemes to ensure coordination and synergies and to avoid overlaps; (d) establish, where appropriate, joint monitoring committees for programmes implementing the ESI Funds, and the development of other joint management and control arrangements to facilitate coor\u00ad dination between authorities responsible for the implementation of the ESI Funds; (e) make use of available joint eGovernance solutions, which may assist applicants and beneficiaries, and make the widest possible use of \"one-stop shops\", including for advice on the opportunities of support available through each of the ESI Funds; \u25bc B ",

Member States shall, where appropriate, combine the ESI Funds into integrated packages at local, regional or national level, which are tailor-made to address specific territorial challenges in order to support the achievement of the objectives set out in the Partnership Agreement and programmes. This can be done using ITIs, Integrated operations, Joint Action Plans and community-led local development. 2. In accordance with Article 36 to achieve integrated use of thematic objectives, funding from different priority axes or operational programmes supported by the ESF, ERDF and Cohesion Fund may be combined under an ITI. Actions carried out under an ITI may be comp\u00ad lemented with financial support from the programmes under the EAFRD or the EMFF respectively. 3. In accordance with the relevant provisions of the Fund-specific rules, to increase impact and effectiveness in a thematically coherent integrated approach a priority axis may concern more than one category of region, combine one or more complementary investment priorities from the ERDF, Cohesion Fund and ESF under one thematic objective and, in duly justified cases combine one or more complementary investment priorities from different thematic objectives in order to achieve the maximum contribution to that priority axis. 4. Member States shall promote, in accordance with their institutional and legal framework and with Article 32 the development of local and sub-regional approaches. Community-led local development shall be im\u00ad plemented in the context of a strategic approach to ensure that the 'bottom-up' definition of local needs takes account of priorities set at a higher level. Member States shall therefore define the approach to community-led local development in the EAFRD and, where appropriate, in the ERDF, the ESF or the EMFF in accordance with Article 15(2) and shall indicate in the Partnership Agreement the main challenges to be tackled in this way, the main objectives and priorities for community-led local development, the types of territories to be covered, the specific role to be attributed to local action groups in the delivery of strategies and the role envisaged for the EAFRD and where appropriate for the ERDF, the ESF or the EMFF in implementing community-led local development strategies in different types of territories such as rural, urban and coastal areas and the corresponding co-ordination mechanisms. 4.

The Union programmes set out in this section do not constitute an exhaustive list. 4.1 Introduction 1. Member States and the Commission shall, in accordance with their respective responsibilities, take into consideration the impact of Union policies at national and regional level, and on social, economic and territorial cohesion with a view to fostering synergies and effective coor\u00ad dination and to identifying and promoting the most suitable means of using Union funds to support local, regional and national investment. Member States shall also ensure complementarity between Union policies and instruments and national, regional and local interventions. 2. Member States and the Commission shall, in accordance with Article 4(6) and with their respective responsibilities, ensure coordination between the ESI Funds and other relevant Union instruments at Union and Member State level. They shall take appropriate steps to ensure consistency, at programming and implementation stages, between interventions supported by the ESI Funds and the objectives of other Union policies. To this end, they shall seek to take into account the following aspects: (a) enhancing complementarities and synergies between different Union instruments at Union, national and regional level, both in the planning phase and during implementation; (b) optimise existing structures and where necessary, establish new structures that facilitate the strategic identification of priorities for the different instruments and structures for coordination at Union and national level that avoid duplication of effort and identify areas where additional financial support is needed; (c) make use of the potential to combine support from different instruments to support individual operations and work closely with those responsible for implementation at Union and national level to deliver coherent and streamlined funding opportunities for beneficiaries. 4.2 Coordination with the Common Agricultural Policy and the Common Fisheries Policy 1. The EAFRD is an integral part of the Common Agricultural Policy and complements the measures under the European Agricultural Guarantee Fund which provide direct support to farmers and support market measures. Member States shall therefore manage those interventions together so as to maximise synergies and the added value of Union support. 2. The EMFF aims to achieve the objectives of the reformed Common Fisheries Policy and of the Integrated Maritime Policy. Member States shall therefore make use of the EMFF to support efforts to improve data collection and strengthen control, and ensure that synergies are also sought in support of the priorities of Integrated Maritime Policy, such as marine knowledge, maritime spatial planning, integrated coastal zone management, integrated maritime surveillance, the protection of the marine environment and of biodiversity, and the adaptation to the adverse effects of climate change on coastal areas. \u25bc B ",

Member States shall develop national and/or regional 'smart special\u00ad isation' strategies in line with the National Reform Programme, where appropriate. Such strategies may take the form of or be included in a national or a regional research and innovation strategic policy framework for 'smart specialisation'. Smart specialisation strategies shall be developed through involving national or regional managing authorities and stakeholders such as universities and other higher education institu\u00ad tions, industry and social partners in an entrepreneurial discovery process. The authorities directly concerned by Horizon 2020 shall be closely associated with that process. Smart specialisation strategies shall include: (a) \"Upstream actions\" to prepare regional R&I players to participate in Horizon 2020 (\"stairways to excellence\") to be developed, where necessary, through capacity- building. Communication and cooper\u00ad ation between Horizon 2020 national contact points and managing authorities of the ESI Funds shall be strengthened. (b) \"Downstream actions\" to provide the means to exploit and diffuse R&I results, stemming from Horizon 2020 and preceding programmes, into the market with particular emphasis on creating an innovation-friendly environment for business and industry, including SMEs and in line with the priorities identified for the territories in the relevant smart specialisation strategy. 3. Member States shall encourage the use of the provisions in this Regu\u00ad lation that allow the ESI Funds to be combined with resources under Horizon 2020 in the relevant programmes used to implement parts of the strategies referred to in point 2. Joint support shall be provided to national and regional authorities for the design and implementation of such strategies, to identify opportunities for joint financing of R&I infra\u00ad structures of European interest, the promotion of international collabor\u00ad ation, methodological support through peer reviews, exchange of good practice, and training throughout regions. 4. Member States and, where appropriate under Article 4(4), regions, shall consider additional measures aimed at unlocking their potential for excellence in R&I, in a manner that is complementary to and creates synergies with Horizon 2020, in particular through joint funding. Those measures shall consist of: (a) linking excellent research institutions and less developed regions as well as low- performing Research, Development and Innovation (RDI) Member States and regions to create new or upgrade existing centres of excellence in less developed regions as well as in low-performing RDI Member States and regions; (b) building links in less developed regions as well as in low-performing RDI Member States and regions between innovative clusters of recognised excellence; \u25bc B ( 1 ) Regulation (EU) No 1287/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 December 2013 establishing a Programme for the Competitiveness of Enterprises and small and medium-sized enterprises (COSME) (2014 - 2020) and repealing Decision No 1639/2006/EC (See page 33 of this Official Journal).

Each Member State's allocation shall be the sum of the allocations for its individual eligible NUTS level 2 regions, calculated in accordance with the following steps: (a) determination of an absolute amount (in EUR) obtained by multiplying the population of the region concerned by the difference between that region's GDP per capita, measured in PPS, and the EU-27 average GDP per capita (in PPS); (b) application of a percentage to the above absolute amount in order to determine that region's financial envelope; this percentage shall be graduated to reflect the relative prosperity, measured in PPS, as compared to the EU-27 average, of the Member State in which the eligible region is situated, i.e.: (i) for regions in Member States whose level of GNI per capita is below 82 % of the EU-27 average: 3,15 %; (ii) for regions in Member States whose level of GNI per capita is between 82 % and 99 % of the EU-27 average: 2,70 %; (iii) for regions in Member States whose level of GNI per capita is over 99 % of the EU-27 average: 1,65 %; (c) to the amount obtained in accordance with point (b) is added, if appli\u00ad cable, an amount resulting from the allocation of a premium of EUR 1 300 per unemployed person per year, applied to the number of persons unemployed in that region exceeding the number that would be unemployed if the average unemployment rate of all the EU less developed regions applied. Allocation method for transition regions eligible under the Investment for growth and jobs goal, referred to in point (b) of the first subparagraph of Article 90(2) 2. Each Member State's allocation shall be the sum of the allocations for its individual eligible NUTS level 2 regions, calculated in accordance with the following steps: (a) determination of the minimum and maximum theoretical aid intensity for each eligible transition region. The minimum level of support is determined by the average per capita aid intensity per Member State before the application of the regional safety net, allocated to the more developed regions of that Member State. If the Member State has no more developed regions, the minimum level of support will correspond to the initial average per capita aid intensity of all more developed regions, i.e. EUR 19,80 per head and per year. The maximum level of support refers to a theoretical region with a GDP per head of 75 % of the EU-27 average and is calculated using the method defined in points (a) and (b) of paragraph 1. Of the amount obtained by this method, 40 % is taken into account; (b) calculation of initial regional allocations, taking into account regional GDP per capita (in PPS) through a linear interpolation of the region's relative GDP per capita compared to EU-27; \u25bc B ",

Allocation method for the more developed regions eligible under the Investment for growth and jobs goal, referred to in point (c) of the first subparagraph of Article 90(2) 3. The total initial theoretical financial envelope shall be obtained by multi\u00ad plying an aid intensity per head and per year of EUR 19,80 by the eligible population. 4. The share of each Member State concerned shall be the sum of the shares of its eligible NUTS level 2 regions, which are determined on the basis of the following criteria, weighted as indicated: (a) total regional population (weighting 25 %); (b) number of unemployed people in NUTS level 2 regions with an unemployment rate above the average of all more developed regions (weighting 20 %); (c) employment to be added to reach the Union strategy for smart, sustainable and inclusive growth target for regional employment rate (ages 20 to 64) of 75 % (weighting 20 %); (d) number of persons aged 30 to 34 with tertiary educational attainment to be added to reach the Union strategy for smart, sustainable and inclusive growth target of 40 % (weighting 12,5 %); (e) number of early leavers from education and training (aged 18 to 24) to be subtracted to reach the Union strategy for smart, sustainable and inclusive growth target of 10 % (weighting 12,5 %); (f) difference between the observed GDP of the region (measured in PPS), and the theoretical regional GDP if the region were to have the same GDP per head as the most prosperous NUTS level 2 region (weighting 7,5 %); (g) population of NUTS level 3 regions with a population density below 12,5 inhabitants/km 2 (weighting 2,5 %). Allocation method for the Member States eligible for the Cohesion Fund under Article 90(3) 5. The total theoretical financial envelope shall be obtained by multiplying the average aid intensity per head and per year of EUR 48 by the eligible population. Each eligible Member State's a priori allocation of this theoretical financial envelope corresponds to a percentage based on its population, surface area and national prosperity, and shall be obtained by applying the following steps: (a) calculation of the arithmetical average of that Member State's population and surface area shares of the total population and surface area of all the eligible Member States.

In order to reflect the significant needs of Member States, which acceded to the Union on or after 1 May 2004, in terms of transport and environment, their share of the Cohesion Fund will be set at a minimum of one third of their total final financial allocation after capping as defined in paragraphs 10 to 13 received on average over the period. 7. The allocation from the Cohesion Fund for the Member States defined in the second subparagraph of Article 90(3) shall be digressive over seven years. This transitional support will be of EUR 48 per capita in 2014, applied to the total population of the Member State. The amounts in the following years will be expressed as a percentage of the amount defined for 2014, the percentages being 71 % in 2015, 42 % in 2016, 21 % in 2017, 17 % in 2018, 13 % in 2019 and 8 % in 2020. Allocation method for the European territorial cooperation goal referred to in Article 4 of the ETC Regulation 8. The allocation of resources by Member State, covering cross-border and transnational cooperation, and including the contribution from the ERDF to the European Neighbourhood Instrument and the Instrument for Pre-Accession Assistance, is determined as the weighted sum of the share of the population of border regions and of the share of the total population of each Member State. The weight is determined by the respective shares of the cross-border and transnational strands. The shares of the cross border and transnational cooperation components are 77,9 % and 22,1 %. Allocation method of the additional funding for regions referred to in point (e) of Article 92(1) 9. An additional special allocation corresponding to an aid intensity of EUR 30 per inhabitant per year will be allocated to the outermost NUTS level 2 regions and the northern sparsely populated NUTS level 2 regions. That allocation will be distributed per region and Member State in a manner proportional to the total population of those regions. Maximum level of transfers from funds supporting cohesion 10. In order to contribute to achieving adequate concentration of cohesion funding on the least developed regions and Member States and to the reduction of disparities in average per capita aid intensities, the maximum level of transfer (capping) from the Funds to each individual Member State will be 2,35 % of the GDP of the Member State. The capping will be applied on an annual basis, subject to adjustments necessary to accommodate the frontloading of the YEI, and will - if applicable - proportionally reduce all transfers (except for the more developed regions and European territorial cooperation goal) to the Member State concerned in order to obtain the maximum level of transfer. For Member States which acceded to the Union before 2013 and whose average real GDP growth 2008-2010 was lower than -1 %, the maximum level of transfer will be 2,59 %. \u25bc B ",

The ceilings referred to in paragraph 10 above include the contributions from the ERDF to the financing of the cross-border strand of the European Neigh\u00ad bourhood Instrument and of the Instrument for Pre-Accession Assistance. Those ceilings do not include the specific allocation of EUR 3 000 000 000 for the YEI. 12. Calculations of GDP by the Commission will be based on the statistics available in May 2012. Individual national growth rates of GDP for 2014 to 2020, as projected by the Commission in May 2012, will be applied for each Member State separately. 13. The rules described in paragraph 10 shall not result in allocations per Member State higher than 110 % of their level in real terms for the 2007- 2013 programming period. Additional provisions 14. For all regions whose GDP per capita (in PPS) was used as an eligibility criterion for the 2007-2013 programming period and was less than 75 % of the EU-25 average, but whose GDP per capita is above 75 % of the EU-27 average, the minimum level of support in 2014-2020 under the Investment for growth and jobs goal will correspond every year to 60 % of their former indicative average annual allocation under the Convergence allocation, calculated by the Commission within the multiannual financial framework 2007-2013. 15. No transition region shall receive less than what it would have received if it had been a more developed region. In order to determine the level of this minimum allocation, the allocation distribution method for more developed regions will be applied to all regions having a GDP per capita of at least 75 % of the EU-27 average. 16. The minimum total allocation from the Funds for a Member State shall correspond to 55 % of its individual 2007-2013 total allocation. The adjustments needed to fulfil this requirement shall be applied proportionally to the allocations from the Funds, excluding the allocations under the European territorial cooperation goal. 17. To address the effects of the economic crisis on Member States within the euro area on their level of prosperity, and in order to boost growth and job creation in these Member States, the Structural Funds will provide the following additional allocations: (a) EUR 1 375 000 000 for the more developed regions of Greece; (b) EUR 1 000 000 000 for Portugal, distributed as follows: EUR 450 000 000 for more developed regions, of which EU 150 000 000 for Madeira, EUR 75 000 000 for the transition region and EUR 475 000 000 for the less developed regions; (c) EUR 100 000 000 for the Border, Midland and Western region of Ireland; (d) EUR 1 824 000 000 for Spain, of which EUR 500 000 000 for Extre\u00ad madura, EUR 1 051 000 000 for the transition regions and EUR 273 000 000 for the more developed regions; \u25bc B ",

In order to recognise the challenges posed by the situation of island Member States and the remoteness of certain parts of the Union, Malta and Cyprus shall receive, after applying the method of calculation referred to in paragraph 16, an additional envelope of EUR 200 000 000 and EUR 150 000 000 respectively under the Investment for growth and jobs goal and distributed as follows: one third for the Cohesion Fund and two thirds for the Structural Funds. The Spanish regions of Ceuta and Melilla shall be allocated an additional total envelope of EUR 50 000 000 under the Structural Funds. The outermost region of Mayotte shall be allocated a total envelope of EUR 200 000 000 under the Structural Funds. 19. To facilitate the adjustment of certain regions either to changes in their eligibility status or to the long-lasting effects of recent developments in their economy the following additional allocations are made: (a) for Belgium EUR 133 000 000, out of which EUR 66 500 000 for Limburg and EUR 66 500 000 for the transition regions of the Region of Wallonia; (b) for Germany EUR 710 000 000, out of which EUR 510 000 000 for the former Convergence regions in the transition regions' category and EUR 200 000 000 for the Leipzig region; (c) notwithstanding paragraph 10, the less developed regions of Hungary will be allocated an additional envelope of EUR 1 560 000 000, the less developed regions of the Czech Republic an additional envelope of EUR 900 000 000 and the less developed region of Slovenia an additional envelope of EUR 75 000 000, under the Structural Funds. 20.

Each Member State\u2019s provisional share from the REACT-EU resources is determined as the weighted sum of the shares determined on the basis of the following criteria, weighted as indicated: (a) A factor of GDP (weighting of 2/3) obtained by applying the following steps: (i) share of each Member State of the total loss of real seasonally adjusted GDP expressed in EUR between the first semester of 2019 and the end of the applicable reference period for all Member States considered; (ii) adjustment of the shares obtained under point (i) by dividing them with the Member State\u2019s GNI per capita expressed as a percentage of the average GNI per capita of the EU-27 (average expressed as 100 %). (b) A factor of unemployment (weighting of 2/9) expressed as the weighted average of: (i) the share of the Member State in the total number of unemployed (weighting of 3/4) for all Member States considered in January 2020; and (ii) the share of the Member State in the total increase in the number of persons unemployed (weighting of 1/4) between January 2020 and the end of the applicable reference period for all Member States considered. (c) A factor of youth unemployment (weighting of 1/9) expressed as the average of: (i) the share of the Member State in the total number of young persons unemployed (weighting of 3/4) for all Member States considered in January 2020; and (ii) the share of the Member State in the total increase in the number of young persons unemployed (weighting of 1/4) between January 2020 and the applicable reference period for all Member States considered. If the Member State\u2019s real seasonally adjusted GDP expressed in EUR for the applicable reference period is higher than in the first semester of 2019, that Member State\u2019s data shall be excluded from the calculations in point (a)(i). If the number of people unemployed (age group 15 to 74) or young people unemployed (age group 15 to 24) in the Member State for the applicable reference period is lower than in January 2020, that Member State\u2019s data shall be excluded from the calculations in points (b)(ii) and (c)(ii). \u25bc M13 ",

The amounts exceeding the level set out in points (a) to (c) per Member State are redistributed proportionally to the allocations of all other Member States whose average GNI per capita (in PPS) is under 100 % of the EU-27 average. The GNI per capita (in PPS) for the period 2015-2017 is the one used for cohesion policy in the MFF 2021-2027 negotiations. 3.

The number of young unemployed persons between the ages of 15-24 shall be identified in the eligible NUTS level 2 regions as defined in Article 16 of the ESF Regulation, namely NUTS level 2 regions that have youth unemployment rates for young persons aged 15 to 24 of more than 25 % in 2012 and, for Member States where the youth unemployment rate has increased by more than 30 % in 2012, regions that have youth unemployment rates of more than 20 % in 2012 (the \u2018eligible regions\u2019). 2. The allocation corresponding to each eligible region shall be calculated on the basis of the ratio between the number of young unemployed persons in the eligible region and the total number of young unemployed persons referred to in point 1 in all eligible regions. 3. The allocation for each Member State shall be the sum of the allocations for each of its eligible regions. II. The specific allocation for the YEI shall not be taken into account for the purpose of applying the capping rules set out in Annex VII in relation to the allocation of the global resources. III. For the determination of the specific allocation from the YEI to Mayotte, the youth unemployment rate and number of young unemployed persons shall be determined on the basis of the latest available data at national level as long as Eurostat data at NUTS level 2 are not available.

In the event that such data is not available, or in other duly justified cases, including where a Member State for the period 2014-2020 has significantly changed the regional breakdown as defined in Regulation (EC) No 1059/2003, gross fixed capital formation can be estimated by applying regional public expenditure indicators or regional population to national level public investment data. (e) Once there is agreement by the Commission and the Member State, Table 1 and, where applicable, Table 2 will be included in the Part\u00ad nership Agreement of the Member State concerned as the reference level of the public or equivalent structural expenditure to be maintained in the years 2014-2020. 2.2 Mid-term verification (a) At the time of the mid-term verification, a Member State shall be deemed to have maintained the level of public or equivalent structural expenditure if the annual average of expenditure in the years 2014-2017 is equal to or higher than the reference level of expenditure set in the Partnership Agreement. (b) Following the mid-term verification, the Commission may revise, in consultation with a Member State, the reference level of public or equivalent structural expenditure in the Partnership Agreement if the economic situation of the Member State has significantly changed from that estimated at the time of adoption of the Partnership Agreement. 2.3 Ex post verification At the time of the ex post verification, a Member State shall be deemed to have maintained the level of public or equivalent structural expenditure if the annual average of expenditure in the years 2014-2020 is equal to or higher than the reference level of expenditure set in the Partnership Agreement. 3. FINANCIAL CORRECTION RATES FOLLOWING EX POST VERIFI\u00ad CATION Where the Commission decides to carry out a financial correction in accordance with Article 95(6), the rate of financial correction shall be obtained by subtracting 3 % from the difference between the reference level in the Partnership Agreement and the level achieved, expressed as a percentage of the reference level, and then dividing the result by 10. The financial correction shall be determined by applying that rate of financial correction to the Funds' contribution to the Member State concerned for the less developed regions for the full programming period. If the difference between the reference level in the Partnership Agreement and the level achieved, expressed as a percentage of the reference level in the Partnership Agreement, is 3 % or less, no financial correction shall be made.
