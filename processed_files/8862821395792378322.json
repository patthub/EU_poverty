We have used external assessments (from the OECD 7 and the Eu- ropean Court of Auditors 8 ), reports from the Regulatory Scrutiny Board and a broad range of consultation activities. These include: \u2022 interviews and meetings to consult Commission staff working in a range of different departments and func- tions, including better regulation support staff, senior managers and members of Commissioners\u2019 political teams, \u2022 a public consultation of all external stakeholders 9 , \u2022 targeted consultation meetings with the adminis- trative secretariats of the European Parliament, the Council of the European Union, the Committee of the Regions and the European Economic and Social Com- mittee, \u2022 an opinion from the REFIT Platform 10 , \u2022 discussion in the Competitiveness and Growth Working Party of the Council (better regulation). The Joint Research Centre has also published a review of the peer-reviewed and \u2018grey\u2019 literature written since 2015 in support of the current stocktaking exercise 11 . INTRODUCTION The Juncker Commission came into office with a commitment to do different things and to do them differently 1 . It wanted to focus on delivering the initiatives needed to support its 10 political priorities and address the issues that really matter to people in the EU 2 . Under its Union for democratic change, it put better regulation principles at the heart of its policymaking processes and made them a key part of the efforts to improve the legitimacy of EU action. The Commission modified its in- ternal structure and created the post of First Vice President in charge of Better Regulation. It changed its internal working methods and transformed its planning processes to deliver streamlined wo rk programmes. Building on the origins of bet- ter regulation in improving European governance 3 , this Com- mission wanted to strengthen the better regulation tools 4 it inherited to inform timely and sound policy decisions that would deliver better policies for better results. To this end, in 2015 5 , the Commission adopted a wide-rang- ing set of measures. Since then it has regularly reported the results it has achieved and the further improvements it has introduced 6 . The Commission has now taken stock of how well the various better regulation tools and processes are functioning. Its aim is to highlight what is needed for possible further improvements and to support a public debate on the future of better regulation. This staff working document presents the findings of this exercise. It accompanies a Commission Communication dis- cussing key results and mapping out avenues for possible future improvements. 1 ",
        "| 9 In May 2015, the Commission published an extensive pack- age of new measures to improve and strengthen its better regulation policy in four areas where progress was consid- ered necessary: (1) Opening up policymaking. To make the EU more trans- parent and accountable but also to ensure that policies are based on the best available evidence 12 , the Commission took measures to consult more, listen better and better ex- plain what it does and why. These measures include: \u2022 creating feedback opportunities over the entire life- cycle of a policy from its initiation to its evaluation, including for the first time the possibility to give views on draft texts of delegated and implementing acts. \u2022 committing to systematic 12-week public consulta- tions on new proposals and evaluations. This was later complemented by a commitment to translate public consultation questionnaires into all official languages for priority initiatives in Annex I of the Commission work programme and into English, French and German for all others. \u2022 introducing an improved template for the explanatory memorandum accompanying Commission proposals. This provides improved explanations of how better regulation principles are applied in the preparation of an initiative, and if not, why they are not 13 . \u2022 designing a new, central web-based portal in sever- al stages ( \u2018Have Your Say\u2019 ) to facilitate stakeholders\u2019 participation in policymaking 14 . (2) Utilising better tools for better policies. To inform po- litical choices in a balanced and inclusive way, drawing les- sons from the past and identifying the best and least costly 12 This document focusses exclusively on the measures taken under Better Regulation policy. Other measures were also taken to im- prove the availability of evidence for policy making including the establishment of the European Commission\u2019s Group of Chief Scientific Advisors. 13 C(2015)3264: Standard explanatory memorandum: http://ec.europa.eu/transparency/regdoc/?fuseaction=list&coteId=3&year=2015&- number=3264&version=ALL&language=en 14 https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/better-regulation/have-your-say_en 15 https://ec.europa.eu/info/better-regulation-guidelines-and-toolbox_en 16 C(2015) 3263: Decision of the President of the Commission on the establishment of an independent Regulatory Scrutiny Board: https://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/info/files/decision-on-the-established-of-an-independent-regulatory-scrutiny-board_may2015_en.pdf policy solution, the Commission took measures such as: \u2022 integrating and improving guidelines (and supporting tools) 15 on how to apply better regulation in practice. These guidelines address all aspects of the policy cy- cle and the connections between them. \u2022 to substitute the Impact Assessment Board with a new body to scrutinise the quality of impact assessments like its predecessor and, for the first time, evaluations. To safeguard its autonomy, this Regulatory Scrutiny Board (the Board) consists of seven full-time mem- bers who are independent of the policymaking pro- cess, including three appointed from outside of the EU institutions 16 . \u2022 committing to explain publicly the reasons why the Commission may decide to take action even if the Board does not give a positive assessment of the quality of any accompanying impact assessment. (3) Keeping the existing stock of legislation fit for pur- pose. Even well designed legislation may become out of date, turn out to be more burdensome and less effective than originally thought or simply cease to achieve relevant objectives. For these reasons, managing existing EU legisla- tion is as important as responding to new policy challenges, and the Commission therefore decided to: \u2022 commit to evaluate existing legislation before propos- ing changes (\u2018evaluate first\u2019 principle); \u2022 strengthen and eventually mainstream its REFIT pro- gramme to verify the opportunities to deliver results more efficiently whenever existing EU legislation is revised; THE MAY 2015 BETTER REGULATION PACKAGE 2 ",
        "10 | Taking Stock of the Commission\u2019s Better Regulation Agenda \u2022 establish a new REFIT Platform 17 through which stakeholders can point the Commission to existing policies and legislation that could be simplified. (4) Advancing a common agenda with other EU institu- tions and Member States . The Commission has a key role in better regulation but cannot do it alone. The right to amend legislative proposals lies with the European Parliament and Council and the right to transpose and implement adopted legislation lies with Member States. That is why the Com- mission put forward a proposal for a new interinstitutional agreement on better law-making between the European Par- 17 C(2015) 3261: Commission decision establishing the REFIT Platform: https://europa.eu/!fN39pK 18 COM(2015) 216: Proposal for an interinstitutional agreement on better regulation: https://europa.eu/!tu94tj 19 Interinstitutional agreement between the European Parliament, the Council of the European Union and the European Union and the European Commission on better law making of 13 April 2016 https://europa.eu/!Hm69mP liament, the Council of the European Union and the European Commission 18 . Following negotiations, a new agreement 19 was jointly approved in April 2016. The next section takes stock of the evidence and examines the views of the concerned parties on the results of these meas- ures. ",

        "12 | Taking Stock of the Commission\u2019s Better Regulation Agenda Answers to the public consultation identified stakeholder consultations and transparency as the two areas where most progress has been achieved since 2014 20 . This is also reflected in an OECD comparative assessment of its mem- ber countries\u2019 better regulation systems which, in 2018, ranked the Commission as first in the OECD for stakeholder engagement 21 . At the same time, however, respondents to the public consultations flagged transparency and consul- tation as the two areas most in need of improvements in the future 22 . 20 Question 15 of the public questionnaire. 21 http://www.oecd.org/governance/oecd-regulatory-policy-outlook-2018-9789264303072-en.htm 22 Question 16 of the public questionnaire. 23 Questions 7 and 8 of the public consultation. 24 In 2015 and 2016 roadmaps and inception impact assessments were posted to http://ec.europa.eu/smart-regulation/roadmaps/ index_en.htm . They were posted to the \u2018Have Your Say\u2019 web site for the first time in 2017. This allowed central collection of feedback and its statistical analysis. These general findings confirm the continued validity of the Commission\u2019s choice to focus on opening up policymaking and are reassuring in terms of the success achieved. They do, however, indicate the need to reflect further on what the key shortcomings are and how they can be tackled in a pro- portionate manner. The following analyses in greater detail outcomes and contributing factors, offering background ev- idence for future policy decisions. FEEDBACK OPPORTUNITIES Opportunities to give feedback over the entire lifecycle of a policy from its initiation to its evaluation were gradually intro- duced. Already in 2015, feedback on inception impact assess- ments, evaluation roadmaps and other types of roadmaps was made available. In 2016 for the first time it became pos- sibile to provide views on draft texts of delegated and imple- menting acts and in 2017 on Commission proposals. The results of the public consultation show that around a fifth of respondents are not aware of the opportunities the Commission offers to contribute to policymaking 23 . Since those answering the public consultation can be expected to be more knowledgeable about better regulation than the av- erage stakeholder at large, this indicates a clear scope to further improve the knowledge and reach of EU tools. The satisfaction of those aware of the various opportunities varied, with the majority of respondents always being either satisfied or neutral. Slightly over a fifth of the respondents, however, expressed dissatisfaction with all tools. Roadmaps and inception impact assessments At the start of each new initiative the Commission publishes an inception impact assessment or, when no impact assess- ment is planned, a roadmap 24 . At the start of each eval- uation the Commission publishes an evaluation roadmap. OPENING UP POLICYMAKING 3 3.1.

        "| 13 These documents provide basic information about what the Commission intends to do, the analytical work it will under- take, and the consultation activities it will launch and, in the case of roadmaps, the reasons why no impact assessment is planned. For a period of 4 weeks, the public can provide comments on these documents, including the need for an impact assessment. The lead Commission department takes into account these comments when preparing the initiative. \u2022 In the two-year period up until 31 December 2018, 86 inception impact assessments were posted to the web for stakeholder feedback. These attracted 1 253 feed- back contributions (32 inception impact assessments received 0-5 contributions, with 2 inception impact assessments receiving more than 100 contributions). The highest number of responses were received for the fight against illegal content online (146) and construc- tion products (121). Business groups 25 accounted for approximately 59%, NGOs for 15%, EU citizens for 8% and public authorities for 5%. The most responses came from Belgium (24%), followed by Germany (16%), the UK (8%) and France (8%). \u2022 In the two-year period up until 31 December 2018, 128 roadmaps were posted to the web for stakeholder feedback.

For example, acts of individual application, in cases of ur- gency or where scientific advice is followed without any deviation, are not posted.

These attracted 724 feedback contri- butions 63 roadmaps received 0-5 contributions, and none more than 100 contributions). Business groups accounted for approximately 44%, NGOs for 20%, EU citizens for 12% and public authorities for 7%. The most responses came from Belgium (33%), followed by Ger- many (14%), France (7%) and Spain (6%).any (14%), ). Responses from the public consultation indicate that road- maps and inception impact assessments are generally con- sidered useful to prepare participation in policymaking and as tools to provide initial feedback 26 . This is especially true among professionals. Professionals are also the group that provided most of the feedback to inception impact assess- ments and evaluation roadmaps. According to the REFIT Plat- form, feedback may be limited due to a lack of time 27 . In its responses to the stocktaking consultation, the business com- munity welcomed the opportunities to provide feedback on roadmaps and inception impact assessments. Delegated acts and implementing acts In many acts of Union law, the European Parliament and the Council empower the Commission to introduce or replace tech- nical and specific elements needed to implement legislation or to ensure a consistent implementation by all Member States. The Commission has greatly enhanced transparency around the preparation of these acts of general application, known as delegated and implementing acts, allowing the public to comment on the draft legal text for a period of 4 weeks 28 . These comments are taken into account before the Commis- sion adopts a delegated act and before it presents a draft im- plementing act to the relevant committee for its opinion. Between 1 July 2016 and 31 December 2018 29 , the Commis- sion published 151 draft delegated acts, 191 draft implement- ing acts and 94 draft acts, following the regulatory procedure with scrutiny 30 . Between 2016 and 31 December 2018, the 151 delegated acts posted to the web for stakeholder feedback attracted 1 576 feedback contributions (100 delegated acts received 0-5 contributions, with 2 acts receiving more than 100 contri- Numbers 2015 2016 2017 2018 Delegated acts - 24 61 66 Implementing acts - 42 73 76 Acts following regulatory procedure with scrutiny - 32 31 31 Table 3 Delegated acts and implementing acts posted for feedback, 2015-2018.

Business groups accounted for approximately 54%, NGOs for 11%, EU citizens for 20% and public authorities for 5%. The most responses came from Germany (20%), followed by Belgium (17.8%), the UK (11.8%) and France (9%). In the same period, the 191 implementing acts posted to the web for stakeholder feedback 1 770 feedback contributions ( 149 implementing acts received 0-5 contributions, with 4 acts receiving more than 100 contribution). Business groups ac- counted for approximately 54%, NGOs for 6%, EU citizens for 26% and public authorities for 6%. The most responses came from Belgium (13.1%), followed by the UK (13%), France (12.8%) and Italy (9%). In the same period, the 94 acts following regulatory proce- dure with scrutiny posted to the web for stakeholder feedback received 1005 feedback contributions (50 consultation with 0-5 contributions, with 2 acts receiving more than 100 con- tributions). Business group accounted for approximately 59%, NGOs for 13%, EU citizen for 11% and public authorities for 3%, The most responses came from Belgium 25%, followed by Germany 19%, the UK 8%, and France 8%. The low response rate to implementing and delegated acts, in particular from EU citizens, is likely to reflect limited awareness of the feedback mechanism but also the technical nature of the acts. This mechanism is mainly used by business groups. Similar to roadmaps and inception impact assessments, re- sponses are generally low but may be more significant in a few cases of more general concern, such as the implementing act on drones or the one on the origin labelling on food. Proposals Prior to 2015, no formal transparent mechanism existed for the public to express its views about the legislative proposals presented to the European Parliament and the Council. The Commission introduced then a mechanism for stakeholders to comment on each proposal (and associated impact assess- ment) for a period of 8 weeks immediately following Com- mission adoption. The Commission reports this feedback to the European Parliament and the Council for them to consider during the legislative procedure. 31 Proposal for a Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on the reduction of the impact of certain plastic products on the environment, COM(2018)340, adopted 28.5.2018 32 Proposal for a Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on the quality of water intended for human consumption (recast), COM(2017)753, adopted 1.2.2018 33 Proposal for a Regulationof the European Parliament and of the Council establishing the European Defence Fund, COM(2018)476, adopted on 13.6.2018 34 REFIT Platform opinion on submissions XXII.4.a by the DIHK and XXII.4.b by a citizen on stakeholder consultation mechanisms, adopt- ed 7.6.2017, https://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/info/files/xxii4ab_on_stakeholder_consultation_mechanisms.pdf \u2022 wo-year period ending 31 December 2018, 232 Commis- sion proposals were posted to the web for stakeholder feedback. These attracted 7 075 feedback contributions (152 proposals received 0-5 contributions). The proposal on a European defence fund alone attracted more than half of these contributions (4 071). All other proposals attracted on average 13 contributions. Of all the contri- butions, business groups accounted for approximately 42.9%, NGOs for 10.5%, EU citizens for 31.1% and public authorities for 2.7%. The most responses came from Bel- gium (16.8%), followed by Italy (16.3%), France (12.1%), and Germany (11.6%). \u2022 The limited feedback reflects the limited awareness of the feedback mechanism as well as possibly a limited interest in its use. However, in the case of proposals of a general public interest, such as marine litter 31 , drinking water 32 or the defence fund 33 , reponse rates were sig- nificantly higher. \u2022 The European Parliament has made clear that it would prefer the Commission to limit its consultations to be- fore it adopts as it considers that, during the legislative process itself, it is for the Parliament and Member States to carry out their own consultations, if they choose to. A similar concern is also raised in the opinion of the REFIT Platform on stakeholder consultation 34 . The mechanism also receives the relative highest share of negative re- plies in terms of satisfaction from the participants to the public consultation (nearly a third). This is probably due to the reduced interest in offering feedback on items the Commission has already adopted. Nevertheless, practi- cal experience shows that, at times, the mechanism can generate a high number of replies, which could be of par- ticular value in cases where no impact assessment and/ or no public consultation could be carried out for reasons of urgency.

These consultations should consider local and regional dimensions, as appropriate 35 . Consultation of the public and civil society is part of a wider agenda to improve the democratic legitimacy and ownership of what the Union does that dates back to the 2001 White Paper on European Govern- ance 36 . This was given a new boost under the Juncker Commis- sion. In May 2015, the Commission introduced the requirement to conduct a 12-week public consultation to support all impact assessments and evaluations. For each new policy initiative, the Commission develops a consultation strategy that maps out the different consultation activities that the Commission will undertake. These will generally include a public consultation and a range of activities targeting particular stakeholders and information. According to the responses to the public consultation, the best known and the most valued way to contribute to policymaking is through public consultations 37 . The Commission carried out 417 public consultations between 2015 and 2018, of which 303 to support new policy initiatives and 114 to support eval- uations. The number of responses varies markedly depending on the nature of the topic addressed. There was a very large number of responses for topics of high popular interest for specific Member States or stakeholder groups. This was, for in- stance, the case for the consultation on summertime arrange- ments ( 38 ) which attracted some 4.6 million responses (of which 70% from one Member State alone) and the consultation on the evaluation of the Birds and Habitat Directive 39 which trig- gered more than half a million responses. The consultation on the future of the common agricultural policy 40 reached more than 300 000 replies in 2017 (compared to 5 700 in 2010 41 ). In contrast, zero or very limited responses were registered for some very technical cases like the code of conduct for com- puterised reservation systems, or zinc oxide in cosmetics.

        "16 | Taking Stock of the Commission\u2019s Better Regulation Agenda on the summertime arrangements, birds and habitats and the future common agricultural policy, the average number of re- sponses to a public consultation between 2015 and 2018 was around 1 119. A sample analysis suggests that in the case of public consultations supporting evaluations, response levels are relatively lower (on average 455 responses for evalua- tions 42 vs on average 1 643 responses for new initiatives 43 ). For both types of consultations, the majority of contributions tend to come from Germany, the UK, Spain and Italy. Local and regional authorites account for a small proportion of the answers. The academic literature recognises that public consultation is a tool to promote participatory democracy 44 . It promotes legiti- macy, helps identify obstacles to effective implementation and 42 Does not include birds and habitats 43 Does not include responses to summertime or common agricultural policy 44 Dawson, M.

According to consultees, public consultation is the area where the Commission has made con- siderable progress since 2015. The literature also recognises a clear increase in stakeholder involvement, with sufficient time to take into account contributions received from consultees 45 . However, external stakeholders raised concerns about the high number of consultations launched by the Commission and the demands this puts on respondents and the fatigue it can cause. In addition, industrial stakeholders asked for more transparency when presenting consultation results. They would also like the views of representative organisations listed in the transparency register to be weighted more heavily. CONTRIBUTING TO LAW-MAKING (THE \u2018HAVE YOUR SAY\u2019 PORTAL) For easier and better interaction throughout the policy cycle with people and stakeholders, the Commission has progres- sively put in place a dedicated digital solution on the Europa website. Through this new web portal \u2013 known as \u2018Have your say\u2019 - the public can participate in all the feedback mecha- nisms and public consultations analysed above. It can also provide comments and suggestions to the REFIT Platform on how to simplify specific legislation and reduce unnecessary regulatory costs. In June 2018, the portal also began offering a timeline view for each ongoing or upcoming initiative. Since the portal\u2019s launch in June 2016, the number of yearly vis- its to \u2018Have your say\u2019 has steadily increased, reaching almost 900 000 in 2018. A recent survey of 200 users also highlight- ed its user friendliness. OVERALL ASSESSMENT AND KEY DRIVERS The analysis suggests there is widespread recognition of the efforts the Commission has made to open up policymaking and a fair degree of satisfaction with the existing set of tools. The key features of the overall system are considered world class by the OECD and there is no significant share of stake- holders calling for a radical overhaul. At the same time, there is a widespread view that the system is not delivering up to its potential in terms of participation and evidence collection. 3.3. 3.4. ",
        "| 17 To highlight possible areas for future changes, the following analyses the underlying factors. Outreach There is limited awareness among stakeholders about the opportunities to participate in policymaking and consultation activities. This is reflected in the response levels to public con- sultations and feedback opportunities and was repeatedly pointed out by Commission staff who were interviewed. In the spring of 2017, in a major move to reach out to a wid- er public, the Commission introduced a new requirement to translate its questionnaires into all official languages 46 for its most important initiatives. Questionnaires for other initiatives would, as a minimum, be presented in English, French and German. All public consultations were available in at least two languages in 2018 and 71% were translated into all official languages (except Irish). Consultees to the public consultation received all these de- velopments positively 47 . Responses from NGOs, in particular, indicated that multilingual questionnaires were necessary. Finally, while too early to determine, the growing volume of responses may be linked to this greater accessibility by hav- ing consultations available in more languages. However, such developments come with a significant cost in terms of the speed with which a policy initiative can be developed, since a questionnaires may take 2 to 3 weeks to translate. Data now becoming available following completion of phase three of the \u2018Have Your Say\u2019 web portal will make it possible to analyse the geographical distribution of responses in greater detail. As for other possible ways of increasing awareness and out- reach, Commission staff welcomed a greater involvement of local and national authorities, Member States, expert groups and Council working parties in gathering evidence more ef- fectively about the different situations in the Member States and, where relevant, in the EU partner countries. Respondents suggested that awareness-raising campaigns should support individual consultations. This was echoed by Commission staff 46 The translation of public consultations into Irish should be assessed on a case-by-case basis until the capacity to translate into Irish has been fully built up. 47 Question 9 of the public consultation. 48 Alemanno, A.

The literature review also high- lighted a potential weakness, in that consultations currently seem to overly target those who already have access to the policymaking process 48 . Duration of public consultations Stakeholders will answer only if they have sufficient time to do so. National authorities and local and regional authorities, in particular, have stressed the importance of having suffi- cient time to prepare comprehensive responses. It is for this reason that, in 2015, the Commission committed in principle to 12 weeks for consultations and 4 weeks for feedback. The twelve-week duration is appreciated by many respondents to the public consultation 49 , although the literature review not- ed that this may be too short for replying to consultations on complex issues 50 . There is a need to consider the impact of any longer consul- tation period on the overall time it takes to prepare a policy proposal. Commission staff proved very sensitive to this issue and argued that public consultations (and the opportunity to provide feedback on roadmaps) may substantially delay the policymaking process within the Commission. Staff argued for a shorter response period of 8 to 10 weeks. While in 2015 and 2016 over 90% of public consultations abided by the twelve-week consultation period, in 2018 this dropped to below 75%. Consultation questionnaires Although a relatively larger share of respondents to the pub- lic consultation were satisfied with the clarity and neutrality of the Commission\u2019s questionnaires, almost a third expressed some dissatisfaction. In particular, consultees argued that questionnaires should be shorter and drafted in a non-techni- cal and non-biased manner. In its opinion, the REFIT Platform raised concerns about the format, clarity and content of con- sultations 51 . The literature review also noted that participants ",
        "18 | Taking Stock of the Commission\u2019s Better Regulation Agenda are often prevented from making comments outside of the multi-choice questions 52 . Since 2017, it is always possible to upload supporting material. A number of Commission staff indicated that they did not have the necessary expertise to draft good, understandable and effective questionnaires. They wanted more training and guidance. Feedback to consultees The impact assessment reports, the staff working documents accompanying evaluations or a self-standing synopsis report should present the results of all consultation activities under- taken. These should also be summarised in the explanatory memorandum accompanying a Commission proposal. The aim is to provide feedback on how the input from consultees has been used. Nearly 40% of the respondents to the public consultation were (very) dissatisfied with the way the Commission reports on the result of its public consultations and feedback and what is does with this information. NGOs responding to the public consultation argued that it is often difficult to discern how the consultation process has affected policymaking. This is also supported by the literature review 53 . More generally, consultees to the public consultation argued that there is no clear commitment on how to use consultation results for poli- cymaking. The REFIT Platform also asks in its opinion for more transparency in the feedback provided 54 . A wide range of consultees to the public consultation wanted systematic and timely reports presenting the results of con- sultation activities. They also wanted contributors to receive better individual feedback. 52 Impact Assessment Institute. (2017).

This is reflected in the results of Commission staff interviews. A number of staff who were interviewed thought that public consultation has a more limited role in gathering useful evi- dence, particularly for technically complex legislation. Targeted consultations were perceived to be much more useful. Some Commission staff expressed a desire for more flexibility par- ticularly with the requirement to conduct public consultations for all evaluations and impact assessments. In their opinion, the necessity for public consultation should be assessed in the context of each new initiative. Similarly, a number of Commis- sion staff found public consultations burdensome, time-con- suming and resource-intensive processes. The results were often considered disappointing in terms of response rates, overall coverage of stakeholdersand quality of responses. ",
        "| 19 IMPACT ASSESSMENT 55 http://www.oecd.org/governance/oecd-regulatory-policy-outlook-2018-9789264303072-en.htm 56 Paragraph 13 of the interinstitutional agreement on better law-making. 57 See tool #9 of the better regulation toolbox on when an impact assessment is necessary: https://ec.europa.eu/info/files/better-regu- lation-toolbox-9_en 58 For example, proposals to codify several legislative acts do not require an impact assessment because there are no substantive changes to the underlying legislation and therefore no impacts. In addition, it may be possible to proceed directly from an evaluation of existing legislation to a legal proposal without an impact assessment when the evaluation identifies specific/well-defined issues and there is little choice about how to address them. For financial programmes, an impact assessment is not required and a simpler ex ante evaluation can be prepared instead . 59 https://www.impactassessmentinstitute.org/news/jo5pj1k319/Absence-of-Impact-Assessment-often-not-justified-or-contrary-to-Bet- ter-Regulation 60 https://www.impactassessmentinstitute.org/news/jo5pj1k319/Absence-of-Impact-Assessment-often-not-justified-or-contrary-to-Bet- ter-Regulation Consultees overwhelmingly support evidence-based policy- making. They also agree that the changes introduced in May 2015 have helped to consolidate the standing and culture of the impact assessment. The better regulation guidelines and toolbox represent a particular achievement because they pro- vide a common framework for the policy cycle. This is reflect- ed in the recent OECD comparative assessment 55 : the Com- mission further refined and improved its impact assessment policy and maintained the third-placed ranking it had already achieved in 2014. Stakeholders\u2019 concerns generally relate to the application of these guidance documents. The Regulatory Scrutiny Board observes that impact assess- ments are carried out for a wide variety of policy fields. For example, different types of initiatives require looking at differ- ent types of impacts, some more easily quantifiable than oth- ers. In their opinion, the Commission guidelines are sufficiently flexible to accommodate for this variety. Against this overall positive assessment, the following analy- ses key concerns and attempts to assess their magnitude. It also analyses underlying factors with a view to making possi- ble future improvements. Which legislative proposals should be supported by an impact assessment? The Commission is committed to presenting impact assess- ments for its initiatives that have significant impacts and par- ticularly for those presented in its work programme 56 . The European Parliament and the Council have also committed to examining the Commission\u2019s impact assessment at the outset of the legislative procedure. The Commission has clear guidance on when an impact as- sessment should be prepared 57 . Impact assessments are only prepared where they are useful for the decision to be taken by the Commission. An impact assessment will not usually be prepared if there is little choice over the content of the initia- tive or if the impacts are not significant 58 . There may be cases, however, where it is not possible or ap- propriate to follow each mandatory better regulation require- ment (including carrying out an impact assessment where significant impacts can be expected) 59 . There may be a po- litical imperative to move ahead quickly, an emergency that requires a rapid response or a need to comply with specific deadlines in legislation which cannot be met on the basis of normal planning. Any resulting exception must be centrally agreed within the Commission and brought to the attention of external stake- holders (via the roadmap, or the inception impact assessment and the explanatory memorandum). Alternative ways should observe as much as possible better regulation principles (like accompanying the proposal in question with astaff working document presenting the available evidence). External organ- isations such as the Impact Assessment Institute are continu- ously checking whether this occurs in practice 60 . BETTER TOOLS FOR BETTER POLICIES 4 4.1. ",
        "20 | Taking Stock of the Commission\u2019s Better Regulation Agenda The stocktaking has recorded a widespread concern by stake- holders about what these rules imply in terms of number of legislative proposals without impact assessments. The Euro- pean Parliament has noted that approximately 30% of pri- ority initiatives in the Joint Declaration signed by the three institutions do not have an impact assessment. Similarly, an analysis of all proposals linked to the Commission work pro- gramme AnnexI and II between 2015 and 2018 shows that 28% were not accompanied by an impact assessment. For 19.5%, no impact assessment was actually needed according to the Commission requirements. For the remaining 8.5%, ex- ceptions were granted. The need to act urgently, thus limiting the time available to gather evidence and prepare an impact assessment report with the associated consultation activities, was the most common reason justifying such exceptions. Pro- posals to address the migration crisis account for nearly half of all exceptions, but there were others to tackle the security and economic crises. Contrary to the Commission\u2019s commit- ment, for a limited number of proposals (7% of all cases), no reason was publicly communicated for the lack of an impact assessment (be it due to an exception or not). Stakeholders consult and appreciate the Commission\u2019s impact assessments. They notice and complain about cases where no impact assessment was provided. The European Parliament and the Council have been particularly critical because they base their own analyses on the Commission impact assessments and have reported that the impact assessment makes finding politi- cal agreement easier. Civil society, social partners and the busi- ness and research communities consider that the absence of an impact assessment undermines transparency and credibility. Some Commission officials consider exceptions undermine the fair application of the better regulation system across depart- ments (and thus are an impediment to buying into the system). Which impacts should be assessed? Respondents to the public consultations were generally positive about the extent to which the Commission takes into account evidence and impacts 61 . More than two thirds of those who expressed an opinion thought the Commission takes into ac- count at least partially the evidence, social and environmental impacts and subsidiarity and the role of different levels of pub- lic authorities. 61 Questions 3 to 5 of the public consultation. 62 Purnhagen, K.

CEPS Policy Insights, 12(March), 1\u201317. 64 In their analysis, these objectives are gender equality; the horizontal social clause; non-discrimination on the basis of gender, racial or ethnic origin, religion or belief, disability, age or sexual orientation; environmental policy integration for sustainable development; consumer protection; securing fundamental rights (Smismans & Minto, 2017). 65 https://europa.eu/!Bg68tX 66 https://ec.europa.eu/info/files/better-regulation-toolbox-33_en 67 COM(2018) 703 final of 23 October 2018 Communication from the Commission to the European Parliament, the European Council, There is, however, also a clear expectation that impacts could be better taken into account, although views differ on which impacts. Business organisations and many public authorities support a strong focus on economic considerations, includ- ing for small and medium enterprises (SMEs) and the digital dimension. Individuals, civil society and academia urge the Commission to look more at society as a whole and not to overemphasise the need to quantify impacts. Respondents to the public consultation also point to the impact that leg- islation has on equality, health, poverty and the safeguarding of fundamental rights and the need to uphold environmental and consumer standards. Many consultees urge paying great- er attention to the impacts on individuals, Member States or industrial sectors rather than providing aggregated estimates at EU level. Purnhagen & Feindt (2015) 62 point to the lack of a consolidated approach in this regard. Some NGOs and aca- demics 63 propose systematically considering the Sustainable Development Goals in impact assessments or integrating the six mainstreaming objectives 64 set out by the EU treaties. Oth- ers highlight the need to better assess impacts on developing countries as a key prerequisite to live up to the EU commit- ment to policy coherence for development. The Council\u2019s General Secretariat acknowledges the useful- ness of impact assessments for the legislative procedure. However, the Secretariat thinks that the impact assessment could provide even greater value if it anticipated the concerns of Member States and provided Member State-specific infor- mation about the expected impacts of policy options. Union legislation may have particularly significant effects at local and regional levels and for public authorities (\u2018territorial impacts\u2019). This is understandably a concern for the Committee of the Regions, the European Economic and Social Committee and national authorities. It was also raised by the \u2018Task force on subsidiarity and proportionality\u2019 in its report of 10 July 2018 65 . The Commission has developed methodologies for territorial impact assessments 66 that have been tested on a number of legislative proposals since 2016. The Commission\u2019s approach is to assess these impacts when they are relevant for the decision-making process and it is proportionate to do so (for example, if there are large variations between regions). In its October 2018 Communication 67 , the Commission indi- cated that it intends to raise the importance of this issue in its guidance to staff. However, it is not always obvious that such ",
        "| 21 effects are likely or that the raw data exist to allow a detailed assessment to be made. The more active involvement of local and regional authorities in consultation processes is an es- sential element of improving the quality of assessments of territorial impacts. Stakeholders\u2019 demand for greater and more detailed analysis of impacts needs to be duly taken into account, but as Smis- mans 68 cautions, the list of impacts the Commission is asked to address continues to grow. The quality of analyses presented in impact assessments (and evaluations) is often limited by the availability of relevant in- formation. Commission officials draw attention to the difficul- ties they have in gathering reliable, comprehensive data and applying methodologies coherently and transparently across a wide variety of policy fields and across all Member States. This is part of a more general problem of knowing how legis- lation is working. The fact that only a tiny fraction of co-leg- islators\u2019 amendments to the Commission\u2019s are assessed each year places greater pressure on subsequent evaluations to es- tablish whether the resultant legislation works effectively and efficiently. Mechanisms to ensure that relevant performance data are collected are also not systematically established. The stocktaking exercise shows that, above and beyond stake- holders\u2019 legitimate individual preferences for specific types of impacts, there is a need to consider structural issues such as the great diversity of the Commission\u2019s initiatives, the specific challenges of analysis at a supranational level and the existing constraints in terms of available resources, time and skills 69 . While efficiency gains and marginal improvements to the cur- rent system are surely achievable and should be sought, these factors inevitably limit the quality and breadth of the analysis and lead to differing views on its proportionality. The impor- tance of preserving the balance and comprehensiveness of the Commission approach to impact assessment should also be taken into account. the European Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions: The principles of subsidiarity and proportionality: Strengthening their role in the EU\u2019s policymaking 68 Smismans, S.

(2017). Final study: A year and a half of the Better Regulation Agenda : what happened ? 72 The General Secretariat of the Councilstressed the importance of the executive summary in comparison to the lengthy impact assessment itself. One tool, too many objectives? Impact assessments serve several purposes. First and most importantly, they aim to inform the Commission\u2019s political de- cisions on new political initiatives. However, they also serve other goals. They promote public transparency and account- ability by explaining the evidence base and the analysis the Commission took into account when taking its decision. In doing so, impact assessments are also a key document the Commission uses to report on the results of its consultations and their use. They also play an important role in following up and reporting on the assessment of subsidiarity and propor- tionality and, whenever relevant, various cross-cutting policy commitments 70 . Crucially, they also assist the European Par- liament and the Council during the legislative procedure. Final- ly, by explaining expected causation chains, setting objectives and estimating expected impacts, impact assessments should serve as a key reference point for any subsequent evaluation. Some Commission officials pointed out that the final impact assessment report has to satisfy competing demands and therefore represents a compromise. Some of the groups con- sulted wondered to what extent impact assessments inform policy development as opposed to merely justifying a pre-de- termined/preferred policy option. The Impact Assessment In- stitute (2017) 71 (among other stakeholders and authors) ar- gues that impact assessments should always be neutral and make a genuine attempt to assess all policy options. Other Commission officials questioned whether the resources re- quired to prepare an impact assessment were proportionate to the benefits and the limited readership. Nonetheless, they find that the process of writing an impact assessment pro- vides a good, systematic preparation for later negotiations and communication about the Commission\u2019s proposals. The 40 or so pages of an impact assessment can prove insuf- ficient in the case of complex legislative proposals with many dimensions. At the same time, the impact assessment report and the technical information in it can be overwhelming for the non-expert public and a complex read for policy-makers themselves 72 . ",
        "22 | Taking Stock of the Commission\u2019s Better Regulation Agenda Respondents to the public consultation also frequently point- ed out that the Commission\u2019s impact assessments are out- dated the moment they are published, because amendments are rarely subject to impact assments during the negotiations between the co-legislators. The perceived partial implementa- tion of the Interinstitutional Agreement in this regard is widely seen as problematic. The quality and objectivity of an impact assessment report is ultimately vouched for by the Regulatory Scrutiny Board (see 4.3.). Impact assessments are made public together with the Board opinion when the Commission proposal is adopted. The feedback mechanism on proposals allows the public to provide its views on its quality and objectivity. Resources and support for Commission staff In the Commission, policy teams responsible for individual in- itiatives are directly tasked with carrying out any accompa- nying impact assessment. Given existing safeguards on the objectivity of the analysis, this is considered a desirable fea- ture that maximises the relevance of impact assessments for the policy process. It has, however, a cost as the quality of impact assessments (and evaluations) reflects the diverging levels of expertise and experience of Commission staff who do not typically undertake impact assessments (and evaluations) on a continuous basis. Individual members of staff are unlike- ly, therefore, to be experts in evaluation and impact assess- ment methodology. Some departments have support teams that can provide assistance. During the consultation activities 73 Special report 16/2018 Ex-post review of EU legislation: a well-established system, but incomplete https://www.eca.europa.eu/en/ Pages/DocItem.aspx?did=46063 74 http://www.oecd.org/governance/oecd-regulatory-policy-outlook-2018-9789264303072-en.htm 75 Question 11 of the public consultation. supporting the stocktaking, these support units indicated that while there were guidance documents, individual policy officers often pointed out they were under too much time pressure to familiarise themselves sufficiently with these documents and that there was too little learning from the experience built up within the institution. Staff indicated a desire for more face- to-face meetings with experienced colleagues to learn from them, share best practice and nurture a common understand- ing of better regulation. For example, they suggested: \u2022 a very early kick-off meeting of the project team with the better regulation support units to discuss procedures, timelines, scope and methods; \u2022 an earlier upstream meeting with the Regulatory Scrutiny Board to seek guidance and avoid problems later down the line; \u2022 communities of practice to learn from the recent expe- rience of colleagues in other directorates-general that have carried out similar projects and to share best prac- tice between better regulation support units; \u2022 facilitating a more effective use of in-house analytical capacity such as that provided by JRC or Eurostat. Finally, the consultations showed that policy officers are of the opinion that they do not have the time to follow more than the basic training courses. Consequently, more specialised knowl- edge (for example, about quantification and subsidiarity) is not systematically acquired. EVALUATION The various consultation activities revealed several impor- tant issues about the Commission\u2019s practices on evaluation. The results of these consultations were complemented by reports from the European Court of Auditors and the \u2018Task force on subsidiarity and proportionality\u2019. The Court found that the Commission had designed a system which is, as a whole, well-managed and quality-controlled 73 . The OECD has recently reported that the use of evaluations has improved. The EU\u2019s evaluation system scores highly in the OECD\u2019s 2018 regulatory policy outlook 74 (4 th out of 39 jurisdictions) and has increased its rating since the previous rating in 2015. The opinion of respondents to the public consultation 75 is mixed, being more or less equally spread between satisfied, neutral or dissatisfied. The Commission, the other EU institutions and consultative bodies use evaluations to learn to what exent EU policies and speding programmes are working and to gain new insights. Re- sults are used to decide whether legislation and programmes should be revised, but evaluations are really useful when they are well timed, designed to address the key questions and of sufficient quality to provide credible and pertinent answers. 4.2.

        "| 23 Stakeholders have raised issues for all of these factors as de- scribed below. Time the evaluation appropriately The systematic evaluation of legislation and programmes as part of an integrated policy cycle was one of the principal changes introduced in May 2015. Common sense requires that we should know how legislation works before making propos- als to revise it. Commission officials had mixed views about the \u2018evaluate first\u2019 principle. Some argued that it is intuitive and logical, as it closes the policy cycle. Others suggested deciding on the need for evaluations on a case-by-case basis. Europe- an institutions, and in particular the Council and the European Economic and Social Committee, firmly supported the principle. Progress is also being made in applying the \u2018evaluate first\u2019 principle. 78% of impact assessments for amendments of legislation in 2018 were also accompanied by an evaluation. This is up from 50% in 2016. Evaluating before taking further action is one thing. Evaluat- ing when there are solid conclusions to draw is another matter. Many respondents thought that legislation was given insuffi- cient time to work before initiating evaluations. Evidence from the literature suggests that evaluations carried out too early may not lead to conclusive results and need to be complement- ed at a later stage 76 . They suggest that evaluations required by legislation should be carried out at a moment in the policy cycle when impacts have materialised and data are available to pursue a meaningful evaluation. Improvements can be made if there is a shared understanding between the European Par- liament, the Council and the Commission on when to require an evaluation (as opposed to other implementation issues such as transposition reports). The European Court of Auditors also raised these issues in its 2018 audit on ex post reviews. A specific challenge in this regard concerns spending pro- grammes for which many respondents thought that the evalu- ation could provide more insight and useful learning for subse- quent programmes. A key concern is that end-of-programme evaluations come when the programmes of the next cycle of the multiannual financial framework have already been decid- 76 EPRS. (2017). Evaluation in the European Commission. Rolling Check-List and State of Play. (Vol. 12). 77 For example: \u2018Evaluation could come too late to inspire the next programme round\u2019 (Smismans, 2015); \u2018Emphasis on the timing of analysis is crucial for being able to inform the legislative process\u2019 (Broughel, 2015); \u2018Given the length of the policy cycle, evaluation cannot meaningfully start before a minimum of ten years from initial work on a proposal. This period exceeds two EC terms. \u2019 (Golberg, 2018). 78 https://ec.europa.eu/info/publications/regulatory-scrutiny-board-annual-report-2017_en 79 Smismans, S. (2015).

European University Institute, Robert Schuman Centre for Advanced Studies. 81 https://cor.europa.eu/en/our-work/Pages/network-of-regional-hubs.aspx ed. Similar views have been expressed in the academic litera- ture 77 . Many respondents suggested reconsidering the timing of programme evaluations, but this is challenging given that, due to the need to have a seamless transition between budg- etary periods, underlying projects funded by a given multian- nual financial framework will not have been completed by the time the next framework has to be prepared. Mid-term evalu- ations of an ongoing programme that are used for preparing a new generation of programmes would be more useful when building also on the results of the preceding programme. Then evaluate well Several interest groups, the Regulatory Scrutiny Board 78 and the General Secretariat of the Council observed that the Com- mission\u2019s evaluations were of lower quality than its impact assessments. In the literature, it is acknowledged that a wide- spread practice of policy-related evaluations started some- what later than impact assessments and need more time to mature further, particularly in terms of design and method- ologies 79 . The Board frequently raised issues with design and methodology. Commission departments grapple with several well-known practical evaluation challenges, including when to evaluate and how to best ensure ownership and independence. Timing obviously plays a role in the final quality of an evalu- ation, but data availability and data quality, more generally, are a strong concern for several interest groups. On quantifica- tion, a number of Commission officials thought that the lack of appropriate data is the most important problem affecting the quality of evaluations. Comparable EU-wide data are often not available, which makes it difficult to quantify impacts. Some of the literature reviewed made a similar point 80 . The European Parliament Research Service suggested applying clear quality criteria, in particular for non-governmental data, together with a clear prioritisation for data collection. The Committee of the Regions sees a role for the newly created Network of Region- al Hubs for EU Policy Implementation Review (RegHub) 81 in gathering data on regional impacts to inform better the Com- mission\u2019s evaluations and impact assessments. Some Commission officials think that the evaluation process is too long and that systematic data collection via well-defined ",
        "24 | Taking Stock of the Commission\u2019s Better Regulation Agenda monitoring (instead of ad hoc collection) would substantially shorten the evaluation process and improve the quality of the analysis. They noted that there is a trade-off between the pres- sure to reduce the administrative burden of systematic moni- toring in the original proposal and the availability of evidence when it comes to the evaluation. Solutions may emerge when paragraphs 22 and 23 of the Interinstitutional Agreement on Better Law-Making will be implemented in a more consistent manner. This calls on the three institutions to consider including monitoring and evaluation provisions in each basic act of Union law. A good impact assessment forms the basis for a good evaluation because the impact assessment sets out problems, objectives and indicators to monitor and appraise the success of the policy. Subesequently, to avoid excessive administrative burden, legislative proposals need to establish adequate moni- toring requirements and data collection verifying that the data is not already being colleted under some different legislative framework. The way in which evaluations are carried out and presented is another factor affecting their quality, but views on this appear to vary. Whether the Commission should conduct evaluations internally or involve external contractors or other institutions met with mixed views. Commission officials shared the view that con- ducting the evaluation internally allows in-house expertise to be built up and used more frequently. Some officials were also sceptical about the quality of the contractors\u2019 work and the quality of service they provide. Similar views were expressed in the literature 82 . In particular, various authors questioned the Commission\u2019s capacity to conduct its own internal consulta- tions, while others thought that external evaluations were more objective, which was important for spending programmes but less so when evaluating legislation. Some authors questioned the ability of external contractors to perform policy evalua- tions. A number of Commission officials thought that it was necessary to use external studies due to the limited capacity to cope with an increased workload and sometimes the need for specific (methodological) expertise.

Ex-post review of EU legislation: a well-established system, but incomplete. Special Report of the European Court of Auditors 6/2018, (16) 86 For matters of urgency, evaluations are sometimes carried out back-to-back with impact assessments (see toolbox tool #52 https:// ec.europa.eu/info/files/better-regulation-toolbox-52_en ). Commission officials had mixed views on impact assessments and evaluations carried out back-to-back. Some thought that in this case the evaluation results might be pre-judged and thus not useful to inform the impact assessment. Others found it a pragmatic and efficient way to comply with the \u2018evaluate first\u2019 principle. The European Court of Auditors has made some similar observations. to the public consultation argued that evaluations should be outsourced or conducted by the European Parliament and the Member States. Some Commission officials and respondents to the public con- sultation called for a flexible application of the rules and pro- cedures to make evaluations more meaningful, given the wide variety of policy areas covered by evaluations. Others urged for additional codification, standardisation, formal oversight and requirements to ensure that the scientific evidence and analyses are of the highest quality. Additionally, respondents to the public consultation and the European Economic and Social Committee wanted evaluations to address more comprehen- sively the transposition of directives into national law and the manner in which they are implemented. Finally, evaluation lessons must be clearly communicated and brought to bear on policymaking. The requirement for an eval- uation staff working document 83 introduced in 2015 aims to present the results of the evaluation process in a self-standing and uniform format. Commission officials generally saw it as helpful in logically structuring the assessment, but they consid- ered it unsuitable for communicating with the public, and some thought it redundant when there is a good evaluation report that has been prepared by external contractors. Analysis of empirical evidence shows that the links between impact assessments and evaluations were limited in the past 84 . The European Court of Auditors reported that in leg- islation adopted by Council and European Parliament between 2014 and 2016 ex post reviews were not always used when preparing impact assessments 85 . Several respondents to the public consultation also said that the evaluation results needed to be utilised better when performing impact assessments 86 . ",

Under Commission policy, a Regulatory Scrutiny Board (the Board) scrutinises the quality of such analyses and supports their im- provement. This is in line with OECD best practices 87 according to which regulatory oversight by a standing body close to the centre of government should play a key role in this context. The Board was set up by the President of the Commission as part of the overall May 2015 better regulation package. It has seven full-time members who do not have any policymaking responsibility. Each member serves for a period of 3 years. Three members are also recruited from outside the EU\u2019s in- stitutions. Together, these changes represent substantially stronger guarantees of the Board\u2019s independence in exercising its scrutiny function compared to its predecessor, the Impact Assessment Board established in 2007. What does the Board do? The Board performs a quality check on impact assessments and evaluations to improve them and ultimately to improve the Commission\u2019s proposals and the legislation adopted by the co-legislators. The Board\u2019s mandate is wider than that of its predecessor. The new Board looks at selected evaluations (and fitness checks) in addition to all impact assessments. It checks their quality before they are shared with the Commission\u2019s departments in the interservice consultation and issues recommendations for their improvement. In 2017, the Board introduced positive and negative opinions 89 for evaluations. Additionally, in late 2016 the Board began distinguishing between \u2018positive opinions\u2019 and \u2018positive opinions with reservations\u2019 for impact assessments. It also overhauled its system of indicators to monitor the qual- ity of the reports submitted. The new system consists of 10 quality components for impact assessments 90 and 6 quality components for evaluations 91 . These allow the Board to track changes in the quality of an impact assessment or evaluation. Box 2. The Board\u2019s work in its own words \u2018The Board evaluates the quality of an impact assess- ment report based on the Commission\u2019s Better Regulation Guidelines and verifies whether the minimum standards are met. However, in doing so, the Board also takes into account the context of each initiative and the proportional- ity of the analysis, meaning that the depth of the analysis should match the importance of the initiative. It considers how an individual initiative fits within the wider sectoral regulatory environment, to what extent it responds to po- litical orientations that have already been agreed by the relevant EU institutions, and whether there is a legal obli- gation to act. Timing constraints of the initiative are some- times a factor when judging the availability of evidence, of prior evaluations and of comprehensive stakeholder consultations.\u2019 What has the Board done? After replacing the Impact Assessment Board in May 2015, the Regulatory Scrutiny Board became fully staffed and op- erational within the following year. Each year the Board pub- lishes reports on its own work that also provide insight into the wider application of better regulation 92 . The following table and graphs present key statistics on the Board\u2019s scrutiny activities since its creation. In 2015, the Board\u2019s recommendations for impact assess- ments focused primarily on defining the problems to be tack- led, considering and presenting stakeholders\u2019 views and de- scribing and assessing options. In 2016, the Board\u2019s annual report flagged problem analysis and development of options as \u2018common weaknesses\u2019. In 2017, negative opinions were most often issued when the rationale for policy action was not convincing or the analysis of the baseline and options showed shortcomings. In 2018, the Board highlighted prob- 4.3. ",
        "26 | Taking Stock of the Commission\u2019s Better Regulation Agenda lem definition, use of evaluation, the design of options and their comparison as being initially the weakest part of impact assessments. Comparable statistics for evaluations were available for the first time in 2017. Coherence, presentation, relevance and EU value added were the most common issues raised when the Board issued negative opinions. The Board observed that often the evaluation questions were not appropriate or could not be answered. Additionally, they pointed out that often either data were not available or were not compared against a baseline or definition of success. What has the Board achieved? The Board acted as the Commission\u2019s quality control body for the analysis supporting its political decisions. In principle, 93 Review of the appropriate prudential treatment for investment firms COM(2017)790 Renewable Energy Directive COM/2016/767 Proposal for a regulation on a framework for the free flow of non-personal data in the European Union - COM(2017)495 94 https://europa.eu/!Qt73NN 95 For a more detailed explanation of the latter see https://europa.eu/!fB49UB when the Board issues a negative opinion on an impact as- sessment, the policy process is put on hold until the quality of the underlying evidence reaches a sufficient level. This has been the norm. In three cases 93 , however, the Commission took the political decision to go forward with an initiative de- spite the absence of a positive Board opinion vouching for the adequateness of the underlying impact assessment. In all of these cases, the Commission carried through on its commit- ment of May 2015 to explain publicly why. Initiatives were also typically adapted to address the weakenesses in the un- derlying evidence base. The Board also managed to improve the quality of the draft impact assessments and evaluations submitted to it. Evidence of its success in doing so comes from several sources. First, the rate of negative opinions has been dropping for both im- pact assessments and evaluations 95 . Secondly, the monitoring system established by the Board shows that the quality of RSB opinion 2015 2016 2017 2018 Impact assessments First submission Positive 15 22 12 22 Positive with reservations 0 13 18 33 Negative 14 25 23 21 Second submission Positive 10 16 7 9 Positive with reservations 0 0 16 9 Negative 1 *** 1 2 1 ** Evaluations First submission Positive - 7 * 10 8 Negative - 7 3 Second submission Positive - - 4 1 Negative - 0 0 Table 4 Opinions issued by the Regulatory Scrutiny Board, 2015-2018 ( *) In 2016, evaluations received opinions with comments, without \u2018positive\u2019 or \u2018negative\u2019.

        "| 27 the draft impact assessments and evaluations submitted is improving gradually. The quality components applied by the Board also show an improvement in quality following the Board\u2019s scrutiny. The weakest impact assessments are im- proving the most. However, the Commission\u2019s departments are less diligent in improving draft impact assessments that receive a positive opinion with reservations. Early meetings between the Board and the team drafting the impact assess- ment or evaluation significantly increased the quality of the submitted reports. Finally, consultation activities undertaken by the Board and by the Commission\u2019s departments reveal that the Board is widely seen as adding value to the policymaking process and improv- ing impact assessments and evaluations. Nearly 90% of the respondents to the public consultation who were familiar with the Board think it adds value to the regulatory process. Com- mission officials view the regulatory scrutiny process (with a hearing at the Board) as providing excellent preparation for the negotiations with the European Parliament and the Council and as an opportunity to rehearse how to explain their propos- al to non-experts. Evidence and the general views of stakeholders thus suggest the Board has been performing its tasks in a successful man- ner. However, some areas of concern remain. 96 Meuwese, A. C. M. (2015).

Edward Elgar Publishing. https://doi.org/10.4337/9781782540854 First, despite stronger assurances of independence and a high rate of negative opinions, views on the Board\u2019s impartiality and independence remain mixed. Proposals to increase inde- pendence were most commonly voiced by stakeholders in the public consultation but also by the Council. The lattter wants the President of the Commission to establish a secretariat for the Board that is independent from the Commission and to recruit all members externally. However, Meuwese 96 cautioned that true independence was most likely unattainable and per- haps undesirable, given the need to retain the relevance of the impact assessment to the policymaking process. Secondly, some Commission officials expressed concerns that the Board\u2019s demands for additional analysis and infor- mation are not proportionate to the specific initiative. Addi- tionally, some Commission staff expressed concern that the Board does not apply its standards consistently to all impact assessments (such as its demands for quantified information). Few professionals responding to the public consultation and academics 97 find that external experts, such as economists and social scientists, could usefully support the Board on a case-by-case basis. Thirdly, the public is largely unaware of the Board\u2019s activities. Among individuals responding to the public consultation, 320 (74%) out of 433 said that they were not familiar with the Board or barely so, compared to 64 (39%) out of 163 pro- fessionals. Finally, there are contrasting views on whether the Board should expand its activities. The academic literature and var- ious stakeholders have suggested widening the role and re- sponsibilities of the Board so that it becomes a body ensuring compliance with many more aspects of better regulation; for example, checking the quality of roadmaps, scrutinising more evaluations, checking delegated acts and the final content of legal proposals (in relation to the impact assessment) and sanctioning exceptions from better regulation requirements. Moreover, some academics 98 expect that the Board will de- velop to ultimately serve the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission. Others 99 see the Board moving to an oversight role in a manner similar to the Court of Justice, Euro- pean Court of Auditors or the Ombudsman. The Commission\u2019s proposal for each institution to be able to call for an independ- ent panel to assess the impacts of amendments to the legisla- tive proposal was discarded during the negotiation of the 2016 Interinstitutional Agreement on Better Law-Making. Box 3. An example of a proposal presented after a negative opinion by the Board \u2022 In the negative opinion on the impact assessment on the proposal for a framework for the free flow of non-personal data in the European Union, the Reg- ulatory Scrutiny Board found that the report did not make the case for EU action and did not assess ap- propriately the proportionality of the options. The re- vised report received a second negative opinion from the Regulatory Scrutiny Board. The Board found that the report particularly failed to make the case for a new right for the portability of cloud services. The in- itiative was adopted by the College without the pro- visions establishing mandatory portability of cloud services, but with self-regulatory measures instead. ",
        "28 | Taking Stock of the Commission\u2019s Better Regulation Agenda SUBSIDIARITY AND PROPORTIONALITY 100 See tool #5 on Legal basis, subsidiarity and proportionality: https://ec.europa.eu/info/files/better-regulation-toolbox-5_en 101 https://europa.eu/!Bg68tX The Union must respect the powers given to it by the Mem- ber States. Protocols No.1 and No.2 of the Treaties create the mechanism to ensure this happens and they give national parliaments a key role in checking conformity with the sub- sidiarity principle. The Commission presents an assessment of subsidiarity and proportionality of its proposals both in the im- pact assessment report and in the explanatory memorandum accompanying the Commission\u2019s legal proposal. The Commis- sion does not translate the impact assessment into all official languages but does translate the explanatory memorandum. The Commission has established guidance on how to perform these assessments 100 . However, most assessments of subsidiarity presented in im- pact assessments tend to be rather general and qualitative in nature. They appear at the beginning of the impact assess- ment report and do not use relevant analyses which come later in the report as part of the assessment of policy options. The assessment of subsidiarity is also separate from the as- sessment of the proportionality of the various policy options. This is confirmed by responses to the consultation that stated that current assessments are overly legalistic and formalistic and that assessments should be based on evidence. Profes- sionals noted that harmonisation and cross-border activity were too often used to justify EU action. In this context, it was stated that 20 or more different national approaches do not necessarily imply a need for harmonisation, but could also be evidence that the Member States have successfully tackled the problem. Therefore, the \u2018Task force on subsidiarity, proportionality and doing less more efficiently\u2019 set up by President Juncker on 14 November 2017 included recommendations meant to im- prove the assessment of subsidiarity and proportionality in its final report 101 . 4.4. Box 4: Task force\u2019s key recommendations on impact assessments Recommendation 1 A common method (\u201cassessment grid\u201d) should be used by the Union\u2019s institutions and bodies and by national and regional parliaments to assess issues linked to the principles of subsidiarity (including EU added value), proportionality and the legal basis of new and existing legislation. This assessment method should capture the criteria contained in the Protocol on subsidiarity and proportionality originally attached to the Amsterdam Treaty and relevant jurisprudence of the European Court of Justice. [A proposed model assess- ment grid is annexed to this report] During the legislative process, the European Parliament and the Council should systematically review the subsidiarity and proportionality of draft legislation and the amendments they make using the common method. They should take full account of the Commission\u2019s assessment presented in its proposals as well as the (reasoned) opinions of national Parliaments and the European Committee of the Regions. Recommendation 5 The Commission should ensure that its impact assessments and evaluations systematically consider territorial impacts and assess them where they are significant for local and regional authorities. Local and regional authorities should help to identify such potential impacts in their consultation responses and feedback on roadmaps. The Commission should revise its better regulation guidelines and toolbox accordingly and address issues linked to the implementation and EU added value of legislation, and to ensure greater visibility of the Commission\u2019s assessments of subsidiarity, proportionality and relevant territorial impacts in its proposals and accompanying explanatory memoranda. ",
        "| 29 On 23 October 2018, the Commission already set out in broad terms how it would respond to the task force 102 . In particular, it committed to incorporate the \u2018grid\u2019 for assessing subsidiar- ity and proportionality in its better regulation guidance and to use the grid to present its findings in impact assessments, evaluations and explanatory memoranda 103 . To avoid a piece- meal approach, this should be done concomitantly with any revision / update of better regulation guidelines and tools the next Commission may opt for. It will then need to be decided whether the assessment grid should be annexed to the impact assessment report or attached to the explanatory memoran- dum accompanying the Commission\u2019s proposal (whether or not there is an impact assessment). Since the memorandum is translated in all languages, it would offer a wider coverage and reach but would imply additional translation costs. 102 COM(2018) 703: Communication entitled: \u2018The principles of subsidiarity and proportionality: Strengthening their role in the EU\u2019s policymaking\u2019. 103 The Commission also committed to target the views of local and regional authorities better in its consultation activities and to look more carefully at existing legislation (including delegated and implementing acts) from the viewpoint of subsidiarity, proportionality, legislative density, simplification and the role for local and regional authorities. These issues are dealt with in other sections of this document. ",
        "30 | Taking Stock of the Commission\u2019s Better Regulation Agenda Legislation should remain fit for purpose and deliver the results that EU lawmakers intended and people expected. The Commission focuses on tackling unnecessary costs and eliminating administrative burdens without compromising policy objectives. Making legislation simpler and less burdensome also improves implementation and enforcement, and ultimately delivers better results. 104 SWD(2017)675 Overview of the Union\u2019s efforts to simplify and reduce regulatory burdens: https://europa.eu/!vf39MV 105 See tool #2 on the Regulatory Fitness programme and the REFIT Platform: https://europa.eu/!FH74GM To pursue these objectives, the Juncker Commission progres- sively mainstreamed the REFIT programme, supported it with the establishment of the REFIT Platform, and communicated more extensively on its results. THE REFIT PROGRAMME REFIT is the programme for the Commission\u2019s actions to en- sure existing legislation is simple,efficient and fit for purpose. Strengthened in the May 2015 better regulation package, the REFIT programme was mainstreamed in 2017 104 . The Commission now seeks to achieve REFIT goals whenever any existing law is due to be reviewed. The exact operational im- plications of this were explained in an appropriately revised version of the better regulation tool 105 . In addition, all eval- uations now seek to identify elements for simplification and burden reduction. While the Commission has repeatedly stressed that REFIT is not deregulatory and does not undermine existing policy ob- jectives by removing unnecessary costs, responses from some NGOs and individuals to the stocktaking exercise continue to criticise the Commission\u2019s approach for putting at risk social, environmental, consumer and employment objectives. Nation- al authorities in the stocktaking consultation supported the Commission\u2019s efforts to review and simplify legislation. The European Parliament suggested that the Commission\u2019s work programme should identify REFIT evaluations/initiatives that could be agreed in the political declaration on priority initia- tives pursuant to the Interinstitutional Agreement on Better Law-Making. The Committee of the Regions considers that RE- FIT provides an essential focus to assess whether implemen- tation is practical and feasible. The Committee also suggested involving the REFIT Platform more closely in evaluations. Commission officials recognised that the REFIT programme is important for communication purposes to emphasise the European Union\u2019s focus on tackling unnecessary costs and to stress the value the Union places on engaging with its people.

The key purpose of this expert group chaired by the Commis- sion\u2019s First Vice President is to provide the REFIT process with bottom-up input by collecting and considering stakeholders\u2019 views on possible improvements to legislation. The Platform issues recommendations to the Commission, which commit- ted itself to explain systematically how it intended to follow up on these. The Platform comprises two groups. The first is made up of experts from different parts of civil society, while the second group has an expert from each Member State gov- ernment. It met for the first time in January 2016, following the formal process to appoint its members. By 31 December 2018 the Platform had received 684 submissions from var- ious parts of civil society. The Platform responded to all of these submissions and adopted 89 opinions covering 129 of the submissions 106 . Business associations and EU citizens accounted for almost three quarters of all 684 submissions. Public authorities (in- cluding local and regional authorities) accounted for approx- imately 5% of submissions. The 268 submissions from indi- viduals resulted in only five opinions of the Platform. This is because they were largely covering other aspects or issues than those in the remit of the REFIT platform. Individual sub- missions covered many policy areas but the area most cov- ered was agriculture (30) followed by financial services (13), education (13) and the internal market (12). The consultation activities revealed mixed opinions from ex- ternal stakeholders and Commission staff. Stakeholders want a wider mandate and better reporting on the follow-up to opinions. A number of Commission officials find the Platform provides little added value to what they already know but re- quires relatively disproportionate resources. However, some Commission officials recognised that better ways to gather evidence from regional and local levels (perhaps via the Com- mittee of the Regions) and from closer links with stakeholders through dedicated conferences would be beneficial. Industrial organisations pointed to the need to raise aware- ness about the Platform to increase submissions on poten- tially problematic legislation. The Commission is also urged to publish information on measures that are implemented following each Platform opinion. There should also be better guidelines on how to create a good submission to the Platform and more focus on reducing costs and burdens for SMEs. The stakeholder group of the Platform has generally taken a more proactive role in setting priorities and leading the work on individual opinions 107 . Experts from the national adminis- trations have preferred not to specify priorities in the absence of clear instructions from their governments 108 . The Platform\u2019s government group has also set clear limits on the number of opinions it is willing to address at any one time (between 5 and 15) and to ensure a clear demarcation between the work of the Council and that of the Platform. Government responses to the consultation activities clearly support extending the mandate of the Platform into the next Commission and raising the awareness of its work. This is per- haps illustrated by the fact that 40% of the individuals who responded to the consultation did not know whether the REFIT Platform was effective in identifying legislation that can be simplified. They indicated that information is not readily avail- able and is not advertised. The process followed is also difficult to understand. The European Economic and Social Committee indicated that it would like a stronger representation in the Platform to re- flect the interests of its constituents. It would also like the Plat- form to address cross-cutting topics to improve the quality of legislation in addition to tackling unnecessary costs, and this may include identifying the need for new legislation.

A dedicated stocktaking exercise undertaken by the REFIT Plat- form has resulted in an opinion on Future prospects 110 .

The Stakeholder group and the Government group suggest im- provements, which are detailed in the opinion.The Committee of the Regions annexed its views to the opinion. It considers that to better achieve its goals, the REFIT Platform should be adapted in terms of approach and structure to review existing legislation also from the perspective of subsidiarity, propor- tionality, legislative density and the role of local and regional authorities. 111 109 Alemanno, A.

The Task force on subsidiarity and proportionality recom- mended that the Commission\u2019s REFIT Platform be adapted to review legislation from the perspective of subsidiarity, propor- tionality, legislative density and the role of local and regional authorities. The Task force noted that the composition of the Platform might also need to change to include a greater pres- ence from local and regional authorities. Stronger links to the work and networks of the Committee of the Regions could also be considered. The Commission echoed these views in its Communication on the principles of subsidiarity and propor- tionality published on 23 October 2018. Box 5.

The Commission has also begun to report annually on its efforts to simplify legislation 112 , 113 and every year publishes online a REFIT Scoreboard 114 that monitors simplification ini- tiatives throughout their life cycle. The Scoreboard provides a comprehensive overview of the REFIT results achieved under each of the Juncker Commission\u2019s political priorities. The Com- mission\u2019s follow-up to the REFIT Platform opinion is explained in the Commission\u2019s annual work programme and in the follow \u2013up report. To improve transparency, since July 2017 impact assessments have also included an annex detailing quantified estimates of costs and benefits. Consultations have, however, raised various issues about the usefulness, and awareness of the REFIT Scoreboard in its cur- rent version. National authorities thought that the Scoreboard could not yet be considered truly user-friendly. They also asked for clear quantitative measurement of reductions in unnec- essary costs and suggested that the REFIT Scoreboard could help monitor, visualise and communicate progress better than today. Following the European Court of Auditors recommenda- tion for clarification of the REFIT concept 115 the Commission has clarified in its annual burden survey the scope of REFIT and improved its internal and external communication to stakeholders.

CONSIDERING ALTERNATIVE APPROACHES TO SIMPLIFICATION AND BURDEN REDUCTION The (Competitiveness) Council has asked the Commission on several occasions to introduce a system of targets to tackle the perceived excessive burden of regulatory costs 116 associ- ated with European Union legislation. Paragraph 48 of the In- terinstitutional Agreement on Better Law-Making 117 also calls on the Commission to look at the feasibility of establishing objectives for burden reduction. The Commission has thus considered alternative approaches and explained its own approach in its Communication of Oc- tober 2017 118 . The Commission looks to simplify legislation on a case-by- case basis, using evidence gathered from evaluations and im- pact assessments and including consultation of stakeholders. To avoid adversely affecting underlying policy objectives and to ensure democratic accountability and transparency, it is es- sential that a political decision on which costs are legitimate to achieve policy goals and which instead should be eliminated is based on evidence from a case-to-case assessment that responds to the concerns of stakeholders and people. Up- front targets would not offer such fundamental guarantees and would present formidable methodological challenges at the European level. When revising legislation, the Commission thus investigates whether it can be simplified and any un- necessary costs removed. To provide a transparent measure of the impact of the proposed measures and a more easi- ly verifiable objective, the Commission tries to quantify the reduction in regulatory costs implied by any such measure. However, ths is not always possible due to data and methodo- logical challenges. In addition, to preserve the meaningfulness of any quantitative objective to reduce burdens in proposed legislation, quantitative estimates need to be modified when- ever needed due to co-legislators amendments and Member States transposition and implementation choices. 5.4.

The current Commission has presented more than 150 new initiatives focused on simplifying legislation. As there is a di- verse range of costs varying between the different initatives, these quantification estimates cannot be added together to provide a single figure. In addition, the extent to which the Commission\u2019s simplification proposals actually deliver tangi- ble benefits for regulated entities depends on the subsequent decisions of the European Parliament and the Council when legislating and Member States when transposing and imple- menting. The Commission has reported annually on the results it has achieved. The following box extracts from these reports some illustrative examples. Nearly a third of all respondents to the public consultation indicated their satisfaction with the Commission\u2019s efforts to simplify existing EU laws and reduce costs where possible 123 . However, some 40% were not satisfied. Combined with the evidence presented above, this suggests that while the Com- mission\u2019s efforts to simplify and reduce unnecessary burdens 5.5. Box 8. Examples of regulatory simplification entered into force in 2018. Value added tax (VAT) for cross-border business to consumer e-commerce ( 119 ). In 2017 the Commission introduced a one-stop shop by which traders that sell goods online to their customers can deal with their VAT obligations through one easy-to-use online portal. The online traders will no longer have to register for VAT in each of the Member States in which they sell goods. The Commission estimated that the one-stop shop will generate an overall saving of \u20ac2.3 billion for businesses and \u20ac7 billion increase in VAT revenues for Member States. A single digital gateway to provide information, procedures, assistance and problem-solving services ( 120 ). In 2017 the Commission proposed a single digital gateway to ensure centralised access to EU citizens and businesses to information they need to exercise their EU rights. The gateway will integrate several networks and services from national and EU level. It will provide a user-friendly interface in all official EU languages. The single digital gateway could reduce by 60 % the 1.5 million hours that people currently spend researching online before going abroad and businesses could save between EUR 11 and EUR 55 billion annually. Consumer protection cooperation ( 121 ): In 2016 the Commission proposed to modernise cooperation mechanisms to reduce the harm caused to consumers by cross-border infringements. The regulation will ensure a swifter protection of consumers, saving time and resourc- es for Member States and businesses. Thanks to additional cooperation powers, the authorities can act faster and save costs to jointly stop widespread online infringements. Businesses operating in all or a large majority of Member States will have the possibility to negotiate commitments at EU-level, which will make it simpler, faster and cheaper to resolve consumer issues. European Structural and Investment Funds ( 122 ). The Commission proposed in 2016 a regulation with concrete simplification provisions to make the use of the Funds simpler for beneficiaries and authorities and financial rules more flexible. Overall, this means reducing the implementation costs of EU rules as well the number of errors contributing to optimise the impact of the Multi-annual Financial Framework 2014-2020. ",
        "36 | Taking Stock of the Commission\u2019s Better Regulation Agenda have delivered results, these are neither well communicated nor generally regarded as sufficient. The changes introduced under this Commission have gone in the right direction but there is scope to do better. It is worth considering how to speed up the adoption of sim- plification measures and increase their visibility. Improving quantification of costs and benefits in evaluations would also help. In principle, each evaluation should assess the extent to which policy objectives have been met and assess the eco- nomic efficiency of the policy . However, according to the liter- ature 124 , many evaluations do not generate sufficiently con- vincing evidence that policies are being delivered in the most effective and efficient manner. Assessing this in quantified terms is not always methodologically possible. 124 For example, Golberg, E. (2018). \u201cBetter Regulation\u201d: European Union Style, (98); Delogu, B. (2016). Risk Analysis and Governance in EU Policy Making and Regulation. An Introductory Guide. Springer International Publishing Switzerland. https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3- 319-30822-7 Finally, and perhaps more importantly, while regulatory costs are often justified for each individual piece of legislation, their combined impact can have undesired effects that deserve to be better addressed. The report of the \u2018Task force on subsidi- arity and proportionality\u2019 pointed to the combined effects of legislation (including delegated acts and implementing acts) which may not be impact assessed or evaluated well enough. The task force recommends that the Commission\u2019s REFIT pro- gramme be adapted to review legislation from the perspec- tive of subsidiarity, proportionality, legislative density and the role of local and regional authorities. Consideration on how to do this could also encompass an enhanced role for the REFIT Platform. ",
        "| 37 In May 2015, the Commission presented a comprehensive better regulation package, including a proposal for a new interinstitutional agreement on better regulation. The previ- ous agreement on better law-making dated back to 2003, and was considered in need of revision, given the develop- ments in the better regulation agenda. A new interinstitutional agreement also reflects recognition of the need for a renewed commitment on the part of all three institutions involved in the legislative process (the European Parliament, Council and Commission) in order for better law-making efforts to suc- ceed. Following negotiations, the three institutions came to an agreement on the substance of the interinstitutional agree- ment on 8 December 2015. The new Interinstitutional Agree- ment on Better Law-Making was signed on 13 April 2016 and entered into force the same day. 125 Paragraph 50. 126 Monitoring report on the Implementation of the Interinstitutional Agreement on Better Law-Making (IIA-BLM) Pursuant to the Deci- sion of the Conference of Presidents of 9 June 2016; PE 605.832/CPG, 12 June 2017. 127 Report A8-0170/2018 of 15 May 2018: https://europa.eu/!Pm74bR 128 ST 14846 2018 INIT (30-11-2018); ST9895 2018 INIT (15-6-2018); ST 15084 2017 INIT (1-12-2017); ST 10006 2017 (12-6-2017); ST 15141 2016 COR 1 (8-12-2016). 129 They include the proposals on the multi annual financial framework which is one item in the Joint Declaration but comprises 37 sectoral programmes as well as the general framework. The Interinstitutional Agreement stipulates that a political meeting is to be held annually to take stock of progress in implementing the Agreement 125 . The first meeting took place in Strasbourg in December 2017 in the margins of the Euro- pean Parliament\u2019s plenary session. Since then the three insti- tutions have held regular discussions at technical level in the Interinstitutional Coordination Group chaired by the European Parliament. The Secretariat of the European Parliament pre- pared an overview on the implementation of the Agreement for the Parliament\u2019s Conference of Presidents in June 2017 126 . The European Parliament adopted an own-initiative report on the interpretation and implementation of the Agreement 127 . The Council has presented regular reports on the work it has undertaken to implement the Agreement 128 . The Agreement contains a number of commitments and follow-up activities. Progress on each of these varies. JOINT DECLARATION ON THE EUS LEGISLATIVE PRIORITIES In line with the Interinstitutional Agreement, in 2016 and 2017, the European Parliament, the Council and the Europe- an Commission agreed on two Joint Declarations on the EU\u2019s legislative priorities. They highlighted 89 initiatives for which priority treatment in the legislative process was needed. This represents a common commitment by the three institutions to ensure substantial progress and, where possible, delivery before the European elections in May 2019. The European Commission has adopted all the proposals announced in the Joint Declarations. Of these 69 have been agreed or formally adopted. 20 initiatives remain pending 129 .

Under paragraph 27 of the Interin- stitutional Agreement on Better Law-Making, the Commission presented a proposal on 14 December 2016 to align these provisions with the requirements of the Lisbon Treaty 130 on delegated acts and implementing acts. Discussions advanced slowly because of the technical nature of the proposal and di- verging views of the European Parliament and the Council. The co-legislators managed to find agreement on the alignment of the empowerments in over 60 legislative acts, and the re- maining acts will be revisited in the new parliamentary term. Delineation criteria (to distinguish delegated acts from implementing acts) In September 2017, the three institutions entered into negoti- ations under paragraph 28 of the Interinstitutional Agreement to establish non-binding criteria to improve the application of Articles 290 and 291 TFEU and to distinguish between the use of delegated acts and implementing acts. The European Parliament, Council and Commission reached agreement on the new criteria, and these are currently being endorsed in each institution. In practice, the choice of empowerment in legislative negotiations remains difficult because of political disagreements between the European Parliament and the Council. These difficulties may be eased with the growing awareness of the delineation criteria and other aspects of the Agreement. Interinstitutional register for delegated acts Under paragraph 29 of the Agreement, the three institutions established a joint register on delegated acts 131 on 12 De- cember 2017. It is a real success and has proved to be a useful tool to share information on delegated acts between the three institutions and the public. IMPACT ASSESSMENT The Commission has committed to carry out impact assess- ments to support its legislative and non-legislative initiatives that have significant economic, environmental or social im- pacts 132 . This includes initiatives in the Commission work pro- gramme or in the joint declaration on annual interinstitutional programming. Not all legislative proposals require an impact assessment, because political discretion is limited or because the impacts are not significant (e.g. proposals to codify legis- lation) 133 . When the Commission does not present an impact assessment, it explains why in the explanatory memorandum accompanying the proposal. See Section 2.1 for further details. The European Parliament and the Council are committed to tak- ing full account of the Commission\u2019s impact assessments 134 . The co-legislators have also committed to assess the impacts of their substantial amendments where this is appropriate in a given legislative procedure. Each year the Council prepares a report on impact assessments and how the Council uses them in its work 135 . It has also established guidance for working par- ty chairs on how to handle examination of the Commission\u2019s impact assessments. The General Secretariat of the Council indicates that the use of impact assessments is increasingly widespread in the Council and that in many areas they facilitate discussions and make it easier to reach political agreement.

The Council has made less progress in conducting its own assessments of the impacts linked to its substantial amend- ments. In January 2018, it established a pilot programme to outsource such assessments to external consultants but no assessment has yet been made. Moreover, the Council prefers to ask the Commission first before considering undertaking its own assessment. There is also a natural tendency of the ro- tating presidency to avoid any risk of delay on a legislative file during its six-month tenure. 136 Paragraph 43. 137 National governments \u2018gold-plate\u201d when they add new or more stringent obligations in national measures that transpose acts of Union law. Member States are free to do so (unless prohibited by the underlying legal basis in the Treaties), but those affected criticise the EU for this when it is a purely national decision. In contrast, the European Parliament has invested more heav- ily in creating its own expertise and capacity to assess sub- stantial amendments. Since 2003, when the co-legislators first committed to make such assessments, the Parliament has made some 68 assessments. At the start of each leg- islative procedure, the European Parliament also routinely appraises the Commission\u2019s impact assessment against the requirements of the Commission\u2019s better regulation guidelines and the opinions of the Regulatory Scrutiny Board. The Par- liament is also performing more retrospective evaluations of legislation that help inform its position on new Commission proposals. \u2018GOLD-PLATING\u2019 OF NATIONAL TRANSPOSING LEGISLATION The Agreement 136 calls on Member States to identify as- pects of national law that are \u2018gold-plated\u2019 137 and to inform the public. To facilitate transparency, the Commission has adapted its IT platforms to enable Member States to provide information about \u201cgold-plating\u201d. Up until the end of 2018, there have been only three notifications from two Member States (add footnote with reference). At the political stocktaking meeting in December 2017, the three institutions agreed to remind the Member States about the gold-plating provisions. OTHER ISSUES There has been little or no tripartite discussion between the three institutions about the implementation of paragraphs 22 and 23 of the Agreement, which concern review clauses and the inclusion of monitoring and evaluation provisions in basic acts of Union law. The Commission has presented two annual burden surveys pursuant to paragraph 48 of the Agreement, and these are discussed in the chapter 5 above on the Union\u2019s efforts to simplify legislation.. 6.4. 6.5.

        "40 | Taking Stock of the Commission\u2019s Better Regulation Agenda The costs of better regulation The benefits of better regulation are clear. We wish to deliv- er high quality effective legislation through informed deci- sion-making. However, there are also significant financial and human resource costs associated with operating an effective better regulation policy. There are clearly trade-offs of making further improvements in a world of limited resources. It is not possible to estimate the costs associated with the changes introduced in 2015, but one can estimate the absolute costs and resources involved in preparing impact assessments and evaluations in a typical year. We estimate that between 150 and 280 full-time equivalent staff are deployed on better reg- ulation-related activities and supported by external contrac- tors providing services amounting to between EUR 10 million to EUR 37 million annually 138 . Opening up policymaking The progress made in consultation and in increasing transpar- ency was widely acknowledged by stakeholders and the liter- ature. Wider awareness and a wider range of opportunities to be involved, combined with better consultation documents and more satisfactory responses to stakeholders contributions, are the key avenues to further improve the Commission\u2019s pub- lic consultation mechanisms. However, any such effort would need to ensure sufficient resources are made available, includ- ing by better prioritising activities. 138 See Annex I for details Utilising better tools for better policies Impact assessment and evaluation Solid reasons for granting exceptions will always exist, and unnecessary impact assessments should be avoided. There is, however, a clear demand for improved communication sur- rounding the reasons why an impact assessment may not be carried out. Improvements in the timely availability and public awareness of roadmaps would also make it easier to issue an early warning that an impact assessment is not to be carried out and enable stakeholders react. There is also scope to re- flect on how must usefully communicate available evidence and analysis to stakeholders in cases where an impact as- sessment is not possible. While individual stakeholders voiced a preference for more in-depth assessment of individual impacts, this has to be bal- anced against the overall breadth of the analysis and its pro- portionality in terms of resources. Measures to increase the readability of impact assessments would be welcomed. There is scope for procedural efficiency gains in the impact assess- ment process, more training and a more effective mobilisa- tion of existing expertise. This confirms the need for well-re- sourced better regulation functions. Over the last few years, the Commission has made progress in improving evaluation. There is, however, scope and a need for further progress. To drive this, there has to be a greater use for evaluations by policy-makers and more favourable conditions for carrying out high-quality evaluations. Evaluations and im- pact assessments should be linked better so that the findings from one are used more effectively by the other. Evaluations could be used more in the decision-making processes in the Commission and by the co-legislators. The quality of evalu- ations depends heavily on whether information is available about how the legislation works. CONCLUSIONS 7 ",
        "| 41 Regulatory Scrutiny Board The Regulatory Scrutiny Board is widely recognised as helping to improve the quality of impact assessments and evalua- tions. Its work could be better known by the public. Using the Board\u2019s expertise in early meetings on the design and meth- odology of evaluations and impact assessment is promising. Keeping the existing stock of legislation fit for purpose Stakeholders have mixed views on the Commission\u2019s efforts to simplify existing EU laws and reduce costs where possible. While the Commission\u2019s efforts to simplify and reduce un- necessary burdens have delivered results, these are neither well communicated nor generally regarded as sufficient. The changes introduced under this Commission have gone in the right direction but there is scope to do better. It will be impor- tant to reflect on the reasons why simplification has proven to be so complicated and burden reduction so burdensome. Enhanced quantification, while welcome, would not directly lead to greater success, only easier communication. No fun- damental reasons to change the Commission\u2019s views on the appropriateness of targets were identified by the stocktaking. Advancing a common agenda with other EU institutions and Member States The new Interistitutional Agreement is still young. It has shown its usefulness and achieved some clear successes, notably for delegated acts. However, there is still much unexploited po- tential to improve the application of better regulation by the three institutions, particularly for monitoring and evaluation, assessing the impacts of more substantial amendments and transparency on \u2018gold-plating\u2019.

It promoted greater openness, accountability and re- sponsibility of all those involved in policymaking. The aim was to bring the Union closer to its citizens in order to make more effective and relevant policies. Those aspirations are just as relevant today as they were in 2001. Following the consultation launched by the White Paper, the Commission published three Communications to promote better law-making. The first launched the impact assessment tool to improve the quality and coherence of the policymaking process 140 . The second established principles and standards to promote a culture of dialogue and stakeholder participa- tion 141 . The third presented an action plan to simplify and im- prove the regulatory environment 142 . These actions came into force in 2003 and together they form the basis of the better regulation policy in place today. THE DIFFERENT ELEMENTS OF BETTER REGULATION Better regulation is a framework to deliver evidence-based policymaking. It promotes transparency, accountability and informed decision-making. It is a key tool to deliver better Eu- ropean governance and to make sustainable development a mainstream part of the Union\u2019s policymaking under commit- ments made at the G\u00f6teborg European Council in 2001 143 . The Commission\u2019s approach incorporates the different steps BETTER REGULATION IN THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION A N N E X I 1. 2. Box 1: Excerpt from Commission Communication COM(2002) 275 on Better Law-Making There are a lot of complex issues at stake now in enacting good European legislation which is mindful of the princi- ples of subsidiarity and proportionality. People nowadays take an interest in the effectiveness of the rules handed down \u201cfrom Brussels\u201d and the way they are drawn up. The advent of a democratic conscience is strengthening the need for accountability and proportionality in the way powers vested in the European institutions are exercised. This need is expressed more especially in transparency, clarity and the willingness to stand up to scrutiny. What we have here, then, is a veritable ethical requirement. ",
        "| 43 of the policy lifecycle from inception and preparation to im- plementation, evaluation and subsequent modification. Better regulation is built on three complementary and closely related pillars: the impact assessment, evaluation and stakeholder consultation. There are also a number of other elements de- scribed below. Stakeholder consultation Consultation allows stakeholders, including individuals, to ex- press their views and for the Commission to gather evidence to help prepare its new initiatives 144 or evaluate existing poli- cies. A consultation strategy accompanies each initiative. This identifies the information that the Commission would like to obtain, and the activities and methods the Commission will deploy to obtain that information. The initial description of the initiative and the consultation strategy are usually published in a roadmap or inception im- pact assessment. This allows all stakeholders to comment at an early stage and to prepare themselves for the more de- tailed consultation activities that follow. 144 Article 2 of Protocol No. 2 TEU/TFEU obliges the Commission to consult widely before proposing legislative acts and these consulta- tions should take into account the local and regional dimensions of the envisaged action where appropriate. The evaluation and impact assessment depend on a good quality stakeholder consultation. A web-based public consulta- tion lasting 12 weeks generally accompanies each impact as- sessment and evaluation. For major initiatives in the Commis- sion\u2019s work programme, the Commission aims to consult in all official languages and at least in English, French and German in other cases. Additionally, Commission staff will carry out tar- geted consultations using interviews, workshops, conferences, focus groups, etc. as described in the consultation strategy. The impact assessment The impact assessment looks at a range of policy solutions that could address an identified problem and its underlying causes. It helps to ensure observance of the Treaty principles of subsidiarity, proportionality and sustainable development and ensure that the most relevant and important impacts are identified and assessed. An impact assessment should also provide information about the views of different stakeholders. Lastly, an impact assessment should make the link to a future evaluation by identifying the benchmarks and procedure for monitoring the practical implementation of the legislation, pol- icy or programme. Box 2: The better regulation policy cycle ",
        "44 | Taking Stock of the Commission\u2019s Better Regulation Agenda Evaluation Evaluations look back to see how the policy has worked 145 . When available, they use the earlier impact assessment to compare the actual and expected outcomes. Evaluation pro- vides important information about potential problems that occur in policy implementation. A future impact assessment might address these in connection with a subsequent revi- sion of the policy. In some cases, an evaluation may conclude that the legislation is no longer needed or that no changes are required. Good evaluations need timely information about how a policy performs. Therefore, an appropriate monitoring framework is essential, but this is not always available. This can occur, for example, when no arrangements have been put in place to collect the necessary information or when the Com- mission is legally obliged to evaluate the legislation before sufficient practical experience has been accumulated. The Commission\u2019s better regulation agenda is based on the \u2018evaluate first\u2019 principle. Before introducing new legislation, the Commission has committed to evaluate what already exists, providing robust and objective evidence to feed decisions as to whether EU action should continue as is, be changed or even stop. These evaluations can be of individual pieces of legislation or of several acts covering a particular sector or issue (\u2018fitness checks\u2019). In 2016, evaluations were carried out for about half of the impact assessments. In 2017 this figure rose to over 70% and in 2018 reached 78%. REFIT The concept of regulatory fitness (\u2018REFIT\u2019) is at the heart of better regulation. It focuses on ensuring that new and existing legislation achieves its objectives in the most efficient man- ner and that existing legislation delivers as expected, does not impose unnecessary regulatory costs and is as simple as pos- sible. Evaluations help ensure that Union legislation remains fit for purpose. 145 The Commission uses five standard criteria: (1) Effectiveness (the extent to which policy objectives are met); (2) Efficiency (the costs of delivering the intended benefits); (3) Coherence (within the policy instrument and with other policies); (4) Relevance (ongoing need for the legislation); (5) EU added value (beyond what might have been expected without EU intervention). 146 COM(2015)215: Better regulation for better results - An EU agenda: https://europa.eu/!TM38ru 147 https://ec.europa.eu/info/publications/european-commission-work-programme_en 148 http://publications.europa.eu/webpub/com/refit-scoreboard/en/index.html 149 https://ec.europa.eu/info/files/better-regulation-toolbox-5_en The REFIT Platform The REFIT Platform was set up by the May 2015 Better Regu- lation Communication 146 to advise the Commission on how to make EU regulation more efficient and effective while reducing unnecessary costs (without undermining policy objectives). The Platform consists of two groups: \u2022 A stakeholder group, with 18 members representing business (including SMEs), civil society organisations and social partners with direct experience in applying Union legislation. The group also includes two representatives from the European Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions. \u2022 A government group, with one high-level expert from each of the Member States. t group, with one high-level Platform members consider suggestions by various parts of civil society. (either online via \u2018Lighten the Load\u2019 web site or through other means), on the potential to reduce regulatory and administrative burden. On this basis, the REFIT Platform adopts opinions recommending practical follow-up to the Commission. The Commission is committed to respond to all opinions, in- dicating whether action is necessary or appropriate, the type of action envisaged and its timing. The Commission presents information on the follow-up to the Platform opinions in its work programmes 147 and in the REFIT Scoreboard 148 . Better regulation guidelines and toolbox The Commission has developed and published guidelines that direct Commission staff on how to apply better regulation in their work. These capture all phases of the policy cycle, includ- ing planning, impact assessment, preparing proposals, imple- mentation and transposition, monitoring, evaluation and stake- holder consultation. They also address how the Commission will assist Member States in their national implementation of Union legislation. The toolbox contains 65 separate tools. They each provide detailed assistance on how to tackle specific issues such as subsidiarity and proportionality 149 . ",
        "| 45 Stakeholder participation: \u2018Have Your Say\u2019 web site (the Better Regulation Portal) 150 The Commission launched a web-based portal ( \u2018Have Your Say\u2019 ) in 2016, and its functionality has improved progressively. Stakeholders are able to provide feedback on policy prepara- tion and implementation throughout the policy cycle. Via the \u2018Have Your Say\u2019 website, stakeholders are able to: \u2022 provide comments on Commission roadmaps and incep- tion impact assessments which are published at the very outset of a new initiative (during a period of 4 weeks); \u2022 participate in public consultations for new initiatives or evaluations of existing legislation or policies (generally during a 12-week period); \u2022 provide comments on proposals adopted by the Com- mission (during a period of 8 weeks following adoption). These will be compiled by the Commission and forward- ed to the European Parliament and the Council; \u2022 provide comments on the legal texts of draft delegat- ed acts and implementing acts before finalisation by the Commission (during a period of 4 weeks); and \u2022 provide comments and suggestions about how to simpli- fy specific legislation and reduce unnecessary regulatory costs. These suggestions are then taken up by the REFIT Platform, which may adopt opinions and recommenda- tions to the Commission.e comments and suggestions All stakeholders are able to participate in such activities and can request automatic notification when new documents are uploaded to the portal website. Stakeholders can also submit views and other evidence to the Commission outside of the formal consultation and feedback processes. In particular, the European Citizens\u2019 Initiative 151 complements the participation opportunities mentioned above. Regulatory Scrutiny Board The President of the Commission established a new Regula- tory Scrutiny Board 152 in May 2015. The Board is comprised of a chairperson and six members. They all work full-time for the Board and do not have any responsibility for policymaking. All serve for a period of 3 years. Three of the members were 150 https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/contribute-law-making_en 151 http://ec.europa.eu/citizens-initiative/public/welcome?lg=en 152 https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-making-process/regulatory-scrutiny-board_en 153 http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=OJ:L:2016:123:TOC 154 http://ec.europa.eu/smart-regulation/impact/key_docs/docs/ii_common_approach_to_ia_en.pdf recruited from outside of the European institutions, while the remaining four come from within the Commission services. The Board checks the quality of all impact assessments and selected evaluations against the requirements of the Com- mission\u2019s better regulation guidelines. It issues opinions and recommendations for improvement. Initiatives accompanied by an impact assessment will generally require a positive opinion from the Board for the file to proceed to the College of Commissioners for decision. These represent significant changes compared to the previous Impact Assessment Board where a pool of senior managers worked part-time for the Board but retained their policy re- sponsibilities. The previous Impact Assessment Board did not scrutinise evaluations. Interinstitutional agreement on better law-making Following the Commission\u2019s proposal in 2015, an interinstitu- tional agreement on better law-making entered into force in April 2016 153 . It sets out the commitments of the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission on many aspects regarding the preparation and implementation of Union leg- islation. These include the performance of an impact assess- ment of proposals and substantial amendments, monitoring and evaluation, the preparation of delegated acts and regula- tory simplification. The 2016 Agreement replaces the previous agreement concluded in 2003 and the institutions\u2019 2005 com- mon accord on impact assessment 154 . Better regulation training courses In 2016-2017, the Commission overhauled its training cours- es on better regulation. The objective was to promote aware- ness of the better regulation tools and principles across the Commission and ensure that officials who carry out impact assessments and evaluations are sufficiently well equipped and knowledgeable to enable them to produce high-quality, evidence-based reports. Better regulation training courses are now available in the interinstitutional catalogue on EU Learn, meaning that any Commission official can easily find and reg- ister for any of the courses. Additionally, the courses are open to officials from the European Parliament and the Council. The revised approach to training on better regulation depicted below has three tiers (see figure below): ",
        "46 | Taking Stock of the Commission\u2019s Better Regulation Agenda \u2022 an introductory course composed of an e-learning and a class-based module; \u2022 one course for each of the better regulation \u2018pillars\u2019 (planning & validation, evaluation, impact assessment and stakeholder consultation); \u2022 advanced courses on specific issues noted as recurring weaknesses in the opinions of the Regulatory Scrutiny Board (e.g. on quantification methods, intervention logic, problem definition in impact assessments and subsidi- arity). Additionally, the Secretariat-General organises regular meet- ings and exchanges of good practices with the networks of desk officers responsible for impact assessments, evaluations, stakeholder consultation and REFIT in the directorates-general. Other activities with other institutions and bodies In the period covered by the stocktaking, the Secretariat-Gener- al represented the Commission in 21 meetings of the Council\u2019s Working Party on Competitiveness and Growth (better regula- tion). Each rotating presidency also tends to organise a meet- ing of representatives from the national ministries responsible for better regulation which the Commission also attends (Di- rectors for better regulation). In addition, the Secretariat-Gen- eral also represents the Commission at the Regulatory Policy Committee meetings of the OECD (typically twice a year). Cost of operating a better regulation policy It is estimated that between 150 and 280 full-time equivalent staff are deployed on better regulation-related activities and supported by external contractors providing services amount- ing to between EUR 10 million to EUR 37 million annually. There are also staff costs associated with operating the Reg- ulatory Scrutiny Board with its seven full-time senior officials. A full-time secretariat serves the Board and consists of ap- proximately 10 to 15 full-time (equivalent) members of staff. A further 3 full-time staff provide a secretariat to the REFIT Platform, and the Commission meets the expenses of the Platform meetings and the participants\u2019 expenses. The \u2018Have Your Say\u2019 web portal cost approximately EUR 3 mil- lion to create between 2015 and 2018.

An impact assessment or evaluation typically takes between 0.5 to 1.5 years to complete. ",
        "| 47 OVERVIEW OF CONSULTATION ACTIVITIES The aim of the consultation was to assess how well the var- ious better regulation procedures and bodies used by the Commission are working in practice and to what extent they contribute to achieving its better regulation policy objectives. The focus of the exercise was on the changes made by the Commission since May 2015. Public consultation On 17 July 2018, the European Commission launched an on- line public consultation entitled Stocktaking of the Commis- sion\u2019s \u2018better regulation\u2019 approach . The public consultation was available in 23 EU languages and closed on 23 October 2018. The Commission undertook communication campaigns, including via social media, in all EU languages to raise aware- ness of the consultation. The public consultation was structured around the following themes: (1) General questions: The Commission and better regulation (2) Stakeholder consultation: Consulting the public and inter- ested parties (3) Evaluation and REFIT: Evaluating existing EU laws (4) Impact assessments: Assessing new Commission proposals (5) Regulatory scrutiny: Scrutinising the quality of impact as- sessments and evaluations (6) Final questions on progress in the past and future. The Commission received 626 responses to the public consul- tation. After applying the rules for moderating feedback and suggestions, 596 contributions remained. Of those, 433 (63%) came from individuals in their private capacity and 163 (27%) from professionals (businesses, NGOs, think tanks, research, academia, consultants, public and regional authorities) reply- ing on behalf of an organisation. Respondents to the public consultation came from 15 Member States. Stakeholders submitted 42 position papers during the public consultation. Of these, 16 were not considered because they (a) duplicated another position paper in a different language; (b) promoted a commercial product or service; (c) duplicated a submission to the Taskforce on Subsidiarity; or (d) did not relate to the Commission\u2019s better regulation agenda. Targeted consultation In addition, there was a targeted consultation of the officials of the European Parliament, the Council, the Committee of the Regions (CoR), the European Economic and Social Committee (EESC). Member States were consulted via the Council Working Party on Competitiveness and Growth (COMPCRO). Additionally, 5 Member States (Estonia, Germany, Ireland, Poland and Spain) sent in contributions after a discussion in the Council\u2019s Work- ing Group on Competitiveness and Growth (COMPCRO). Some Member States also contributed to the public consultation. There were 244 Commission officials who were interviewed. These interviews targeted officials who had written an evalu- ation and/or impact assessment. Officials responsible for bet- ter regulation in the Commission discussed the results of all consultation activities at a dedicated workshop on 18 January 2019 with approximately 80 participants. In parallel, the REFIT Platform launched its own survey of its members on whether the Platform had served its purpose and had contributed to the Commission\u2019s better regulation agenda. OVERVIEW OF CONSULTATION ACTIVITIES II A N N E X 1. ",
        "48 | Taking Stock of the Commission\u2019s Better Regulation Agenda The Platform circulated the survey on 2 July 2018 and re- ceived 34 contributions (20 from members of the government group and 14 from the stakeholders\u2019 group). It delivered its opinion on 14 March 2019 155 . Feedback on the roadmap The Commission published the roadmap 156 for the stocktak- ing exercise on the \u2018Have Your Say\u2019 web portal for stakeholder engagement. During the four-week feedback period, 6 replies were received through the portal and 1 by email. These con- tributions are published on the web alongside the roadmap. 155 REFIT Platform opinion XXII.10.a \u201cREFIT Platform Survey \u2013 Future prospects\u201d, adopted on 14 March 2019: https://ec.europa.eu/info/ files/refit-platform-recommendations-horizontal-issues-xxii10a-refit-platform-survey-future-prospects_en 156 https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/better-regulation/initiatives/ares-2018-2332204_en 157 http://www.oecd.org/gov/regulatory-policy/2012-recommendation.htm 158 http://www.oecd.org/governance/oecd-regulatory-policy-outlook-2018-9789264303072-en.htm Two anonymous individuals asked questions and made sug- gestions about the stocktaking process. For example, one in- dividual suggested extending the scope of the exercise to the co-legislators and proposed involving independent experts to make the results more credible. The other individual wondered whether it was the right time to take stock. According to this person, it would be desirable to study the effects on the quality of legislation but it might be too early to see any at this stage. The submissions from associations (Association of German Chambers of Industry and Commerce, the European Crop Pro- tection Association and the German Confederation of Skilled Crafts and from the Maltese national authorities offered a pre- view of the contributions they sent in response to the public consultation and which are described in detail below. Overall, they welcomed the visible progress made with the Commis- sion\u2019s better regulation policy and offered suggestions on how to improve it further. OECD REGULATORY POLICY OUTLOOK 2018 Every 3 years, the OECD publishes a comparative assessment of member countries\u2019 better regulation systems. The purpose of the OECD report is to track and measure the progress of OECD countries (and the progress of the European Commis- sion) in their regulatory practices and their implementation of the OECD\u2019s 2012 recommendations for regulatory policy 157 . The 2018 outlook reflects the situation at the end of 2017 158 . The OECD\u2019s assessment focuses on three dimensions of reg- ulatory policy practices, namely stakeholder engagement, the impact assessment and ex post evaluations. For each of these dimensions, the study assigns scores for the methodology, oversight and quality control, the systematic use and trans- parency. The report applies a methodology of composite in- dicators constructed using self-reported data, which is quality checked by the OECD. With the 2018 outlook, it is possible to measure the improve- ments made under the Juncker Commission that include the May 2015 reforms and subsequent adjustments made in the summer of 2017. Already before these reforms, back in 2014, the EU (European Commission) was performing well in the three dimensions analysed: stakeholder engagement, the impact assessment and ex post evaluations. The Commission was a strong performer for the impact assessment and eval- uations, but still had the potential to improve on stakeholder consultation. The 2018 report shows that the Commission\u2019s 2015 reforms have brought significant improvements. The Commission is now ranked first in the OECD for stakeholder engagement, a reflection of the Commission\u2019s introduction of feedback mech- anisms for roadmaps, inception impact assessments, adopted proposals, draft delegated acts and implementing acts and public consultations accompanying impact assessments and evaluations. On impact assessments, the Commission further refined and improved its policy and kept the third-placed ranking it had already achieved in 2014. The Commission has further im- proved its approach on evaluations and has improved its rank- ing to third place. Overall, the Commission\u2019s regulatory policy now ranks among the very best in the OECD with no other country or associated country scoring higher across the three dimensions of better regulation. 2.

The debate on the EU Better Regulation Agenda: a literature review, EUR, Publications Office of the European Union, Luxembourg, 2019, ISBN 978-92-76-00840-8, doi:10. 2760/46617, JRC116035 The Directorate-General Joint Research Centre undertook a review of the academic literature to support the current stocktaking exercise and has published the results 159 . Looking at better regulation generally and at the specific tools used by the Commission, the Joint Research Centre focused on peer-reviewed and grey literature published since 2015. The results have been incorporated in the preceding sections and a short summary of the main findings is presented below. The literature review looked at more than 100 papers. These covered many different issues, given the different interpre- tations of better regulation. It is difficult to draw overarching conclusions because relatively little time has elapsed since the Commission introduced major changes in 2015. Generally, the literature welcomes the Commission\u2019s stronger commitment to evidence-based policymaking and the guid- ance it has provided in the better regulation guidelines and toolbox. The literature highlights the all-encompassing ap- proach taken by the Commission in covering the whole policy cycle. However, the review notes that this guidance still leaves room for discretion on how to carry out analyses (especially the quantification of impacts) that adversely affect objectiv- ity. More (standardised) guidance and support as well as im- proved in-house expertise and external peer review have been suggested to increase the quality and objectiveness of impact assessments and evaluations. In this respect, the review also highlights the value of the \u2018evaluate first\u2019 principle and the need for impact assessments to build better upon each other, particularly in terms of planning/scheduling. The review highlights several criticisms. Evidence-based policy- making is undermined when proposals are not supported by an impact assessment. Impact assessments often seem to justi- fy a predetermined policy option. In this context, authors also called for more transparency by publishing underlying data and studies as well as draft reports. Additionally, there were concerns about how the EU\u2019s overarching objectives, as en- shrined in the treaties, are taken into account in the assess- ments. Regarding public consultations, the literature welcomes the significantly increased opportunities for participating in EU pol- icymaking. However, some authors questioned whether the quality of the feedback received justified the high workload for participants and the Commission. There is a perceived lack of transparency on how the Commission uses consultation re- sponses. Moreover, authors questioned whether the question- naires succeed in collecting evidence from people who would otherwise not be involved. The review noted that the REFIT Platform was seen as focus- ing too narrowly on cost reduction rather than cost-efficiency (cost per unit benefit). Furthermore, there were concerns that the Platform does not exclude political considerations and that it may support a deregulation agenda. On the Regulatory Scrutiny Board, the review recorded pro- posals to expand its scope and activities: first, intervene ear- lier in the preparatory processes; second, become more inde- pendent; third, consolidate its expertise in a variety of policy fields. Some contributions regretted that the Board is only an in-house body, also meaning that the public and stakeholders cannot hold the Commission (judicially) accountable to its bet- ter regulation principles. Some authors saw the Interinstitutional Agreement on Bet- ter Law-Making as an essential part of better regulation but regretted that it remains only partially implemented. Others viewed it as an attempt by the Commission to wield greater influence over policymaking and/or to share the blame with the co-legislators for poor quality legislation. 3. ",
        "50 | Taking Stock of the Commission\u2019s Better Regulation Agenda PUBLIC CONSULTATION This section presents the overall results per question, as well as a breakdown of replies according to the type of respondent (i.e. individuals, professionals) in order to make the views of the different stakeholder groups more visible. GENERAL QUESTIONS: THE COMMISSION AND BETTER REGULATION Q1. Are you informed about the Commission\u2019s plans early enough to be able to take part in the policy- making process? Out of 596 respondents, 184 (31%) agree that that they are fully or mostly informed early enough to take part in the Com- mission\u2019s policymaking process; whereas 147 (25%) of the 596 respondents argue that this is sometimes the case, and 253 respondents (42.4%) said they were not informed early enough. Public authorities and businesses said most frequently that they are fully or mostly informed early enough in the process (41 out of 74 and 17 out of 23; 55.4% and 73.9% respec- tively). In contrast, the majority of the individuals (238 out of 433, 55.0%) responded that they are not usually or not at all informed early enough. 4. 4.1. 36 148 147 130 123 12 27 68 93 120 118 7 9 80 54 10 5 5 0 20 40 60 80 100 120 140 160 180 200 Yes, fully Yes, mostly Some \ufffd mes No, not usually No, not at all Don't know N u m b e r o f r e s p o n d e n t s Are you informed about the Commission\u2019s plans early enough to be able to take part in the policy-making process?

        "| 51 Breakdown of answers given in a professional capacity: Q2. Are you satisfied with how the Commission involves members of the public, businesses, non-governmental organisations and other interest groups? Approximately half of the individual respondents (53%) are dissatisfied or very dissatisfied with the way that the Commis- sion involves members of the public, businesses, non-govern- mental organisations and other interest groups. Out of 163 professionals, 64 (39%) are of the same view.

The opinions whether the Commission proposals are backed by enough evidence are divided. 147 respondents (24.7%) in- dicated that there was enough evidence, while 164 (27.5%) said that there was not.

        "| 53 Q4. Does the Commission take environmental and social impacts sufficiently into account when putting forward policy proposals (in addition to economic impacts)? Respondents agreed almost equally that the Commission did or did not consider environmental and social impacts suffi- ciently. Out of 596 respondents, 171 (28.7%) thought those impacts received sufficient attention, while 170 (28.5%) did not. The largest group of respondents (188 out of 596, 31.5%) thought that the Commission considers environmental and so- cial impacts partially. Among professionals, non-governmental organisations tended to think that social and environmental impacts are not suffi- ciently considered, while businesses tended to be of the oppo- site view.

        "56 | Taking Stock of the Commission\u2019s Better Regulation Agenda PUBLIC CONSULTATIONS: CONSULTING THE PUBLIC AND INTERESTED PARTIES Q7. Are roadmaps and inception impact assessments useful to help you prepare your participation in the policymaking process? Approximately 20% (102 of 556) of all respondents are not familiar with roadmaps and inception impact assessments. Of those who said they were familiar with them, approximately half (226 out of 494, 45.7%) find roadmaps and inception impact assessments entirely or mostly useful for preparing their participation in the policymaking process. More than half the professionals thought that the roadmaps and inception impact assessments were (very) helpful, while another quarter deemed them partially helpful. Individual re- spondents were less positive. 4.2. 56 170 138 87 43 102 40 100 94 67 43 89 16 70 44 20 0 13 0 20 40 60 80 100 120 140 160 180 200 Yes, fully Yes, mostly Par \ufffd ally No, mostly not No, not at all Don\u2019t know N u m b e r o f r e s p o n d e n t s Are roadmaps and incep \ufffd on impact assessments useful to help you prepare your par \ufffd cipa \ufffd on in the policy-making process?

        "| 57 Q8. Are you satisfied with the following opportunities to contribute to the policymaking process? With the exception of public consultations, a significant num- ber of respondents (from 18.8% to 25% depending on the opportunity) was not aware of the various opportunities to contribute to policymaking. The proportion of respondents who are satisfied with the op- portunities to give feedback to inception impact assessments and roadmaps and take part in public consultations (31.7% and 40.0% respectively) is higher than the proportion of those who are dissatisfied (21.1% and 27.5% respectively). Howev- er, slightly more participants were dissatisfied than satisfied with the opportunities to comment on draft implementing and delegating acts (27.0% versus 25.2%) and legislative pro- posals adopted by the College (29.2% versus 28.0%) as well as the opportunity to flag legislation needing improvement (27.2% versus 24.8%). Across the five questions on participa- tion opportunities, between 17.4% and 23.3% of respondents were neither satisfied nor dissatisfied. Respondents (mainly individuals) to the open questions made a strong call to the European Commission to reach out more to increase awareness of its efforts under the better regula- tion agenda. Respondents stressed that the outreach efforts on regulatory developments in the EU have to find their way into the mainstream media, because most people do not fol- low EU social media accounts. According to respondents, the communication is also not tailored to Member States and the members of the public there. National and regional public au- thorities should play a more prominent role in informing the public. In response to the open questions, several professionals point- ed out that local and regional and local public authorities as well as small and medium enterprises (SMEs) should be con- sulted better.

        "58 | Taking Stock of the Commission\u2019s Better Regulation Agenda Q9. Are you satisfied with the following aspects of the Commission\u2019s public consultations? Respondents had rather positive opinions on various charac- teristics of public consultations. The availability of different language versions, the length of the consultation period, and the opportunity to make relevant comments and provide sup- porting material were the aspects with which respondents were most satisfied (54.2%, 47.8% and 44.3% (very) satisfied respectively). Between 40.8% and 36.1% of the respondents were (very) satisfied with the length, clarity and neutrality of the question- naires. While the percentage of respondents who were (very) dissatisfied with these six aspects of public consultations was smaller, it is still sizeable (9.7% to 17.35%). Several individ- uals and organisations/professionals responded in the open text questions that questionnaires should be shorter, clearer, more neutral, less biased and less geared towards the desired option.

Out of 596 respondents, 225 (37.8%) were (very) dissatisfied with the way the Commission reports on the results of its public consultations and feedback mechanisms. Another large share was neither satisfied nor dissatisfied (169 respondents, 28.4%). Public authorities who responded tended to be more satisfied than businesses and non-governmental organisations. Answering the open questions, respondents (both individuals and organisations/professionals) asked that reports on the re- sults of consultation activities be systematically published (in timely fashion). 27 105 169 146 79 70 25 76 113 90 71 58 2 29 56 56 8 12 0 20 40 60 80 100 120 140 160 180 200 Yes, very sa \ufffd s fi ed Yes, sa \ufffd s fi ed Neither sa \ufffd s fi ed nor dissa \ufffd s fi ed No, dissa \ufffd s fi ed No, very dissa \ufffd s fi ed Don't know N u m b e r o f r e s p o n d e n t s Are you sa \ufffd s fi ed with how the Commission reports on the results of its public consulta \ufffd ons and the other opportuni \ufffd es to comment?

Are you satisfied with the following aspects of the Commission\u2019s evaluations? The opinions on the various elements of the evaluations carried out by the Commission were mixed. Again, professionals tended to be a bit more positive than individuals. Additionally, a sizea- ble group of 95 and 118 respondents (15.9% - 19.8%) did not feel they were capable of judging the quality of the evaluations. Most of the replies from respondents are more or less equally divided between satisfied, neither satisfied nor dissatisfied and dissatisfied. Only a small number said they were very satisfied (3.7% - 5.5%), while 10.2% to 15.4% were very dissatisfied. In response to the open questions, several respondents said that the evaluation results needed to be utilised better when performing impact assessments. Some industry representa- tives asked for stricter adherence to the \u2018evaluate first\u2019 principle. Respondents suggested that legislation should be given time to be implemented and take effect before initiating evaluations. Evaluations often require assumptions to be made to quantify costs and benefits, which have not yet materialised. Additionally, respondents called for more transparency in the transposition of directives into national law and in the manner in which they are implemented. The evaluations should be more sensitive to divergences in the implementation of legislation in Member States. Some respondents argued that evaluations should be done by the European Parliament and the Member States, i.e. that the Commission should not have this responsibility. Others sug- gested relying less on external contractors to do evaluations. 0 8 8 5 0 2 1 14 25 29 4 1 0 2 8 12 2 2 1 4 6 0 2 6 0 1 9 10 0 1 05 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 Yes, very sa \ufffd s fi ed Yes, sa \ufffd s fi ed Neither sa \ufffd s fi ed nor dissa \ufffd s fi ed No, dissa \ufffd s fi ed No, very dissa \ufffd s fi ed Don't know N u m b e r o f r e s p o n d e n t s Are you sa \ufffd s fi ed with how the Commission reports on the results of its public consulta \ufffd ons and the other opportuni \ufffd es to comment?

Many of the respondents were not sufficiently aware of the REFIT Platform. Out of 163 professionals, 45 (28%) did not feel they were able to assess the REFIT Platform\u2019s effectiveness. The same was true for 177 (40%) of the 433 individuals who replied.

        "| 63 IMPACT ASSESSMENTS: ASSESSING NEW COMMISSION PROPOSALS Q13. Are you satisfied with the following aspects of the Commission\u2019s impact assessments? A large percentage of the respondents (14.9% to 20.1%) did not know whether they were or were not satisfied with the Commission\u2019s impact assessments. Of those who did feel they could answer the question, the largest group (24.2% to 27.9%) said they were neither satisfied nor dissatisfied. With 223 respondents (very) dissatisfied (37.4%), there was most dissatisfaction with the transparency on policy alternatives and their impacts. Around 170 participants (28.5%) were (very) dissatisfied with each of the other three characteris- tics. While only a few respondents were very satisfied (4.7% to 5.7%) with the impact assessments\u2019 various characteristics, 18.0% to 21.8% were satisfied. Respondents saw the impact assessments\u2019 usefulness for decision-making slightly more positively than the quality of the assessments. Professionals were on average neither satisfied nor dissatis- fied with the impact assessments, except for transparent in- formation on all relevant impacts (75 out of 168, 44.6%). In addition, businesses were not satisfied with the assessment of the potential for simplifying legislation (29 out of 74, 39.2%). Professionals responding to the open questions very often flagged that too many pieces of legislation came without an impact assessment. Respondents said that it is not always transparent why some proposals are subject to impact as- sessments while others are not. 4.4. ",
        "64 | Taking Stock of the Commission\u2019s Better Regulation Agenda Some respondents indicated that the Interinstitutional Agree- ment on Better Law-Making is not fully observed. They ex- pressed disappointment that the European Parliament and Council seem to make little use of impact assessments and do not assess their amendments. Respondents felt that best practices on transparency were not consistently followed, so that, for example, the analysis pre- sented, including the choice of options, was not transparent and comprehensible. The criticism was diverse, covering the whole range: there was the feeling that political considerations outweighed all other input, consultation questions were found to be biased or too limited, not all information was published, etc. Professionals added that the use and presentation of nu- merical models often was detrimental to transparency. Individuals and professionals replying to the open questions are of the opinion that the scope of the impacts assessed is too limited, focusing too much on economic issues, big indus- try and other large stakeholders, in particular. The wish to look rather at society as a whole (e.g. on environmental impacts, effects on SMEs/micro-businesses, impacts on individuals/con- sumers, health, fundamental/basic rights, inequality/poverty/ social dialogue, minorities) was often voiced. Professionals very often criticise the varying analytical and methodological quality across impact assessments and the low quality of the underlying data. Regarding subsidiarity, some respondents find the current assessment overly legalistic and formalistic. They claim that the added value of action at EU level needs to be analysed based on evidence. Professionals said that harmonisation and cross-border activity should not be overused as arguments for justification. In this context, the remark was made that more than 20 different approaches do not necessarily imply a need for harmonisation; rather it could be evidence that the Mem- ber States have successfully tackled the problem. Respondents Respondents proposed various suggestions on how to be better involved. Moreover, local and regional lev- els of government should better be taken into account. They said that a territorial and urban impact assessment should be done, EU-level action should be better justified, and there should be a closer examination of what measures Member States have taken. REGULATORY SCRUTINY: SCRUTINISING THE QUALITY OF IMPACT ASSESSMENTS AND EVALUATIONS Q14. Please indicate the level of your agreement with each of the following statements regarding regu- latory scrutiny Among individuals, 320 (74%) out of 433 said that they were not familiar with the Regulatory Scrutiny Board (the Board) or barely so, whereas 64 (39%) out of 163 professionals stated the same. Hence, awareness of the Board is very low. Of those who did know about regulatory scrutiny, an over- whelming majority thought that the Board added value to the regulatory process (89 out of 103, 86.4%). Additionally, more respondents had a positive opinion of the Board\u2019s character- istics than a negative opinion. On the two questions whether there was sufficient regulatory scrutiny and whether the Board was impartial, respondents were evenly split. Moreover, pro- fessionals are more likely to have positive opinions about the Board than individuals are in their private capacity. It emerges from the answers to the open questions that re- spondents clearly do not see the Board as a body exercising purely internal quality control. Given the absence of a similar body elsewhere in the legislation process, for example at the level of co-legislators, the Board is expected to have a much larger role in the policymaking process. Several respondents proposed giving it more independence by establishing a sec- retariat for the Board independent from the Commission or by recruiting all members externally. Additionally, respondents suggested strengthening the mandate to allow the Board to assess inception impact assessments and roadmaps as well as more evaluations. 4.5. ",

While individuals saw further im- provement necessary in areas where most progress has been made \u2014 i.e. consultation, transparency and impact assess- ments \u2014 professionals would like to see also more progress on evaluations. CONCLUSIONS OF THE PUBLIC CONSULTATION QUESTIONNAIRE Professionals tended to be more positive about the Commis- sion\u2019s better regulation efforts than individuals responding in a private capacity. Individual respondents often indicated that they found the decision-making process with its better regulation elements confusing, did not find it transparent or were simply unaware of its elements, especially REFIT and impact assessments. The new web portal Have Your Say was welcomed by several respondents, but consultation and transparency remain the top items that respondents would like to see further improved. Additionally, many individuals had the impression that they were overlooked by the analyses. Like civil society organisa- tions, they argued that the economic focus is too strong and neglects issues such as (public) health, inequality and the cli- mate. Professionals considered themselves better informed about the better regulation agenda and the opportunities to partic- ipate than individual respondents did. They made proposals to strengthen several elements of better regulation and to increase the opportunities for them to participate, and urged the Commission, the European Parliament and the European Council to assess the impacts of every proposal and amend- ment. 4.7.

        "68 | Taking Stock of the Commission\u2019s Better Regulation Agenda POSITION PAPERS 160 https://ec.europa.eu/info/consultations/public-consultation-stocktaking-commissions-better-regulation-approach_en Overall, stakeholders welcomed the progress that the Com- mission has made on better regulation since 2015. They especially appreciated the increased possibilities for partici- pation. In their position papers, they call for continued efforts and make many suggestions to further improve and elaborate the better regulation system. To be able to advocate better their interests, stakeholders proposed further improving par- ticipation, increasing transparency and de-politicising the bet- ter regulation system. Additionally, NGOs and social partners called for an overhaul to put the public interest rather than the economy into the focus. National and regional governments as well as businesses supported the economic orientation and renewed their call to pay close attention to the regulatory bur- den placed on each of them. At the same time, two members of the business community worried about better regulation leading to deregulation. Finally, members of the research community offered their specific expertise. For more detail, see the web page where all position papers have been published 160 . Public authorities In alphabetical order, the national governments of Denmark, Finland and the United Kingdom as well as the organisation representing the interests of Danish local governments (LGDK) submitted relevant position papers. In a separate document, the national government of Malta provided extended answers to the open questions in the public consultation online. These public authorities univocally welcome the improvements brought by the better regulation agenda. They propose various ways to further strengthen the elements of the better regula- tion system and to continue the REFIT programme. They also support an economic orientation, referring to competitiveness, economic growth, employment and innovation as important issues to be considered. Additionally, public authorities ask for continued efforts on quantification and burden reduction. For the Danish, Finnish, Maltese and British public authorities, especially the Danish local governments, implementation was a key issue. In this context, they considered more granularity in the analyses as essential. The Danish local governments gave as an example \u201cthat an impact assessment shows that 40% of workers will get better terms for a given action at EU level. It would be desirable to investigate which workers this applies to and from which Member States.\u201d Additionally, these public authorities also asked the Com- mission to pay attention to the density and complexity of its legislation, which is especially caused by implementing acts and delegated acts. According to them, these acts often weigh heavily on local governments and small and medium-sized businesses who have to understand and apply those rules. In terms of proposed changes, those proposed to improve stakeholder consultations and participation in the REFIT Platform played the most prominent role in these public authorities\u2019 position papers. They urged the Commission: to make sure that all stakeholder groups are included; to drive up the number and diversity of contributions; to have more open-ended questionnaires; to follow up on stakeholders\u2019 con- tributions systematically and consistently; and to improve the inclusion of (detailed) stakeholder contributions in analyses. Another suggestion made by several public authorities is to increase the Regulatory Scrutiny Board\u2019s independence. Many detailed suggestions regarding the Commission\u2019s better regu- lation system can be found in the position papers themselves. Civil society (NGOs) In alphabetical order, BirdLife Europe, CONCORD (European NGO confederation for relief and development), the European Environmental Bureau, NABU and WWF submitted position pa- pers, with those of BirdLife and NABU being almost identical. The following statement of the WWF reflects these NGOs\u2019 concerns succinctly: \u201cCurrently the Better Regulation guide- lines mainly aim to support economic growth by ensuring that its proposals meet policy goals at minimum cost, while main- taining social and environmental sustainability considered as a secondary objective.\u201d Therefore, the position papers call for a reform or even an overhaul of the Commission\u2019s current better regulation system. These NGOs urge the Commission to put public interest rather 4.8. ",
        "| 69 than the private interest of the business community at the cen- tre of the better regulation agenda. A related criticism is that the environmental impacts do not receive the same attention as economic impacts. These NGOs see an overemphasis on quantification, especially in monetary terms, as a root cause. According to them, the current quantifying practices also sys- tematically disadvantage future generations and non-linearly behaving environmental systems. CONCORD commented pos- itively on the sustainability impact assessments and human rights impact assessments carried out by DG TRADE for trade negotiation proposals. These NGOs look to the better regulation system to track the European Union\u2019s performance in meeting (internationally) agreed objectives and goals, such as the Sustainable Devel- opment Goals and climate targets. For example, they find that setting indicators and monitoring the achievement of policy goals against those indicators increases the EU\u2019s accounta- bility. The environmental NGOs proposed that sustainability principles become mainstream by including them in the better regulation toolbox and having the Regulatory Scrutiny Board oversee their application. CONCORD added the concept of pol- icy coherence for development to this request. Additionally, these NGOs emphasise the importance of achiev- ing policy objectives effectively and efficiently, rather than fo- cusing on cost cutting and simplification, which is what the current REFIT programme does in their view. In this regard, NGOs ask that better attention be paid to policy coherence, implementation in the Member States and enforcement. Finally, these NGOs would like to see stakeholder consulta- tions improved. It is important to them to be consulted also on strategic policy considerations rather than only on a narrow set of pre-determined policy choices. Moreover, they stress the importance of making sure that all stakeholders, includ- ing small ones, are reached. NGOs also ask the Commission to make questionnaires more understandable, to balance the stakeholders\u2019 input fairly in the analyses and to provide feed- back to those who participated. Business community In alphabetical order, the following organisations from the business community submitted relevant position papers: Ac- countancy Europe, Advertising Information Group, Bundesver- band der deutschen Industrie, BusinessEurope, Deutsche In- dustrie- und Handelskammertag, EuroChambers, Insurance Europe, N\u00e4ringslivets Regeln\u00e4mnd, Specialised Nutrition Eu- rope, Verband der chemischen Industrie, Zentralverband des deutschen Handwerks. There is much consensus on what would need to be improved. Many of the papers feature long lists of detailed suggestions for improvement. It should be noted that 4 of the 11 position papers from the business com- munity came from Germany. For the business community, the consultations are of great importance. The one-page position paper by Accountancy Europe represents the variety of suggestions made. Besides improving the questionnaire, as also proposed by the public authorities (see above), they pointed out that the current for- mat of the questionnaire and the lengths of response periods often make it difficult for them to consult their constituents. The members of the business community would also like to see their contributions to consultations fairly weighted and more visible in the analyses. Additionally, many of the position papers stressed that every legislative proposal, including implementing acts and delegat- ed acts, should come with an analysis of the underlying evi- dence. They also called for the co-legislators to increase their efforts to assess the impact of their amendments during the negotiations. Furthermore, several papers drew attention to the correct application of the subsidiarity and proportionality principles. A frequently mentioned issue was policy fragmentation, be- cause impact assessments do not sufficiently consider im- pacts on other policy areas. Furthermore, the business com- munity perceived impact assessments often to have a bias. They flagged that initial preferences for certain policy options should not lead to selective data selection and that the collect- ed data needs to be of high quality. The position papers stressed the importance of the \u2018evalu- ate first\u2019 principle, because it makes the European authorities more accountable. At the same time, they pointed out that evaluations are not informative if they are done too early. A few organisations noted that the quality of evaluations was still trailing behind the quality of impact assessments. Another frequently mentioned topic was the transposition by Member States, including gold-plating. Several papers asked for more transparency and suggested developing a common definition of over-implementation. The business community would also like to see efforts to further increase transparency. In particular, they would like to see the Commission publish ",
        "70 | Taking Stock of the Commission\u2019s Better Regulation Agenda draft impact assessments, so that stakeholders can already have a look at the underlying data and analysis. Additionally, almost every position paper mentioned that trilogues lacked transparency. The several respondents from the business community were of the opinion that the Regulatory Scrutiny Board should en- joy greater independence. They also regretted the fact that the Board\u2019s opinions were too often not sufficiently followed up on. Finally, businesses welcomed the REFIT Platform and cautioned the Commission not to politicise it, i.e. make policy through it. They would like the Platform\u2019s scope to be broad- ened to cross-cutting issues and they called for better fol- low-up of the Platform\u2019s opinions. The position paper from Special Nutrition Europe (SNE) pro- vided a different angle than the others. SNE was worried that deregulation, particularly in food labelling, would jeopardise the recognition of their specialised productions. For further reference, the published position papers provide many detailed suggestions regarding the Commission\u2019s better regulation system. Trade unions Two trade unions submitted position papers. The European Trade Union was highly critical of the Commission\u2019s better reg- ulation agenda. Quoting from their paper: \u201cthe \u2018Better Regula- tion\u2019 package puts the supposed needs of business above all others; turns minimum standards into maximum standards; puts a value on impact assessments that they do not have; brings a longer, costlier and more bureaucratic procedure that will risk delaying social progress; makes it more difficult for elected EU institutions to change European Commission pro- posals and could undermine the principle that EU law applies equally to all. In short, it adds red tape, slows down progres- sive change and de-democratises Europe.\u201d The Beamtenbund und Tarifunion (DBB; German association of government officials) drew attention to the importance of social protection, including health, equal chances and workers\u2019 rights. They perceived better regulation as overly focusing on reducing the burden for businesses. Research community (think tanks, academia and consultants) The European Risk Forum, Quadrant Conseil and RegWatch Europe submitted position papers that all take up a different angle to better regulation. Nonetheless, they all call on the Commission to further consolidate its better regulation efforts. The main message of RegWatch Europe\u2019s paper is to not ag- gregate analyses at EU level. In their opinion, it is more inform- ative to read what the impact on individuals and businesses would be. As a consultant carrying out evaluations, Quadrant Conseil implores the Commission to move beyond procedure and rules to create a genuine evaluation culture among its of- ficials. Paraphrasing Quadrant Conseil\u2019s words, an evaluation should not be a report, but an internal process. To this end, the consultant proposes, for example, establishing a body of eval- uators and increasing the mutual link between impact assess- ments and evaluations. It also calls for a flexible application of the rules and procedures in order to make evaluations truly useful, given the wide variety of policy areas. The European Risk Forum takes an approach opposite to the one calling for flexibility advocated by Quadrant Conseil. The Forum urges additional codification, standardisation, formal oversight and requirements to ensure that the scientific evidence and anal- yses are of the highest quality. For example, it is concerned about bias, the distinctions between fact and opinion and be- tween measured evidence and theoretical extrapolation, and applying state-of-the-art quantification methods. Additional- ly, improving risk management legislation and sophisticated risk analysis is close to their heart. Their long list of detailed suggestions includes ideas to improve the tools on sectoral competitiveness (tool #20) and research and innovation (tool #21) in the better regulation toolbox. ",
        "| 71 EU INSTITUTIONS AND CONSULTATIVE BODIES THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT 161 https://epthinktank.eu/category/publications/ In its briefings and studies in the fields of ex-ante impact as- sessment and ex-post impact evaluation, the European Par- liamentary research service (EPRS) seeks to use the European Commission\u2019s own impact assessments and evaluations as the starting-point for the analysis which it provides to parlia- mentary committees. For this and other reasons, it attaches great importance on the latter being of high quality and based on reliable data. It sees a general rise in the quality of Com- mission impact assessments over time, but expresses a wider concern in the European Parliament that too many significant proposals from the Commission have recently not been ac- companied by impact assessments. Impact assessments and regulatory scrutiny The EPRS critically analyses every major Commission impact assessment: its specialist ex-ante impact assessment unit has undertaken over 250 \u2018initial appraisals\u2019 of such texts since 2012. Its overall assessment of the quality and coherence of Commission impact assessments - reflected in annual reports 161 on the subject to the parliamentary committees - is that whilst a rising curve of quality is generally observable in the Commission\u2019s impact assessment work, with a more consist- ent use of evidence and better balance between qualitative and quantitative methodologies over time, there a still some shortcomings to be addressed. The Parliament\u2019s services have also undertaken 68 impact assessments for committees on amendments put forward to Commission legislative proposals since 2007 - seeking to work on the basis of the Commis- sion\u2019s impact assessments, wherever possible - as well as a number of substitute or supplementary impact assessments for committees. As foreseen in the Inter-Institutional Agreement on Better Law-Making and requested by the Parliament in various res- olutions, the Parliament would like at least all legislative initi- atives included in the Commission\u2019s annual work programme and/or in the joint declaration (between the Parliament, Coun- cil and the Commission) to be accompanied by an impact as- sessment, wherever possible, and to be warned early on if this is not going to be the case. This is important both for consid- eration of proposals in committee and for negotiations in tri- logues. Therefore, it is considered problematic that about one third of recent Commission proposals in such categories have come without an impact assessment, for whatever reason, with a desire for a clearer explanation of why impact assess- ments are not conducted and ideally an early warning system in such cases. The EPRS explained that parliamentary committees have ex- pressed concern that Commission impact assessments do not always fully cover the various aspects foreseen in the incep- tion impact assessment in a balanced way. They note that, in some cases, the quality of Commission impact assessments could be improved by balancing the potential economic im- pacts of an initiative with a more systematic consideration of environmental, social and other impacts, and by better identi- fying potential implications for citizens. In some cases, the dif- ferent policy options and their potential effects could also be presented more clearly, whilst some impact assessments are considered to be too long and insufficiently concise as texts. When necessary, impact assessments could be updated after having passed the Regulatory Scrutiny Board to fully reflect the Commission\u2019s final legislative proposal, and underlying studies and the Board opinions could be published at the same time as the impact assessment. Evaluation and REFIT The European Parliament considers it a positive development that the Regulatory Scrutiny Board now scrutinises both im- pact assessments and evaluations, not least because the in- stitution has attached increasing importance to the evaluation of existing legislation and policy in recent years. In April 2016, the Parliament approved new internal provisions for carrying 5. 5.1. ",
        "72 | Taking Stock of the Commission\u2019s Better Regulation Agenda out Implementation Reports, and during this legislative term (2014-19), 65 such Implementation Reports have been adopt- ed - almost two and a half times as many as during the previ- ous 2009-14 term. To facilitate this work, the EPRS publishes (since 2014) \u2018rolling check-lists\u2019 that keep track of reporting requirements in EU legislation, of on-going and planned eval- uations by the Commission, and of EP policy requests to the Commission. It also drafts short \u2018Implementation Appraisals\u2019, analysing the state of implementation of selected legislation, and longer \u2018European Implementation Assessments\u2019 (EIAs), which provide an analytical base for the Implementation Re- ports produced by parliamentary committees. This material not only looks at general issues arising in implementation, but explores how far the Parliament\u2019s own objectives have been met and any other issues reflecting its Members\u2019 concerns. Such texts usually take full account of Commission evaluations and of data provided by the Commission, although questions of data availability and quality are sometimes of concern. The EPRS suggests applying clearer quality criteria, in particular for non-governmental data, together with a greater prioritisa- tion of data collection methods used by the Commission. More widely, the Parliament and its committees have called on the Commission to give the institution greater access to data it may hold - such as information relating to pre-infringement procedures and on Member States\u2019 transposition measures and explanatory documents - and also requested it to indi- cate more clearly when Member States introduce additional administrative requirements or other elements unrelated to EU legislation, or set higher standards that go beyond EU-wide minimum standards. On REFIT, the Parliament would like the Commission\u2019s annual work programme to seek to identify REFIT evaluations and in- itiatives that could be agreed in the joint declaration (between the Parliament, Council and the Commission) each year. The scoreboard published by the Commission in respect of the REFIT element of the Commission\u2019s programme is considered useful, although the schedule foreseen is not always followed and proposals are often delayed. There is also thought to be scope for improvement in the quantification of the reduction in regulatory burdens and potential savings. Consultation The European Parliament has strengthened its attempts to consult with national parliaments on legislative issues, al- though it has so far received only limited feedback on the practical experience of applying EU legislation in the Mem- ber States. It has welcomed the commitment made by the Commission, before adopting a proposal, to consult widely - in particular with SMEs, civil society and other end-users - but considers that the Commission should focus on consultation before the adoption of a proposal, and not to continue any public consultation during the legislative process itself, since during this phase, it is for the Parliament and Member States to carry out their own consultations, if they choose to. THE GENERAL SECRETARIAT OF THE COUNCIL On 11 January 2019, a delegation from the General Secretari- at of the Council (referred to as \u2018the General Secretariat of the Council\u2019 or \u2018GSC\u2019) visited the Commission\u2019s Secretariat-General to informally exchange views in the context of the better reg- ulation stocktaking exercise. The officials from the GSC had consulted some of the sectoral departments of the General Secretariat for an overview of the strengths and weaknesses of the current better regulation system. (The views expressed here do not commit the Council as such in any way) Impact assessments and regulatory scrutiny As the GSC only has limited capacity to carry out its own im- pact assessments, it would encourage the Commission to fur- ther strengthen the quality of its impact assessments, notably by increasing their readability and working on the executive summaries. Additionally, they remarked that the Commission could pay more attention and focus on the effects of certain legislative proposals at Member State level. The GSC found that the impact assessments provided a lot of relevant information that facilitated agreement and increased the efficiency of the legislative process. They acknowledged that the use of impact assessments across working parties and presidencies varied. This depended among others on the policy area and the political sensitivity of the file. The GSC also clarified that the working parties were free to choose their approach to impact assessments, but that the working party chairpersons usually read them closely. The GSC found the impact assessments generally thorough and of high quality, but also flagged that they were lengthy. 5.2. ",
        "| 73 Hence, the executive summary was of utmost importance. Furthermore, they would like to see better justifications of the options and, in some cases, more analysis at Member State level, as mentioned before. The GSC also pointed out that the legislative proposals were not always consistent with the im- pact assessments. Additionally, the GSC preferred the pres- entation of the available underlying evidence even if it was not possible to present it as an impact assessment. The GSC reported that they had built up capacity to carry out im- pact assessments on their own. This capacity is very small and meant as a last resort. Preferably, the Member States should carry out the impact assessments for the major amendments they propose. Any analytical work to be carried out by the Coun- cil would be heavily based on the preceding work done by the Commission and the European Parliament. So far, the GSC\u2019s ca- pacity remains untested, because it has not yet received either an eligible request for an impact assessment or there was no simple majority support for an impact assessment in the Council. Evaluations The GSC stressed the importance of obeying the \u2018evaluate first\u2019 principle and pointed out that timing is very important for evaluations. The GSC regretted that it is difficult to gather information from national and regional authorities, which re- sults in interest groups having disproportionately loud voices. The GSC suggested there should be more awareness raising about opportunities for participation and such participation should be made less resource-intensive. The GSC observed that the quality of evaluations was inferi- or to that of impact assessments. Especially, it found the re- search design poor and would like to see the structure of eval- uations improved. Additionally, the GSC was of the view that based on experience, the Regulatory Scrutiny Board helped to increase the quality of evaluations. The GSC therefore sup- ported the idea of seeing the Board\u2019s involvement expanded. Subsidiarity and proportionality The GSC has observed an increase in the request for subsidi- arity and proportionality in legal assessments since the Lisbon Treaty. In the GSC\u2019s view ( based on feedback from its ser- vices), the high quality of the Commission\u2019s analyses in this respect was of great importance to the GSC\u2019s services. How- ever, presently, as far as subsidiarity and proportionality are concerned, it is only possible to find a very short assessment on those aspects in the Commission\u2019s Memoranda of Under- standing. In particular, it would be essential for the Commis- sion\u2019s analysis to cover all viable policy options. Additionally, the GSC suggested doing a more in-depth analysis on sub- sidiarity issues for politically sensitive files (especially in poli- cy areas where, within the Council, unanimity is still required for decision-making on issues such as taxation, for example.). Finally, the GSC thought that the Commission should refrain from using standard sentences in the subsidiarity and propor- tionality analysis, especially in the executive summary, as this did not bring any added value. THE COUNCIL WORKING GROUP ON COMPETITIVENESS AND GROWTH In response to the consultation with the Council\u2019s Working Group on Competitiveness and Growth (COMPRCO), Estonia, Germany, Ireland, Poland and Spain submitted written contri- butions. They appreciated impact assessments considerably, because they help them understand the Commission\u2019s thinking and help them communicate with national stakeholders. Addi- tionally, several Member States valued the impact assessments as a basis for their own analyses. Hence, most of them stat- ed that it is of great importance for all legislative proposals to come with impact assessments and for amendments to be assessed as well. They also stressed the need to better assess the impact on individual Member States, which according to one Member State would facilitate negotiations. Regarding impact assessments and evaluations, Estonia, Germany, Ireland, Po- land and Spain acknowledged their increasing quality but asked for shorter, more readable documents, a more consistent appli- cation of methodologies and an analysis of (macroeconomic) impacts (GDP, export, jobs) rather than output (patents, papers). These Member States suggested that consultations should be more representative, that national, regional and local govern- ments should be consulted more (for example, through the Com- mittee of the Regions), and that individuals who do not speak English or do not have internet access should be included. Estonia proposed an automated analysis of responses to online consulta- tions that would be available online directly. Poland also proposed giving more attention to non-governmental organisations. Finally, two Member States called for a reduction of targets or a one-in/one-out mechanism to reduce bureaucracy. 5.3. ",

In addition, views were exchanged with the officials of the CoR. Their main concern is to increase the participation of regional and local authorities in policy development and in the assessment of legislation\u2019s impact on the regions, including the administra- tive burden placed on their authorities. End of 2018, the CoR launched its network of regional hubs, as an additional source of feedback, to assess EU policy implementation at local and regional level. Impact assessments and scrutiny In its opinions, the CoR made proposals to improve impact as- sessments. In particular, impact assessments should explore the territorial dimension of major policy options and the ef- fects of legislation on the administrative burden for local and regional authorities. Good examples of successful territorial impact assessments undertaken by the CoR, as pointed out by the officials of the CoR, include the UK\u2019s withdrawal from the EU, the European Regional Development Fund after 2020 and the Urban Agenda. The CoR uses the information provided in impact assessments as a technical basis for background notes and political fiches to inform the political level. Based on the Commission\u2019s roadmap, the CoR identifies five priority areas per year, for which which they conduct territorial impact assessments. In the last 2 years some of these were conducted with the Commission\u2019s Directorate-General for Re- gional and Urban Policy, with the CoR providing the Commis- sion with input for impact assessments. Nonetheless, in most cases the Commission does not involve the CoR at an early stage of the impact assessment process. The officials of the CoR underlined they would prefer to be involved at an earlier stage of the process, as made possible by the CoR-Commis- sion cooperation agreement, in order to flag territorial dimen- sion aspects. The officials of the CoR also pointed to the lack of regional data, which limits a clear assessment of territorial impacts in some areas. The officials of the CoR welcomed the Regulatory Scrutiny Board\u2019s independent scrutiny and acknowledged that impact assessments were scrutinised for including an analysis of the territorial impact. However, they asked for more regional competence within the Board and more effort on scrutinising territorial impact assessments. Evaluation and REFIT In its opinions, the CoR welcomed the stronger role of evalu- ations and the introduction of REFIT to support simplification and regulatory cost reductions without compromising poli- cy objectives. Their officials find that REFIT sets an essential focus by assessing whether implementation is practical and feasible. In the CoR\u2019s view, the REFIT Platform should focus on specific issues within EU legislation and take a more ambitious approach, i.e. aiming for structural improvements to the EU regulatory framework in the medium-term. The officials of the CoR found that the highly technical level of submissions to the REFIT Platform made it difficult for the CoR to contribute with- in the short timeframes. Additionally, broader themes would facilitate input from local and regional government. The offi- cials suggested that the REFIT Platform be involved in REFIT evaluations and agreed with the proposals put forward in the \u2018Commission Communication on the principles of subsidiarity and proportionality\u2019 163 to give local and regional authorities a greater presence within the Platform and to widen its focus to address subsidiarity, proportionality, legislative density and the role of local and regional authorities in implementing EU law. The officials of the CoR recognised that the Commission had come a long way in its evaluation of legislation, which is more systematically covered, although not to the same degree in all areas. However, they were of the opinion that the timing needed improvement, as evaluations come too late, notably evaluations of spending programmes whose purpose is es- sentially to inform decisions for the next cycle of multiannual frameworks. 5.4.

        "| 75 The CoR has initiated a network of regional hubs in response to the \u2018Task force on subsidiarity, proportionality and do- ing less more efficiently\u2019 which presented its conclusions in 2018 164 . During a two-year pilot phase, 20 core regions and an additional number of associate regions will provide sys- tematic information and feedback on the implementation of EU legislation at local and regional level, which is shared with EU institutions. Consultation In its opinions the CoR supported the actions introduced in 2015 to improve stakeholder consultations. The CoR insisted in its opinions that the Commission and the other institutions should involve regions and local authorities more actively when designing legislation. Their experience in applying EU rules is valuable for assessing the impact of legislation or de- vising ways to implement policies. Specifically, the CoR asked for a specific set of consultations of regional and local legisla- tive assemblies during the Commission\u2019s policy development. The CoR would like to be involved in their role as consultative body and not as stakeholder. Therefore, they do not participate in public consultations as a rule. 164 https://europa.eu/!Bg68tX 165 Opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee on the Communication from the Commission to the European Parliament, the Council, the European Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions \u2212 Completing the Better Regulation Agenda: Better solutions for better results (2018/C 262/04) OJ C 262, 25.7.2018, p.22 Opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee on \u2018Analysis of transparency, methodology and resources of impact assessments and evaluations that the European Commission is launching to improve the quality of European legislation\u2019(2017/C 434/02) OJ C 434, 15.12.2017, p. 11 Opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee on the \u2018Evaluation of European Commission stakeholder consultations\u2019 (2015/C 383/09) OJ C 383, 17.11.2015, p. 57 Opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee on REFIT (exploratory opinion) (2016/C 303/06) OJ C 303, 19.8.2016, p. 45 According to the CoR officials, an inherent self-selection of respondents in the public consultation results in sets of re- sponses with high degrees of bias. The timing of consultations can be challenging, such as the quick consultation on the pro- posals for the multiannual financial framework, making the response by regions and other stakeholders difficult. Hence, they did not find public consultations a good source of data and evidence. The number of respondents should not be the only benchmark for the success of consultations. There is a strong legitimacy between input and output. This means that providing the tar- get group most affected by new EU legislation (e.g. regions) with meaningful input in the consultation also increases the motivation of these players to comply with the regulation once adopted or once revised. According to the CoR, the regional hubs pilot scheme with 20 regions and an additional number of associate regions will help increase the input from regional authorities and their re- gional stakeholders. Participating regions have committed to reply systematically and several times per year to question- naire consultations on the implementation of EU legislation at local and regional level. THE EUROPEAN ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL COMMITTEE The European Economic and Social Committee (EESC) has ex- pressed its views on better regulation in several opinions 165 . In addition, an exchange of views took place between offi- cials of the Secretariat-General of the Commission and three members of the European Economic and Social Committee on 15 January 2019. Overall, the EESC welcomed the better regulation agenda, which in their view should become a permanent programme in delivering high-quality Union legislation without undermin- ing key policy objectives or creating deregulation pressure. Ac- cording to the EESC, it should be continued, further developed and improved by the new Commission after 2019. The EESC stressed the importance of covering the whole life cycle of legislation and in particular its applicability, which needed to be ensured from the start and monitored at the implemen- tation stage. 5.5.

        "76 | Taking Stock of the Commission\u2019s Better Regulation Agenda Impact assessments and scrutiny The EESC considered impact assessments useful, but the focus on assessing cost must not come at the expense of the assessment of possible benefits that are not as easy to quantify. The EESC encouraged a broader view of the Commission\u2019s impact assess- ments, i.e. they should consider a wider set of options in detail. The EESC considered it important that the European Council and the European Parliament shared the responsibility of en- suring better regulation, especially when it comes to assessing the impacts of amendments, not least also in keeping with the recommendations from the European Court of Auditors. They suggested that the three institutions should have a shared methodology for impact assessments and an agreed scope. The better regulation agenda including the Regulatory Scrutiny Board was highly appreciated. The Board has a crucial role, in the EESC\u2019s view. Because of its neutrality and know-how, it adds considerably to the credibility of the Commission\u2019s proposals. The EESC regretted that the Board is not well known outside the European institutions and bodies in Brussels. According to them, a Regulatory Scrutiny Board that is more visible in European capitals could help increase the credibility of the Commission\u2019s legislative proposals and impact assessments. Additionally, the EESC would like to discuss methodological issues with the Regulatory Scrutiny Board. Evaluation and REFIT The EESC firmly supports the \u2018evaluate first\u2019 principle and is ac- tively involved in better regulation, notably through its partici- pation in the drafting of ex post evaluations. The EESC deemed monitoring of application on the ground to be essential in order to create a legal framework that enabled businesses and individuals to benefit from the advantages of the internal market and to avoid unnecessary administrative burdens. The EESC subscribed to a REFIT programme that in their view must lead to neither deregulation nor reducing the level of protection of social, environmental or fundamental rights. European legislation is an essential factor in integration, and, when proportionate, it is an important guarantee of protection, promotion and legal certainty for all European stakeholders and citizens. But it is essential to avoid needless regulatory costs. The EESC is participating in the REFIT Platform. While recog- nising the progress made by the REFIT Platform in simplify- ing existing legislation, the EESC proposed that the Platform\u2019s mandate could be extended to not only look at burden reduc- tion but also at improving the legislation, which may include the need for new legislation. Finally, the EESC found that the REFIT Platform did not adequately reflect in its composition the weight that the EESC actually carries by representing civil society. Consultation The EESC supported the comprehensive involvement of stake- holders by performing consultations throughout the lifecycle of a political initiative, because it is crucial to consider already at the drafting stage that legislation is easy for Member States and stakeholders to implement. It recognised the progress made on consultation under the better regulation agenda. Nonetheless, the EESC would like to see more and better in- teraction with stakeholders and the general public who are affected by proposed legislation. To this effect, the EESC would like to contribute more to identifying relevant stakeholders and disseminating information about consultations to relevant organisations and groups. This would help to ensure that rele- vant players are aware of the consultation and the possibility to contribute. ",
        "| 77 EUROPEAN COMMISSION OFFICIALS IMPACT ASSESSMENT Commission officials strongly supported the concept of evi- dence-based policymaking. Overall, they found that the pro- cess of writing an impact assessment provides a good, sys- tematic preparation for later negotiations and communication about the Commission\u2019s proposals. Some Commission officials were of the opinion that the impact assessment report has to satisfy competing demands of efficient communication and providing evidence on often complex topics. Others were con- cerned whether the resources required to prepare an impact assessment were proportionate to the benefits and the often limited use in the co-legislative process. Commission officials were of the opinion that the absence of impact assessments needs to be justified much better, for example in the explanatory memorandum or even in a press release, but they preferred not having an impact assessment over having one of low quality. The quality of analyses presented in impact assessments is often limited by the availability of relevant information. Com- mission officials drew attention to the difficulties they have in gathering reliable, comprehensive data and in applying meth- odologies coherently and transparently across a wide variety of policy fields and across all Member States. EVALUATION Commission officials acknowledged that evaluations are use- ful for learning about the functioning of EU interventions and can help gain new insights when well timed, for example, when the policy has been implemented for a while, and its re- sults and impacts can be meaningfully assessed. Commission officials had mixed views about the \u2018evaluate first\u2019 principle. Some argued that it is intuitive and logical as it closes the policy cycle. Others suggested deciding on the need for evalu- ations on a case-by-case basis. Some Commission officials called for a flexible application of the rules and procedures to make evaluations more meaning- ful, given the wide variety of policy areas that evaluations cover. There were mixed views about whether the Commission should conduct evaluations internally or involve external con- tractors or other institutions. Commission officials shared the view that conducting the evaluation internally allows in-house expertise to be built up and used more. Some officials were sceptical about the quality of the work and services provided by contractors. The issue of limited resources for conducting the evaluation internally was also a concern. On quantification, a number of Commission officials thought that the lack of appropriate data is the most important prob- lem affecting the quality of evaluations. Comparable EU-wide data are often not available and this makes it difficult to quantify impacts. Commission officials noted that there is a trade-off between the pressure to reduce the administrative burden of systematic monitoring in the original proposal and the availability of evidence when it comes to the evaluation. 6. 6.1. 6.2.

        "78 | Taking Stock of the Commission\u2019s Better Regulation Agenda CONSULTATION Commission officials considered stakeholder consultation as being essential for transparency and accountability purposes. Nonetheless, they shared the view that public consultation can in some cases, particularly in evaluations, be a time-consum- ing and resource-intensive process with limited value when it comes to the quality and quantity of evidence provided by participants. THE REGULATORY SCRUTINY BOARD The interviews showed that Commission officials think highly of the Board\u2019s work. Several officials saw the Board hearing as a rehearsal for the negotiations with co-legislators and as practice to explain their proposal to non-experts. Some Commission officials expressed concerns that the Board\u2019s demands for additional analysis and information are not proportionate to the specific initiative. Additionally, Commission staff worried that the Board does not apply its standards consistently (such as its demands for quantified in- formation). Some officials were of the opinion that too many published impact assessments and evaluations remain of un- satisfactory quality. THE REFIT PROGRAMME, PLATFORM AND SCOREBOARD Commission officials recognised that the REFIT programme and Platform are important for communication purposes. However, they thought that a separate process such as the REFIT Platform is not needed, because the REFIT approach is now a mainstream part of the policy cycle and evaluations are improving. On the REFIT Scoreboard, the officials who were interviewed suggested using more qualitative examples or case studies to illustrate impacts of legislation. Moreover, they suggested being more open about which burdens and benefits can and cannot be quantified. 6.3. 6.4. 6.5. ",

The REFIT Platform decided that it would contribute to the Commission\u2019s better regulation stocktaking exercise. The Plat- form\u2019s Secretariat prepared a dedicated survey to collect the views of the Platform\u2019s members on how the Platform has fulfilled its purpose and contributed to the Commission\u2019s bet- ter regulation agenda. The survey was circulated on 2 July. Members had 12 weeks to send in their contributions (until 20 September 2018). Of the Platform\u2019s 47 members (28 in the government group and 19 in the stakeholder group), 34 sent contributions (20 from the government group and 14 from the stakeholder group). The Secretariat compiled the contributions, presenting aggre- gated findings from the survey and including a synthesis of proposals for future improvements. The stakeholder group agreed in its meeting on 29 June to set up a working group to consider the findings. The working group prepared a recom- mendation to identify the consensual or more complex issues. The Platform as a whole agreed this recommendation at its meeting on 14 March. In the opinion the REFIT Platform members recognize that the Platform has provided a valuable contribution to the REFIT agenda and recommends its continuation with the Stakeholder group and the Government group. The Stakeholders and the Government group proposed detailed suggestions on possible improvements. The Committee of the Regions also annexed its opinion 166 . TASK FORCE ON SUBSIDIARITY, PROPORTIONALITY AND DOING LESS MORE EFFICIENTLY The \u2018Task force on subsidiarity, proportionality and doing less more efficiently\u2019 submitted its report to President Juncker on 10 July 2018 167 . The report contains nine recommendations to bring about a new way of working to achieve \u2018active subsidi- arity\u2019 and greater involvement of local and regional authorities in the Union\u2019s policymaking. Several of the task force\u2019s rec- ommendations have an impact on the Commission\u2019s better regulation policy and have been considered in the stocktaking exercise. On 23 October 2018, the Commission already set out in broad terms how it would respond to the task force 168 . 7. 7.1. 7.2. ",
