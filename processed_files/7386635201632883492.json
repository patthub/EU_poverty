        "General information Coverage This short guide shows information for the EU, the euro area, the EU Member States and three EFTA countries. The euro area (EA-17) is composed of: Belgium, Germany, Estonia, Ireland, Greece, Spain, France, Italy, Cyprus, Luxembourg, Malta, the Netherlands, Austria, Portugal, Slovenia, Slovakia and Finland. The EU-27 includes the EA-17 countries and also: Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Latvia, Lithuania, Hungary, Poland, Romania, Sweden and the United Kingdom. The EU-28 includes the EU-27 countries and Croatia. The three EFTA countries covered are: Iceland, Norway and Switzerland. For the EU, the information presented in this short guide is based on data for the EU-28 when figures are available. Otherwise results for the EU-27 are shown. The euro area aggregate is fixed for the 17 Member States (EA-17). However, the data for inflation is based on moving aggregates that reflect the membership of the EU and euro area over time (coded EU and Euro area in the graphs). Quarterly growth rates are expressed in relation to the previous quarter. Quarterly rates are generally calculated using seasonally adjusted data, although rates for the government surplus, deficit and debt and long-term unemployment are based on non seasonally adjusted data. Furthermore, annual rates of change for inflation are also based on non seasonally adjusted data. Symbols and abbreviations : not available Figures in italics are estimates, provisional or forecasts Extraction date Data were extracted on 31 October 2013. The next edition (extraction planned: 31 January 2014) will be issued in February 2014. The most recent data is available at http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/ portal/page/portal/statistics/search_database Data codes The Eurostat online data code, which is given at the bottom of each column of data in the tables and as part of the source for figures, provides users with a quick and efficient way of accessing the most up- to-date statistics. When used through the \u2018search\u2019 facility of Eurostat\u2019s website, each data code directs users to the corresponding dataset offering the freshest data and longer time-series. ",

        "Eurostat, the statistical office of the European Union Eurostat\u2019s mission is to be the leading provider of high quality statistics on Europe. Eurostat publishes official, harmonised statistics on the European Union (EU) and the euro area which offer an objective portrayal of social and economic trends. These statistics are available for EU Member States, and are sometimes broken down by region. Furthermore, some of the indicators are published for candidate countries and other non-member countries. Eurostat collects data from national statistical institutes; the statistics are harmonised according to Europe-wide methodologies. Data are, therefore, genuinely comparable across the whole of the EU. Website Eurostat\u2019s website: http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat provides free access to EU statistics, and is also available in German and French. Statistics Explained is a wiki-based system that presents statistical topics in an easy to understand way. Together, the articles make up an encyclopaedia of European statistics and can be accessed at: http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/statistics_explained. There one can also access online publications Eurostat yearbook , Regional yearbook , The EU in the world , Statistics in focus and other publications. Eurostat releases a range of publications, all of which are free of charge on its website in PDF format; some of these are also available in German and French. Among these, the pocketbook Key figures on Europe 2012 provides a comprehensive set of information introducing readers to most statistical themes that are covered by Eurostat.
