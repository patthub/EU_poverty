At this C2C, which inter alia focused on infrastructure financing in Africa, the Secretariat of the EU-Africa Infrastructure Trust Fund organised, with the support of the EU Delegation to the AUC in Addis Ababa and the Africa Union Commission, a side event on the activities of the ITF. The final beneficiaries of two projects reported on the impact and value added of ITF grant support. ",
        "3 2012 Annual Report EU-Africa Infrastructure Trust Fund The EU-Africa ITF The EU-Africa Infrastructure Trust Fund (ITF) is an in- strument of the wider EU-Africa Infrastructure Part- nership. The Trust Fund aims to increase investment in regional infrastructure in Africa by blending long- term loan financing with grant resources from the European Commission and EU Member States. The sectors covered by the Trust Fund are energy, water, transport and communications/telecoms. Financial support can be provided in four differ- ent forms: interest rate subsidies (IRS), technical as- sistance (TA), direct grants (DG) for the financing of environmental or social components of a project and insurance premiums (IP) as a risk mitigation mechanism. The Governance structure consists of the following organs: The Steering Committee , which was estab- lished in October 2007 in Addis Ababa. Its purpose is to provide strategic advice to the Executive Com- mittee of the Trust Fund. It is composed of an equal number of representatives from the European Union (EU) and the African Union (AU) (29 each). The Executive Committee of Donors , which is the decision-making body of the Trust Fund. It ITF Executive Committee The governing body of the Trust Fund examines and decides on Grant requests Project Financiers Group Informal professional group: identifies, discusses Grant Operations and submits requests to the Executive Committee Project Promoters Requests for project financing EU-Africa Infrastructure Partnership Steering Committee Provides strategic guidelines Submission of Grant Requests ITF Secretariat Assistance to the Executive Committee ITF Manager EIB \u2013 responsible for treasury and accounting includes three categories of members: (i) the voting participants, i.e. the donors (European Commission and 12 EU Member States); (ii) the non-voting par- ticipants, i.e. EU Member States, which are not yet donors; (iii) the European Investment Bank (EIB), as Manager of the Trust Fund, and the Secretariat of the Trust Fund, both of which have a non-voting status. As the governing body of the Trust Fund, the Execu- tive Committee is respon sible for all key decisions. The Project Financiers Group (PFG) , which brings together the financial institutions that have each been nominated by a donor, as well as ex- perts from the Commission. All grant requests are first discussed by the PFG and only then submitted to the Executive Committee for approval. The Trust Fund Manager (the EIB), which is responsible for the financial management, account- ing and treasury operations of the ITF. The Secretariat , which assists the Executive Committee. The Secretariat attends all Executive Committee and PFG meetings, as well as meetings of other African infrastructure fora. It co-ordinates, therefore, the overall ITF governance process and acts as a permanent contact centre for stakehold- ers interested in ITF activities. ",
        "From a macro-economic perspective, Sub-Saharan Africa continues to outperform many regions and countries in the world, with a growth rate of 5.3% in 2012 that is expected to rise to 5.6% in 2013 1 and then to an average of around 6% a year over the next decade 2 . 4 Annual Report EU-Africa Infrastructure Trust Fund 2012 from the Commission and the EU Member States, now numbering 12, which in turn mobilise and lev- erage long-term investments from the EIB, other financial institutions in the EU and the African De- velopment Bank. The following pages of this Annu- al Report provide details of the 74 grant operations and EUR 380 million which have been approved over the last five years and which are expected, based on current trends, to mobilise investments of 13 times the value of the grant funding. The Commission\u2019s decision in 2012 to become actively involved in the UN\u2019s Year of Sustainable Energy for All (SE4All) and make it a top priority will have a direct impact on the ITF. The SE4All ini- tiative pursues three interlinked objectives to be achieved by 2030: (i) to ensure universal access to modern energy services; (ii) to double the rate of improvement in energy efficiency; and (iii) to dou- ble the share of renewables in the global energy mix. As a concrete commitment to these objec- tives, the Commission made an additional contri- bution of EUR 329 million to the ITF, specifically dedicated to projects eligible under SE4All. T hese figures are encouraging and indicate progress in reducing poverty, but they are av- erages on a continent rich in contrasts, and significant challenges remain on the road to de- velopment at both the macro and micro levels. Among the key challenges is the deficit in infra- structure that determines and drives all human economic activities, from agriculture to financial services, and in the areas of housing, healthcare, culture and education, etc. which cannot exist and flourish without roads, water, power and means of communication. This critical role that infrastructure plays in promot- ing regional integration and economic and social development is the reason why, in 2007, the Com- mission, together with nine EU Member States and the European Investment Bank, launched the EU- Africa ITF as an innovative blending instrument aimed at stimulating investment in regional infra- structure in Sub-Saharan Africa in the four key sec- tors of energy, transport, water and sanitation and ICT (Information and Communications Technology).

        "8 Annual Report EU-Africa Infrastructure Trust Fund 2012 March 2012 During the fourth meeting of the Steering Committee of the Africa-EU Infrastructure Part- nership in Addis Ababa, it was agreed that \u201cthe in- stitutional status and place of the Africa-EU Infra- structure Partnership should be examined in the framework of the review of the overall institution- al structure of the Joint EU-Africa Strategy (JEAS). Until then, a reference group should ensure the exchange of information, knowledge-sharing and ITF 2012 Highlights coordination between the sectors of transport, en- ergy, ICT and trans-boundary water\". This reference group, which will be composed of nominees from the different partnerships, will develop and identify areas where the European Union could contribute, through knowledge-sharing, to accelerating the programme's implementation and the fulfilment of its objectives. A full review of the partnership struc- ture is scheduled for 2013. At the same time, the Steering Committee welcomed the adoption by the African Heads of State and Government on 30 January 2012 of the Programme for Infrastructure Development in Afri- ca (PIDA). The PIDA is considered to be a milestone in the work to achieve consensus on African infra- structure sector priorities. 60% of the projects cur- rently supported by the ITF are identified PIDA pro- jects and programmes. The Steering Committee also welcomed the initiative launched by UN Secretary-General Ban Ki Moon on Sustainable Energy for All (SE4ALL) aimed, in particular, at increasing access to modern, afford- able and sustainable energy services. The ITF will support this initiative through a Climate Change Window earmarked for energy projects that qualify under the SE4ALL eligibility criteria. July 2012 A mid-term evaluation of the ITF was com- pleted by external consultants. The recommenda- tions from this evaluation were discussed by the Executive Committee and a Fiche Contradictoire was drawn up, identifying specific actions to be undertaken by the ITF, for example expanding the use of risk mitigation products and providing an updated and more detailed version of the logical framework.

        "9 2012 Annual Report EU-Africa Infrastructure Trust Fund ITF 2012 Highlights September 2012 Adoption by the ITF Executive Committee of a framework for ITF support for intermediated loans. Intermediated loans typically involve lines of credit to an intermediary financial institution which subsequently \"on-lends\" the funds to the fi- nal beneficiaries, both public and private promot- ers. The advantages of intermediated lending are: (i) financing of small and medium-sized projects, which would otherwise be precluded due to re- source constraints and lack of scale and outreach, and (ii) closer collaboration with African regional development banks and the private sector. June and December 2012 The ITF Executive Committee approved grant sup- port for two innovative facilities that will help cat- alyse the financing of renewable energy projects and energy-efficiency projects: The objective of the Africa Sustainable Ener- gy Facility is to increase the role of the private sec- tor (notably through local financial intermediaries) in financing renewable energy and energy-efficien- cy activities. Smaller projects usually fail to attract funding from international financing institutions and are more efficiently dealt with by local financial intermediaries. Specific projects supported under this scheme will be reported to the ITF. The Africa Energy Guarantee Fund (AEGF) is being developed to address the lack of adequate risk-mitigation products, which would leverage in- surance, re-insurance and banking sector expertise for eligible energy projects in Africa. The EIB is cur- rently undertaking the requisite feasibility studies, financed by the ITF, to identify the nature and ex- tent of the gap and to propose solutions for effec- tive risk mitigation under SE4All.

        "10 Annual Report EU-Africa Infrastructure Trust Fund 2012 D uring the past decade, it has become clear that climate change is a global problem, af- fecting and concerning all of us. Africa has been identified as one of the regions most vulner- able to climate change while contributing very lit- tle, itself, to global warming. The continent will be affected in terms of food security, sustainable wa- ter supply and extreme weather phenomena such Fighting Against Climate Change as floods and desertification. In addition, develop- ing countries often have the least capacity for deal- ing with the consequences of global warming. Climate change poses economic and social threats for developing countries. Communities and their economies are increasingly under pressure as a result of land degradation and falling crop yields. ",
        "11 2012 Annual Report EU-Africa Infrastructure Trust Fund Fighting Against Climate Change The challenges that Africa is facing require timely and appropriate measures that, in turn, call for a significant amount of resources. This is where the EU-Africa ITF comes into its own. By funding and investing in infrastructure projects, the ITF assists and supports Africa with its adaptation and miti- gation efforts. As global warming is largely attributed to the in- crease in greenhouse gases emitted by human ac- tivities, in particular the burning of fossil fuels (coal, oil and gas), investing in renewable energy has be- come an indispensable complement to climate change mitigation. This also helps to ensure that African countries are \u201cstuck\u201d with increasingly ex- pensive and potentially unsustainable power-gen- eration infrastructure based on fossil fuels. In 2012, at \u201cRio+20\u201d, the United Nations Conference on Sus- tainable Development, the heads of state and gov- ernment of most countries in the world decided that a green economy is one of the primary tools for achieving sustainable development. With its untapped natural resources, Africa is ideally placed to develop new technologies and renewable en- ergy projects, while the ITF is well equipped to support capacity building and provide renew able energy and energy-efficiency technologies and assistance. Two recent examples of the ITF\u2019s sup- port for renewable energy projects are: the Africa Sustainable Energy Facility, which aims to increase the role of the private sector in financing climate change activities, and the Africa Energy Guarantee Fund, which has been developed as one of the key European responses to the Sustainable Energy for All initiative (SE4All). Both grants were approved in 2012. As a follow-up to the announcement by EC Com- missioners Piebalgs, Hedegaard and Fule, at the 2010 UN Climate Change Conference in Cancun, that \u201cClimate Change Windows\u201d (CCWs) would be created in all EU regional investment facilities, the ITF\u2019s Executive Committee decided to introduce an equivalent tracking system for climate change- related projects that receive ITF support. Under the CCWs, projects are tracked according to their mitigation and/or adaptation objectives: Rio Marker 0 no climate change objectives are targeted by the project. Rio Marker 1 climate mitigation/ adaptation is among the objectives of the project. Rio Marker 2 climate mitigation/ adaptation is the principal objective of the project. Results Out of the 17 ITF approved grants in 2012, ten contribute to projects that support climate change mitigation/adaptation; for three of them, which support the Africa Sustainable Energy Facility and the Africa Energy Fund, it is the principal objective of the project (Rio Marker 2). In the remaining seven grant op- erations, climate mitigation/adaptation is a significant objective (Rio Marker 1) among other objectives such as supporting sustain- able development and promoting regional integration. In addition to the Rio Markers, the ITF financiers provide information on the project components that contribute to climate change mitigation and/ or adaptation and their expected impact as well as on climate change risks and potential mitiga- tion measures applied to make the project climate change resilient.

The Trust Fund was represented at the following ma- jor events in 2012: the fourth Steering Committee Meeting of the Africa-EU Infrastructure Partnership in Addis Ababa in March, the Global Energy Confer- ence \u2013 Focus on Africa, held during the Africa Busi- ness Week in Germany in May and the All-Africa Energy Week in Addis Ababa in November. In addi- tion, the Secretariat also regularly produced special leaflets on events such as the signing in November 2012 of the ASECNA V project, for which the ITF has provided a TA grant. The ITF has its own website, http://www.eu-africa- infrastructure-tf.net/ , which is used both as a tool for providing general information for the public at large, as well as a channel for distributing restricted documentation to selected stakeholders. The web- site experienced a positive trend in both the number of individual visitors, which increased by 25% com- pared to 2011, and the pages viewed in 2012. The ITF, as a blending mechanism, will continue to ensure the visibility of European development as- sistance in Africa through its activities in the future. ITF Visibility ",

The port plays a vital role in the Mauritian economy as it accounts for 2% of GDP and handles all mari- time traffic for the island. This extension will make the port one of the major players in the region and it will contribute to the economic integration of the Indian Ocean region by enhancing inter-island shipping and inter-island trade between the mem- ber states of the Indian Ocean Commission. The DG The direct grant of EUR 3 million from the ITF (to be implemented by AFD) to the Mauritius Ports Author ity (MPA) will be used to mitigate the ad- verse environmental and social impacts of the project: for example, through the construction of a rock bund to contain the sediment, the deploy- ment of silt screens to protect the coral colonies and the creation of a mooring facility as one of a series of compensatory measures for the fisher- men. The grant will strengthen MPA\u2019s efforts to conserve the port environment and develop Port Louis as a \"green port\". The finance agreement was signed on 26 October 2012.

        "20 Annual Report EU-Africa Infrastructure Trust Fund 2012 Itezhi-Tezhi Hydropower and Transmission Line Project The project The Itezhi-Tezhi Hydropower Project (ITT) can be divided into two components: First, there is the construction of a new 120 MW hy- dropower plant on the Kafue River in Zambia. Sec- ond, there is the development of the new transmis- sion line (of approximately 300 km) via Mumbwa and on to Lusaka West substation, which will connect the plant to the national grid of Zambia and through it to the Southern African Power Pool (SAPP). The attraction of the project lies in the fact that it will take advantage of existing infrastructure with the Itezhi-Tezhi dam already in operation for more than 30 years. Adding a second power station will thus limit construction cost and risk as well as keeping the environmental impact low and mini- mising resettlement. The new transmission line will not only facilitate regional power trade for the ben- efit of Zambia and ultimately the whole SAPP re- gion, but also significantly contribute to infrastruc- ture development, identified by the IMF as a key area where further progress is urgently needed in order to unlock Zambia\u2019s growth potential. The Itezhi-Tezhi project complements the ITF\u2019s ap- proval for upgrading the Kafue-Livingstone trans- mission line in 2011. The Kafue-Livingstone (KL) project includes the upgrading of the existing 341 km Kafue\u2013Muzuma\u2013Livingstone transmission line from 220 to 330 kilovolts (kV).

The loan was signed in De- cember 2012. The tendering procedure for the line is expected to be finalised by mid-2013 and the project itself is expected to be completed by 2015. The TA The TA (EUR 600 000 ITT, approved in 2012 + EUR 350 000 KL, approved in 2011) will cover both the Itezhi-Tezhi and Kafue-Livingstone projects. As both ITT and KL (both transmission line pro- jects) will be implemented by the same promoter (ZESCO) within roughly the same timeframe, it has been agreed that having one joint lender\u2019s engi- neer 5 for the two projects will be more effective and administratively less burdensome. The technical as- sistance will finance the lender\u2019s engineer contract- ed by the EIB. The launch of the tender took place at the end of 2012. The tender evaluation and the signing of the service contract are expected in the first quarter of 2013. 4 Following the substantial debt relief provided under the HIPC Initiative, many low-income countries have adopted borrowing limitation policies under the Debt Sustain- ability Framework established by the IMF and the World Bank. 5 A lender\u2019s engineer is a term given to the representative of the commissioning company of a construction project.

Lake Victoria WATSAN Mwanza The project The project consists of the upgrading and exten- sion of water and sanitation facilities in the cities of Mwanza, Musoma and Bukoba and satellite towns of Mwanza, located on the shores of Lake Victo- ria, which is regarded as one of the most important trans-boundary national resources on the African Continent. It is a shared water resource for several countries (Tanzania, Kenya and Uganda) with multi- ple economic uses and the sole source of water sup- ply for many communities. Since it has been subject historically to multiple pollutants, the need to man- age this resource and the activities which impinge on its environmental sustainability has emerged as one of the key challenges in East and Northern Africa. A particularly pressing issue is the population growth in the lake zone of the East Africa Community (EAC), which has risen exponentially at seven times the Af- rican average, as the lake itself attracts people be- cause of the economic opportunities it offers. The TA The TA will assist the different water supply and sanitation authorities (WSSAs) involved in the pro- ject in planning, implementing and operating sus- tainably as well as increasing their understanding of the water quality trends of the lake. All WSSAs are faced with shortfalls in human resources and fi- nancing and require assistance for better manage- ment of billing and collection as well as improved coverage of operation and maintenance costs. The TA will also assist the updating of the utilities\u2019 busi- ness plans with a view to establishing tariffs that cover costs and contribute to the long-term finan- cial sustainability of the utilities. The TA will ensure that all measures are undertaken as part of a coor- dinated planning approach. The IRS The IRS will be granted to the Republic of Tanzania in order to comply with IMF conditionality for pub- lic borrowing in Tanzania and to reflect the social nature of the water and sanitation sector which is characterised by low financial returns. It will help to reduce the financial cost borne by the Govern- ment of Tanzania and compensate for the fact that the final beneficiaries of the project, the public wa- ter utilities, are not in a position to borrow money.

Al- though Sub-Saharan Africa has a large renewable energy potential, the resources remain to a large extent unused due to various constraints such as the lack of access to long-term financing and high development costs. The lack of electricity or its un- reliable supply is a major obstacle to economic growth in Africa. As well as promoting the use of renewable energy, the Africa Sustainable Energy Facility is designed to tackle the problem of elec- tricity shortage, thereby supporting economic development. The first loss guarantee The project will provide risk mitigation instruments (e.g. tenor extension guarantees and mezzanine/ subordinated/senior loans) to support local finan- cial intermediaries in the financing of smaller re- newable energy (RE) and energy-efficiency (EE) projects. Owing to the mitigation of the risks, the RE and EE projects will become financially viable and thus eligible for funding from local financial in- stitutions.

The four countries have been affected by civil war or civil disorder resulting in the destruction of infrastructure and a severely limited or even non-existent public electricity service. The aim of the project is to interconnect Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea with C\u00f4te d'Ivoire into the West African Power Pool (WAPP) regional electricity mar- ket. By enabling power exchanges between the four countries and providing a reliable electricity supply, the project will help to foster economic growth, and thus also improve the standard of living which is es- sential for continued stability in these countries. The IRS During the first three years following the end of the grace period of the EIB loan, the grant of up to EUR 12.5 million will be used to cover the pay- ments of capital that will be due from the Special Purpose Company (SPC) 7 under the EIB loan. This ITF support will extend the grace period of the EIB loan to 10 years in line with the terms of the loans of other co-financiers and help to limit the financial risk of the project in the early years of operation by reducing the costs that the SPC will have to face at a time when the trading through the line is expect- ed to pick up gradually.

CLSG Interconnection Project / Rural Electrification in Sierra Leone The project The rural electrification project in Sierra Leone is an integral part of the overall CLSG project (see above) and will provide social benefits to the pop- ulation living close to the line. In this case, it is es- timated that roughly 150 000 people in over 1 000 local communities will benefit from the rural electri- fication component. The project will have an overall positive effect on poverty reduction and will include the following socio-economic benefits: improved health, better water supply, better learning condi- tions for children and empowerment of women. The DG The EUR 10 million DG from the ITF will help to finance the project which consists of direct connections from the five substations in Sierra Leone as well as the use of shield wire systems and low-cost solar energy for remote and small villages that would otherwise be uneconomical to connect. The grant will, in particu- lar, fund the physical implementation of the distribu- tion network, provide meters and supply connections for the first customers. A consultant might have to be hired to monitor the implementation of the rural elec- trification component. The grant will cover a shortfall in funding for rural electrification in Sierra Leone and, by doing so, will ensure that all the countries will ben- efit equally from the CLSG project. 7 The project will be owned and implemented by a Special Purpose Company, the shareholders of which will be the national utilities of the four countries, namely \u00c9lectricit\u00e9 de Guin\u00e9e, Liberia Electricity Corporation, Sierra Leone Electricity Corporation and Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de Gestion du Patrimoine du Secteur de l\u2019\u00c9lectricit\u00e9 \u2013 SOGEPE.

ASECNA, the Agency for Aerial Navigation Safety in Africa and Madagascar, is an international public entity providing air navigation services to 17 Afri- can countries 8 to ensure safety of general air traffic in the airspace under its supervision. The moderni- sation programme includes the upgrading of many air traffic systems which are currently in operation even though they have exceeded their normal technical lives. The outdated and obsolete equip- ment reduces the reliability of ASECNA\u2019s services and increases the cost of maintenance. The project will contribute to economic develop- ment and, to some extent, to poverty reduction as air transport is an important infrastructure sector supporting economic exchanges and growth. ASECNA can be considered as a success story in terms of regional integration in Africa. For states with currently limited civil aviation facilities, re- gional integration may be the only way forward to secure cost-effective investments. In this regard, the establishment of air navigation service entities similar to ASECNA is being studied in other African regions. The TA The TA for ASECNA V has been provided in the con- text of two upcoming loans granted to ASECNA by AFD (EUR 40 million) and the EIB (EUR 40 million). Whereas the loans will be used for the upgrading of the ATC facilities, the TA will focus on internal management.

The resulting study is a comprehen- sive and detailed body of work focus- ing on a number of key components such as data collection, an economic analysis for the preparation of a preliminary generation and transmission development plan based on least- cost economic criteria, network performance and stability studies and an environmental and finan- cial analysis to identify key implementation issues and associated costs as well as the setting-up of an economically optimum development programme. The process of updating the Master Plan brought together all the stakeholders in the West African energy sector including the ECOWAS Commis- sion, the ECOWAS Regional Electricity Regulatory Authority, ministries in charge of energy, national utilities, national regulators, and funding agencies. This represented an important collaborative ef- fort and dialogue at regional level aimed at ration- al least-cost planning of priority investments that are fully consistent with national policies and will lead to the complete interconnection of ECOWAS Member States over the medium to long term. This process also provided the stakeholders with an op- portunity to revise the implementation strategy for regional priority projects, to exchange views on critical factors affecting the efficiency of the elec- tricity sub-sector and to identify the key players re- quired to ensure sustained development. The results of the study were approved for imple- mentation in February 2012 by the highest West African decision-making body, the Authority of the ECOWAS Heads of State and Government. The current WAPP Infrastructure Programme is based on the conclusions and recommendations of the updated Master Plan Study. It includes, in particular, the development of about 16 000 km of interconnection transmission lines and 7 092 MW of hydropower and 800 MW of renewable energy capacity over the period 2012 to 2025.

        "34 Annual Report EU-Africa Infrastructure Trust Fund 2012 All of us, as stakeholders of the ITF, are proud of the results achieved in 2012, as detailed in the preceding pages. With 17 grant operations approved for EUR 83 million, the Trust Fund turned in yet another strong performance, comparable to the two previous years, which brought the total number of grant operations to 74 and almost EUR 380 million in approved grants. Closing Remarks by the Chair of the Executive Committee W hat is worth highlighting is that a little over 60% of those operations are for pro- jects included in the Priority Action Plan (PAP) of the Programme for Infrastructure Develop- ment in Africa (PIDA), the multi-billion dollar initia- tive for the period up to 2040, adopted by the Af- rican Heads of State and Government at their 18 th meeting on 1 February 2012 and led by the African Union Commission, the NEPAD Secretariat and the African Development Bank. This percentage re- flects the positive correlation that exists between the Trust Fund and African priorities. Besides the operational results, the year 2012 was fruitful and productive in other areas as well. The financial resources were reinforced with sub- stantial additional funding from the Commission (EUR 329 million, dedicated to improving access to energy) and the United Kingdom (EUR 23 million), as highlighted above. The independent mid-term evaluation undertak- en by external consultants was completed in July 2012. It focused on the deployment of the Trust Fund at a programme/portfolio level, not on the assessment of individual projects. The evaluation nevertheless included in-depth field work with 82 interviews, field visits to four African countries and the review of ten projects as part of a case study analysis. The fundamental conclusion from the con- sultant is that the Trust Fund fulfils its role and de- livers results, although it is still very early in the in- frastructure development process. The conclusions and recommendations of the mid-term evaluation endorse the ITF, while identifying areas and oppor- tunities for enhancing its operation and focusing still further. The report and its conclusions and rec- ommendations were shared to a large extent with ITF stakeholders and partners in the EU and Africa with a view to garnering opinions and advice. This consultation process resulted in the Executive Com- mittee adopting a \u201croad map\u201d for the implementa- tion of some key recommendations 10 , e.g. measures to encourage greater private sector participation. The positive evaluation of the ITF by the independ- ent consultants was confirmed by similar research undertaken by the Infrastructure Consortium of Af- rica to assess project preparation in Africa 11 . For the additional funding for the SE4All initiative, certain provisions of the basic agreement governing 10 The mid-term evaluation and the \u201croad map\u201d (included in a \u201cFiche Contradictoire\u201d) are available on the ITF website. 11 http://www.icafrica.org/en/knowledge-publications/article/ica-assessment-of-project-preparation-facilities-for-africa-197/ ",
        "35 2012 Annual Report EU-Africa Infrastructure Trust Fund Closing Remarks by the Chair of the Executive Committee the Trust Fund have to be adapted and amended. The consultation between the Members of the Executive Committee will continue in 2013 with a view to reach- ing a consensus and signing a revised agreement as soon as possible. In addition, I wish to highlight that in 2012 the Trust Fund further diversified its types of financial support, by expanding the use of direct grants and also introducing risk-sharing guarantees. More- over, the Executive Committee approved a frame- work for the assessment of eligible projects using other financial intermediaries, typically local banks, Francesca Mosca Chair of the Executive Committee for on-lending to small and medium-sized projects. Extending the use of the ITF grants to local banks combined with a wider choice of financial tools is expected to broaden the ITF\u2019s reach. Several new opportunities have thus been opened up for the Trust Fund in 2013 and beyond, sup- ported by a strong pipeline amounting to about EUR 350 million in potential grant requests. The ex- perience of the ITF will also be valuable in the on- going discussions on future blending operations which the European Union may support. ",
