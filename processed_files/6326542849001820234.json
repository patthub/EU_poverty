The amount provided for is conditional, which is not acceptable, and too low to have a significant overall or territorial impact. Boosting the budget for these activities means regions will be able to take their rightful place in the next framework programme by devising medium- to long-term structural policies essential for strengthening the Union's innovation capacity.

The Horizon Europe rules permit payments to be made to third parties by a joint programme co-financed in this way, subject to the rules on Community guidelines on state aid. Reason The old debate on synergies requires a clear and comprehensive conclusion that will allow for combined financing beyond the Seal of Excellence, and for fully tapping the potential of European partnerships. However, this arrangement must also be elastic and leave regions able to react and adapt swiftly to initiatives and developments in the European ecosystem. This amendment achieves its purpose by enabling Managing Authorities to make a virtual transfer via a direct allocation to a programme co-financed by the Framework Programme.

In the event of a joint request from the Member State and local and regional authorities, a specific measure for cooperation between the Commission and these national, regional and local actors may be implemented in order to enhance the relevance of ERDF and ESF + use in the field of research and innovation, to facilitate access to the Horizon Europe programme and to strengthen synergies between the different funds and the framework programme, for example, in the new European partnerships and co-financed programmes. The Commission services and agencies responsible for the implementation of Horizon Europe will be directly involved in this scheme; II. POLICY RECOMMENDATIONS THE EUROPEAN COMMITTEE OF THE REGIONS 1. reiterates its call for a comprehensive approach to the Union\u2019s financial effort for research, training and innovation, which is currently absent from budgetary work; 2. considers that the level of resources allocated to Horizon Europe is satisfactory in the current budgetary context, and that only a major increase in the Union budget could justify a reassessment, which should then be concentrated on Pillar III and the section on Strengthening the European Research Area; 3. is concerned at the risk of inequalities growing between cities and regions that benefit hugely from the framework programme for research and innovation, and whose budgets will increase, and the others, who will suffer the consequences of the fall in cohesion policy budgets; reiterates that according to Article 174 TFEU, the Union shall develop and pursue its actions leading to the strengthening of its economic, social and territorial cohesion; warns of the inadequacy of the steps taken to close the gaps between regions in order to address the challenges, including the demographic challenge, and to promote access for all to Horizon Europe; 4. calls for genuine account to be taken of the excellence to be found throughout the EU's Member States and regions in order to improve the level of scientific excellence in Europe as a whole and not in just a few large regions and cities; ",
        "COR-2018-03891-00-00-AC-TRA (EN) 48/50 5. emphasises the progress made on taking account of local and regional innovation in Horizon Europe, but is disappointed to note the ongoing refusal to recognise the territorial roots of scientific excellence, the contribution of regional ecosystems and innovation hubs to the EU\u2019s dynamics, and the role of local and regional authorities in the planning and implementation of research and innovation policies; considers that the introduction of a formal definition of regional and innovation hubs is essential if they are to be properly taken into consideration; 6. calls strongly for the full participation of local and regional authorities in the strategic planning exercise that will guide the implementation of Horizon Europe, and for smart specialisation strategies to be taken into account in this context; 7. believes that territorial impacts should be recognised as integral components of the impact concept when it comes to evaluating the programme and projects; 8. considers it essential that the coordination needed between European, national, regional and local innovation policies is clearly spelled out and that local and regional authorities have a place in the European Innovation Council Forum; 9. fully supports new European partnerships and co-financed actions, which could become the main funding tools for trans-regional cooperation and programmes run by consortia of regional ecosystem and innovation hubs (a process to connect territories); calls for a significant proportion of the Horizon Europe programme to be implemented through these arrangements, in particular under Pillars II and III; 10. hopes that all funding harnessed to co-finance an action or action programme under Horizon Europe will be subject to the legal rules applying to this programme, in particular those concerning State aid; 11. considers it essential to provide a precise framework for the synergies between the different funds and the framework programme around a 5C principle (coherence, complementarity, compatibility, co-construction, recognition of local stakeholder collectives); emphasises the crucial importance of an effective co-construction-based approach, in particular to establish the Seal of Excellence; 12. strongly opposes the fact that the option of transferring a share of cohesion policy funds to the Horizon Europe programme should be systematically decided by the Member States; strongly urges that this option should be exercised by the relevant managing authority and that the arrangements for harnessing these funds should be decided on by agreement between that authority and the Commission, ensuring that these funds are returned to the geographical area concerned; 13. emphasises the importance and value of the support measure for the European innovation ecosystems provided for in Pillar III, calls for its budget to be substantially increased, and for this approach to be directed, in particular, towards regional ecosystems and innovation hubs; ",
