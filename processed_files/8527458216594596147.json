        "General information The European Neighbourhood Policy (ENP) \u2014 established in 2004 \u2014 reflects the European Union\u2019s (EU) wish to build on common interests with partner countries and commitment to work jointly in key priority areas, including in the promotion of democracy, rule of law, respect for human rights, and social cohesion. Through the ENP, the EU offers partner countries potential greater access to the EU\u2019s market and regulatory framework, standards and internal agencies and programmes. On 18 November 2015, the European Commission and the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy set out a joint Communication providing a \u2018Review of the European Neighbourhood Policy\u2019 (JOIN(2015) 50 final) in response to some radical changes in several of the countries that surround the EU. Eurostat aims to promote and implement the use of European and internationally recognised standards and methodology for the production of statistics necessary for developing and monitoring policy achievements across a broad range of policy areas . Eurostat contributes to the European Commission\u2019s technical assistance programmes in the ENP-East countries through encouraging best practice and the transfer of know-how through mutual contacts, training, study visits, workshops and seminars; participating in the collection, validation and dissemination of a wide range of data; assisting countries in the process of harmonisation to the European Statistical System (ESS)/international standards. The ENP countries and Eurostat exchange a wide range of harmonised indicators on a voluntary, annual basis. Symbols and abbreviations : not available \u2013 not applicable Billion 1 000 million Figures in italics are estimates or provisional. Extraction date Data were extracted on 17 and 18 December 2018. Data codes Eurostat online data codes, which are given in the source under each table, provide users with a quick and efficient way to access the most up-to-date statistics. When entered in the \u2018search\u2019 facility on Eurostat\u2019s website, these codes provide users with the freshest data and longer time series.

        "Eurostat, the statistical office of the European Union Eurostat\u2019s mission is to provide high-quality statistics for Europe . Eurostat collects data from national statistical authorities. This short guide presents the latest data available for the European Union (EU) and the European Neighbourhood Policy-East (ENP-East) countries. The ENP-East region covers six countries: Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Georgia, Moldova and Ukraine. The data for Georgia exclude the regions over which the government of Georgia does not exercise effective control, and data for Moldova excludes areas over which the government of the Republic of Moldova does not exercise effective control. The latest data for Ukraine generally have a break in series in 2014 (see specific footnotes for precise coverage), excluding the territories which are not under effective control of the Ukrainian government. Through the ENP, which was revised in 2015, the EU offers its neighbours a relationship, built upon a mutual commitment to common values (such as democracy, human rights and the rule of law), while working together to foster stabilisation, security and prosperity. Eurostat\u2019s website : https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat provides free access to its statistics; it is available in German, English and French. Statistics Explained is a wiki-based system that presents statistical topics in an easy to understand way; it is composed of articles that together make up an encyclopaedia of statistics. There are a range of articles on ENP countries covering subjects such as agriculture, the economy, international trade in goods, the labour market, transport, energy and population.
