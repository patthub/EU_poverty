        "The social and employment situation of Roma communities in Slovakia 7 PE 648.778 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY This briefing paper on \u2018The social and employment situation of Roma communities in Slovakia\u2019 was commissioned by the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs of the European Parliament for the purpose of its delegation visit to Slovakia in April 2020. It provides MEPs with background information for their visit, including up-to-date information and analysis covering four key areas: \u2022 Overview on social and employment policy with a focus on the Roma minorities and the implementation of Roma national strategy in the areas of household and employment policies. Social and economic integration and fighting poverty of the Roma communities; \u2022 Situation of Roma children, integration in the educational system, especially segregated schooling; \u2022 Achievements and lessons to learn for the use of EU funds and relevant programmes in Slovakia; \u2022 Related work of the Fundamental Rights Agency, the Council of Europe, the European Court of Auditors and their findings on the Roma situation in Slovakia. Based on extensive desk research of the available literature and descriptive analysis of the data available, this briefing note presents the following key findings: Overview Slovakia has one of the largest Roma communities in Europe, but there is a severe lack of systemic data on Roma population, including a lack of data on the economic integration of Roma. The available data paint a grim picture, however. One in five Roma aged 16 years and older in Slovakia described their main activity as employed or self-employed; 43% of Roma living in Slovakia declare any paid work done in the last four weeks; and almost half of the Roma households in Slovakia declare themselves as unemployed (48%). The data also shows a substantial difference between the outcomes of Roma women and men in the labour market: Roma women exhibit lower rates of paid work (32%) than Roma men (54%). The proportion of young Roma not in work, education or further training is 65% in Slovakia compared to the Slovak NEET rate of those aged 16-24 at 14%. The worst situation is observed for young Roma women in Slovakia, of which 77% are not in work, education or further training, compared to 52% of young Roma men. The Roma population suffers from a high risk of poverty and social exclusion: at-risk-of-poverty rate of Roma people in Slovakia reached 87% compared to 13% in general population Almost half of the unemployed Roma participate in public works schemes, which often provide the only available income for Roma; however, these programs do not improve relevant skills for the participants who end up unable to escape the unemployment trap and find a job in the open labour market. Social partners in Slovakia do not pay adequate attention to the labour market integration of Roma workers, who then lack collective representation in the labour market. As many as 54% of Roma in Slovakia felt discriminated against because of their Roma origin in the last five years. They perceive discrimination mostly when they look for a job. ",
        "IPOL | Policy Department for Economic, Scientific and Quality of Life Policies PE 648.778 8 A large share, 48%, of all Roma settlements are located on the outskirts of a village or town, 34% inside a village or town, and 18% are outside of a village or town or are remotely located. Education and schooling In Slovakia, early school leaving is particularly common among the Roma and socially disadvantaged individuals; particularly young Roma women are overrepresented among NEETs. There is an increasing trend in the early school drop-out rate in Slovakia, increasing from 4.9% in 2008 to 8.6% in 2018. The drivers of early school leaving are associated with the limited access to inclusive education at the primary and secondary level, inadequate educational and career guidance services, ill-functioning second chance education programs and lacking other supportive measures. At the primary school level, Roma children encounter school segregation and discriminatory practices, extensive and unjustified enrolment in ethnically segregated special schools and classes. Schools are not adequately-equipped to provide inclusive education due to a lack of professional pedagogical personnel (e.g. special education teachers) and pedagogical assistants. Another contributing factor is the low quality of professional preparation of teachers to enable them to create a safe and friendly school environment and develop school-parent cooperation in the context of the education of children and students from disadvantaged backgrounds. Only one third of Roma children between the age of 4 (and the beginning of compulsory education at the primary level) attend pre-school facilities in Slovakia. Introduction of compulsory pre-school education for 5 year old children (to be in force in 2021) aims at increasing the number of Roma children in pre-school, but they do not address the low quality of teaching, shortage of professional pedagogical personnel, or other supportive measures that would foster regular attendance. At the national level, there are no systematic public early childhood education and care programs targeting children aged 0-3 and fostering parenting competences. Infringement proceedings regarding discrimination of Roma and access to education of Romani children were launched against the Slovak Republic in April 2015; similar procedures were launched against the Czech Republic (September 2014) and Hungary (May 2016). In response, the respective national governments adopted a number of measures and legislative amendments. There is no systematic evidence about their effectiveness, but key stakeholders such as the European Roma Rights Centre have evaluated these measures and legislative changes as insufficient and ineffective. Lessons from the use of EU funds The implementation of activities to improve the lives of people from marginalized Roma communities (MRC) in the long-term is one of the main areas of EU fund support in Slovakia. During the 2007-2013 programming period, the integration of MRC was recognized as a horizontal priority across all operational programs and the so-called \"comprehensive approach to integration of MRCs\" was adopted. For the programming period of 2014-2020, the assistance of ESIF explicitly addressing integration of MRCs is concentrated in two separate priority axes of the OP Human Resources, in the total amount of EUR 153 954 885.- (ESF) and EUR 228 707 577 (ERDF). Despite the advanced stage of the programming period, the spending rate has remained low (as of 31.12.2019 it is 23.78% for ESF and 13.95% for ERDF). ",
        "The social and employment situation of Roma communities in Slovakia 9 PE 648.778 Assistance of FEAD allocated for Slovakia for the 2014-2020 programming period is EUR 55 112 543. At the end of 2019, the spending rate reached about 45%. The reasons for the low absorption rate may be interpreted by the high level of mistrust in ESIF implementation in Slovakia, the significant administration burden in ESIF implementation, but also by the resistance to these schemes at the local municipalities\u2019 level. In spite of the difficult situation, there are several municipalities, which are successful in the integration of MRC. The common denominator of their success is the determination of the mayor, the support of the municipal council, and options for property ownership settlement. In regards to the upcoming programming period, the assistance aiming integration of MRC is among the priorities, its scope and format is a subject of discussion. Related work The Fundamental Rights Agency, the Council of Europe, the European Roma Rights Centre, and the European Court of Auditors have engaged with the Roma situation in Slovakia within their missions and mandates. There is a broad consensus that permeates through the work and actions of these various organizations and bodies that structural discrimination, school and spatial segregation, anti-Gypsyism, and inadequate policy efforts are some of the key factors precluding progress towards the social and labour market integration of Roma.

        "The social and employment situation of Roma communities in Slovakia 11 PE 648.778 1.1. Introduction Slovakia has one of the largest Roma communities in Europe (see Figure 1), but there is a severe lack of systematic data on Roma population and a vast difference between the number of self-identified Roma and other estimates. The UNDP data from 2014 estimated the number of Roma people at 402,840 (about 7.4% of total population) 1 , compared to about 100,000 self-reported Roma from the 2005 Census 2 . Most recent estimates of the share of Roma population in Slovakia place it at 9% (see Figure 1). In addition , there is a lack of data on the economic integration of Roma 3 . Most of them live in poverty and face social exclusion. The Roma national strategy warns about the multiple disadvantages the Roma population in Slovakia faces: poverty related to demographic trends, poverty caused by unemployment, and poverty related to low-qualified or low-paid jobs, compounded by the lack of formal education 4 .

Machlica (2019) Enhancing the social integration of Roma in Slovak Republic Note: The presented shares represent the average of different estimates 1.2. Development of employment and poverty The Roma national strategy states three global aims to address the labour market participation of the Roma population by 2020. First, to improve the access to employment with particular emphasis on non-discriminatory access to the labour market, active labour market policies and programs, adult education and training and the promotion of self-employment. Second, to reduce the employment gap between the Roma and the majority population. Third, to reduce the rate of Roma unemployment by 50%, referring to the 2010 UNDP survey, according to which the unemployment rate for Roma men was 72% and for women 75% 5 . 1 Source: UNDP (2014) ATLAS r\u00f3mskych komun\u00edt na Slovensku 2013. 2 Source: Kahanec and Sedl\u00e1kov\u00e1 (2016) The social and employment situation in Slovakia and outlook on the Slovak EU Presidency 2016. 3 Source: Kahanec, M.

        "IPOL | Policy Department for Economic, Scientific and Quality of Life Policies PE 648.778 12 According to the EU-MIDIS II survey, only one in five Roma aged 16 years and older in Slovakia described their main activity as employed or self-employed (see Table 1). For comparison, this number is lower than in Czechia or Hungary, where it is 29% and 36% respectively.

Thus, results based on 20 to 49 unweighted observations in a group total or based on cells with fewer than 20 unweighted observations are noted in parentheses. Results based on fewer than 20 unweighted observations in a group total are not published Almost half of the Roma households in Slovakia declare themselves as unemployed (48%) which is again the highest number in the region, compared to 32% in Czechia and 23% in Hungary. Although we cannot directly compare self-reported data on unemployment of Roma to the standard unemployment rate in the general population, for illustration, the unemployment rate in Slovakia reached 11.5% in 2015 and in 5.8% in 2019. The data also show a substantial difference between employed Roma women and men . While 26% of Slovak Roma men declare that they are employed, only 14% or Roma women say they are employed or self-employed. Domestic work is more often declared as the main activity (15%) rather than employment or self-employment status among Roma women (Table 1). ",
        "The social and employment situation of Roma communities in Slovakia 13 PE 648.778 Figure 2: Paid work rate for Roma (20-64 years) in Slovakia, including self-employment and occasional work or work in the past four weeks (%) Source: EU (2016), Second European Union Minorities and Discrimination Survey, Roma \u2013 Selected findings, European Union, Agency for Fundamental Rights Notes: Data are compared with the Europe 2020 employment rate 2015 (Eurostat) (%). Data on Roma population are calculated out of all persons aged 20-64 years in Roma households (n=17,806); weighted results The data on paid work from the EU-MIDIS II survey, which approximates the standard employment rate definition used by Eurostat show that overall, 43% of Roma living in Slovakia declare any paid work done in the last four weeks . This is also the average rate for all nine EU states that participated in the EU-MIDIS II survey. Compared to the employment rate in the general population which has attained 68% in Slovakia, the paid work rate of Roma is thus substantially lower. It is important to mention that the increase in paid work rate (Figure 3) compared to the self-declared employment status, including self-employment (Table 1) is due to the nature of the EU-MIDIS II survey data, where on average, question on any paid work done in last four weeks increases self-reported employment data by 18 percentage points (FRA 2016). Roma women declare lower rates of paid work (32%) than Roma men (54%), which is ascribed to the traditional division of roles in households, domestic work and childcare (Table1; Gatti et al. 2016). In comparison, the female employment rate in the general population is also lower than the employment rate of men, but the gap is considerably smaller (61.2% and 73.9% in 2018, respectively). One of the key factors behind these employment gaps is longer parental leave in age cohorts between 25-34 years compared to the EU-28 countries (Kahanec and Sedl\u00e1kov\u00e1 2016). Youth unemployment is a persistent problem in Slovakia. The NEET rate (Not in Education, Employment, or Training) of young people between 15 and 34 years old reached 17.2% in 2018, compared to the EU average of 14.1%. A similar indicator was computed based on the EU-MIDIS II survey for Roma aged 16 to 24 years and shows that the proportion of young Roma not in work, education or further training is 65% in Slovakia. This is comparable to an average of 63% among all Roma populations surveyed. EU-MIDIS II compares this data to their own calculation of the Slovak NEET rate of those aged 16-24 at 14%. The situation is even worse for young Roma women , of which 77% are not in work, education or further training , compared to 52% of young Roma men. 68 43 32 54 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 employment rate in general population total (Roma) Roma women Roma men ",
        "IPOL | Policy Department for Economic, Scientific and Quality of Life Policies PE 648.778 14 While the share of people at risk of poverty in the general population has been declining from 20.6% in 2008 to 16.3% in 2018 , the Roma population remains at high risk of poverty and social exclusion . According to the EU-MIDIS II, at risk of poverty rate of Roma people in Slovakia reached 87% in 2014, compared to 13% in the general population. Income poverty and its rate appears to be related to the residential concentration of Roma and reaches 98% in areas populated almost exclusively by the Roma population. 1.3. Employment and labour market policies The expenditures on active labour market policies in Slovakia remain low compared to the other EU members (Kahanec and Sedl\u00e1kov\u00e1 2016). The most important ALMP programme in relation to the Roma integration appears to be public works schemes (Activation Work Programmes), since almost half of the unemployed Roma participate in these programmes (Bednarik et al. 2019). They focus on jobs in the public sector to help the unemployed maintain basic work-related skills and last between 6 to18 months, during which a lump-sum benefit is received. Benefits from public works schemes are often the only available income of Roma (ibid.) However, studies show that these programs do not provide relevant skills for the participants who are unable to escape the unemployment trap and find a job on the open labour market (c.f. Bednarik et al. 2019). In addition, Roma participate less in policies with higher potential of labour market integration (ibid.) Thus, experts call for higher spending on ALMPs that focus on long-term unemployed Roma, including the improvement of training, skills, on-the job training supported by better and closer involvement of employers in Slovakia and individualised services of labour offices in the regions (Bednarik et al. 2019). Data shows that successful integration of Roma would help the labour market : the estimated impact of increasing employment rate and productivity of Roma to the level of the general population by year 2060 can increase GDP by more than 12% (Bednarik et al. 2019). Employment and labour market policies also need to address the fact that many Roma work in an informal economy (Kahanec 2014; Gatti 2016), however, there is no specific measure targeting this at the moment. 1.4. Social Dialogue structures and the role of social partners Slovakia has relatively well-established social dialogue structures at three levels: the national, sectoral, and company level. The tripartite involves the following three constituents: representatives of employers organized in employers\u2019 associations, trade unions, and the government. While the national tripartite committee serves mostly as an advisory body to the government, sector-level social dialogue dominates in the key sectors of the Slovak economy - automotive, steel, electronics, chemicals, construction and transport industries (Kahancov\u00e1 and Sedl\u00e1kov\u00e1 2016). Nevertheless, sector-level collective bargaining has been losing its significance to the multi-employer and single-employer levels. The collective bargaining coverage rate that has decreased over time, reached 25% in 2015. Trade union density has been steadily declining and is currently 10.7% 6 . Social partners have been actively trying to shape labour legislation; however, they have not focused their attention on addressing the labour market participation of Roma specifically. 6 Source: ICTWSS Database Version 6.1 - November 2019, available at: https://aias.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/website/uploads/20191107_ICTWSS_6_1_Codebook.pdf.

        "The social and employment situation of Roma communities in Slovakia 15 PE 648.778 In general, trade unions represent workers; hence, with the high unemployment rate of Roma and large share of undeclared work, the Roma population lacks collective representation on the labour market . 1.5. Public perception of Roma in society and in the workplace The EU-MIFID II survey data show that overall, 54% of Roma in Slovakia felt discriminated against because of their Roma origins in the last five years in at least one area of life and 30% in the past twelve months. Most Roma feel discriminated against when they are looking for work . This is consistent with the findings of the Institute of Financial Policy (2014), which showed that applicants with Roma names had less than half the chance of being invited to a job interview than participants with non-Roma names, even though both groups - Roma and non-Roma shared the same personal and professional characteristics, including educational attainment. Another substantial area where the Roma feel discriminated against is \u2018other private and public services\u2019, a category that includes administrative offices or public services, public transport, shops, hotels or restaurants and bars. Figure 3: Prevalence of discrimination based on Roma background in the past 5 years in different areas of life (%) Source: EU (2016), Second European Union Minorities and Discrimination Survey, Roma \u2013 Selected findings, European Union, Agency for Fundamental Rights Notes: Out of all Roma respondents at risk of discrimination on grounds of Roma background in at least one of the domains of daily life asked about in the survey (\u2018the past 5 years\u2019: n=7,745; weighted results) 1.6. Reality in Roma settlements Based on the data from the Atlas of Roma communities 7 , which was last updated in 2019, there are 818 municipalities with the presence of Roma settlements in Slovakia. Furthermore, 200 of these municipalities register two or more settlements in their territory; the total number of Roma settlements was determined to be 1043 based on the results of the Atlas 8 . 7 Source: https://www.minv.sk/?atlas-romskych-komunit-2019. 8 For the purposes of the Atlas of Roma communities, a settlement is defined as a concentration of a minimum of 30 people or five houses, which provide sub-standard quality of living and are inhabited by people who are considered Roma by majority. 54 53 18 16 30 44 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 overall looking for work at work education (self or as a parent) housing other public/private services ",
        "IPOL | Policy Department for Economic, Scientific and Quality of Life Policies PE 648.778 16 Based on the data from the Atlas, it can be stated that 48% of all settlements (498) are located on the outskirts of a municipality, 34% inside a municipality (351 settlements) and 18% are outside of a municipality or are remote (194 settlements); there is no road or walkway leading to 17 of these settlements. A common problem in these settlements is access to drinking water . In spite of the fact that in approximately 77% of all settlements (810 settlements), more than 50% of the population of the settlement has access to public water supply, the public water supply is used by more than 50% of the population of the settlement only in 64% of the settlements (677 settlements). However, in 13% of the settlements, more than 50% of the population gets water from a public tap on the street, and in 5% of the settlements (56 settlements), more than 50% of the population of the settlement uses non-standard water sources such as a river or puddles . There is also a problematic situation in connection with the sewer system and treatment of sewage. In case of approximately 44% of all settlements (464 settlements) more than 50% of the population of the settlement has access to the public sewer system, however, it is used by more than 50% of the population of the settlement only in the case of 33% of the settlements (350 settlements). In fact, in 44% of settlements (463 settlements), more than 50% of the population of the settlement does not use any sewage system, septic tank, or treatment mechanism and the sewage is freely discharged. The electrical grid is accessible to more than 50% of the population in 97% of the settlements. Based on the data from the Atlas of Roma communities, it is possible to conclude that there are still 67 settlements where the connection on the electrical grid is used by less than 10% of the population of the settlement and 53 settlements, where the connection to the electrical grid does not exist. Gas (or green sources) as a source of heat is virtually not used; in case of 83% of the settlements (872), more than 50% of the population uses solid fuel for heating. Waste management is also a problem; 38% of the settlements have no solid waste landfill in their vicinity. A major problem is the ownership of the land under the individual settlements and the ownership of the individual dwellings. Difficulties with the land ownership is also one of the basic obstacles in the implementation of investment projects in the municipalities. Based on the information from the Atlas of Roma communities, approximately two thirds of the people living in Roma settlements (about 170 000 people) live in houses or apartments with a conscription number , therefore it is possible to conclude that these are legal buildings. Even though these may be legal dwellings, ownership of these dwellings may not be resolved, or quality of the dwellings may be substandard. A situation when the dwelling is legal, and the ownership is settled, but the ownership of the property under the dwelling is unresolved, is also not exceptional. The remaining third of the population of the Roma settlements (about 90 000 people) live in houses without a final building approval certificate; these are usually shanties, camper vans, or other structures not suitable for housing, therefore, it is possible to conclude that these people are living in irregular housing. 1.7. Examples of successful projects Examples of good integration practice can be divided into three levels. The first of these is legislation, which makes it easier to employ people from MRCs (Marginalized Roma Community) environments, the second are the so-called national projects, which are usually financed from the ESIF, and the third are individual initiatives of individual municipalities, NGOs, or business entities.

        "The social and employment situation of Roma communities in Slovakia 17 PE 648.778 1.7.1. Legislative level In 2018, the Act on Social Economy and Social Enterprises was adopted, setting conditions for establishing social enterprises, including work integration ones . As of March 15, 2020, 93 social enterprises were registered in the register of social enterprises 9 of which 92 were of the work-integration type. The possibility of registration is used also by the so-called municipal social enterprises . Examples of these are the municipal enterprise \"Hrhovsk\u00e9 slu\u017eby\" (Hrhov services) (the municipality of Spi\u0161sk\u00fd Hrhov , which is internationally known 10 as an example of good practice in the integration of people from the MRC environment). It employs 50+ people, mostly Roma, and it is seen as an inspiration for other municipalities. Another example is the municipal enterprise in Raslavice , which employs 20+ people, most of whom are women from the MRC environment. Given the short period of time since the adoption of the Act, there is no assessment of its impact. However, on the basis of the statements of the social enterprises, it is possible to conclude that the existence of the Act has provided a range of support mechanisms (as financial aid, fiscal benefits, measures improving access to the market) that significantly simplify the daily functioning of social enterprises in Slovakia and hence the inclusion of people from MRCs. It is also worthwhile to mention a recent update of Act 245/2008 Coll on Education (School Act) from June 2019. It introduced compulsory preschool education for the children aged five . The preschool education does not count toward the compulsory school attendance which lasts 10 years in Slovakia, yet the new measure is expected to increase the readiness of children from MRCs for elementary school. The update will come into effect on January 1, 2021. The main challenge for the proper application of this measure is the capacity of preschool facilities, which are rather limited in number of localities. 1.7.2. National (large-scale) projects Healthy Communities (Zdrav\u00e9 komunity) Project \u2018Healthy Regions\u2019 is focused on the implementation and development of health mediation in MRCs ; the activities are aimed at identifying social determinants of health, at overcoming barriers in access to healthcare, at increasing health literacy (including raising the awareness in the area of health care for people from MRC), and at improving health-related behaviour. In the framework of the project, 253 health mediation assistants and 25 coordinators are employed. Most of the employees are Roma directly from the local communities and for many, the work on the project is the first paid employment of their lives. Employees of the programme are systematically trained, the programme also achieves a strong emancipation effect for a number of its employees, and dozens of employees increased/completed their formal education due to their employment in the programme. An interesting point of the programme is that the workers in the programme are de facto employees in public interest (employees of an allowance organisation of the Ministry), which provides them with relatively stable working conditions. The project is co-funded by the ESF and implemented by an allowance organisation Healthy Regions of the Ministry of Health of the Slovak Republic. Field social work programme (Ter\u00e9nna soci\u00e1lna pr\u00e1ca) 9 It can be assumed that many more organizations, which show signs of social entrepreneurship, exist in Slovakia, but only those are listed in the register, which have registered pursuant to the Act on Social economy and social enterprises. Due to their registration, they have access to more types of support. 10 Source: https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/09/world/europe/slovakia-roma-spissky-hrhov-integration.html. ",
        "IPOL | Policy Department for Economic, Scientific and Quality of Life Policies PE 648.778 18 Field social work programmes are implemented directly in MRCs with the main aim to assist people from MRC to access public services and be assisted in the areas where no other assistance accessible for people from MRC exists . A strong element of the programme is the individual empowerment of people from MRC. The programme, in a form of various technical settings, has existed since 2002. There are currently approx. 980 field social workers/field workers , many of whom are Roma. The field social workers are employed by local authorities; however, the programme is implemented centrally (part of the programme is realized by the implementing agency of the Ministry of Labour, Social Affairs and Family and part by the Office of the Slovak Government Plenipotentiary for Roma communities) with the support of ESF. The Programme is currently active in 380 locations . Community centres programme (Komunitn\u00e9 centr\u00e1) With the aim of establishing a network of community centres active in MRC , the first large-scale program called \u201cCommunity centres\u201d was launched in 2013, under which 166 community centres were supported. Subsequently, the role of the community centres was stipulated in the Act of Social Services 11 , and the community centres were qualified as accredited social service . According to the legislation, the community centre (among other activities) provides basic social counselling, organizes after-school activities for children, assists children from the community in achieving good school performance and organizes harm-prevention activities. Currently 175 community centres are operating thanks to ESF assistance. In order to improve community centre facilities, the financial scheme, co-financed by ERDF, supporting construction/reconstruction of community centres in localities with MRC presence was established. So far, 61 community centres have been supported under the scheme. Local municipal civil patrol services (Miestne ob\u010dianske poriadkov\u00e9 slu\u017eby) The programme of municipal civil patrol services is currently implemented in 212 locations , each of which has a separate project co-financed from the ESF. The goal of the local municipal civil patrol services is to monitor the compliance to the rules of civil coexistence and reduce the likelihood of risk-taking behaviours in the community. The program is considered an important source of job opportunities for people from MRC. Employees of the local municipal civil patrol services are in most cases men living directly in the MRC . In comparison with the programme Healthy Regions or Field social work, the employees of the patrol services are not provided any further education from the central level and their work is not methodically managed. 1.7.3. Individual initiatives In addition to programmes co-financed by public sources (in particular the ESF), recently, individual initiatives of commercial subjects targeting people from MRCs have started to appear. These are primarily related to employment and respond specifically to the current shortage of labour. An important role is played by the Pontis Foundation (the administrator of the Business Leaders Forum initiative), which has prepared a series of seminars on the employment of the Roma for business companies. An example of a good practice initiative is the company Stiga from Poprad , which has been implementing a programme of supported employment for the people from the MRC environment in cooperation with the non-profit organization People in Need. 11 See Act 448/2008 Coll on Social Services.

SITUATION OF ROMA CHILDREN IN EDUCATION: BARRIERS IN THE ACCESS TO INCLUSIVE EDUCATION KEY FINDINGS \u2022 Infringement proceedings regarding discrimination of Roma and access to education of Roma children were launched against the Slovak Republic in April 2015; similar procedures were launched against the Czech Republic (September 2014) and Hungary (May 2016). \u2022 In response, the respective national governments adopted a number of measures and legislative amendments. \u2022 There is no systematic evidence about their effectiveness, but key stakeholders such as the ERRC evaluate these measures and legislative amendments as insufficient and ineffective. \u2022 There is an increasing trend in early school drop-out rate in Slovakia as the rate increased from 4.9% in 2008 to 8.6% in 2018. \u2022 Early school leaving is particularly common among the Roma and socially disadvantaged youth; young Roma women are particularly overrepresented among the NEETs. \u2022 Drivers of early school leaving are associated with limited access to inclusive education at primary and secondary school level, inadequate educational and career guidance services, ill-functioning second chance education programs and lacking supportive measures such as mentoring. \u2022 At the primary school level, Roma children encounter school segregation and discriminatory practices, including extensive and unjustified enrolment in ethnically segregated special schools and classes. \u2022 Schools are not well-equipped to provide inclusive education due to a lack of professional pedagogical personnel (e.g. special education teachers) and pedagogical assistants; school personnel is also poorly prepared to work with children and students from disadvantaged background. \u2022 Only one third of Roma children between the age 4 and the beginning of compulsory education at the primary level attend pre-school facilities in Slovakia. \u2022 Introduction of compulsory pre-primary education for 5 years old children (to be in force in 2021) aims at increasing the number of Roma children in preschool. \u2022 At the governmental level, there is no systemic early childhood education and care programs targeting children aged 0-3 and fostering parenting competences.

        "The social and employment situation of Roma communities in Slovakia 21 PE 648.778 2.1. Overview of the Commission infringement procedure against Slovakia and comparison to the cases of Hungary and Czech Republic Infringement proceedings are established by Article 258 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. They provide the Commission with a legislative tool to ensure compliance of Member States with EU law. On April 19, 2015 , infringement proceedings were launched against the Slovak Republic that call into question Slovakia\u2019s compliance with Article 21 (1) of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the EU, which prohibits discrimination based on any ground such as race or ethnic origin; and the Race Equality Directive (2000/43/EC (RED)) Articles 2.2a, 2.2b, 2.3, 3.1.g, which prohibit discrimination in access to education on the grounds of race or ethnicity. Prior to that, in September 2014, the European Commission started an infringement procedure against the Czech Republic for breaching the EU Anti-Discrimination Law by discriminating Roma children in education. In May, 2016, the European Commission (EC) launched a similar procedure against Hungary. All three countries were called on to stop discriminating against Roma children in education and to adjust their laws accordingly. Should this not be achieved satisfactorily, the cases could end up before the European Court of Justice. Slovakia has taken four legislative measures in response to the infringement procedure: (i) extension of the powers of the state school inspection to oversee the functioning of diagnostics centres (Centres of Pedagogic-Psychological Counselling, CPPC); (ii) limiting the placement of a child enrolled in a so-called specialized class (catch-up class) of a regular school to one year; (iii) amending the School Act to stipulate that a child whose special educational needs stem merely from being raised in a socially disadvantaged environment cannot be placed into a special school or special class; and (iv) changing the methodology of determining whether a child is from SDE (as a basis for a special state subsidy) to one based on diagnosing by the CPPC, rather than based on whether the child\u2019s family is in material need 13 . Aside from these four legislative measures, the Ministry of Education, Science, Research, and Sport implemented several ESIF-funded (The European Structural and Investment Funds) national projects to foster desegregation , such as the \u2018More Successful at School\u2019 project that funds primarily teacher assistants and other supportive school personnel for disadvantaged children (among them Roma, but also children with disabilities) with a budget of 50 million EUR 14 . In the Czech Republic, the Education Act was amended in 2016 and several reforms to foster inclusion were enacted, such as the abandonment of the categorization of children, pupils and students according to types of disadvantage and the establishment of a new monitoring body, the National Institute for Education. Since the 2017/2018 school year, a compulsory year of free preschool has been introduced. However, the number of Roma children educated according to reduced curricula remains 13 Source: Civil society monitoring report on implementation of the national Roma integration strategies in Slovakia, available at: https://cps.ceu.edu/sites/cps.ceu.edu/files/attachment/basicpage/3034/rcm-civil-society-monitoring-report-1-slovakia-2017-eprint- fin.pdf. 14 Ibid.

        "IPOL | Policy Department for Economic, Scientific and Quality of Life Policies PE 648.778 22 disproportionately high and about a quarter of Roma pupils are educated in a segregated setting. This is partly due to the fact that the residential segregation of Roma has practically not been addressed 15 . In Hungary , as of 2015 (prior to the procedure), three-year kindergarten education is now compulsory. However, the accessibility and quality of preschools varies. The Sure Start children\u2019s centres, aiming to integrate children into local communities, were set up in settlements with a high share of Roma population and child poverty. In spite of these efforts, children in Hungary are increasingly segregated on the grounds of their socio-economic or ethnic backgrounds 16 . Gabriela Hraba\u0148ov\u00e1, director of the European Roma Grassroots Organisations (ERGO), stated in an interview, however: \u201c infringement procedures of the European Commission against the Czech Republic, Hungary and Slovakia concerning segregation in education have not brought any results. Above all, structural anti-Gypsyism has not been addressed in most Member States. A lot of commitment and action from decision-makers are needed to achieve more equality for Roma in the coming years.\u201d 17 Concerning Slovakia, a note of the European Roma Rights Centre concludes that these legislative changes adopted in response to the infringement procedure have been highly insufficient, as they alone cannot secure equal access of Roma children to education if not accompanied by any concrete and sustainable de-segregation policies and measures 18 . 2.2. Early school leaving Over the last ten years, there has been an increasing trend in the early school drop-out rate in Slovakia. Even though in 2008 the early school drop-out rate in Slovakia was 4.9%, the rate increased to 8.6% in 2018 19 . The evidence shows that the early school dropouts is particularly common among the young Roma 20 and socially disadvantaged communities 21 . Although there is no ethnic data on the attendance level in secondary education, according to the research of the Institute of the Financial Policy, only every second Roma student aged 17-18 years studies at secondary school 22 . Regarding this, the young Roma are also overrepresented among the NEETs and early school dropouts affect Roma women more than Roma men (see section 1.2 on NEET rates). Nevertheless, there are no reliable research findings about the drivers of early school leaving among the Roma youth in Slovakia since no systemic monitoring and research about the topic has been carried out. Gender-specific factors of early school dropouts among young Roma women and reasons behind the currently increasing trend in early school dropout rates are underexplored as well. 15 Source: Civil society monitoring report on implementation of the national Roma integration strategies in Czech Republic, available at: https://op.europa.eu/en/publication-detail/-/publication/51003529-b1ac-11e9-9d01-01aa75ed71a1/language-en/format-PDF/source- 113947200. 16 Source: Civil society monitoring report on implementation of the national Roma integration strategies in Hungary, available at: https://op.europa.eu/en/publication-detail/-/publication/b5fa7f29-b1aa-11e9-9d01-01aa75ed71a1/language-en/format-PDF/source- 121387732. 17 Source: https://www.brusselstimes.com/all-news/eu-affairs/67303/roma-integration-still-far-away-in-eu/. 18 Source: http://www.errc.org/uploads/upload_en/file/slovakia-cerd-submission-5-november-2017.pdf. 19 Source: Donlevy, Day, Andriescu, Downes (2019).

        "The social and employment situation of Roma communities in Slovakia 23 PE 648.778 On a policy level, there is a lack of educational policy tools with a potential to mitigate early school leaving. First, in general a low quality of education, which includes a lack of inclusive education tools utilised in pre-primary, primary and secondary level (see below), presents a major factor behind low academic performance of Roma pupils and students. This in turn leads to low self-motivation and self-esteem of students, grade repetition and eventually to early school leaving. These factors are intertwined with other aspects such as early pregnancies, a lack of parental and family support, a need to earn money to support a family, and others (Mi\u0161kolci, Kub\u00e1nov\u00e1 and Kov\u00e1\u010dov\u00e1, 2019). Second, career and educational guidance services are currently underdeveloped and ill- functioning. These measures serve as preventive interventions for early school leaving and have a positive impact on decisions over pursuing education (De Witte and Cabus, 2013) . Effective career guidance services are particularly important for students with an ethnic background or for other vulnerable cohorts facing multiple barriers in the access to education and the labour market. Third, the access of Roma pupils and students to secondary education is very limited due to travel costs and segregation in housing, which increases travel costs and proximity to the school facilities. Importantly, the motivation to attend secondary school regularly is low among the Roma students from disadvantaged backgrounds which is associated with the above-mentioned ill-functioning career guidance services, and the low quality of inclusive education and supportive measures such as flexible school schedules, tutoring, etc. Besides that, there is no stipend provided for socially disadvantaged students or any form of affirmative action or intervention that would aim at increasing the number of Roma in secondary and higher education (Laj\u010d\u00e1kov\u00e1, 2015). Fourth, the system of second-chance education does not work properly and does not offer proper educational options for early school leavers to complete their formal education, or acquire skills needed for successful work integration (Ke\u0161elov\u00e1, Ondru\u0161ov\u00e1 and Urdzikov\u00e1, 2018). Those students who do not graduate primary school successfully are frequently offered to attend two-year programmes (so called \u201cF\u201d programs) provided by the secondary vocational schools. However, the \u201cF\u201d programs are characterised by several deficiencies, particularly: (1) graduates of the program only receive a lower secondary vocational educational level (ISCED 2c) 23 which means that the graduates cannot pursue further education at the secondary level (ISCED 3); (2) the employment rate of graduates is very low; (3) only 33% of students successfully complete these programmes 24 . The cross-sectional problem related to the above-mentioned barriers in the access to education and labour market is a poor cooperation between regional, local and national stakeholders. The social field workers and public servants of the local Labour Offices are not cooperating with the stakeholders in education effectively. As a result, Roma youth (NEETs) are not actively approached to return into the system of training and education. Similarly, Roma NEETs are not provided with individually tailored interventions that would enable them to foster their skills and education. In addition, Active Labour Market Policies seem to add a creaming off effect since the most vulnerable groups of unemployed, especially the Roma with low educational attainment, are not eligible for 23 Completion of the \u201cF\u201d program, the lower secondary vocational level (ISCED 2c), is not equivalent to completion of the primary school level (lower secondary educational level ISCED 2) which means that the graduates of the \u201cF\u201d programmes cannot apply for the regular program at the secondary school and further pursue their education and attain higher educational level. There has been an initiative of the Ministry of Education to include the training on the completion of primary school level into the \u201cF\u201d program which would allow graduates to pursue higher education. Nevertheless, to the best of our knowledge, no legal amendment has been made in this respect. 24 Source: Institute for Educational Policy and Value for Money (2019). ",

Main barriers in the access to inclusive education Poor academic performance and high early school drop-out rates are results of a set of factors related to the school environment and quality of learning. Kindergartens and primary schools in Slovakia lack professional pedagogical staff, including special education teachers, school psychologists, speech therapists, and social pedagogues , as well as pedagogical assistants. These professionals could provide pupils/students and their families with complex services, set individual plans and address the individual difficulties the disadvantaged children encounter in the process of learning and socialising in the school environment. Salaries of professional pedagogical staff is covered by financial contributions for students with special education needs, however, the recent funding system does not allow schools to hire them. The support in special education is partially provided by the Centre for Pedagogical and Psychological Counselling and Prevention (their district offices), nevertheless they reportedly lack the capacity to provide teachers with individual training and consultation. The same applies to the pedagogical assistants that are funded by the financial contributions for pupils from socially disadvantaged backgrounds. The amount of contribution per pupil is low and, as a result, schools often cannot cover the labour costs of full-time assistants. In addition, there is a lack of pedagogical assistants and hence, the demand of schools for these professions are not addressed (Hapalov\u00e1, 2020) 25 . This has, however, several negative consequences: the role of pedagogical assistants is crucial for creating a safe and supportive school environment. They assist regular teachers in providing an individualised approach to pupils in learning, mediate communication between school and families and organize extra-curricular activities. Therefore, the kindergartens and primary schools lack an inclusive team of experts consisting of pedagogical assistants, professional pedagogical staff and other supportive personnel. Additionally, the school staff (school management and pedagogues) is poorly trained in creating a safe and friendly school climate and working in culturally diverse classes . They are often not trained in Roma language and culture; as a result, the language barrier between school staff and pupils and/or their families persist. Additionally, the school staff tend to have anti-Roma attitudes which manifests itself in complicated school-parent relations and an unfavourable school climate (Mi\u0161kolci, et al., 2017; Petrasov\u00e1 and Porubsk\u00fd, 2013). As a result of the above-mentioned problems, the Roma pupils are extensively enrolled in ethnically segregated schools or classes , special classes in regular schools, or in special schools . School segregation is a result of anti-Roma prejudices on the institutional level, a lack of inclusive tools in education and diagnostics, but also in housing segregation. Overall, the portion of children involved in special education in Slovakia is 5.9% which is among the highest in the EU countries (EU average presents 1.6%) (Ramberg, L\u00e9n\u00e1rt and Watkins, 2018 ). The re-integration of children from special education (either special schools or special classes) into mainstream education has not been initiated or systematically supported, and thus is almost non-existent. 25 Source: https://analyza.todarozum.sk/docs/346831004ej0a/. ",
        "The social and employment situation of Roma communities in Slovakia 25 PE 648.778 Due to a lack of ethnic data, there is no recent evidence on the enrolment rate of the Roma children in special primary schools or special classes. Nevertheless, it is estimated that the Roma pupils represent almost 60% of all pupils in special primary schools, 86% of pupils in special classes at regular primary schools and 35% of all students in special secondary schools (Friedmann et al., 2009). Given that the Roma population in Slovakia presents only about 9% of all the population, the enrolment rate of Roma children and youth in special education is extensive. Special schools are self-motivated to retain the number of pupils and students and are frequently established in the proximity to the Roma settlements, which strongly affects the decision of parents to enrol their children in such schools. Not only for safety reasons and travel costs, but also the overall lack of information about educational possibilities lead Roma parents to enrol their children in special schools (Mi\u0161kolci et al., 2017). Regarding this, there is no de-segregation strategy and other systemic and institutionalised support that would assist the school and municipal stakeholders to systematically de-segregate school facilities and, thus, address ethnic discrimination in the school system. Desegregation efforts must be planned, coordinated and implemented by various actors at a local, regional and national level, involving not only educational authorities but the whole set of actors including pedagogical experts, social field workers, municipal representatives and others. 2.4. Education and care in early childhood Despite the recognised importance and benefits of pre-primary education on further educational paths, Roma children in Slovakia encounter limited access to pre-primary education and care. In 2016, the participation of Roma children (aged between 4 years and the starting age of compulsory education) in pre-school facilities was only 34%, while the participation rate of the general population was about 77%. From the perspective of CEE countries, the participation rate of Roma children in pre-school facilities in Hungary 26 was 91% (compared to 95% of the general population), in the Czech Republic 34% (compared to 86% of the general population) and in Poland 42% (compared to 94% of the general population) in the same year (FRA, 2016). The causes of the low attendance are manifold. First, a lack of capacities in pre-school facilities represent a major barrier for Roma children in the access to pre-primary education . In the school year 2018/2019, 12,502 applications to pre-schools were rejected. Nevertheless, evidence shows that the available capacities are distributed disproportionally since in the same school year approx. 7,000 to 12,000 places in the kindergartens across the country were available (Varsik, 2019). Second , as mentioned above, kindergartens lack financial resources to pay for the professional pedagogical staff (e.g. special education teachers) as well as pedagogical assistants that would enable the pre-school staff to apply an individualised approach, particularly in ethnically diverse classes. The pre-school staff is currently ill-equipped to utilise inclusive tools in education including creating favourable school climate , develop parent-teacher cooperation (together with other local stakeholders), and others . A shortage of professional staff and cases of hostile pre-school environments may discourage Roma parents from enrolling children in local kindergartens (Mi\u0161kolci et al., 2017). Third, the Roma families often encounter financial restrictions in the access to pre-primary education due to formal and informal fees, and other associated expenses (proper clothes, shoes, 26 The participation of children in pre-school facilities in Hungary is compulsory for children aged 3-6. ",
        "IPOL | Policy Department for Economic, Scientific and Quality of Life Policies PE 648.778 26 hygiene utilities, etc.). Besides formal fees, there is a set of so-called hidden fees such as fees for Christmas parties or pre-school trips (Parental Fund); even though these types of fees are approved by parents themselves, parents in material need may feel pressured to agree with the other parents due to a fear of stigmatisation. In July 2019, the Slovak Parliament introduced a compulsory pre-primary education for children at the age of five (one year prior to the beginning of compulsory education at the primary level) by adopting the amendment of the School Act 27 to be in force in 2021. This policy aims at increasing the participation rate of children primarily from the socially disadvantaged background. At the same time, the amendment of the School Act abolishes zero classes which serve as preparatory classes for children that were considered as \u201cnot prepared\u201d to pursue education in primary school. Worryingly, the amendment also introduces a provision allowing grade repetition at the pre-school level, provided that a child is considered as unprepared to attend primary school level. However, grade repetition may harm the self-confidence and motivation of the children (Mi\u0161kolci et al., 2017). Regular attendance of Roma children in pre-school education might be hindered by the above- mentioned barriers that were not addressed by the amendment of the School Act or any other recent state policy intervention. Importantly, the Slovak municipal system is fragmented and typical of many small-sized municipalities (about 20% of the municipalities have a population smaller than 500) which means they lack financial resources to establish and run pre-school facilities. The amendment also does not allow other, more flexible forms of pre-school education such as small children\u00b4s groups. Comparably to the case of primary education, Roma children might be extensively enrolled in the ethnically segregated pre-school facilities such as kindergartens in the close proximity to the Roma settlements. 2.5. Government versus non-governmental initiatives There are several governmental initiatives that foster inclusion of Roma children in education. Increasing the participation rate of Roma children in pre-primary education is currently actively supported by the ESF-funded Project of Inclusion in Kindergartens - PRIM (Operational Programme Human resources) which has been implemented by the Office of Plenipotentiary of the Slovak Government for Roma communities in 120 kindergartens. The aim of the project is to support inclusive teams operating the kindergartens that would enhance an individualised approach in teaching and foster parent-teacher cooperation. The inclusive teams consist of teachers, pedagogical assistants, special education teachers and coordinators of inclusive education. Pre-school teachers are provided with consultations and training in utilising inclusive tools and mitigating the barriers Roma children encounter in the access to education. Nevertheless, the project is time-limited since the end of the implementation period is 2020 (it is expected to be extended until 2023). Additionally, to enhance the capacity in kindergartens, the Operational program Human Resources and Integrated Regional Operational Program currently provide municipalities with funds to enlarge or build pre-school facilities. Nevertheless, recent governmental interventions only partially alleviate barriers the Roma children encounter in the access to pre-primary education. The interventions on creating inclusive teams at the pre-school level are small-scaled and project-based, thus, the support is currently not 27 Source: https://www.slov-lex.sk/pravne-predpisy/SK/ZZ/2019/209/20190716.html.

Also, there is no systemic support for pre-primary education for younger children aged 0-4 and fostering parent competencies. There is a set of non-governmental initiatives in the field of education that reflect the above-mentioned barriers. For instance, the Omama programme implemented by a non-governmental organisation Cesta von (Way out) focuses on fostering child development from the prenatal period to the age of three. It consists of the educational interactive activities and counselling services provided by Roma trainers in the households and in the parents\u00b4 clubs. The Roma women are trained in parental competences, particularly in the methods of fostering early childhood development. After completion of the program, they become employees with a regular employment contract and provide services in their own communities 28 .

It is based on a buddy system and children are provided with interactive learning and being mentored in a form of both online and personal communication.

ACHIEVEMENTS AND LESSONS TO LEARN OF THE USE OF EU FUNDS AND RELEVANT PROGRAMMES IN SLOVAKIA 3.1. Overview on the ESIF implementation in regards of Roma The implementation of activities to improve the lives of people from MRC in the long-term is one of the main areas of EU fund support in Slovakia . The narrative and type of support has developed over time, and is affected by international discourse, in addition to domestic experience. 3.1.1. Lessons learned during the 2007-2013 programmatic period With the goal of better focus in the use of EU support, the term marginalised Roma community (MRC) began to be used in the context of EU funds in the programming period 2007-2013. Adoption of a new concept in the discourse strengthened the social marginalisation aspect, which is conditional upon belonging to an ethnic minority, but clearly separated the Roma, who, despite belonging to the ethnic minority, are not the recipients of social assistance and are fully integrated into mainstream society. The programming period 2007-2013 can be considered important with regard to MRCs also due to the fact that the integration of MRCs had been recognized as a so-called horizontal priority for all operational programmes and six out of a total of eleven operational programmes were required to implement the so-called \"comprehensive approach to integration of MRCs\". The initial plan was that KEY FINDINGS \u2022 The implementation of activities to improve the lives of people from marginalized Roma communities (MRC) in the long-term is one of the main areas of EU funds support in Slovakia. \u2022 During 2007-2013 programming period, integration of MRC was recognized as horizontal priority for all operational programmes and approach of so-called \"comprehensive approach to integration of MRCs\" was adopted. \u2022 For 2014-2020, assistance of ESIF explicitly addressing integration of MRCs is concentrated in two separate priority axes of the OP Human Resources, with the total amount of EUR 153 954 885 (ESF) and EUR 228 707 577 (ERDF). \u2022 Despite the advanced stage of the programming period, the spending rate remains low (as of 31.12.2019 it is 23.78% for ESF and 13.95% for ERDF). \u2022 The reasons behind the low spending rate can be interpreted by the high level of mistrust in the ESIF implementation in Slovakia, significant administration burden in ESIF implementation, but also by the resistance from the level of local municipalities. \u2022 Despite the difficult situation, there are several municipalities, which are successful in integration of MRC. The common denominator of their success is the determination of the mayor, the support of the municipal council, and options for property ownership settlement. \u2022 In connection with the upcoming programming period, the assistance aiming integration of MRC is among the priorities, its scope and format is a subject of discussion. \u2022 Assistance of FEAD allocated for Slovakia for 2014-2020 programming period is EUR 55 112 543. As for 31.12.2019 the spending rate reached some 45%. ",
        "The social and employment situation of Roma communities in Slovakia 29 PE 648.778 projects that have a positive relevance to integration of MRCs were scored more favourably in competition with other projects. However, the approach to MRCs as a horizontal priority has not been successful. The main reason for this was the insufficient methodology to determine which projects, and based on what criteria, can be considered as relevant to MRCs. The inclusion of the projects was performed based on self-identification of the project, which, in practice, meant the inclusion of projects that had no connection to the integration of MRCs. From the viewpoint of the general public and expert community, however, the biggest problem was caused by the discussion of the amount of funds invested in favour of MRCs, which was the sum of all the projects identified as relevant to MRCs. It does not need to be emphasised that the amounts were absurdly overestimated. A similar failure has ended the implementation of the so-called \" comprehensive approach to the integration of MRCs\" , which was built on the logic of a coordinated approach of the involved operational programmes and concentration of aid (in the form of financial resources and technical assistance) for the territories, which were prepared for the absorption of the funds. The preparedness was supposed to be proven by the presence of the so-called \"Strategy of comprehensive approach to the integration of MRCs\", which was a document describing the sequence of individual steps in the medium term, approved by both, the local government and the Office of the Plenipotentiary of the Slovak Republic Government for Roma communities (which played a coordinating role in the comprehensive approach). According to an external evaluation of the comprehensive approach 30 , the proposed policy of ESIF aid failed in particular due to the highly ingrained culture of departmentalism and the inability of individual ministries to cooperate. 3.1.2. Implementation structure during the 2014-2020 programmatic period In 2012, the first impact assessment of ESF on the Roma in Slovakia was conducted 31 . It highlighted the uncertain results in regards to the most disadvantaged Roma groups, the inability of small municipalities to draw funds (they do not have the financial resources for project co-financing or the human capacities necessary for the successful implementation of the projects), and the frequent hostility of local authorities 32 . Also, based on the evaluation results, a strategy was adopted for the programming period 2014-2020, in which, based on the findings of the so-called Atlas of Roma communities from 2013 33 , 150 municipalities in the most serious situation were identified . These municipalities have automatic access to basic assistance programmes such as field social work or community centres. In the programming period 2014-2020, MRCs as a horizontal priority for ESIF was discontinued and the issue of integrating MRCs is concentrated in two separate priority axes of the OP Human Resources . These are the priority axis 5 Integration of marginalised Roma communities and the priority axis 6 Technical facilities in municipalities with a presence of marginalised Roma communities. The contribution of the European Community for priority axis 5 is EUR 153 954 885 (with an additional EUR 25 144 105 from national resources). This assistance is from the European Social Fund 30 Source: Salner et al.

The contribution of the European Community for priority axis 6 is EUR 228 707 577 (with an additional EUR 26 906 77 from national resources). This assistance is from the European Regional Development Fund and the funds are directed to any municipality with the presence of an MRC, which is listed in the Atlas of Roma communities. Municipalities that have not been included in the list of the 150 municipalities with the most dire situations may apply for financial assistance for the benefit of the MRC through OP Human Resources priority axis 4 \u201cSocial inclusion\u201d, in which people from the MRC constitute one of the priority target groups, or within any other priority axis of any operational programme. Within the priority axis 5 , funds are distributed in particular through the so-called national projects, to a large extent administered by the Office of the Plenipotentiary of the Slovak Republic Government for Roma communities. As of December 31, 2019, the spending rate was 23.78% and the rate of contracting was 88.99% 34 . Within the priority axis 6 , the funds are used exclusively through individual, so-called demand- oriented, projects. The project administrator is an intermediate body of the Ministry of the Interior of the Slovak Republic (not the Office of the Plenipotentiary of the Slovak Republic Government for Roma communities). As of December 31, 2019, the spending rate was 13.95% and the rate of contracting was 47.29% 35 . 3.2. Low absorption rate and possible misuse of ESIF The reasons behind the low spending rate of ESIF (in case of priority axis 6 also of contracting rate) can be found in several factors. In addition to a delayed start of ESIF implementation in Slovakia (the funds started to be drawn in 2017) and high administrative burden , there is an especially high level of distrust in the implementation of ESIF as well as structural obstacles to drawing ESIF at the lowest level . High administrative burden is often the result of a conservative approach and lack of ability to establish up-to-date procedures in ESIF administration in Slovakia 36 . However, from the point of view of social significance, the culture of mutual mistrust , which is characteristic for the implementation of ESIF in Slovakia, can be considered a significantly larger problem in comparison with the administrative complexity . The mistrust can be observed on the side of the management and intermediary bodies, which often approach the beneficiary of the aid with a large degree of suspicion of misuse of the aid, as well as on the side of the potential beneficiaries, who often do not trust the processes implemented by the management and intermediary bodies (whether in the context of the project selection or process control) and thus do not even apply for aid. The reasons for this situation can be found in the past, when cases of misuse or inefficient use of ESIF resources repeatedly occurred. At present, similar cases (particularly, failures in selection and control mechanisms, when projects without any link to the target group were supported) are not reported, 34 Source: https://www.vicepremier.gov.sk/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/RO%C4%8CN%C3%81_inform%C3%A1cia-o-stave- implement%C3%A1cie-E%C5%A0IF-k-31-12-2018.pdf. 35 Source: ibid. 36 It is not an exception that a procedure, which can be executed electronically (it may even be executed electronically), must be executed also traditionally in a \"paper\" form.

        "The social and employment situation of Roma communities in Slovakia 31 PE 648.778 and it can be argued that in the case of the resources intended for the benefit of MRCs, similar fraud can no longer happen. Contrary, the use of ESIF currently represents a disproportionate risk for potential beneficiaries and many of them are not interested in the use of ESIF . The beneficiary is often (even after the support is finished) in a situation of legal uncertainty and is often forced to provide documents which exceed the common standard of duties. A low level of flexibility in ESIF implementation in Slovakia often impedes the implementation of any innovations , and only highly standardised activities can be implemented and financed. The orientation on 100% risk prevention of misuse is currently becoming the main obstacle to the utilization of the funds, since the designated conditions are often unclear and rather difficult to accomplish. The focus on reducing the risk of misuse would be entirely legitimate and correct, if it had not been oriented exclusively on control of the administrative processes, without considering the needs of the target group or specifics of the individual projects. Another serious obstacle to using ESIF in favour of MRCs is the approach of local municipality governments . It is not exceptional that the local municipality is hostile and unwilling to address the problems of people from MRCs. In the analysis of the lack of interest of the local authorities, a question of capacities of the specific municipality often resonates . In many cases, the concerned municipalities have a yearly budget 37 , which is not sufficient to ensure the compulsory co-financing of the project and even if the local government is interested, it does not have the capacity to implement a strategic project that could bring real change. In addition to financial resources, human resource capacities are a problem. The municipalities often do not have the internal capacity for the implementation of development projects , project management is usually outsourced, and there are almost no possibilities for building internal capacities required for the implementation of integration projects in the future. Slovakia, particularly its eastern part, also suffers from the impact of brain-drain and the main problem during the implementation of development projects are often human and intellectual resources necessary for the successful implementation of the projects. 3.3. Examples of proper use of ESIF Despite the difficult situation, there are several municipalities , which are successful in integration and development initiatives . The common denominator of their success is the determination of the mayor, the support of the municipal council, and options for property ownership settlement (which is often related to the presence of vacant land in the ownership of the municipality). The municipalities, which can be a source of inspiration are, for example, Raslavice, Spi\u0161sk\u00fd Hrhov, \u010c\u00edr\u010d, Mur\u00e1nska Dlh\u00e1 L\u00faka and other. All of the municipalities above implemented their successful initiatives with significant ESIF support. In principle, ESIF can be considered the main resource for any activities aimed at integrating MRCs . The programme Healthy regions ; the programme of field social work ; the programme of support for community centres, within the framework of which 175 community centres operate, can be considered as successful examples of good practice in the utilization of ESIF. The programme of local municipal civil patrol services can be also considered a success. The facilities for community centres in 61 municipalities with an MRC presence were improved via the programme for the construction/reconstruction of a community centre and 160 preschools in 37 In Slovakia, there are 2927 municipalities, of which 404 have less than 200 inhabitants. Budget of these municipalities is approximately EUR 25 000 per year. ",
        "IPOL | Policy Department for Economic, Scientific and Quality of Life Policies PE 648.778 32 municipalities with the presence of MRCs were supported under the calls for increasing the capacities of preschools . A programme to support waste management and solutions to illegal landfills in municipalities with MRC presence was met with a great deal of interest and approximately 140 projects were supported. A programme to support access to drinking water is still running; approximately 40 projects have been supported. A programme that has been met with the smallest interest so far is a programme to support transitional housing , through which only 12 projects have been supported so far. The project Support of land settlement , which is implemented by the Office of the Plenipotentiary of the Slovak Republic Government for Roma communities is also noteworthy. In the framework of the project, municipalities with the presence of MRCs receive free-of-charge technical assistance in order to reach settlements in ownership of the lands, so that people acquire a legal relationship to the land under their home , which is a condition for the legalisation of their housing, other possible modifications in the future, and improvement of conditions of their housing. Another project is realized with the support of ESIF by the Office of the Plenipotentiary of the Slovak Republic Government for Roma communities called Monitoring and evaluation of inclusive policies and their impact on MRCs, in which data and information on socio-economic conditions of the Roma are systematically collected, which are subsequently used for creating public policies. In 2019, the Atlas of Roma communities, EU-SILC, and several other studies were conducted through the project. 3.4. Upcoming programmatic period and future use of ESIF in regards of Roma In connection with the approaching programming period 2021-2027, the extent and the form of ESIF aid for MRCs is still under discussion . Currently, the most probable alternative is that separate priority axes explicitly aimed at MRCs will be discontinued, and support in favour of MRCs will be fully integrated into the mainstream priority axes. Similarly, it is not recommended to continue the division of the programmes into two parallel channels with one focused on municipalities with the most serious situation (150 municipalities, which received aid through the priority axis 5). Even though the division of the programmes was built on clear arguments, in practice the division was not productive and resulted in more complications than benefits. The Slovak Republic will most likely request that existing priorities be extended to investments into construction and reconstruction of primary schools 38 in the municipalities with the presence of MRCs. In the context of MRCs, implementation of the so-called strategic projects , which would allow a coordinated implementation of development programmes in selected areas, is under consideration . The existence and potential settings of the so-called strategic projects are currently the subject of discussion. 3.5. Fund for European Aid to the Most Deprived In the programming period 2014-2020, an Operating programme Food and basic material aid co-financed through the Fund for European Aid to the Most Deprived has also been realized in Slovakia. The contribution of the EC is EUR 55 112 543 (with additional EUR 9 725 743 from national resources). The programme is implemented by the Central Office of Labour, Social Affairs, and Family of the Slovak Republic, the aid is distributed through partner organizations, which were selected for cooperation 38 Currently, it is possible to invest in construction and reconstruction of preschools, investments into the construction and reconstruction of primary schools were identified in the programming period 2014-2020 as a negative priority.

The ownership of the land under the settlement has been resolved and the land is owned by the homeowners. Approx. 40% of the dwellings have final building approval . There is public water supply in the settlement, which is used by approx. 60% of the population in the settlement, some 30% have their own well, and the rest of the inhabitants use a public tap. A sewer system, which is accessible to approx. 80% of the population of the settlement, is only used by about 60% of the population who could connect to it; the rest does not use any sewage treatment mechanism. The settlement is electrified; approx. 75% of the population uses the official connection to the electrical grid .

Both are located on the outskirts of the village and appr. 250 people live in each . In each of the settlements, there are appr. 40 dwellings , most of them without final building approval, since they are sub-standard dwellings. In the New settlement, there are 5 apartment buildings with a total of 22 apartments. The road to the Old settlement leads directly through a creek , which often overflows and makes it difficult and risky to access the settlement. Old settlement in Hermanovce is also known under the name \"settlement on the island\". About one quarter of the land in each of the settlements is owned by the owners of the houses built on them. In the New settlement, the rest of the land is owned by the municipality; in Old settlement a quarter is owned by the municipality and almost a half belongs to various private owners. In the New settlement , 100% of the population has access to public water supply, which is used by approx. 90% of the population . In the Old settlement, there is no water supply system in place and about 90% of people use water from a public tap . Approximately 10% of the population in both locations has their own well. A sewer system is not established in either of the sites ; in the New settlement, approximately 60% of the population uses its own septic tank, the rest of the population does not use any method of sewage treatment. In the Old settlement, 95% of the people do not use any method of sewage treatment . Both settlements are electrified; in the New settlement, 100% of the population uses the connection to the electrical grid , while in the Old settlement, it is only about 20%. Based on the results of the Atlas of Roma communities, the village was included in the list of 150 municipalities with the most serious MRC situation. In the village, there are field social workers (the programme of field social work) and the local municipal civil patrol service . The programme Healthy regions is not implemented in the village. The village has received the support of OP Human Resources to build a community centre and to increase the capacity of the preschool. According to the data from \u00daPSVAR, as of 31.12.2019, there were 87 registered jobseekers in the village, of which 50 were registered long-term.

Lun\u00edk IX (Ko\u0161ice) Lunik IX is one of the boroughs of the city of Ko\u0161ice. Appr. 7 000 people live in Lun\u00edk IX and the settlement is generally considered the largest Roma ghetto in Europe . The neighbourhood was designed in 1975 with the working title \"ABC\" which was the abbreviation for \u201cArmy-Safety-Gypsies\" (Arm\u00e1da-Bezpe\u010dnos\u0165-Cig\u00e1ni) . It is possible to say that it was a social experiment conducted in the framework of the \"Concept of the solution of the gypsy question\" adopted in the 1970s 48 The ambition was to situate army workers' families and Roma families in one location, and the presence of the members of the armed forces would guarantee safety in the neighbourhood. However, the myth of the ABC concept quickly fell apart, as members of the armed forces were not interested in the apartments in Lun\u00edk IX. The high concentration of Roma families began to be a problem for the non-Roma inhabitants, and they tried to leave the neighbourhood and move to other parts of the city. Lun\u00edk IX gradually became a Roma settlement, and Roma families from other parts of the city, where they had difficulties paying rent or the municipal apartments they inhabited became lucrative real estate in the 1990s 49 , which the city was interested in capitalising on, were moved there. Lun\u00edk IX became not only a Roma neighbourhood, but gradually became a neighbourhood for Roma families with difficulties. A long-term disregard for the problems of the neighbourhood by the city created an unsustainable social situation and a complete destruction of a number of the residential blocks. During recent years, the city proceeded to tear down six apartment houses , which, according to a report of a static engineer , had impaired statics and had become life threatening for the inhabitants. However, the demolition of the apartments took place without providing any alternative accommodation , which has contributed to the creation of additional settlements on the city property (one of the latest ones is for example Ma\u0161li\u010dkovo), in which people are living in substandard conditions (usually in shanties built from various materials) or the families from the demolished apartments have moved to non-residential premises in the existing apartment blocks, which leads to further devaluation of the existing apartment buildings. Currently, according to the Atlas of Roma communities, there are 386 apartments in Lun\u00edk IX, all of which are in theory linked to public water supply, electrical grid, sewage system, and gas. However, many apartments are disconnected from the energy sources and use energy in an unofficial manner, or alternatively, solid materials are used for fuel directly in the apartments. There is a primary school, a preschool, a community centre and an active church congregation directly in the neighbourhood . Field social workers, health assistants, and Roma teaching assistants are present in the neighbourhood. In the latest period, due to ERDF aid, approx. EUR 500 000 was invested in the reconstruction of the preschool . The preschool is known for the inspired artwork of its students and the determination of the teaching staff. 47 Source: SITA, \"Constitutional Court rejected a complaint of the brutality of the police officers during a raid in Moldava. 48 Source: Fil\u010d\u00e1k and Ficeri (2020) Making the Ghetto at Lun\u00edk IX, Slovakia: People, Landfill and the Myth of the Urban Green Space. 49 During socialism, Roma families usually inhabited the historical city centre, since apartments in historical buildings were generally considered as apartments of lower standard.

        "The social and employment situation of Roma communities in Slovakia 37 PE 648.778 According to the data from COLSAF, as of December 31, 2019, there were 303 registered jobseekers in the city, of which 170 were registered long-term. A work activation programme is implemented in the city, and as of December 31, 2018, approx. 80 people were involved in the programme. A number of inhabitants of the neighbourhood moved to the UK and Belgium. One of the most recent efforts to improve the situation is a joint initiative of ETP Slovakia, the city of Ko\u0161ice, and the borough of Ko\u0161ice - Lun\u00edk IX to build a model house similar to individual houses utilizing community construction during which the construction workers acquire professional skills.

RELATED WORK OF OTHER RELEVANT BODIES AND FINDINGS ON THE ROMA SITUATION IN SLOVAKIA This last chapter briefly summarizes key evidence from the related work of the European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights (FRA), Council of Europe (CoE), European Roma Rights Centre (ERRC), and the European Court of Auditors (ECA), along with their findings on the Roma situation in Slovakia. 4.1. Fundamental Rights Agency A 2019 FRA report 50 examines data from the second European Minority and Discrimination Survey (EU-MIDIS II) conducted by FRA in Slovakia and eight other EU-Member States (Bulgaria, Croatia, Czechia, Greece, Hungary, Portugal, Romania and Spain) to compare the situation of Roma women to that of Roma men and to that of women in the general population. The key areas studied were experiences with hate-motivated discrimination, harassment and physical violence, living conditions, employment, education, housing and health. Among some of the specific findings for Slovakia are the following: \u2022 Regrettably, the highest rate of those who have experienced violence motivated by racism among the studied countries is in Slovakia (19% men, 13% women); \u2022 Besides Croatia and Czechia, limitations due to health and long-term activity limitations were more prevalent among Roma than non-Roma in Slovakia; \u2022 Next to Greece and Czechia, Slovakia exhibits the lowest levels of agreement with the statement that \u201cboth girls and boys should stay in school for the same length of time\u201d (74% among Roma men and 75% among Roma women); \u2022 In Slovakia, besides Bulgaria, Greece, and Croatia, the majority of respondents speak Romani as their first main language at home . Interestingly, this is more prevalent among men than women. This linguistic aspect must be taken into account when designing educational policies; \u2022 On the other hand, a significant proportion of respondents (49%) in Slovakia reported that they benefited from the assistance of Roma teaching assistants at schools , whereas, except for Croatia (35%), a rather low shares of respondents reported benefits from such support in the other eight studied Member States (3-11%). 50 Source: https://fra.europa.eu/sites/default/files/fra_uploads/fra-2019-eu-minorities-survey-roma-women_en.pdf. KEY FINDINGS \u2022 The European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights, the Council of Europe, and the European Court of Auditors have engaged with the Roma situation in Slovakia within their missions and mandates. \u2022 There is a broad consensus that permeates through the work and actions of these various organizations and bodies that structural discrimination, school and spatial segregation, anti-Gypsyism, and inadequate policy efforts are some of the key factors precluding progress towards the social and labor market integration of Roma.

        "The social and employment situation of Roma communities in Slovakia 39 PE 648.778 The report concludes that \u201c the results in education and employment show that the EU and its Member States are far from reaching the goals set by the EU Roma inclusion framework , especially for specific, critical indicators, such as the share of early school leavers and the proportion of young people not in employment, education or training. A serious investment in targeted and gender-sensitive measures is therefore required\u201d. In another report 51 , FRA studied the link between Sustainable Development Goals and human rights. In regards to Roma, the report provided country-specific recommendations and highlighted anti-Gypsyism as a driver of structural discrimination and segregation in education . Finally, the FRA report 52 on anti-Gypsyism as a barrier to Roma inclusion, covering nine countries (Bulgaria, Croatia, the Czech Republic, Greece, Hungary, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia and Spain), finds that Roma children face similar risks of verbal abuse at school regardless of the type of neighbourhood they live in , suggesting this being driven by their ethnicity and hence anti-Gypsyism as a cause of such abuse. The report highlighted negative attitudes towards Roma in housing (62% of the population over 18 years of age opposes having Roma as their neighbours, based on the 2017 European Value Survey); however, it also reported that perceived discrimination in housing declined considerably only in Slovakia among the studied countries, with 30% of Roma having felt discriminated against in 2016 (down from 44% in 2011). On the other hand, Slovakia reported the third highest rates of perceived discrimination in access to health services (at 11%, topped by Greece (20%) and Romania (12%)) as well as regards hate-motivated harassment (at 37%, topped by Czechia (56%) and Greece (50%)). 4.2. Council of Europe The Council of Europe has established an ad hoc Committee of Experts on Roma and Traveller Issues (CAHROM) to address the situation of Roma and Travellers in Europe. Operational Platform for Roma Equality (OPRE) is another platform which serves the representatives from equality bodies and human rights institutions to discuss the rights to quality and inclusive education of Roma and Traveller children in the Council of Europe Member States. The Commissioner for Human Rights is an independent and impartial non-judicial institution established in 1999 by the Council of Europe to promote awareness of and respect for human rights in the Member States. Among the key tasks of CAHROM are: (i) review the implementation of policies (national programmes and/or action plans) and identify good practices of Member States concerning Roma and Travellers; (ii) exchange information, views and experience on Member States\u2019 policies and relevant measures for Roma and Travellers; (iii) prepare recommendations, advice and opinions for the Committee of Ministers, including ad hoc opinions on emerging issues requiring urgent attention; (iv) draw up guidelines for the development and/or implementation of policies which promote the rights of the Roma and Travellers; (v) keep under review the situation of Roma and Travellers in Member States; (vi) support the implementation of relevant activities launched by the Council of Europe, particularly within the \u201cThematic Action Plan on the Inclusion of Roma and Travellers (2016-2019)\u201d and follow its implementation; and others. 51 Source: https://fra.europa.eu/sites/default/files/fra_uploads/fra-2019-fundamental-rights-report-2019_en.pdf. 52 Source: https://fra.europa.eu/sites/default/files/fra_uploads/fra-2018-anti-gypsyism-barrier-roma-inclusion_en.pdf.

        "IPOL | Policy Department for Economic, Scientific and Quality of Life Policies PE 648.778 40 The then-Commissioner for Human Rights, Nils Mui\u017enieks paid a country visit to Slovakia in March 2018. Responding to the dire situation of many Roma communities in Slovakia, the Commissioner called on Slovak authorities 53 in 2018 to tackle school and spatial segregation, discrimination, and anti-Gypsyism, including the importance of politicians refraining from perpetuating stereotypes about Roma. 4.3. European Roma Rights Centre The ERRC has prepared a written note 54 on the issues faced by Romani communities in Slovakia. The report documents the situation of Roma communities and EERC actions in three key areas: police ill- treatment and harassment, access to adequate housing, and discrimination in education. For example, in 2017 the ERRC filed an actio popularis claim against the Ministry of the Interior, challenging Police harassment of Roma. Concerning housing, the note documents residential segregation, substandard housing, restricted access to basic infrastructure, and a lack of access to drinking water. Importantly, with many Roma dwellings located either on state owned or private land, the report highlights that many Roma families live under the threat of forced eviction due to insufficient legal protection and an ineffective legalization procedure which could regularize their home ownership. Concerning education, the note concludes that in Slovakia, many Roma children face systemic discrimination and segregation in education , being segregated into Roma-only schools or classes and disproportional channelling into special schools and special classes for children with \u201cmild mental disabilities\u201d. As a result, they are excluded from quality education. 4.4. European Court of Auditors In its report 55 from June 2016, the European Court of Auditors assessed whether EU policy initiatives and financial support had contributed effectively to Roma integration during the previous decade. Whereas some progress was reported, so were obstacles and dilemmas which prevented the programs from having the greatest possible impact. Progress had also been hampered by a lack of suitable data, including data on ethnicity. Whereas significant progress was made in setting out EU policy initiatives promoting Roma integration and all Member States had developed a National Roma Integration Strategy, a number of deficiencies precluding further progress remained . These included (i) a lack of proper budgeting; (ii) a lack of attention to anti-discrimination and, in particular, anti-Gypsyism; (iii) that active Roma representation was not always taken into account; and (iv) a mismatch of resources and responsibilities sometimes undermined the work of the National Roma Contact Points. The report noted a number of improvements in the period 2014-2020 , including Roma inclusion being explicitly referred to in the European Structural and Investment Funds Regulation and having a specific funding priority. In addition, Member States with country-specific recommendations related to Roma integration within the European Semester are obliged to devote EU funds to promoting Roma inclusion. 53 Source: https://www.coe.int/en/web/commissioner/-/slovak-republic-adopt-a-bolder-approach-to-ensure-inclusive-education-and- strengthen-the-safety-of-journalists. 54 Source: http://www.errc.org/uploads/upload_en/file/slovakia-cerd-submission-5-november-2017.pdf. 55 Source: https://www.eca.europa.eu/Lists/ECADocuments/SR16_14/SR_ROMA_EN.pdf.

        "The social and employment situation of Roma communities in Slovakia 41 PE 648.778 The report makes a number of specific points referring to Slovakia . According to the report, Slovakia (along with Bulgaria, Czechia and Greece) only partially met the ex-ante conditionalities (EACs) applicable to ESF OP investment priority IP 9(ii) \u201eIntegration of marginalised communities such as the Roma\u201c, mostly due to the lack of proper monitoring tools or methodology for implementing their National Roma Integration Strategies (NRIS). Along with Croatia, Italy, and Hungary, Slovakia had not met the general EAC concerning anti - discrimination. The report however concluded that Slovakia eventually had met the EAC regarding IP 9(ii) on the basis of the action plan submitted. The report of the European Court of Auditors also makes specific recommendations to Member States and the Commission summarized in Box 1. Box 1: ECA Report recommendations The Member States should take the following steps: \u2022 When revising their National Roma Integration Strategies, they should: a) Specify the level of funding needed for Roma integration measures proposed in their respective strategies; include indicators and targets which deal with anti-discrimination or, more specifically, anti-Gypsyism; b) Ensure that Roma representatives are consulted and included in planning integration measures; and define the role played by National Roma Contact Points in more detail. \u2022 When implementing their operational programmes, they should: a) Make use of best practice criteria for Roma integration in proposals and for selecting projects; and complement current output and results indicators with Roma-specific indicators, where appropriate; b) They should also consider acting together to ensure legal certainty on the use of ESF funds for social inclusion irrespective of a link to employment. The Commission should: a) Ensure that measures carried out under the ESIF are of an inclusive nature and contain provisions aimed at fighting segregation; b) Make full use of the reports from Member States on effective Roma integration measures; c) Ensure that Roma inclusion objectives in their National Roma Integration Strategies are reflected in the ESIF framework; d) Consider legislation to ensure that, from 2020, the distribution of funds among Member States takes into account social inclusion indicators.
