The Co-President recalled the rules applicable. 4. The state of democracy in the EU and in ACP countries Debate with Yves Leterme, Secretary-General of the International Institute for Democracy and Electoral Assistance (International IDEA) Yves Leterme, Secretary-General of International IDEA, made a presentation on the state of democracy in the EU and in ACP countries. Speakers: Adjedoue Weidou (Chad), Davor Ivo Stier, Maria Arena, Younoussa Tondy (Niger), Ana Rita Geremias Sithole (Mozambique), Jo\u00e3o Ferreira, Ahamada Soukouna (Mali), Sonny Ogbuoji (Nigeria), Ignazio Corrao, Michael Gahler, Enrique Guerrero Salom, Jo Leinen, Michela Giuffrida, Mariya Gabriel and Louis Michel. Yves Leterme stressed that International IDEA used the concept of democracy in its broadest sense, while pointing out that there was not just one model. Governments could support and commit to democracy but could not export it to other countries. A democratic system was based on control by citizens and on the equality of all citizens in the exercise of their powers of scrutiny. For Sustainable Development Goal number 16, which promoted democratic institutions as a vehicle of peace, it was important to establish concrete indicators. Members stressed that, even if democratic values were sometimes interpreted differently in different countries, they were intrinsically universal. Issues raised also included the crisis relating to the interface between political leaders and the population, caused by the incapacity of political parties to adapt to a changing global environment, increasing popular demands for political participation and the ever-faster development of technology. 5. Forty years of partnership: evaluation of the impact on trade and development in the ACP countries and prospects for enduring relations between the ACP countries and the European Union Committee on Economic Development, Finance and Trade Co-Rapporteurs: Jacob Oulanyah (Uganda) and David Martin Sanjay Tanna (Uganda) (replacing Jacob Oulanyah) and Enrique Guerrero Salom (replacing David Martin) outlined the report. Speakers: Theodor Dumitru Stolojan, Norbert Neuser, Younoussa Tondy (Niger), Netty Baldeh (Gambia), Daniel K. Shumba (Zimbabwe), Javier Nart, Jo\u00e3o Ferreira, Maria Heubuch, Laura Ferrara, Ousmane Kaba (Guinea), Teshome Toga (Ethiopia), Maurice Ponga, Michael Gahler and Erja Askola (European Commission). There was broad consensus on a generally positive assessment of the ACP-EU partnership but also on the need for it to adapt to new realities and to combat poverty more effectively and stimulate growth, investment, diversification and better access for ACP countries to EU and global markets. Opinions were more varied on the trade and development effects of the Economic Partnership Agreements, with some Members stressing the opportunities they afforded and others criticising them for being more geared to trade than to development. Sanjay Tanna (Uganda) and Enrique Guerrero Salom wound up the debate. 6. Urgent Topic No 2: The post-election situation in Burundi Speakers: Erminia Norarangelo (European External Action Service), Netty Baldeh (Gambia), Louis Michel, Lidia Senra Rodr\u00edguez, Maria Arena, Tulia Ackson (Tanzania), Veikko Nekundi (Namibia), Teshome Toga (Ethiopia), Maria Heubuch, Ignazio Corrao, Anicet Niyongabo (Burundi), Mariya Gabriel, Kashetu Kyenge, Maurice Ponga, Bogdan Brunon Wenta and Joachim Zeller. There was a clear divide between EP and ACP Members on the post-electoral situation in Burundi, mainly over how to interpret the Arusha Peace and Reconciliation Agreement for Burundi in terms of calculating the number of terms of office served by the Burundian President so far. While the EP Members were of the view that the Arusha Agreement had been infringed, the ACP Members considered that both the Burundian and the East African Community judiciary had ruled in favour of the Burundian Government position. There was also disagreement over the decision by the EU to open consultations with the Government of Burundi under Article 96 of the Cotonou Agreement. 18.5.2016 EN Official Journal of the European Union C 179/3 ",
