        "V (Announcements) OTHER ACTS EUROPEAN COMMISSION Publication of a communication of approval of a standard amendment to a product specification for a name in the wine sector as referred to in Article 17(2) and (3) of Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2019/33 (2020/C 70/03) This communication is published in accordance with Article 17(5) of Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2019/33 ( 1 ). COMMUNICATING THE APPROVAL OF A STANDARD AMENDMENT CIGALES Reference number: PDO-ES-A0622-AM02 Date of communication: 26 November 2019 DESCRIPTION OF AND REASONS FOR THE APPROVED AMENDMENT 1. Amendment to the analytical characteristics: reduction in total acidity and increase in total sugars Description and reasons This amendment concerns point 2(a) of the Specification and point 1.4 of the Single Document. The fundamental reason is climate change. In recent years, low precipitation has led to a general decrease in acidity in all grape varieties, resulting in a hike in residual sugars. In order to attain optimum phenolic ripeness, the fruit must be harvested in conditions that take account of the decrease in acidity and the hike in residual sugars. This is considered a standard amendment because it does not imply a substantial change in the characteristics of the product, which retains the characteristics and profile described in the link, which are a consequence of the interaction between natural and human factors. It is thus considered that this amendment does not fall into either of the two categories provided for in Article 14(1) of Regulation (EU) 2019/33. 2. Amendment to the organoleptic characteristics: change to the sensory descriptors Description and reasons This amendment concerns point 2(b) of the Specification and point 1.4 of the Single Document. The organoleptic characteristics of the wines covered have been revised and amended so that these characteristics can be linked to assessable descriptors using a tasting panel meeting the criteria laid down in the UNE-EN-ISO 17025 standard.

        "This is a standard amendment since it does not imply a substantial change in the product characteristics. Rather, it provides a more precise description in line with new techniques in sensory analysis. The characteristics and profile described in the link, which are a consequence of the interaction between natural and human factors, are retained. It is thus considered that this amendment does not fall into either of the two categories provided for in Article 14(1) of Regulation (EU) 2019/33. 3. Amendment to the maximum yield expressed in litres of wine per 100 kilograms of grapes Description and reasons This amendment concerns points 3(b)(1) and 5 of the Specification and points 1.5.1 and 1.5.2 of the Single Document. In recent years, new technologies in wineries, refrigeration and the use of vacuum filters for the classification of must, have led to an increased use of grape juice without causing significant pressure that would impact negatively on quality. The outcome is a higher yield and the same level of quality we require. This is a standard amendment since it does not imply a substantial change in the product characteristics. It is merely to adapt to technological change. It is thus considered that this amendment does not fall into either of the two categories provided for in Article 14(1) of Regulation (EU) 2019/33. 4. Amendment to the minimum planting density Description and reasons This amendment concerns point 3(a)(1) of the Specification and point 1.5.1 of the Single Document. In view of the high average age of vineyards in the area and their adaptation in some cases to new mechanisation, it was not considered logical to exclude old parcels with 3x3 planting patterns, given the poverty of the soil. This would lead to a loss of quality potential in wine production in these more longstanding vineyards. This is a standard amendment since it does not imply a substantial change in the product characteristics. It does not fall into either of the two categories provided for in Article 14(1) of Regulation (EU) 2019/33 on amendments. 5. Amendment concerning \u2019Bag in a box\u2019 containers for export Description and reasons This amendment concerns point 8(b)(2) of the Specification. The Single Document is unaffected. In view of marketing requirements in a number of overseas markets, the decision has been taken to use this kind of container, while preserving the quality and characteristics of the product. In this way, our wines will become better known abroad and the part of our production intended for such markets will increase. This should boost the promotion of the quality of our wines overseas. The Regulatory Council made use of Article 16(4) of its own Regulations, which states as follows: \u2018The Regulatory Council may authorise other special containers and closures for specific uses, where these do not cause a deterioration in the quality or image of the protected wines.\u2019 This amendment only affects the presentation of the product. Its characteristics are unaffected. 6. Corrigendum of wine variety/vineyard and vintages/wines Description and reasons This amendment affects the terminology used in point 7 of the Specification. This does not affect the Single Document. The reason for the change is to make the language more generalised and understandable as regards the sector. This correction only affects the form. EN Official Journal of the European Union C 70/4 4.3.2020 ",
        "7. Corrigendum to section 9(b)(2) on control methodology Description and reasons This correction concerns the fourth heading of point 9(b)(2) on the control of wines. This does not affect the Single Document. An error has been noted in the fourth heading of section 9(b)(2) on the Control of Wines. This has been corrected. Where it read: \u2014 \u2018Qualification of wines \u2014 Qualification process.\u2019 It should read: \u2014 \u2018Control of wines \u2014 Verification of the qualification process...\u2019 SINGLE DOCUMENT 1.

Demarcated geographical area The geographical area of the PDO \u2018Cigales\u2019 extends to the northern area of the Duero Depression on either side of the River Pisuerga. Its surface area is 574 km 2 . It includes the following municipalities: \u2014 Province of Valladolid: Cabez\u00f3n de Pisuerga, Cigales, Corcos del Valle, Cubillas de Santa Marta, Fuensalda\u00f1a, Mucientes, Quintanilla de Trigueros, San Mart\u00edn de Valven\u00ed, Santovenia de Pisuerga, Trigueros del Valle and Valoria la Buena; and the estate known as El Berrocal, bounded by the border of the province of Valladolid, the Valladolid-Fuensalda\u00f1a-Mucientes main road and the River Pisuerga. This estate is part of the municipality of Valladolid. \u2014 Province of Valladolid: Due\u00f1as. EN Official Journal of the European Union 4.3.2020 C 70/9 ",
        "7. Main wine grape variety(ies) VERDEJO TEMPRANILLO - TINTA DEL PAIS RED GRENACHE RED GRENACHE - GREY GRENACHE 8. Description of the link(s) WINE The geographical area covered by the PDO \u2018Cigales\u2019 is highly suited to vineyard cultivation: The vineyard is divided in two by the River Pisuerga and is sited near the river\u2019s midpoint between the cold climate upstream and the temperate climate of its estuary. The interplay between climate and soil helps produce grapes with very balanced acidity and sugar levels. The varieties are very well suited to the area and the wine-making practices that have existed for decades. This makes it possible to obtain very balanced wines. Another characteristic is that 30 % of the vineyard has been in place for over 60 years. Taken together with the conditions mentioned above, this allows for very intense and balanced ripening suited to \u2018crianza\u2019 wines. QUALITY SPARKLING WINES Various attempts in recent years have led to sparkling wines that maintain the distinguishing characteristics of the wines in the area and are also of very high quality (small bubbles that are long in the finish, presence of secondary aromas, etc.). The varieties specific to the area (major adaptation) enable the production of sparkling wines that are very fine and fresh, both in the mouth and at the back of the palate. The climate conditions in the area make it possible to obtain a raw material that is balanced in acidity, extract and aromas. This gives the wine a full mouth-feel that compensates for the acidity. 9. Essential further conditions (packaging, labelling, other requirements) Legal framework: In national legislation Type of further condition: Packaging within the demarcated geographical area Description of the condition: The bottling of wines covered by the PDO \u2018Cigales\u2019 is one of the key criteria for ensuring the characteristics acquired during the production and - where appropriate - ageing process defined in the specification. Because of this, bottling must be performed in the bottling facilities of wineries located in the production area laid down in this specification. Legal framework: In national legislation Type of further condition: Addition provisions relating to labelling Description of the condition: EN Official Journal of the European Union C 70/10 4.3.2020 ",
        "The traditional term \u2018DESIGNATION OF ORIGIN\u2019 may be used instead of \u2018PROTECTED DESIGNATION OF ORIGIN\u2019. A reference to the year of harvest must be included on the label, even if the wines are not aged. An exception is made for sweet and sparkling wines. The indications \u2018CRIANZA\u2019, \u2018RESERVA\u2019, \u2018GRAN RESERVA\u2019 and \u2018ROBLE\u2019 may be used, provided this complies with applicable legislation.
