They describe strategies and measures how the EU Member States intend to address energy efficiency, renewables, greenhouse gas emissions reductions, interconnections, as well as research and innovation. This report analyses the Member States\u2019 plans and measures related to renewable energy and energy savings in the heating and cooling (H&C) sector from 2020 to 2030. Based on the information collected in the final NECPs, this report shows the status of the European H&C market and its development, as well as national actions to achieve the renewable and energy efficiency targets. Moreover, the report provides recommendations assisting the individual EU Member States and the European Commission with increasing the quality of the next NECPs. ",
        "4 Executive summary Policy context National energy and climate plans (NECPs) are part of the \u2018Clean energy for all Europeans\u2019 package. They describe strategies and measures through which the European Union Member States intend to address energy efficiency, renewable energy, greenhouse gas emission reductions, interconnections, and research and innovation. EU Member States were required to submit their final NECPs to the Commission by the end of 2019. This report analyses Member States\u2019 plans and measures related to renewable energy and energy savings in the heating and cooling (H & C) sector from 2020 to 2030. Among other things, it analyses how Member States intend to meet the targets specified in articles of the renewable energy directive (RED II) and the energy efficiency directive (EED). For example, according to Article 23 of RED II, countries should report their annual increase in the share of renewable energy sources in the H & C sector and the role of waste heat and cold. With respect to efficient H & C, Member States are to communicate energy savings as required by Article 7 of the EED, as well as the current potential for the application of high-efficiency co-generation and efficient district heating and cooling (DHC) in accordance with Article 14 of the EED. Main findings The scope of the NECPs is large, and a clear and detailed overview of all sectors is challenging to provide for Member States. Member States addressed various areas related to the H & C sector in their NECPs, which allowed us to assess the status of the European H & C market and its development, as well as national plans and measures to achieve the renewable energy and energy efficiency targets. All EU Member States\u2019 NECPs were analysed with regard to the H & C sector. Although significant efforts had been made to address this sector, there were also many aspects that had not been incorporated by all Member States, for example high-efficiency co-generation and efficient DHC. It was often stated that some information would be provided later, pending their respective analyses carried out in line with other directives, for example a long-term strategy for the renovation of buildings and potential for efficient DHC. Nevertheless, a significant amount of information could be extracted, which allowed the progress achieved to be made visible. The final NECPs anticipated a share of renewable energy in the H & C sector of 23 % in 2020 and a share of 33 % in 2030 ( 1 ). All countries expect to see an increase in this period; however, their levels of ambition vary significantly. Nine countries meet the target set out in Article 23 of RED II of a 1.3 percentage point annual increase in renewables in the H & C sector. Only a few countries provided details about the constraints that caused them not to meet the objectives. Biomass and heat pumps were the dominant renewable technologies in 2018. Biomass accounted for 81 % and heat pumps for 11 % of the final energy consumption from renewables in the H & C sector. The relative contribution of biomass among the renewable H & C technologies is expected to decrease by 2030. However, with a share of 66 %, it will remain the dominant technology in the EU-27 ( 1 ). The contribution from heat pumps was 11.3 Mtoe in 2018, and it is expected to increase to 21.1 Mtoe by 2030, thereby contributing 17 % of renewable H & C. Projections for heat supply from DHC were often not provided. Increased use is envisaged in three countries (BE, LT, NL) and a decline is expected in six countries (CZ, DK, EE, PL, FI, SE). This decrease is mainly due to efficiency improvements in the building stock and district heating networks. Most countries that supplied data on the share of renewable energy in DHC met the target specified in Article 24 RED II of a 10 percentage point increase from 2020 to 2030. ( 1 ) Including 25 Member States of the EU. Data for Spain and Latvia are not included (no data found in the NECPs). ",
        "5 The contribution from waste heat in DHC systems today or in the future (Article 24 of RED II) was not detailed in any of the NECPs, although some countries mentioned that they intended to make use of that resource (e.g. FR). Six Member States (CZ, EE, LU, PT, SI, SK) expect increased heat supply from combined heat and power (CHP)) in the period 2020\u20132030, whereas six countries (DK, DE, ES, NL, AT, FI) expect decreased heat supply from CHP. The mixed trends are due to different market conditions and national priorities. The most common policy concerns achieving energy savings through better insulation of buildings. Overall, 20 Member States have measures for building renovation. Measures related to phasing out fossil fuels in the heating sector were put forward by eight Member States. Measures for greater use of waste heat were presented by seven Member States. Measures concerning the efficiency and RES in industrial H&C processes were not often specified. The policies and measures in the H & C sector were often incomplete and did not set out the amount of savings that would be achieved or the amount of emissions that would be avoided. Regarding investment requirements for the H & C sector, investments in building renovation are most prominent in many countries, followed by investments in the centralised energy supply (district heating network, CHP and modernisation or installation of renewable decentralised heating systems (e.g. heat pumps). Sources of financing were mostly not provided per measure. Key conclusions and recommendations The key conclusions and recommendations are listed below for the attention of the European Commission and EU Member States. The recommendations aim to enhance the quality of future NECPs, in terms of compliance with the governance regulation and the implementation of RED II and the EED, while helping to enhance their planning value and providing clear directions and seamless integration with the long-term objectives on renewable energy and energy efficiency. The recommendations are not obligatory for the European Commission or the Member States, but suggestions for improvement, and are solely the views of the authors of this study. Conclusion 1. The ambition to increase the share of renewables in the H & C sector is often lower than that in the power sector. The objectives of Articles 23 and 24 of RED II are not met in many NECPs. Moreover, most of the plans did not provide explanations about the constraints that caused the Member States not to meet the targets. \uf0be Recommendation 1.1. For the next NECPs, it is essential for countries not meeting the targets for the share of renewable energy in the H & C sector to increase their level of ambition, given the important role of this sector in fulfilling the EU\u2019s climate and energy goals. \uf0be Recommendation 1.2. Some NECPs did not describe the technologies that are intended to be used to meet the targets. In the next NECPs, it is advised that the contribution from the renewable H & C technologies with the largest share be provided. \uf0be Recommendation 1.3. Five NECPs present plans to phase out fossil fuels to decarbonise the H & C sector. These plans could serve as best practice examples for other countries so that they can reach carbon neutrality by 2050. \uf0be Recommendation 1.4. The next NECPs could be improved by explaining constraints to justify the underachievement of targets. Only a handful of Member States discussed such limitations for the H & C sector. Conclusion 2. The potential use of waste heat and cold is often overlooked. Seven Member States described measures enabling and promoting the use of waste heat from industry, whereas only four NECPs presented an intention to increase the use of waste heat. \uf0be Recommendation 2.1. Member States should increase their efforts to systematically identify, describe and quantify sources of waste heat and cold. The comprehensive assessments to be performed in accordance with Article 14(1) of the EED could provide the framework. In addition, measures to exploit waste heat and cold should be explored. ",
        "6 Conclusion 3. In some NECPs, it was assumed that co-generated heat from CHP could be counted as waste heat to meet renewable H & C targets. \uf0be Recommendation 3.1 . The Commission should clarify the definition of waste heat and cold and how to account it towards the heating and cooling targets in Articles 23, 24 of the RED II. Conclusion 4. In total, 14 NECPs presented information on the potential for high-efficiency co- generation (high-efficiency combined heat and power (HECHP)). Seven expect to see a decrease and seven anticipate an increase in heat consumption from HECHP. \uf0be Recommendation 4.1. The Commission should analyse why the increased use of HECHP was successful in some countries and not in others. Is it due to different incentives, market conditions, etc.? \uf0be Recommendation 4.2. Use the next comprehensive assessment under Article 14(1) of the EED to reassess the importance of HECHP. Conclusion 5. The measures related to renewables and energy savings in the H & C sector are, in most cases, provided with limited description. A better description of such measures would help understanding their impact on reaching the targets. \uf0be Recommendation 5.1. All measures presented would significantly improve in quality if a description, anticipated energy savings or emission reductions, years of implementation, and planned investments were provided. Conclusion 6. Cooling is addressed by only six NECPs, although its importance is expected to grow in the future. \uf0be Recommendation 6.1. Member States are encouraged to increase their focus on the cooling sector. Conclusion 7 . Data collection and completeness for H & C could be improved. The target year for the estimated trajectories was not 2030 in all cases. \uf0be Recommendation 7.1. Improve data collection procedures at Member State level for technology contributions, waste heat, process heat, CHP. \uf0be Recommendation 7.2. Clarify which time frame and target year the NECPs should cover. \uf0be Recommendation 7.3. Ensure the usage of the Annex I of the Energy Governance ( 2 ) , since it clarifies which data should be provided. In addition, the template could be expanded to cover more data. Conclusion 8. The timing of some directives and the timing of the NECPs are not aligned, which often led Member States to claim that some information was missing but that it would be updated soon, for example their long-term strategy for the renovation of buildings and comprehensive assessments related to Article 14 of the EED, which were due by the end of April 2020 and December 2020, respectively. \uf0be Recommendation 8.1. It would benefit future NECP assessments if important outputs of directives could be prepared in time to provide an input to the next NECP. The Commission could reflect on whether the timing of outputs from other directives could be amended to better feed into the NECP analyses.

        "7 1. Introduction The national energy and climate plans (NECPs) are part of the \u2018Clean energy for all Europeans\u2019 package, and describe strategies and measures for the period 2021\u20132030 designed to achieve the EU\u2019s 2030 energy and climate targets. One of the objectives is to break the silos across policies and sectors to define a pathway to 2030. European Union Member States were required to submit the final NECPs for the period 2021\u20132030 to the Commission by the end of 2019 in accordance with the governance regulation ( 3 ). Progress reports should be submitted every 2 years. The national plans outline how the EU Member States intend to address energy efficiency, renewables, greenhouse gas emission reductions, interconnections, and research and innovation. This report analyses the heating and cooling (H & C) aspects for the energy efficiency and renewable dimensions. H & C in buildings and industry accounted for 46 % of the EU\u2019s final energy consumption (FEC) in 2018. From this, 21 % was generated by renewable energy ( 4 ), whereas almost 80 % of the heating energy was still being generated by fossil fuels. Hence, the European H & C sector plays an important role in fulfilling the EU\u2019s climate and energy goals. This report assesses Member States\u2019 targets, projections, strategies and measures for the H & C sector, as provided in the final NECPs. It evaluates the extent to which Member States\u2019 incorporated the H & C sector to decarbonise their energy systems, highlights missed opportunities and provides recommendations on how to improve the next round of NECPs in 2029. The report includes an assessment of the following parts of the NECPs: \uf0be estimated trajectories of total final energy consumption (TFEC) in the H & C sector, and quantity and shares of renewable energy in FEC for H & C from 2021 to 2030; \uf0be renewable energy technologies to achieve the trajectories for H & C, bioenergy demand and renewable energy in district heating; \uf0be compliance with the targets of Article 23 of the RED II (increase of RES share in the H & C sector, the role of waste heat and cold, constrains for not meeting the requirements); \uf0be compliance with the targets of Article 24 of the RED II (plans to increase the share of RES in DHC, if applicable); \uf0be energy efficiency measures used to reach the savings targets; \uf0be policies and measures to achieve the trajectories for the H & C sector, including sector- and technology- specific measures, measures on financial support, and measures under Article 7 of the EED; \uf0be current potential for the application of high-efficiency cogeneration, waste heat, and efficient DHC (in accordance with Article 14(1) of the EED); and \uf0be impact assessment of planned policies and measures. The structure of the report is as follows. Chapter 2 concerns the current H & C FEC, the forecast until 2030, the share of renewable energy, and energy savings. Chapter 3 addresses the policies and measures presented by Member States with which they intend to meet the targets. Chapter 4 contains the recommendations on how the next round of NECPs can be improved. ( 3 ) Under the Governance Regulation (Regulation on the governance of the energy union and climate action (EU)2018/1999), the EU Member States develop integrated national energy and climate plans based on a common template. ( 4 ) Own calculation based on Eurostat data (SHARES tool data) (https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/web/energy/data/shares ). ",
        "8 2. Current situation and projections 2.1. Background The governance regulation requires Member States to report an indicative national trajectory for the overall share of renewable energy in gross FEC from 2021 to 2030, including the sectorial share of renewable FEC in the H & C sector. This also includes estimated renewable energy trajectories per technology and sector in million tonnes of oil equivalent (Mtoe) and installed capacity. In this chapter, we analyse the data provided in the NECPs for the current situation and projections. The analysis concerns primarily the completeness of information, whether targets were met, and the priorities selected by Member States. As the NECPs should reflect the annual increase in the share of renewable energy in the H & C sector provided for in Directive (EU) 2018/2001 (Article 23), we estimate compliance with this article, including the role of waste heat and cold, and the constraints that caused Member States not to meet the requirements. Next, we show the role of renewable technologies (biomass, heat pumps, solar thermal, geothermal and municipal waste) in achieving the sectorial trajectories for renewable energy. Furthermore, we analyse the FEC for DHC and the share of renewable energy sources (RESs) in this sector. 2.2. Final energy consumption and renewable sources Following the governance regulation, Member States have to provide the estimated trajectories for the share of renewable energy in the H & C sector and the FEC by renewables in the H & C sector from 2021 to 2030. Using these two data sets, we estimated the TFEC for H & C until 2030. These data were compared with Eurostat data from 2018. The current TFEC for H & C made up 46 % of the TFEC for the 27 EU Member States (EU-27) in 2018 (TFEC for H & C amounted to 467.2 Mtoe). H & C makes up more than 50 % of the TFEC in nine Member States (see Table 1). The highest TFEC was in Germany (109.2 Mtoe), followed by France (61.2 Mtoe) and Italy (55.5 Mtoe). The TFEC for H & C is estimated to decrease by more than 10 % from 2020 to 2030 in the EU-27 (excluding Spain and Latvia ( 5 )). The highest decreases are expected in Luxembourg, Slovenia and Italy, where reductions of 29 %, 18 % and 16.5 % between 2020 and 2030 are predicted, respectively. Germany, Ireland, France, Poland and Slovakia have reductions of at least 10 % in FEC in the H & C sector. However, five countries show an increasing trend over the same period: Croatia, Cyprus, Lithuania, Malta and Sweden. The share of renewable energy in the H & C sector amounted to 21 % in 2018 in the EU-27. It was expected to reach 23 % in 2020 and is expected to reach 33 % in 2030 (Spain and Latvia are not included). The share of renewable energy was above 50 % by 2020 in Denmark, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Finland ( 6 ). In Sweden, this share was above 60 % ( 7 ). Several countries report a low share of RESs in the H & C sector. All countries increase their share of renewable energy in the H & C sector from 2020 to 2030. However, the levels of ambition vary considerably between Member States. The highest increase in the RES share in the H & C sector is estimated in Luxembourg (16.8 %), followed by Lithuania (16.3 %) and Greece (12.4 %). The lowest increase is expected in Sweden (3 %), followed by Belgium (3.3 %) and Malta (3.7 %). ( 5 ) No data are available in their NECPs. ( 6 ) Above 50 %, a Member State has to achieve half of the renewable increase requirement, i.e. 5.5 or 6.5 percentage points per year (Article 23(2)(c) of the renewable energy directive).

        "10 As mentioned above, nearly 50 % of FEC is used for H & C purposes in Europe. The remaining energy is consumed by the transport and electricity sectors. The trajectories of the share of RESs in these three sectors can be seen in Figure 1 . In 18 countries, the electricity sector has the largest share of renewable energy, compared with the other two sectors, in 2020. This situation remains in 2030. Denmark, Estonia, Austria and Sweden expect to reach more than 80 % of the RES share in electricity consumption by 2030. There are four countries with a larger share than 60 % in the H & C sector by 2030: Sweden (72 %), Lithuania (67 %), Estonia (63 %) and Denmark (60 %). Biomass energy is an important contributor to RESs in the H & C sector in these countries. The transport sector lags far behind other sectors. In 19 countries, the share of RESs in this sector stays below 20 % in 2030. Sweden, Finland and Spain show the most ambitious development of renewable energy in the transport sector and plan to reach 48 %, 45 % and 28 %, respectively. ",

Data source: European Commission (2019). Austria *: the overall RES share ranges from 46-50% 2.3. Renewable target under Article 23 of the renewable energy directive Regarding Article 23(1) of the renewable energy directive (RED II), Member States must endeavour to increase their RES shares in FEC for H & C by an indicative 1.3 percentage points as annual average counting for the periods 2021\u20132025 and 2026\u20132030, starting from the share of renewable energy in the H & C sector in 2020. Article 23(1) also indicates that this increase must be limited to 1.1 percentage points for Member States in which waste heat and cold is not used. If the share of RESs in the H & C sector in 2020 is above 60 %, Member States may count any such share as fulfilling the average annual increase (see Article 23(2b)); if the share is above 50 % and up to 60 %, Member States may count any such share as fulfilling half of the average annual increase (see Article 23(2c)). Member States must provide any information as to the constraints that may have caused them not to meet the requirements, such as structural barriers arising from the high share of natural gas or cooling, or from a dispersed settlement structure with a low population density. Table 2 shows the RES share in the H & C sector in 2020, and the average annual increase in the RES share in the H & C sector by 2025 and 2030. It also indicates whether Member States take waste heat and cold into account and whether the constraints that caused Member States not to meet the requirements are provided ( 13 ). Considering all criteria from Article 23(1 and 2), we identified whether Member States meet the requirements. Member States that do not meet the requirements are highlighted in red, whereas those that meet the requirements are highlighted in green. Nine countries (Estonia, Ireland, Greece, Spain, France, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Finland and Sweden) meet their targets, whereas 13 countries do not meet them, and five countries are expected to comply in one of the periods (2020\u20132025 or 2026\u20132030) but not in the other period.

        "13 Czechia, Latvia, Malta, Portugal and Romania provided information on the constraints that caused them not to meet the requirements (see the list below). Looking at the fuel mix for H & C, planned policy measures, ambiguity in scenario calculation and data used, we identified the barriers that might influence a slow increase in RESs in the H & C sector. These barriers are as follows. \uf0be Natural gas as an alternative to coal. The projected low share of RESs in Bulgaria may be attributed to the country\u2019s shift from coal to natural gas. In Czechia, natural gas is further promoted and seen as an alternative to coal. Poland\u2019s policy objectives suggest that the use of natural gas is an important alternative to coal. \uf0be Natural gas as the most cost-effective investment. In Romania, the calculation assumptions considered the most cost-effective investments to cover the national heat demand, which is natural gas. That is why the use of natural gas in heating processes is expected to increase. \uf0be Reduction in biomass due to energy efficiency improvements. In Latvia, the reduction in energy consumption due to the renovation of buildings using old decentralised solid biomass boilers is identified as a constraint that caused the country not to meet the requirements. \uf0be Untapped potential. Bulgaria has high geothermal energy potential. However, scenarios show a slow increase in geothermal use by 2030. The country promotes studies mapping the potential and analysing the utilisation of geothermal. \uf0be Ambiguity in scenario calculation. \u25cf Portugal does not include consumption by heat pumps in its calculation of the share of RESs in the TFEC for H & C. This can result in the country not meeting the targets specified in Article 23 of RED II. It is said that Portugal will revise these numbers by considering ambient heat for heat pumps. \u25cf Denmark has defined the political measures for the period until 2024, but it is not clear what will happen afterwards. Clarification is needed as to how the period after 2024 was calculated and whether the same political measures apply. \u25cf Similarly, the analysis of France ends in 2028. \uf0be RESs in the H & C sector are already high. Romania\u2019s NECP states that the share of RESs in the H & C sector is already relatively high. It was estimated at 25.6 % in 2020. \uf0be Lack of statistics for biomass consumption. In Romania, the national statistics on biomass are incomplete. Houses in rural areas use firewood, which is difficult to count. \uf0be Lack of indigenous resources and infrastructure. In Malta, the lack of a natural gas distribution system on the Maltese territory excludes the option of blending biogas. The country has no sources of indigenous biomass. \uf0be The dispersion of housing /inhabitants in Romania\u2019s rural areas is a constraint. \uf0be Misunderstanding of definitions. The definition of waste heat is not clear in the directives. Croatia assumed that co-generated heat is waste heat, which in most cases is not correct. The Commission should clarify the definition of waste heat and cold. 2.4. Renewable energy technologies To estimate the contribution of renewable technologies in achieving the sectorial trajectories for renewable energy from 2021 to 2030, we assess the estimated trajectories by renewable energy technology provided by Member States in their NECPs. First of all, we estimate data for 2018, which were obtained from the SHARES tool. For 2030, we take the TFEC in the H & C sector by RESs in 2030, as given in the countries\u2019 sectorial trajectories, and the FEC by renewable technologies. ",
        "14 Biomass was the dominant renewable fuel in all Member States in 2018. According to the SHARES tool data (Eurostat), the use of biomass in the H & C sector amounted to 79 975 ktoe in 2018, which is 81 % of the total usage of RESs in this sector. The use of biomass is expected to decrease by 2030; however, with a share of 66 %, it remains the dominant technology in the EU-27 ( 17 ) in 2030. Heat pumps are the second most-used renewable technology, and account for the largest relative growth among RESs in the H & C sector in EU-27 over the period 2020\u20132030. In 2018, heat pumps provided 11 316 ktoe, which equated to 11 % of the total RESs in this sector. This amount is expected to increase to 21 130 ktoe by 2030, thereby contributing 17 % of RESs in the H & C sector. The use of solar thermal amounted to 2 414 ktoe in 2018 and the use of geothermal energy ( 18 ) amounted to 848.97 ktoe ( 19 ), which equated to 2 % and 1 % of the total usage of RESs in this sector, respectively. To show the share of renewable technologies contributing to the total H & C sector trajectories for renewable energy, we introduce an \u2018unknown\u2019 category (see Figure 2), which serves as residual (the difference between the TFEC for renewable H & C and the sum of FEC by specific renewable H & C technologies). This discrepancy could be interpreted as resulting from a lack of data, since some Member States focused on the main technologies to be relied on to reach the sectorial target. In some Member States, the sum of the individual RES technologies is slightly higher than TFEC in the H & C sector by RESs. ( 17 ) Data for Spain and Latvia are not included (no data found in the NECPs). ( 18 ) Excluding low-temperature geothermal heat in heat pump applications.

        "16 Biomass Biomass was the dominant renewable fuel in all Member States in 2018, except in Cyprus and Malta. In the following Member States, biomass made up more than 90 % of the TFEC by renewables in the H & C sector: Romania (99 %), Lithuania (98 %), Latvia (97 %), Croatia (97 %), Poland (96 %), Belgium (92 %), Hungary (91 %), Finland (91 %), Czechia (91 %), Luxembourg (91 %) and Slovenia (90 %). In 2030, biomass remains the dominant renewable H & C technology. The following countries expect to reach a share higher than 80 %: Finland (95 %), Hungary (92 %), Romania (91 %), Bulgaria (89 %), Czechia (87 %), Estonia (87 %), Croatia (87 %), Sweden (87 %), Belgium (80 %), Luxembourg (80 %) and Slovakia (80 %). In most of the Member States, biomass consumption is estimated to increase by 2030, except in Italy, Lithuania, Portugal, Slovenia and Slovakia. In Lithuania and Slovakia, the use of biomass increases until 2020, but it is expected to decrease thereafter. The projections for Denmark show an increase from 2020 to 2025 and a decrease after 2025. The highest predicted increase in biomass consumption is in Hungary, Luxembourg, Bulgaria and France. From 2020 to 2030, the use of biomass is expected to increase by 40 %, 39 %, 36 % and 33 % in these countries, respectively. Heat pumps In 2018, ambient energy from heat pumps made up more than 20 % of the total RESs in the H & C sector in the following countries: Malta (61 %), Portugal (25 %), Cyprus (24 %), Italy (24 %), Greece (21 %) and France (20 %). In 2030, the share of heat pumps is the highest in Cyprus (90 %), Malta (79 %), Italy (38 %) and Greece (36 %). Meanwhile, all countries expect to see an increase in FEC by heat pumps over the period 2020\u20132030. The highest increase can be seen in Spain (1 046 %), followed by Hungary (467 %), Belgium (234 %) and Poland (195 %). However, the highest FEC in 2030 is in Italy (5 700 ktoe), followed by France (4 500 ktoe) ( 20 ). It should be noted that there is no common European accounting methodology for renewable cooling yet. Therefore, it is likely that some Member States will update the amount of ambient energy from heat pumps for cooling later. Solar thermal The highest share of solar thermal in total RESs in the H & C sector in 2018 was in Cyprus (38.9 %), followed by Malta (27.3 %) and Greece (18.3 %). Germany had the highest consumption of solar thermal in 2018 (763 ktoe), followed by Spain (324.3 ktoe) and Greece (277 ktoe). The highest relative increases over the period 2020\u20132030 are seen in Denmark, Italy, Luxembourg, Poland and Slovakia. In 2030, the highest share of solar thermal in the H & C sector is estimated to be in Cyprus (35.5 %), followed by Greece (16.7 %). Geothermal The highest share of geothermal in total RESs in the H & C sector in 2018 was in Slovenia (8.3 %), followed by Hungary (6.7 %) and the Netherlands (4.5 %), according to the SHARES tool. Projections for geothermal usage in 2020 and 2030 were missing for most Member States. Countries that provided data showed substantial increases from 2020 to 2030: Slovakia (689 %), Czechia (443 %), Belgium (432 %), Croatia (300 %), the Netherlands (233 %), Italy (126 %), Austria (125 %), France (95 %), Lithuania (62 %), Hungary (38 %) and Poland (10 %). ( 20 ) Data for Germany, Latvia and Lithuania are not included. ",
        "17 Municipal waste According to data from the SHARES tool, the use of municipal waste in the H & C sector amounted to 3 889 ktoe ( 21 ) in 2018, which was 4 % of total RESs in the H & C sector. Two Member States, Denmark and Poland, counted municipal waste in their RESs in the H & C projection. In Denmark, municipal waste is estimated to decrease from 386 ktoe in 2020 to 369 ktoe in 2030. In Poland, there is an increase from 81.4 ktoe in 2020 to 110.5 ktoe in 2030. 2.5. District heating and cooling under Article 24 of the renewable energy directive Member States were asked to provide, if applicable, other national trajectories and objectives, including long-term or sectorial ones (e.g. share of renewable energy in district heating, renewable energy use in buildings). Moreover, Member States were requested to describe the implementation of both Article 24(4a) and Article 24(10) of RED II if applicable. In accordance with Article 24(4a), Member States should increase the annual share of energy from renewable sources and from waste heat and cold in DHC by at least 1 percentage point for the periods 2021\u20132025 and 2026\u20132030, starting from the share in 2020. If that share in 2020 is above 60 %, the Member State may count any such share as fulfilling the average annual increase. Member States may decide not to apply Article 24(4a) if they fulfil the criteria defined in Article 24(10) (points a, b or c) of RED II. Considering all criteria from Article 24(4 and 10), we identify whether Member States meet the requirements. To estimate the TFEC for DHC and the share of RESs, we use the national trajectories and objectives for energy in this sector. Table 3 shows data on FEC by DHC, FEC of renewables in the DHC sector, and the RES share in the DHC sector in 2018, 2020 and 2030. Trajectories for DHC were often missing in the NECPs. Although two countries (LT, NL) estimate an increasing energy consumption over the period 2020\u20132030, six countries (CZ, DK, EE, PL, FI, SE) show decreasing energy consumption. This decrease is mainly due to efficiency improvements in the building stock and district heating networks. Member States were asked to provide information on gross final consumption of waste heat and cold from DHC. These data were not provided for most of the countries. However, some countries mentioned that they intend to exploit waste heat for district heating. Three Member States provided targets for RES use in the DHC sector: Estonia, Lithuania and Poland. ( 21 ) Excluding Ireland, Greece, Croatia, Malta, Portugal and Slovenia (data for these countries were not provided or are equal to zero). ",

        "19 Only eight countries assessed or discussed Article 24(4a) in their NECPs. Based on the projections for the FEC of RESs from DHC and the criteria from Article 24(4a), we identified whether the following Member States meet the requirements: Denmark. The RES share in DHC amounted to more than 70 % in 2020. This country automatically meets the target specified in Article 24(4a) of RED II, since its share of renewable energy in district heating was higher than 60 % in 2020. Estonia. This Member State provides the FEC of RESs from DHC for 2018, 2020 and 2030. Its sectorial target is 80 % RESs in the DHC sector in 2030. Considering the fact that the share of RESs in the DHC sector amounted to 51.6 % in 2017, Estonia significantly exceeds the requirements of Article 24(4). Ireland. The current share of DHC in TFEC for H & C was approximately 0.8 %, which is below the 2 % set in Article 24(10)(a) of RED II. Therefore, Ireland is not required to apply Article 24(4). Latvia. The share of RESs in the DHC sector accounted for 46.7 % in 2018. According to the projections, the share of renewable energy in district heating will increase from 44.9 % in 2020 to 58.4 % in 2030. Hence, Latvia meets the requirements of Article 24(4a). Lithuania . District heating plays a key role in the overall decarbonisation of the H & C sector. The country has set a target to reach 90 % renewable energy share in the total district heating sector by 2030. The share of RESs was expected to reach 71.7 % in 2020. In addition, the share of renewable energy in district heating was already higher than 60 % in 2020, meaning that Lithuania fulfils Article 24(4a). Poland. The NECP contains different messages concerning RESs in the DHC sector. However, it says that the share of RESs in the DHC sector was 2 % in 2015 (coal made up 90 %) and is projected to increase to 29 % by 2030. It also says that the country\u2019s goal is to increase the share of renewable energy in the DHC sector to 47 % by 2020 and to 72 % by 2030. In either case, Poland meets the requirements of Article 24(4a) to increase the share by 1 percentage point annually. Romania. This Member State did not give details of the renewable share of RESs in the DHC sector. However, according to the scenario with planned measures, the renewable energy used in district heating, with geothermal energy as source, is projected to increase from 31 ktoe in 2016 to 45 ktoe in 2030. This would not meet the requirements of Article 24(4). Finland. Article 24(10) states that a Member State must not be required to apply paragraphs 2\u20139 of Article 24 if its share of high-efficiency combined heat and power (HECHP) and efficient DHC systems constitutes over 90 % of total sales of its DHC. According to Finland\u2019s current calculations, their share exceeds 90 %, which means that the country will be obliged to implement only paragraph 1 of Article 24. However, Finland still aims to increase the share of renewables and waste heat in district heating. The share of renewable energy in district heating increases from about 50 % in 2020 to around 75 % in 2030 (including waste heat). ( 32 ) Target.

Co-generation of heat and power Countries must provide trajectories for heat generation from combined heat and power (CHP) plants, and the current potential for the application of HECHP and efficient DHC in accordance with Article 14(1) of Directive 2012/27/EU (European Union, 2012). The information provided by Member States is summarised in Table 4. According to the NECPs, heat generation from CHP plants is expected to increase in Czechia, Estonia, Luxembourg, Portugal, Slovakia and Slovenia. Less generation is expected in Denmark, Germany, Spain, the Netherlands, Austria and Finland. Malta expects a stable development of heat generation from CHP plants until 2030. Other Member States did not provide estimations of the potential for new CHP, but supporting measures for new installations were mentioned in Bulgaria, Czechia, Greece, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland and Romania (see Section 3.5 ). Some countries said that they would perform the analysis in 2020 for the update on the comprehensive assessment related to energy efficiency in the H & C sector (Article 14 of the energy efficiency directive (EED)). The reasons mentioned for a decline in heat generation from CHP vary. In Germany, electricity generation from CHP plants is expected to decline long term because of the expansion of wind and photovoltaics (PVs). Similarly, in Denmark, the percentage of district heating demand that heat generation from CHP supplies is expected to decrease from 73 % in 2012 to 63 % in 2025 because of the integration of RES electricity into the power grid. In Spain, approximately 2 400 MW of CHP will exceed its regulatory useful life by 2030. A supporting measure is envisaged during the period 2021\u2013 2030, which boosts high-efficiency co-generation of 1 200 MW. In Finland, almost 70 % of heat supply in district heating was based on CHP in 2017. Owing to the ban on coal in energy production, coal CHP plants will mainly be replaced by heat-only boilers using biomass. In the Netherlands, the deployment of centralised CHP is expected to decrease because of unfavourable competitive position, but decentralised CHP in industry and horticulture are expected to continue to be profitable until 2030. In 2017, CHP plants provided about 4.3 Mtoe of heat in the Netherlands. This is expected to decline to 3 Mtoe by 2030. According to the Austrian NECP, HECHP is already widely used in Austria. Heat generation from CHP plants accounted for 17 083 GWh ( 40 ) in 2020 and is expected to account for 16 368 GWh ( 41 ) in 2030. Table 4.

        "23 3. Policies and measures 3.1. Background The governance regulation emphasises how to meet the EU\u2019s 2030 energy and climate targets. The main objectives of the regulation are to implement integrated strategies and measures to achieve the goals (European Parliament, 2018). This chapter describes Member States\u2019 existing and planned measures for energy efficiency and renewable H & C to achieve the 2030 goals. 3.2. National objectives and measures We collected the existing and planned measures for the H & C sector provided in both the energy efficiency and renewable energy dimensions of the NECPs. The policies and measures of Member States and the instruments used are summarised in Table 5 and Table 6 . Existing measures ( 55 ) are measures that have already been implemented, whereas planned measures ( 56 ) are likely to be implemented. Countries promote renewable H & C systems and energy efficiency improvements using the following instruments: \uf0be economic (direct subsidies, grants, preferential loans, tax incentives), \uf0be regulatory (building codes, RES heating obligations), \uf0be other instruments (information, advice, capacity building, qualification, quality assurance).

Improving thermal insulation for buildings is the most common measure in the NECPs. The instrument used is usually economic support, for example subsidies. The second most common is financial support for decentralised RES installation, for example heat pumps. Half of the countries support modernising centralised heating systems, and heating networks, as well as the installation of renewables in this sector. Eight countries intend to make use of financial incentives and five intend to make use of regulatory provisions to phase out the use of fossil fuels by replacing them with RESs. There are only a few countries that presented existing measures for energy efficiency in industry in their NECP. However, there are several countries with planned policies for this sector. Policies for waste heat were found in seven countries. However, the descriptions of these policies are vague in most cases. It should be emphasised that the information about policies and measures provided by the Member States is often incomplete. Details about measures are often missing, such as (i) expected benefit, such as energy savings, (ii) an indicative timeline, and (iii) the source and amount of budget required. However, several countries identified concrete objectives for the H & C sector. Some of these objectives are summarised in Table 7 . Table 7. Objectives for the H & C sector. Data source: European Commission (2019). Member State Objectives Belgium Phase out back-up coal in residential sector by 2030; start exit from heating oil from 2025; start exit from natural gas in 2030 (in Brussels).

Usage of waste heat with the yearly contribution of 0.45 TWh (15 % of the theoretical potential). Installation of new RES boilers, installed capacity 200 MW until 2030. By 2030, the target is to renovate 5 000 multi-family houses and 500 yearly (equal to an area of 750 000 m\u00b2). Luxembourg Renovation objective for the existing housing stock: 3 % renovation rate at 72 % renovation depth, on average. Hungary By 2030, at least 200 000 households must have roof-mounted solar panels with an average power of 4 kW. Hungary\u2019s objective is to reduce the gas import ratio to close to 70 % by 2030 by reducing energy consumption and increasing domestic production. Malta NA Netherlands Cannot connect new houses to gas network from 2020, and 1.5 million homes should have switched from gas by 2030.

Sustainability of biomass Biomass is the largest RES contributing to the H & C trajectories for renewable energy from 2021 to 2030. This biomass, however, must be produced in a sustainable manner. Since biomass production involves activities ranging from the growing of feedstock to final energy conversion, Member States addressed the sustainability of biomass in different ways. Although RED II sets out sustainability criteria for bioenergy through different provisions, including indirect land use change, more clarification and harmonisation of information on this topic are needed in the next NECPs. We collected pieces of information about the sustainability of biomass provided by Member States and grouped them as follows. \uf0be Linking to their national bioeconomy strategy and the forestry development plans. In the Austrian NECP, it is stated that bioenergy is addressed in the national bioeconomy strategy. France refers to the national bioeconomy mobilisation strategy, which identifies three major challenges: the preservation of soil quality, and the preservation and enhancement of biodiversity. In Estonia, wood for energy is in line with the forestry development plan. In Hungary, the forest act obliges forest owners to replace their felled forests in accordance with the required minimum level of quality and time limit, thereby guaranteeing the sustainability of forests at national level and the continued provision of their various services. \uf0be Ensuring that the sustainability of biomass meets the criteria from RED II. In Hungary, domestic forest management meets the criteria laid down in RED II. In Ireland, the Support Scheme for Renewable Heat includes detailed sustainability criteria in line with the RED II. \uf0be Promoting the use of waste and forest residues. In Germany, bioenergy should be based more on waste and residual materials in the future. In Finland, a major share of wood fuels is derived from waste and residues, including black liquor originating from the pulp-making process and bark, sawdust and other industrial wood residues. Croatia describes three main aspects regarding the sustainability of biomass, including the collection and treatment of agricultural plantations and residues for energy use. In Greece, the use of biomass for energy or fuel production is limited in relation to the availability of residual biomass. Its use should take into account the characteristics of domestic farming activities, competitiveness and the potential for the development of supply chains. \uf0be Establishing certification schemes and documentation. According to the voluntary Danish industry agreement on sustainable biomass, 90 % of the biomass used must be sustainable, and its sustainability must be documented. The remaining 10 % must also be sustainable, but there is no need for documentation. In Lithuania, bioenergy sustainability is ensured by forestry certificates showing product quality and sustainability in the whole chain from production to supply. ",
        "30 \uf0be Introducing instruments promoting sustainable biomass. Luxembourg plans to extend the European sustainability criteria to large CHP installations (> 20 MW) (the new Directive (EU) 2018/2001) and to set up criteria for biomass used in smaller CHP plants. For example, plants with a rated electrical output above 10 MW using biomass or waste wood should comply with these sustainability criteria to obtain the feed-in tariff/market premium. In the Netherlands, sustainability criteria will be developed for different types of bioenergy. Subsidies will be used to stimulate the use of sustainable biomass. \uf0be Increasing use of domestic biomass . Cyprus anticipates future use of biofuels from waste. Whether it is sustainable is not discussed. In Italy, 27.5 % of the sustainable biofuels were produced domestically in 2017. \uf0be Sustainable management. There is a plan for the sustainable management of biomass in Flanders and Wallonia (Belgium). In Wallonia, Belgium, most biomass is produced domestically. \uf0be Biogas production. Several countries addressed domestic biogas production. In Belgium, increased biomethane use is anticipated for CHP, heat alone and the transport sector. A study shows a potential amount of 656 ktoe. It will preferably be based on the treatment of waste, and agricultural, household and industrial uses. Biogas is planned to be injected into the natural gas grid. In Croatia, an advanced biofuel market development plan is one of the measures regarding the sustainability of biomass. In Slovakia, biomethane is seen as one of the key fuels to decarbonise the H & C sector. The intention is primarily to decarbonise the district heating systems by using biomethane CHP as a fuel. \uf0be The NECPs of Bulgaria, Spain, Latvia, Portugal and Romania did not consider the sustainability of biomass. Although the Italian NECP does not address the sustainability of bioenergy, it states that only sustainable bioenergy is included in trajectories for biomass and biofuels. Other information on the sustainability of biomass provided by Member States: In France, beyond the existing limit for conventional biofuels, the incorporation of biofuels from feedstock with a high risk of causing indirect land-use change (e.g. palm oil and soya beans) is limited. The Czech NECP addresses the country\u2019s Ministry of Agriculture\u2019s strategy, which allows an increase of 20 % in the energy use of agricultural biomass by 2030. This can be achieved only under the conditions of maintaining a strategic level of agricultural production for food use. Thus, the strategy confirms that the main role of agricultural land is food security. Imported biomass in Malta primarily includes wood pellets, fuel wood in logs or briquettes, sawdust and wood charcoal, all of which is assumed to be consumed by the residential sector for heating purposes. In 2018, 49 % of biomass imports originated from EU countries, whereas 51 % was imported from non-EU countries. In the Netherlands, the following biomass fuels are to be applied for certain sectors: wood pellets are to be used for steam production in industry, and biomethane is to be used for CHP. The Netherlands will import a large share of the biomass fuels. They will ensure that it is sustainable. To make the use of biomass more sustainable, Poland suggests: \uf0be moving away from co-incineration as an inefficient way of producing electricity; \uf0be further increasing the use of local biomass and reducing biomass imports; \uf0be taking a new approach to using land for biomass that can be taken into account of the balancing of emissions. Although Sweden ensures that its national biomass fuels are sustainable, it cannot ensure the sustainability of imported biomass. Slovenia does not anticipate significant imports of wood biomass for energy needs. The use of wood biomass is aligned with the land use, land use change and forestry targets and does not reduce sinks. Slovenia sees that there is a need to ensure prudent forest management and improve the sustainable use of wood in a sustainable manner, including the following aspects. ",
        "31 \uf0be The largest possible share of Slovenian wood is to be processed domestically and used for maximum added-value products strengthening value chains (for energy purposes at the end of the chain). \uf0be Green public procurement is to be based on indicators of sustainable construction by integrating timber. The economic aspect is also important, as the use of less quality wood for industrial and energy purposes greatly improves the economics of wood-processing chains. Wood biomass is of great importance to the production of heat and electricity in district systems using the latest technologies. 3.4. Energy efficiency measures under Article 7 of the energy efficiency directive Under Article 7 of the EED (Directive 2012/27/EU), each Member State must set up the energy obligation scheme. This scheme should ensure that energy companies deliver the cumulative annual energy end-use savings. In the period 2021\u20132030, Member States should achieve savings of 0.8 % of FEC, except for Cyprus and Malta, which have 0.24 % as a target. The end-use savings can be reached by establishing one or a combination of the following approaches: (i) energy efficiency obligation schemes or (ii) alternative policy measures. Alternative policy measures can include energy and CO 2 taxes, regulation or voluntary agreements, financial schemes and fiscal instruments, standards and norms, energy labels, and training and education (European Union, 2012). In their NECPs, Member States were asked to provide the cumulative amount of energy savings to be achieved over the period 2021\u20132030 under Article 7(1)(b) of the EED on energy saving obligations. Moreover, Member States were requested to describe policy measures to achieve the energy saving targets under this article. Table 8 shows the cumulative energy savings over the period 2021\u20132030 in all Member States, measures (for some countries four to five of the largest policy measures in terms of energy savings are shown), instruments and energy saved by the particular measure. Most of the countries provided the cumulative energy savings. Regarding measures and policies, it seems that only few countries have chosen the energy obligation scheme only. The majority of countries identified alternative measures as well. Most of the major policies and measures in Article 7 address energy consumption reduction in the H & C sector (see Table 8). Almost all Member States include measures related to building renovation in their policy portfolios. In fact, their most important measures usually focus on energy efficiency improvements. However, several countries address energy supply as well: energy/fuel taxation (CZ, NL, SE), CO 2 pricing (DE, SE), replacement of boilers (LT) and HECHP promotion (PT). Table 8.

The mixed trends are due to different market conditions and national priorities. ",
        "35 Seven Member States (CZ, EE, EL, ES, LT, PT, RO) promote the new construction of HECHP plants and two Member States (EE, PL) aim to increase installed capacity. Germany and Finland define the timing for phasing out coal-fired CHP plants. Six Member States (BG, IE, FR, LT, LU, SK) support RESs in CHP plants. Five Member States (HR, IT, LV, LT, PL) promote increased energy efficiency through the use of CHP in district heating systems. Promotion of new HECHP plants and increase in capacity \uf0be Czechia has investment support for the implementation of CHP, covered by both operational and national programmes. There is a target to increase the heat supply from district heating produced by high-efficiency co-generation by 60 %. \uf0be Estonia supports HECHP; its target is to increase total electricity generation from CHP by at least 600 MWe by 2030. \uf0be Greece has a financial programme to promote HECHP and district cooling in the new programming period (2021\u20132027). \uf0be Spain plans to add 1 200 MW of HECHP during the period 2021\u20132030. This will be achieved by establishing a multiannual auction. \uf0be Lithuania supports the construction of a large new CHP plant. \uf0be In Poland, the development of heat production from co-generation is one of the main objectives in the energy efficiency dimension, and the potential to significantly increase the production of heat is high. In the long term, heat should be produced primarily in CHP plants. \uf0be Portugal plans to promotes HECHP based on RESs during the period 2020\u20132030. \uf0be Romania is promoting HECHP through a support scheme, which was established through Government Decision No 219/2007 on the promotion of co-generation based on useful heat. Phasing out coal-fired CHP plans \uf0be Germany plans to phase out coal-fired CHP plants by 2030. \uf0be Finland has adopted phasing out coal in CHP as one of its new government objectives. Finland has already adopted legislation to phase out the use of coal in energy production by 2029. A special incentive package to support replacements is under preparation. This incentive will support district heating companies in towns and cities that phase out the use of coal as early as 2025. Supporting renewables \uf0be Bulgaria supports increased use of biomass in existing and new CHP plants using financial and legal measures. \uf0be Ireland has a support scheme for projects to provide additional energy from biomass technologies, including anaerobic digestions and CHP. \uf0be France plans to achieve 0.8 GW of biomass CHP by 2028, compared with 0.59 GW in 2016, by promoting heat recovery from biomass for HECHP. \uf0be Lithuania promotes the use of RESs for CHP heat generation by assessing the potential of solar technologies, heat pumps and heat storage in CHP systems. \uf0be Luxembourg supports biomass use, mainly in the CHP sector in recent years. \uf0be Slovakia wants to phase out fossil fuels from the H & C sector by supporting the use of biomass and biogas for CHP plants. Supporting energy efficiency measures \uf0be Croatia supports energy efficiency of district heating systems (replacing steel pipes with insulated pipes and boilers with high-efficiency CHP plants or heat pumps) using financial and organisational instruments. \uf0be Italy supports CHP and efficient DHC, as well as the extension of networks. ",
        "36 \uf0be Latvia plans to promote efficiency and RESs in the centralised energy supply, as well as the construction of new CHP plants. \uf0be Lithuania promotes the renovation of existing CHP plants and the modernisation of the network grid. \uf0be Poland supports HECHP plants and systemic change in the district heating sector to develop efficient and low-carbon district heating. Moreover, Poland aims to replace low-energy coal power plants with the new high-efficiency plants that comply with restrictive environmental standards. Other measures \uf0be In Italy high-efficiency co-generation is promoted through white certificates, which are a negotiable instrument that certifies energy savings in final energy use achieved through energy efficiency interventions. \uf0be Cyprus uses a net billing scheme for HECHP. \uf0be In Finland, efficient co-generation competes with other generation plants in an open energy market. Energy efficiency measures for HECHP are promoted through energy efficiency agreement activities. \uf0be In Sweden, CHP plants, which are not in the EU Emissions Trading System, pay full energy tax and full CO 2 tax on fuel for heat production. 3.6. Planned investments Table 9 provides information about major planned investments in different areas of the H & C sector and Table 10 the financial sources used. The information is incomplete, since many Member States did not provide detailed information about their measures. Investments in building renovation are most prominent in many countries, followed by investments in the centralised energy supply (district heating network, CHP) and modernisation or installation of renewable decentralised heating systems (e.g. heat pumps). Funding sources were mentioned in 22 countries\u2019 NECPs. In most of the countries, EU funds were mentioned as a possible source of finance but without details of how the funding would be split among the sectors or policies. Member States intend to benefit from the European Structural and Investment Funds, such as the European Regional Development Fund and the Cohesion Fund. Other financial sources mentioned were: \uf0be InvestEU, \uf0be LIFE programme, \uf0be Modernisation Fund, \uf0be European Investment Bank (EIB) loans, \uf0be private investments and green finance.

Impact assessment of planned measures The impacts of planned policies and measures on renewable heat and energy efficiency improvements can be observed by comparing two scenarios: scenarios with existing measures (WEM) and scenarios with additional measures (WAM). The WEM scenario takes existing measures into account, whereas the WAM scenario also incorporates the planned measures (see Section \u201cList of definitions\u201d). Figure 3 shows the share of renewable energy in FEC in 2018 and 2030 in the H & C sector. Two different projections are shown for 2030: the WEM projections and the WAM projections. Planned policies and measures are expected to contribute to an increased RES share in the H & C sector by 2030 in the WAM scenario compared with the WEM scenario in investigated Member States ( 68 ). The level of new planned measures varies considerably between the countries. Planned policies allow RESs in the H & C sector to increase by the highest number of additional percentage points by 2030, compared with existing measures in the following countries: Lithuania (13 %), Luxembourg (11.9 %), Poland (10.7 %), Italy (10.1 %) and Ireland (10 %). Ireland and Lithuania provided good assessments of the impact of planned measures and policies, and these are presented below. \uf0be Ireland. Planned policies are expected to help increase RESs in the H & C sector by an additional 10 percentage points by 2030 in the WAM scenario compared with the WEM scenario. The increase is driven by the full delivery of the Support Scheme for Renewable Heat in the non-ETS industry and services sectors, growth in the use of biogas, and the impact of the heat pump grants for homes switching from oil boilers, with the assumption that 377 000 heat pumps will be deployed in existing homes by 2030 and 178 000 will be deployed in new homes. The uptake of low-carbon heating technologies in new buildings is driven by building regulations and an effective ban on oil boilers (2022) and gas boilers (2025) in new dwellings in the WAM scenario. \uf0be Lithuania. Planned policies are expected to help increase RESs in the H & C sector by an additional 13 percentage points by 2030 in the WAM scenario compared with the WEM scenario. The share of RESs in the centralised heat energy supply will increase by 30 % and reach 91 % in 2027. The highest impact will be delivered by two big new CHP constructions in Vilnius and Kaunas, accompanied by other smaller constructions / modernisation of the CHP plants. That high share of RESs would be impossible without implementation of energy efficiency measures \u2013 retrofitting of the building stock and modernisation of the decentralised heating boilers. Moreover, with planned policies, Lithuania will promote the renovation of buildings and the increase in the use of heat pumps. Its concrete objective is to replace 50 000 inefficient boilers with heat pumps or efficient district heating each year. ( 68 ) 12 countries were excepted because of a lack of data. ",

        "43 4. Recommendations Based on the information collected in the final NECPs \u2013 namely quantitative data, projections and qualitative data on policies and measures \u2013 and our assessment using this information and criteria from several EU directives, we provide some recommendations below. Our recommendations are meant to assist the individual EU Member States and the European Commission in increasing the quality of the next NECPs by streamlining the analyses of Member States, highlighting ambiguities in directives. The recommendations will eventually support the implementation of new measures and adapting provisions that will decarbonise the H & C sector. Neither the Commission nor Member States are obliged to implement any of these recommendations, which are the opinions of the authors of this report. Renewable energy targets Background. Most Member States are less ambitious in decarbonising their H & C sector in comparison with their power sector. Moreover, in the context of fulfilling Article 23(1 and 2) of RED II, to increase the share of RESs in the H & C sector by 1.3 percentage points ( 69 ) annually over the period 2021\u20132030, only nine countries met those targets. \u2014 Recommendation. For the following NECP, it is essential for countries lagging behind with the implementation of renewables in the H & C sector to increase their level of ambition, given the important role of this sector in fulfilling the EU\u2019s climate and energy goals. Constraints that caused Member States not to achieve renewable energy targets Background. With regard to Article 23(2) of RED II, Member States must provide information as to the constraints that may have caused them not to meet the objectives, for example structural barriers arising from the high share of natural gas or cooling, or from a dispersed settlement structure with low population density. Only few countries provided such details in their NECPs. \u2014 Recommendation. For the next NECPs, Member States could provide more information on the constraints that caused them not to meet the requirement of reaching the RES targets in the H & C sector. In addition, it is advised that Member States provide a detailed plan with measures to close the gap. RES technologies contributing to the sectorial target achievement Background. In their NECPs, Member States should provide estimated trajectories for the renewable H & C technologies from 2021 to 2030. The majority of Member States identified the renewable technology projections used in the H & C sector, but some did not. In addition, in some countries, there is a significant gap between total RES projection in the H & C sector and the projections of renewable technologies contributing to that goal. In other words, it is not clear which H & C technologies they intend to use to meet the target. Although most of the Member States take into account biomass, geothermal, solar thermal and renewable energy from heat pumps, some countries also consider renewable municipal solid waste and heat from CHP plants. \u2014 Recommendation I. It is advised that Member States identify and provide trajectories for the main RES technologies contributing to reaching the sectorial target. \u2014 Recommendation II. The Commission could prepare a template to clarify the technologies and data to be included as a minimum in the next NECP. ( 69 ) This increase can be limited to 1.1 percentage points, 0.65 percentage points or 0.55 percentage points per year (Article 23(1 and 2)of RED II). ",
        "44 Co-generation of heat and power and efficient DHC Background. Following Article 14 of the EED, Member States promote energy efficiency in the H & C sector by assessing the potential for the application of HECHP and efficient DHC, along with a cost\u2013 benefit analysis. If these assessments identify the potential for such an application, the countries must develop measures to promote HECHP, efficient DHC infrastructure and the use of waste heat. Overall, 14 Member States identified current potential for the application of HECHP and efficient DHC. Rather than providing data, some Member States referenced the forthcoming comprehensive assessment, which was to be submitted to the European Commission by the end of 2020. The NECPs do not show a significant expansion of DHC during the period 2021\u20132030. Only Belgium, Lithuania and the Netherlands expect an increasing share of heat supply from DHC. Six countries anticipate a decline in heat supply from DHC, primarily because of savings from better insulation of houses and thermal networks. The remaining countries did not provide projections. \u2014 Recommendation I. As HECHP and efficient DHC are considered to be key technologies in the future energy system, it is suggested that they should be discussed as an option in the NECPs by all Member States. The Commission could facilitate the exchange of experiences and knowledge support. \u2014 Recommendation II. For the next NECPs, Member States are encouraged to provide current potential and expected trajectories for the application of high-efficiency co-generation and efficient DHC in accordance with Article 14 of the EED. It should be mentioned, in case other technologies are prioritised. \u2014 Recommendation III. Why CHP appears to grow in some markets whereas it declines in others should be evaluated. \u2014 Recommendation IV. The contribution of CHP to targets should be clarified in future NECPs, since countries have different interpretations. For example, co-generated heat from natural gas CHP plants should not be considered waste heat and, therefore, cannot be counted towards the target specified in Article 23 of RED II. However, co-generated heat from CHP using bioenergy as fuel could be considered renewable heat and therefore be counted towards the renewable target. Waste heat and cold, and process heat Background. According to Article 23(2) and Article 24(4a) of RED II, Member States may count waste heat and cold when calculating their share of renewable energy in the H & C sector. Article 14 of the EED encourages countries to develop measures to promote the use of waste heat. Most Member States did not provide information on whether waste heat and cold was counted as contributing to the H & C target. Some Member States mentioned waste heat and cold as a heat source that should be exploited but without providing figures. Moreover, Member States were asked to provide information on gross final consumption of waste heat and cold for H & C, and gross final consumption of waste heat and cold from DHC. These data were not available for most of the countries. \u2014 Recommendation I. Member States would benefit from performing more systematic studies on waste heat potential, for example as part of the comprehensive assessment in line with Article 14 of the EED. The updated NECP should describe what type of waste heat and how much waste heat will be utilised based on the identified potential. \u2014 Recommendation II. The amount of waste heat and cold that will be counted as fulfilling the target for renewable energy in the H & C sector in the context of Articles 23 and 24 of RED II should be specified. Process heat ",
        "45 Background. Process heat accounts for a large share of heat consumption in industry, and in the longer term it also needs to be decarbonised. This topic was not addressed in the NECPs. \u2014 Recommendation. Member States are advised that the next version of the NECPs also present plans on how process heat and cold can achieve energy efficiency improvements and decarbonisation. Heat pumps Background. Heat pumps are one of the key technologies designed to decarbonise and increase energy efficiency in the H & C sector. Heat pumps were addressed by all Member States, but not all Member States provided trajectories. In addition, several countries have a very limited increase in absolute numbers. \u2014 Recommendation I. It is advised that all Member States provide trajectories on how heat pumps will develop in the future. \u2014 Recommendation II. A deeper analysis of how to increase the use of heat pumps should be performed by Member States. Information exchange could be simplified by the Commission. Sustainable bioenergy Background. RED II sets out sustainability criteria for bioenergy through different provisions, including indirect land use change. However, the NECPs used many different interpretations of the sustainability of bioenergy. \u2014 Recommendation: It is advised for the Commission to investigate whether further clarification of sustainable bioenergy criteria is needed. Measures and policies Background. Member States were asked to describe the existing and planned policies and measures that are contributing to reaching the 2030 targets. In most cases, the description of policies and measures did not detail how much each measure would aim for in terms of energy savings or renewable heat or cold. The cost of specific measures was also not provided in many cases. Replacing fossil fuels. To decarbonise the European H & C sector, one of the essential tasks is to replace fossil fuels, including coal, oil and natural gas, both in individual heating and in the DHC sector. Six Member States have regulatory instruments to ban fossil fuels and nine Member States have financial support to switch from a fossil fuel boiler to renewable boiler. DHC . DHC measures mostly concerned the construction of new HECHP plants (sometimes biogas fuelled) and the improvement of thermal insulation of networks. The option to build new DHC networks was not explored much. Countries without a significant share of DHC in particular appear not to consider it as an option. CHP . There are important differences among the countries. Although seven Member States promote the construction of new HECHP plants (mostly with economic incentives), some Member States expect a reduction in the level of importance of HECHP because of a more difficult competitive situation in some markets. Heat pumps. These are a key technology today, and it is expected that they will be more important in the future. The NECPs\u2019 planned absolute growth in million tonnes of oil equivalent is expected to be nearly as large as biomass in the period 2020\u20132030. Nevertheless, in some countries such growth is expected to be significantly smaller. The measures in those countries are often focused on centralised systems and CHP. ",
        "46 Waste heat. Reusing waste heat from industry is another pillar in the effort to improve energy efficiency and thereby support the decarbonisation of the European H & C sector. Seven countries presented policies on waste heat from industry. Denmark, France, Lithuania and Finland identified concrete objectives for increasing the use of waste heat. Most other countries did not explore this option. \u2014 Recommendation I. A plan for phasing out fossil fuels in the H & C sector could be a significant step towards decarbonising the H & C in the next NECP. \u2014 Recommendation II. Member States should make greater effort to systematically look for sources of waste heat. The comprehensive assessments in line with Article 14(1) of the EED could provide the framework for this. The usefulness of the next NECPs would increase by incorporating measures to exploit waste heat and cold. \u2014 Recommendation III. Analyse why increased use of HECHP was successful in some countries and not in others. Is it due to different incentives, market conditions, traditions, etc.? \u2014 Recommendation IV. Some countries envisage a slow increase in the deployment of heat pumps. The Commission could facilitate an information exchange on best practices. \u2014 Recommendation V. Member States should describe measures in greater detail, such as (i) expected results, (ii) an indicative timeline, and (iii) the source and amount of budget required. Cooling Background: Member States focused mostly on heating and much less on cooling. Since heating accounts for a significantly larger share than cooling, this could be a valid explanation for the first evaluation. However, as our climates become warmer and our demand for comfort increases, cooling will become increasingly important. Seven countries have planned measures for increasing cooling demand. Four countries intend to support district cooling development by either amending administrative and legal frameworks or providing economic incentives. Other countries promote the development of cooling maps and shifting to renewable cooling equipment. \u2014 Recommendation I. Member States should address the cooling sector more in the updated NECP and consider the anticipated increase in cooling demand. \u2014 Recommendation II. A definition for renewable cooling is still missing. The Commission should prepare guidelines. General recommendations \u2014 Recommendation I. Member States often claim that some data will be updated after the final NECP report, for example their long-term renovation strategy. It would benefit future NECPs if related directives and the analyses of such directives were ready before the next NECPs. This would ensure a more complete analysis in future NECPs. The Commission could analyse whether the timing of directives serving as input to the NECPs could be better aligned with the timing of the NECPs. \u2014 Recommendation II: Data collection procedures and national and Eurostat statistics should be improved to include key H & C energy streams, such as waste heat, process heat and heat pumps for cooling. \u2014 Recommendation III: All Member States should have the same end year in their analyses. \u2014 Recommendation IV: Require that Annex I be filled in by Member States, and expand its use to include more data. This would ensure that they cover all essential aspects of their NECP. ",
        "47 5. Summary and conclusions NECPs describe strategies and measures for the period 2021\u20132030 designed to achieve the EU\u2019s 2030 energy and climate targets. In their NECPs, Member States addressed different areas related to the H & C sector, which allowed us to assess the status of the European H & C market and its development, as well as national actions to achieve the renewable energy and energy efficiency targets. Our analysis shows that the current TFEC for H & C amounts to 467 Mtoe and makes up 46 % of the TFEC in the EU-27 ( 70 ). The renewable energy share in the H & C sector amounted to 21 % in 2018 in the EU-27. WAM projections ( 71 ) show a decrease of more than 10 % in the TFEC for H & C from 2020 to 2030 in the EU-27 ( 72 ). The share of RESs is expected to increase in all estimated Member States ( 73 ) reaching 23% by 2020 and is expected to increase to 33 % by 2030. The current shares of RESs in the H & C sector, as well as the levels of ambition to increase them over the period 2020\u20132030, vary considerably between the Member States. Although the contribution of renewables is above 50 % in six countries, with the highest shares projected in Sweden (69 %), Finland (54 %) and Denmark (54 %), there are nine countries whose share of RESs, in 2030, will still be smaller than 20 %. The lowest shares are projected in Belgium (8 %), Ireland (8 %) and the Netherlands (8 %). All countries anticipate an increase in the share of renewable energy from 2021 to 2030. However, the increase is not ambitious enough in most of the countries. This is also evident when verifying compliances with Article 23 of RED II, which requires Member States, starting in 2020, to increase the annual RES share by 1.3 percentage points, if they use waste heat, or by 1.1 percentage points in the period 2021\u20132030. Only 9 out of 27 Member States meet the requirements. Countries were asked to identify the constraints that caused them not to meet the requirements, such as a high share of natural gas or dispersed settlement structures. However, only few countries provided these details in their NECPs. The dominant renewable technology was biomass-heating systems, followed by heat pumps, with shares of 81 % and 11 % in 2018, respectively. Solar thermal, geothermal and renewable municipal waste contributed to 2 %, 1 % and 4 %, respectively. Although the use of biomass will increase slightly, the use of heat pumps will double over the period 2021\u20132030 in most of the countries. Evaluating the development of the RES share for the EU-27 was not possible because of lacking or inconsistent data. Several Member States did not explain which technologies they would employ to reach the RES target in the H & C sector. NECPs are important documents providing an opportunity to compare Member States and link the current situation and national targets to policies and measures. For the next NECP, we recommend that Member States improve the following areas. \uf0be Increase their level of ambition regarding the RES share in the H & C sector. \uf0be Explain the barriers that caused them not to reach the targets set out in Article 23 of RED II. \uf0be Specify whether waste heat and cold is counted when calculating the share of renewable energy in the H & C sector. \uf0be Harmonise and provide details regarding measures such as (i) expected results, (ii) an indicative timeline, and (iii) the source and amount of budget required. ( 70 ) Calculation based on the SHAREs tool (Eurostat statistics). ( 71 ) WAM projections mean projections of policies and measures that have been adopted and implemented to mitigate climate change or meet energy objectives, as well as policies and measures that are planned for that purpose (European Parliament, 2018b).

        "57 Annexes Annex 1. Country summaries A1.1. Austria The TFEC for H & C amounted to almost 13.4 Mtoe in 2018. This was 47 % of Austria\u2019s FEC ( 74 ). Estimated trajectories for FEC in the H & C sector show a decrease of almost 3 % from 2020 to 2030. The share of renewable energy in FEC in the H & C sector was 34 % in 2018. A further increase from 36.5 % in 2020 to 40.6 % in 2030 is expected. There are no projections for DHC or the RES share in DHC. According to the NECP, high-efficiency co- generation and efficient district heating are already widely used in Austria. Heat generation from CHP plants amounted to 17 389 GWh ( 75 ) in 2020 and is expected to amount to 16 047 GWhe ( 76 ) in 2030. Table 11.

Data sources: Eurostat (2018), European Commission (2019). With regard to Article 23 of RED II, Austria must endeavour to increase the annual share of RESs in the H & C sector by 1.1 percentage points or 1.3 percentage points during the periods 2021\u20132025 and 2026\u20132030. The share of RESs in the H & C sector in 2020 was lower than 50 %. Therefore, a reduced increase rate does not apply. There is no information in the Austrian NECP on whether waste heat is counted. Looking at the scenario results, Austria does not meet the requirements. However, the country does not provide any information as to the constraints that may have caused it not to meet the requirements. The main political measures in the building and heat sector concern thermal building renovation and renewable heat, including the following. \uf0be A ban on oil-fired boiler installations in new buildings built after 2020.

The share of RESs in the H & C sector in 2020 was lower than 50 %. Therefore, a reduced increase rate does not apply. The scenario results suggest that Bulgaria meets the requirements for the first period but will fail to meet the requirements for the second period. The main contribution to fulfilling the requirements comes from biomass. The significant increase in biomass is expected because of the development of new co-generation plants (from 4 GWh in 2020 to 2 497 GWh in 2030). The projected low share of RESs may be attributed to the country\u2019s shift from coal to gas. Moreover, although Bulgaria has high geothermal potential, its use is expected to increase only slowly until 2030. Studies analysing the potential and utilisation are promoted. The main policies promoting an RES increase in the H & C sector are the increase in the use of biomass in existing and new CHP plants and the promotion of the use of renewable energy in buildings, using financial and legal measures (with a focus on biomass and solar energy). Regarding synergies with energy efficiency, there are policies addressing both energy efficiency and RESs. \uf0be Meeting the energy efficiency targets is strategically linked to the renovation of building stock. Priority will be given to energy efficiency combined with the use of RESs. \uf0be Increasing the energy efficiency in DHC infrastructure involves both the renovation of heat transmission networks and the replacement of old heating stations.

Czechia claims that it is problematic to meet this indicative target because of the already relatively high share of RESs in the H & C sector (20.65 % in 2018). Natural gas is further promoted and seen as an alternative to coal. \uf0be In the household sector, there is a scheme supporting the installation of gas condensing boilers. \uf0be The country seeks to support the transition from smaller heat systems to multifuel systems using locally available biomass, natural gas and, if appropriate, other fuels. Gas will fulfil the role of a complementary fuel. Regarding measures supporting an RES increase in the H & C sector, Czechia has two existing economic support schemes addressing the installation of biomass boilers and heat pumps. These schemes offer the possibility of combining the improvement in the energy performance of buildings with a greening of heating sources. It seems that there is a limited number of policies promoting RESs in the H & C sector. Instead, Czechia is more focused on the long-term phase-out of coal in the H & C sector, and thus prioritises efficiency gains and savings.

Since the share of RESs in the H & C sector in 2020 was lower than 50 %, a reduced increase rate does not apply. The country\u2019s NECP does not contain any information on whether waste heat is counted. According to the scenario results, Germany will fail to meet the requirements in both periods. Germany does not provide any information as to the constraints that may cause it not to meet the requirements. With respect to Article 24(4a) of RED II, Germany may increase the share of RESs in the district heating network from 20 % in 2020 to 25 % in 2025 and to 30 % in 2030. The country\u2019s NECP does not provide any projections for the RES share in district heating. The main political measures to increase the RES share in the H & C sector can be broken down into incentives to promote renewable-based heating technologies in buildings and the decarbonisation of district heating. In the building sector, the building subsidy programme and the Buildings Energy Act (Geb\u00e4udeenergiegesetz (GEG)) for existing buildings seem to be the major measures (based on the cumulative energy saved calculated following Article 7 of the EED). \uf0be Federal Funding for Energy-Efficient Buildings (Bundesf\u00f6rderung f\u00fcr effiziente Geb\u00e4ude (BEG)) provides financial support (investment grants and low-interest loans) for building construction and renovation, as well as heating boiler installation. This programme is designed to be open to all kinds of new technologies. Although biomass boilers have been dominant until now, this funding scheme is expected to contribute to increasing the demand for heat pumps as a result of the improvement in energy standards. \uf0be The GEG creates a new, coordinated set of energy efficiency requirements for new buildings and existing buildings, and for the use of renewable energies for the H & C of buildings. However, the current level of requirements for new buildings and renovation remains unchanged. The review of the energy requirements for new and existing buildings in 2023 will be laid down, and a regulation on the installation of oil heating systems from 2026 will be presented.

Data sources: Eurostat (2018), European Commission (2019). NA \u2013 not available Denmark has not yet set any individual objectives or targets for total bioenergy demand. Following Denmark\u2019s Energy and Climate Outlook 2019, the use of bioenergy will continue to grow from 2020 to 2025, after which consumption is expected to decrease slightly. More than half of the present bioenergy consumption is used to produce district heat and electricity, followed by bioenergy in households. With regard to Article 23 of RED II, Denmark must endeavour to increase the annual share of RESs in the H & C sector by 0.55 percentage points for the periods 2021\u20132025 and 2026\u2013 2030. Denmark may count half of the average annual increase in the RES share in the H & C sector (Article 23(1c)), and the NECP states that any contribution from surplus heat is not included. Looking at the scenario results, Denmark meets the requirements for the period 2021\u20132025 but does not meet them for the second period, in which the average annual increase amounts to 0.4 %. Denmark does not provide any information as to the constraints that may have caused the country not to meet the requirements. The technology mix suggests that it can be related to the decrease in the use of biomass after 2025. Another aspect is that Denmark has defined the political measures for the period until 2024, but it is not clear what will happen afterwards. Clarification is needed as to how the period after 2024 is calculated and whether the same political measures apply. With respect to Article 24(4a) of RED II, the share of renewable energy in district heating was higher than 60 % in 2020. Therefore, Denmark fulfils this article and does not need to implement the 1 percentage point option. The potential for CHP in Denmark has decreased since 2012 and is expected to decrease further until 2025. CHP covered 73 % of the total district heating demand in 2012 and is expected to cover 63 % in 2025. The main reason is the integration of RES-electricity sources into the electricity grid. Regarding the district cooling consumption, Denmark does not expect a dramatical growth. It is expected to reach 2 866 MW in 2030. With regard to the main political measures to increase the RES share in the H & C sector, Denmark promotes the installation of heat pumps through the use of two instruments. The first one is an economic incentive for electric heat pumps supporting individual households, companies and district heating producers. The second instrument is an initiative to reduce the electrical heating tax to approximately DKK 0.15/kWh (2018 prices), effective from 2021. Moreover, Denmark supports the phase-out of both natural gas (primarily in the district heating sector) and oil boilers in the individual heating sector. Natural gas is expected to be replaced by renewables in smaller district heating areas by implementing the regulatory binding on the choice of fuels (applicable from January 2019). To phase out oil boilers, there is a subsidy scheme to replace them with heat pumps in buildings outside the district heating and gas grids, with an annual budget of DKK 20 million over the period 2021\u20132024. Regarding measures supporting energy efficiency, Denmark provides competitive support schemes for both building renovation and private enterprises. For the buildings, there is a specific list of energy efficiency measures that are granted. In the case of private enterprises, the subsidy scheme focuses on the savings in process energy. In both cases, the amount of subsidy depends on the energy saved. ",

The provided trajectories suggest that Estonia is on track to meet these requirements. The main contribution comes from biomass, especially biomass in the centralised heat supply, and new heat pump installations. There are two existing policy measures contributing to the fulfilment of the requirements for increasing the RES share in the H & C sector. The first one is an economic support measure for energy production from renewables and co-generation. The second policy measure supports the transition from oil to renewable energy, as well as energy efficiency improvements in the district heating network and boilers. Overall, Estonia identifies two main pillars in achieving the national RES targets, both of which are supposed to help lower demand: the renovation of the country\u2019s building stock and increasing the share of renewables in district heating supply. There are direct subsidies for the thermal renovation of public, commercial and private buildings. Subsidised renovation must achieve an efficiency class of at least C. The NECP does not specify whether renewable energy is part of the requirements in class C. Estonia has identified a concrete objective for the reduction of heat loss in district heating by 2030, compared with 2012. The indicative target is 0.1 TWh.

Finland may count half of the average annual increase in the RES share in the H & C sector (Article 23(1c)), and it states that any contribution from waste heat is not included. Looking at the scenario results, Finland meets the requirements for the periods 2021\u20132025 and 2026\u20132030. The share of renewable energy in district heating is expected to increase from approximately 50 % in 2020 to approximately 75 % in 2030 (including waste heat), which shows that Finland meets the requirement of Article 24(4a) to increase this share by 1 percentage point annually. Finland\u2019s new government identified ambitious objectives that might be the main triggers for increasing RESs in the H & C sector: phasing out coal in CHP, phasing out oil in buildings and supporting heat pumps in district heating. The concrete instruments are as follows. \uf0be Finland has already adopted legislation to phase out the use of coal in energy production by 2029. A special incentive package to support replacements is under preparation. This incentive will support district heating companies in towns and cities that phase out the use of coal as early as 2025. Phasing out coal will have a notable impact on the district heating sector, because in Finland coal is used mainly in CHP plants. Coal CHP plants will mainly be replaced by heat-only boilers using biomass. \uf0be The government programme envisages a stepwise phase-out of the use of oil for heating by the beginning of the 2030s. Oil heating will no longer be used in properties owned by central and local governments after 2024. \uf0be The government programme indicates that heat pumps generating heat for district heating networks will be transferred to the lower category of electricity tax, which is mainly applied to energy-intensive industries. This change should have a positive effect on the utilisation of waste heat. There are several measures supporting energy efficiency in buildings, such as improvements in standards and subsidies for building renovation. All of these are existing measures, and there is no information on whether these measures are effective after 2020. In the field of DHC, improvements in the efficiency of primary energy use, more efficient utilisation of waste heat and the overall efficiency of energy production are promoted within the scope of voluntary energy efficiency agreement activities.

NA \u2013 not available With regard to Article 23 of RED II, Hungary must endeavour to increase the annual share of RESs in the H & C sector by 1.1 percentage points and 1.3 percentage points over the periods 2021\u20132025 and 2026\u20132030, respectively. Since the share of RESs in the H & C sector in 2020 was lower than 50 %, a reduced increase rate does not apply. The country\u2019s NECP does not contain any information on whether waste heat is counted. According to the scenario results, Hungary complies with the requirements in the period 2021\u20132025 but will fail to meet them in the second period. Hungary does not provide any information as to the constraints that may have cause it not to meet the requirements. Hungary\u2019s NECP states that natural gas and biomass are the most important fuels for household energy consumption. The consumption of both fuels will increase slightly by 2030. By contrast, coal and oil consumption will almost completely disappear by 2030. Thus, the increase in gas may result in the country not meeting the requirements of Article 23 of RED II. Unlike in the residential sector, the share of gas in district heating will drop to 50 % by 2030. Reducing the use of gas in DHC appears to be one of the primary objectives in the H & C sector. The main policy tool to achieve this goal is the green heat programme, which promotes the use of renewables (geothermal, biomass and waste) for DHC. Under this scheme, large district heating areas considering local conditions are analysed. For individual houses, the Hungarian government has established a loan programme supporting investments in energy efficiency and renewable energy. The NECP does not provide any further information on the duration and impact of this instrument. In the longer term, Hungary aims to increase the use of geothermal energy. Owing to its geological conditions, the country has great potential in this respect. In the energy efficiency dimension, the modernisation of district heating and the construction of mini- heat plants, as well as the increase in the energy efficiency of buildings, will lead to significant energy savings in the H & C sector. To increase the efficiency of the district heating supply, Hungary will address district heating networks at municipality level, at which the district heating supplies to the grid reach 100 000 GJ. The NECP does not provide information about what instruments have been implemented in this field. As far as energy efficiency is concerned, the modernisation of buildings will be carried out on a market-oriented basis under the energy efficiency obligation scheme so that the costs are not essentially borne by households and the public budget. Hungary requires energy distributors and/or retail energy sales companies to put in place schemes and implement measures that deliver certified energy savings for the end user. Energy efficiency investments in public buildings by the central budget and municipalities will be carried out using energy service company-based services. ",

The share of RESs in the H & C sector in 2020 was above 50 %. Therefore, Latvia may count any such share as fulfilling half of the average annual increase (Article 23(2c)). Following these two criteria, Latvia must increase the share of RESs in the H & C sector by at least 0.55 percentage points per year, on average, for the periods 2021\u20132025 and 2026\u20132030. The projections show an average increase in the RES share in the H & C sector of 0.54 % by 2025 and 0.30 % by 2030. Latvia does not meet the requirements. A constraint that caused the country not to meet the requirements has been identified as being a reduction in energy consumption due to the renovation of buildings using old decentralised solid biomass boilers. There are two main action plans for the H & C sector. The first action plan addresses energy reduction in buildings by increasing energy efficiency. The second promotes the efficiency and RESs in the centralised energy supply, as well as the construction of new CHP plants. The latter action plan sets out the following concrete measures. \uf0be Mobilise EU financial support for investments in the development of new regional district heating networks and the renovation of existing (old) networks in municipalities with an existing or planned heat grid intensity of more than 2 MWh/m. \uf0be Develop economic incentives for final consumers to connect to the district heating network. Such incentives could work as a reduction in the common heating tariff of district heating. \uf0be Update legislation that limits the installation of new fossil fuels in district heating. Latvia sees energy efficiency as the main trigger in reducing costs and increasing the level of security of the energy supply by reducing energy consumption. The following main actions are planned. \uf0be Building thermal energy consumption for heating is more than 30 % lower than in 2020. \uf0be At least 2 000 residential multiapartment buildings and at least 5 000 private homes will be renovated between 2020 and 2030. This also includes an installation of RES technologies (non-emission technologies) and a connection to the district heating network. ",

FEC in the H & C sector is projected to increase by 8 % from 2020 to 2030. The share of renewable energy in FEC in the H & C sector was 45.6 % in 2018. It is expected to increase from 50.9 % in 2020 to 67.2 % in 2030. Energy consumption by district heating amounted to almost 915 ktoe in 2020, which was 29.4 % of the total energy consumption for H & C in 2020. District heating plays a key role in the overall decarbonisation of the H & C sector. The share of renewable energy in the total district heating sector must reach 90 % by 2030. With respect to Article 24(4a) of RED II, the share of renewable energy in the district heating sector was higher than 60 % in 2020; this means that Lithuania fulfils this article and does not need to implement the 1 percentage point option. The total installed capacity (thermal) of efficient CHP plants was 1 600 MW in 2018. Projections for efficient CHP and efficient DHC are not provided. Since the centralised cooling energy supply network is not developed in Lithuania, residential and commercial houses typically use decentralised cooling systems. The theoretical annual energy demand for cooling is estimated at 5\u20136 TWh. Table 56.

NA \u2013 not available With regard to Article 23 of RED II, Lithuania must endeavour to increase the annual share of RESs in the H & C sector by 0.55 percentage points for the periods 2021\u20132025 and 2026\u20132030. Lithuania may count half of the average annual increase in the RES share in the H & C sector (Article 23(1c)), and it states that any contribution from waste heat and cold is not included. Looking at the scenario results, Lithuania meets the requirements. The main contribution comes from local biofuels (although biomass is expected to decrease from 2020 to 2030 (see Table 56)). Overall, there are two main action plans for the H & C sector. Lithuania prioritises the reduction in energy consumption in buildings. The second action plan aims to increase both the share of RESs and the efficiency in the heating energy supply. Existing policies in the H & C sector, which are being implemented until 2021 and 2023, focus on centralised DHC, promoting the construction of new CHP plants and the retrofitting of both old heating boilers and the heat transmission network. Another goal is to increase the number of households with a centralised heat supply. An update of the country\u2019s existing regulatory framework seems to be the main instrument for the implementation of these policies. Meanwhile, new policies set concrete targets and call on municipalities that still use coal and gas to promote the installation of new boilers. Existing boilers are supposed to be replaced by 2030. Moreover, new RES boilers with a total capacity of 200 MW must be installed by 2030. In the energy efficiency dimension, policy measures focus on building renovation, especially the renovation of multifamily buildings. The main measures and their impact are as follows: \uf0be thermal renovation of multifamily buildings \u2013 energy savings of 5\u20136 TWh by 2030; \uf0be thermal renovation of public buildings \u2013 annual energy savings of 0.19 TWh and 1.1 TWh during the total period until 2030. \uf0be replacement of 50 000 inefficient boilers each year with heat pumps or efficient district heating (which will result in annual energy savings of 200 GWh); \uf0be modernisation of the district heating network (annual energy savings of 10 GWh).

It is expected to increase from 13.7 % in 2020 to 30.5 % in 2030. It is estimated that the amount of renewable energy in DHC will increase from 50.6 ktoe in 2020 to 58.2 ktoe in 2030. In 2015, almost 326 GWh of electricity and 527 GWh of heat were produced in Luxembourg using CHP technology. Further potential for the use of high-efficiency co-generation can be found in the following areas: \uf0be decentralised CHP installations in buildings, \uf0be use of CHP in industry, \uf0be heat grid supply and central CHP plants. The estimated heat generation from CHP plants, including industrial waste heat, is expected to increase from 589 GWhe in 2020 to 676 GWhe in 2030. Table 58.

NA \u2013 not available Following the conditions of Article 23(1), the average annual increase over the periods 2021\u20132025 and 2026\u20132030 should be 1.1 percentage points or 1.3 percentage points, compared with 2020 (it is not clear whether waste heat and cold are counted). The share of RESs in the H & C sector in 2020 was lower than 50 %. Therefore, a reduced increase rate does not apply. Looking at the scenario results, Luxembourg meets the requirements. Energy efficiency is considered a top priority and is of importance to Luxembourg in achieving its energy and climate objectives. Luxembourg has set an ambitious renovation objective for the existing housing stock (3 % renovation rate at 72 % renovation depth on average). This should be achieved by combining building efficiency (roof, walls, windows, cellars) with the elimination of fossil heating systems. Heat pumps are considered the main renewable technology in the housing sector and are therefore promoted through two policy instruments: \uf0be financial support (two main programmes: the prime house support programme and climate loans for residential buildings); \uf0be improved information policy (e.g. updated restriction map via Geoportal). The realisable potential of using near-surface geothermal energy associated with heat pumps is estimated at around 180 GWh per annum. The NZEB construction standard for new residential buildings has been in force since 2017. This will be extended in the short term (A + energy class) to ensure 100 % renewable energy coverage. Other planned policies to promote renewable technologies include the introduction of the taxation of heating oil and an attractive support programme for oil heating exchange (to guarantee that the tax measure is socially fair). Support for biomass has mainly been used in the CHP sector in recent years. For large installations (> 20 MW), RED II provides sustainability criteria for the use of biomass. Luxembourg also plans to extend European sustainability criteria for biomass use in CHP plants to smaller plants. For example, plants with a rated electrical output of above 10 MW using biomass or waste wood as an energy source should comply with these sustainability criteria to obtain the feed-in tariff / market premium.

The Maltese NECP assumes an increase from 22.1 % in 2020 to 25.8 % in 2030 (WPM scenario) (see table 60). According to the NECP, 69 ktoe of fossil fuels were consumed in the H & C sector in 2017, with the largest contributions coming from liquified petroleum gas and gasoil. There is no DHC in Malta. Heat generation from CHP plants, including industrial waste heat, amounted to 8 GWhe in 2015. The heat generation from CHP plants is expected to be 7 GWhe in 2020 and remain stable until 2030. In view of the current installed stock of H & C technologies, which is already very efficient, and the low share of heating demand, Malta envisages the role of H & C networks and CHP technology to be only marginal over the next decade.

Since the share of RESs in the H & C sector in 2020 was lower than 50 %, a reduced increase rate does not apply. Looking at the scenario results, Malta does not meet the requirements. In fact, several challenges make the target of 1.1 percentage points quite difficult to reach. \uf0be The lack of a natural gas distribution system on the Maltese territory excludes the option of blending biogas. \uf0be The country has no sources of indigenous biomass. \uf0be A share of 28 % biodiesel blend would be required to meet the target of 1.1 percentage points by 2030, resulting in an additional cost to industry and services of approximately EUR 70 million. Given that all biofuels would need to be imported, incurring additional shipping costs (and associated carbon footprint), such a measure would not provide any tangible economic benefits to Malta. Malta received recommendations from the Commission regarding additional measures in the buildings sector. The government plans to implement measures targeting solar water heaters (SWHs), heat pump water heaters (HPWHs) and waste-to-energy plants, with the aim of increasing Malta\u2019s RES share in the H & C sector. Air-to-air heat pumps are projected to increase without the need for any further policy intervention. The government plans to initiate an educational and awareness- raising campaign to encourage households to invest by highlighting the benefits of SWHs/HPWHs. The Maltese NECP states that several policies and measures have been put in place to promote energy efficiency in buildings. Predominantly, these have taken the form of financial incentives or grants. The enforcement of energy efficiency measures in new buildings will be addressed when a new Building and Construction Authority becomes statutory and established. Malta possesses no sustainable sources of biomass and does not have the land area or resources required to cultivate energy crops to any practical extent. Furthermore, given Malta\u2019s low heating demand, targeting increased efficiency in the H & C sector is deemed more appropriate than promoting the importation of biomass. No specific measures have been planned to promote the use of energy from biomass. In 2015, a comprehensive assessment of the potential for the application of high-efficiency co- generation and efficient DHC in Malta was presented to the Commission in accordance with Article 14(1) of the EED. This report concluded that DHC systems are not technically viable or cost- effective solutions for Malta. This makes it more challenging to address the H & C sector. ( 146 ) Excluding solar PV. ",

The share of renewable energy in FEC in the H & C sector was 41.2 % in 2018 (Eurostat SHARES tool 2018 data). According to Portugal\u2019s NECP, this share will increase from 34 % in 2020 to 38 % in 2030. Portugal does not expect to deploy district heating networks. Specifically, it is stated that the assessment of the need to build new DHC infrastructure from RESs does not apply. CHP plants produced 7 484 GWh of electricity and 19 249 GWh of thermal energy in 2014. In that year, the share of electricity produced from CHP in gross electricity production was 14 %. For thermal production, co-generated heat represents 36 % of the FEC (based on data from 2020). Regarding Article 14 of the EED, Portugal conducted a study in 2016 to identify the potential for high- efficiency co-generation with a time frame of 10 years (starting with 2014 as reference year).

With regard to Portugal\u2019s specific measures, one of the measures is dedicated to the promotion of the efficient use of renewable energy in H & C systems. It focuses on residential, service and industrial sectors.

This is due to the share of biomass. However, it is stated that the national statistics on biomass are incomplete. Houses in rural areas use firewood, which is difficult to count. \uf0be The calculation assumptions took into account the most cost-effective investments to cover the national heat demand. That is why the use of natural gas in heating processes is expected to increase. The dispersion of housing/inhabitants in Romania\u2019s rural areas is another constraint. \uf0be There may be uncertainties about the prediction of gross FEC, which may be affected by various factors, such as weather conditions and the volume and type of industrial activity.

        "109 Following the conditions of Article 23(1), the average annual increase over the periods 2021\u20132025 and 2026\u20132030 should be 1.1 percentage points or 1.3 percentage points, compared with 2020 (there is no information on whether waste heat and cold are counted). Since the share of RESs in the H & C sector in 2020 was below 50 %, a reduced increase rate does not apply. The scenario results suggest that Spain meets the requirements. According to the NECP, the increase in end-use renewable energy, such as biomass, biogas and thermal solar energy, has a significant impact on the development of RESs in the H & C sector. The same holds true for the increased use of heat pumps for air conditioning. With respect to Article 24 of RED II, the share of DHC in TFEC for H & C was 0.15 % in 2017 (i.e. well below the 2 % specified in Article 24(10)(a) of RED II). Therefore, Spain is not required to apply Article 24(2\u20139). However, given the identified potential for the development of H & C networks, Spain expects renewable H & C networks to play a much more significant role in 2030. Specific regulatory and economic measures are to support the development. Overall, electrification and an increase in the use of thermal renewables are the main goals in the H & C sector. The following measures are intended to promote the wider adoption of RESs for thermal uses in both the building sector and DHC: \uf0be revision and update of the minimum requirements of thermal installations for all new and renovated buildings; \uf0be loan schemes and grants supporting the renewal of the installed solar thermal parks, high-efficiency ambient energy equipment, the retrofitting of biomass equipment with high performance, geothermal energy installation and NZEBs (instruments: direct subsidies; fiscal framework to put in place signals to incentivise electrification; elimination of an indirect subsidy of fossil fuels); \uf0be mechanisms for the promotion of H & C networks (implementation of Article 14 of the EED; implement a mechanism that informs the final customer about energy efficiency and RESs in DHC through energy certification of buildings and thermal installations legislation). The main policy measures in the energy efficiency dimension are as follows. \uf0be Financial support for energy efficiency investments to increase the energy performance of buildings, along with the building performance certificate. This measure seeks to achieve 4 755.9 ktoe of cumulative final energy savings over the period 2021\u20132030. \uf0be Support energy efficiency in cold-generating equipment and air-conditioning installations in the tertiary sector and public infrastructure. This measure seeks to achieve 3 350.4 ktoe of cumulative final energy savings over the period 2021\u20132030. ",
        "110 A1.26. Sweden The TFEC for H & C was 14 700 ktoe in 2018, which was 42 % of the country\u2019s FEC. In the period 2020\u20132030, the FEC in the H & C sector is expected to increase from 16 to 17 Mtoe. The share of RESs in the H & C sector was 69 % in 2018, and it is expected to be 72 % in 2030. Since the share in 2018 was already above the 60 % threshold of Article 23(1), a further increase in the H & C sector is not required. Table 81.

NA \u2013 not available Heat demand in the district heating sector is expected to decrease by 300 ktoe in Sweden, although 700 ktoe of new customers has been added. This is due to lower heat consumption from existing customers. There are no targets for new DHC in Sweden, although district cooling is expected to increase from 86 to 258 ktoe. Waste heat was not discussed. The potential for CHP by 2030 is 648 ktoe, of which 62.5 % is for district heating and the rest is for industry. Biomass consumption is expected to increase from 9 500 ktoe in 2020 to 10 700 in 2030. Of the total increase in RESs in the H & C sector, biomass contributes 82 %. Heat pumps account for the largest growth among RESs in the H & C sector with 17 % during the period 2017\u20132030. Table 82.
