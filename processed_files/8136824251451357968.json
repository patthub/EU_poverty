        "Ladies and gentlemen, F irst of all I would like to thank the Algemene Rekenkamer (AR) for offering me this opportunity to present the Annual Report of the European Court of Auditors for 2007 here in the Lange Voorhout [where the Algemene Rekenkamer is located]. It is once again a pleasure to be back here with so many former colleagues and good friends. And it is also good that the AR is hosting this event, as this illustrates your great commitment to the auditing of EU funds, a commitment which has made you the absolute front-runner in this field among the EU SAIs. I would like to start with a general picture of the implementation of the budget in 2007. The total expenditure was \u20ac 114 billion, around 7 billion more than in 2006. The comparability of the breakdown by expenditure category is less than perfect because of the new financial perspective that was introduced in 2007. The new budget classification has also had the effect of compelling the European Court of Auditors to choose a different classification for the specific appraisals, which makes it difficult to draw comparisons with previous years. We have combined the specific appraisals of development cooperation (external actions in EU jargon) and pre-accession aid, and have split the specific appraisal of internal policy into three. I will come back to this. Agriculture and Structural Funds, now known as Cohesion, have largely remained the same, but Agriculture now also covers environment and health, while Cohesion covers some of the expenditure on rural development, namely that part which is funded by the Agriculture Structural Fund. The summary on the slide shows the distribution of the \u20ac 114 billion over the various expenditure categories. For the Netherlands, the net position is always interesting. As you know, there are different ways of calculating this, which I will not discuss now, but on the basis of the results included in our Annual Report, the Netherlands alone has contributed traditional own resources of \u20ac 4.4 billion to the budget and has received \u20ac 1.9 billion in EU subsidies. The European Court of Auditors as such has no opinion about that balance but we do have an opinion about the whole system of contributions and correction mechanisms \u2013 too complicated and unfair. The Budget Review launched by the European Commission should provide a trigger for reform of this system. I shall now move on from this outline of the situation to the principal conclusions of our Annual Report. Just like the American presidential election, the result of our audit activities for 2007 was not a great surprise: the counter is now on 14. For the fourteenth time in succession, our DAS statement was adverse overall. But there is some good news: for the first time, our statement on the reliability of the annual accounts is positive, that is to say we have given an unqualified opinion on this area. Unlike previous years, INTRODUCTION TO THE 2007 ANNUAL REPORT OF THE EUROPEAN COURT OF AUDITORS AT THE DUTCH COURT OF AUDIT Algemene Rekenkamer [Netherlands Court of Audit], The Hague, 11 November 2008 By Maarten B. Engwirda, Member of the Court > 4 Mr Maarten B. Engwirda ",
        "5 there was no need to issue a qualified opinion. This means that the financial administration is now in good order and reliable, which represents a significant improvement over the past. Moreover this was a condition that had to be met before further improvements in financial management could be achieved. The other part of our statement, concerning the legality of expenditure and revenue, is once again predominantly negative. Let\u2019s start with the biggest problem area, Structural Funds, or Sustainable growth in Financial Perspective terminology. Last year we reported a minimum error rate of 12%. In 2007, at least 11 % of payments were irregular . This difference is too small to be called an improvement, and besides, 11% of expenditure totalling 42 billion euros is far too high. This does not mean that nothing has happened since last year. In the first place, the control requirements for the new 2007-2013 programme period have been tightened up considerably and a clearer distinction has been made between the Commission\u2019s responsibilities, on the one hand, and those of the Member States on the other. Furthermore, as a result of the discussion of our 2006 Annual Report at the European Parliament, the Commission has developed an action plan for further improvements to financial management. The effects of this were not yet evident in 2007, because most of the 2007 expenditure was still stemming from the previous programme period, when the requirements were less strict. I must add that the Commission\u2019s opinion differs from ours with regard to the results of our audits. The Commission believes that many of the irregularities we discovered would have been discovered and corrected by the control mechanisms in the Member States or by the Commission itself at a later stage. It draws attention to the long-term nature of the control system. However, there is little evidence of this; the Commission normally has no reliable information about the operation of the control systems in the Member States and is therefore not in a position to say that the majority of the at least 11% of errors that we identified would have been discovered at a later date. Regarding expenditure on agriculture, the picture has changed little since last year. More subsidy schemes have been brought into IACS, which is a positive development because this system works well in principle. In 2006, 70% of all agricultural subsidies operated through this system and by 2007 this had already risen to 85%. But the information held in the system must be correct and up to date, and that is just not the case for a number of subsidy schemes which have been brought into IACS for the first time. Once again I have to cite olive oil in greece (5.14), and also in Italy (5.14 and 5.25). There were errors in four out of five payments that we audited in these two countries. But in the Netherlands too our audits uncovered a number of problems, primarily in establishing claims and correctly calculating the single payment scheme (SPS) which was introduced in the Netherlands in 2007. In this area, we gave the Netherlands a \u201cred card\u201d. Our assessment is that the supervisory and control system for the single payment scheme is not effective \u2013 and, I should add, the same is true in France and the UK. We had already said last year in our report that in our view this scheme, which is already a simplification of the previous system, is still too complicated. However, this does not alter the INTRODUCTION TO THE 2007 ANNUAL REPORT OF THE EUROPEAN COURT OF AUDITORS ",
        "fact that for that part of agricultural expenditure which is funded by the Agricultural guarantee Fund, i.e. including the single payment scheme, which accounts for 80% of the total, we calculated that the error rate is just below 2%, our materiality threshold. Unfortunately, this good result is cancelled out by the much higher error rate for rural development subsidies. In this area we have a complex regulatory framework which is often translated into national legislation in a rather ambiguous way, particularly the provisions relating to environmentally friendly agriculture. This makes control and verification difficult, and moreover, controls in the Member States that we have visited still appear to exhibit some serious shortcomings In 2006 we reported on internal policy as a single policy area but with effect from 2007 it has been divided into three areas: Research, energy and transport, Economic and financial affairs, and Education and citizenship. There are a few other small differences, but this is the main one. Two of the three sub-statements are adverse. Let us start with the specific appraisal for Research, energy and transport, which accounted for a total of \u20ac 4.5 billion in 2007. In the subsidies for research, our audits showed that, in half of the cases, accountants had incorrectly issued an unqualified opinion on the cost breakdown submitted. This is partly because the complex rules allow a lot of scope for interpretation when assessing whether particular costs can be subsidised, or which method should be used to decide which part of a project which qualifies for subsidy can be included. We are still calling for a simplification of the rules. Initial steps towards tackling this have been taken in the Commission\u2019s measures for the new framework programme for research. However, the Commission must also ensure that the measures are complied with. An important improvement in the 6th Framework Programme was the option for the Commission to impose sanctions; however, the Commission has never used this option, so that beneficiaries can claim whatever they want and, if this is discovered, the most they have to do is pay back the excess \u2013 interest is not even charged. Education and citizenship covers a large number of subsidy programmes which are usually implemented either through shared management with the Member States or by the Commission itself. In total, a sum of \u20ac 1.5 billion is involved. Despite the fact that our random sampling of 150 payment transactions found that nearly two-thirds were advance payments, we still found errors in 20% of the transactions audited. In one of the policy areas, communication, it struck us that most of the errors we identified in interim payments or final accounts should have been discovered by the normal ex-ante controls. This control system can also be assessed as \u201cnot effective\u201d and also gets a red card. By far the smallest area for specific appraisal within the framework of the DAS is that of Economic and financial affairs: \u20ac 0.5 billion. Part of it falls under the Framework Programme for research and here again we found the type of errors noted above. But, overall, this did not impact on our sub-statement, which is unqualified. 6 INTRODUCTION TO THE 2007 ANNUAL REPORT OF THE EUROPEAN COURT OF AUDITORS ",
        "7 I mentioned above that pre-accession aid and development cooperation are combined in one specific appraisal. In total, this involved \u20ac 6.2 billion, of which \u20ac 1.7 billion is for aid to candidate countries. We assessed the Commission\u2019s control system, including the control system in the Commission Delegations, and found it effective. We found problems in Bulgaria, where the Commission Delegation has lifted the ex-ante controls, but the national systems are still far too weak to guarantee the regularity of payments of EU subsidies. This is why the Commission has suspended some of the EU subsidies to Bulgaria. Overall, our opinion of the area of development cooperation and enlargement is adverse. By contrast, we are positive about administrative expenditure, \u20ac 8.2 billion in 2007. We found no errors in the course of our transaction controls, although some areas for improvement are outlined in our Annual Report. Finally, I would like to make a few comments about the progress of the improvement operations and the role of the Member States in them. Does the Court of Auditors see any progress? Will it ever be possible to give an unqualified opinion on the regularity of expenditure? We are indeed seeing progress, but it is a tough process, in which those involved do not always have the same interests, or, to put it more bluntly, often have opposing interests. It is also an illusion to think that stepping up the controls alone will put a positive DAS within reach. In some areas, the regulations are so complicated that improvements will be impossible without simplification. In our contribution to the Budget Review we urged that the rules be simplified, and we have done so again in our Annual Report on very specific points. An important point is that the specifications of a subsidy programme, the control costs and the acceptable risks of irregular expenditure must be weighed up against one other. In general, EU subsidies are paid on the basis of declarations by the final beneficiaries themselves. Because most of the errors occur as a result of incorrect declarations, ignorance, indifference or other factors, only improvements in control at that level, i.e. in the Member State, with the final beneficiary, will result in a significant step forwards. This is why it is so important for the national summaries which the Member States must provide (germany does not do this) to develop into the type of Member State declaration that the Netherlands submits. In our Annual Report we state that the first batch of national summaries gives a rather diverse picture and that, furthermore, many of the summaries do not have a management statement as to the completeness and accuracy of the information provided. For this reason the Commission cannot use them as part of its supervisory system and they are even less use to us in forming a judgement. There is still a great deal of opposition to national declarations on the part of Member States, but, on the other hand, the number of Member States that see some sense in making their own national declaration is growing. I believe this is a positive development, albeit in a long-term perspective. INTRODUCTION TO THE 2007 ANNUAL REPORT OF THE EUROPEAN COURT OF AUDITORS ",
        "8 AUDIT OF THE EUROPEAN \u201cLEADER\u201d PROgRAMME By the Cabinet of Kikis Kazamias, Member of the European Court of Auditors > T he European Court of Auditors (ECA) is one of the European Union\u2019s (EU) institutions. The EU Treaties define its mission as that of external auditor to the EU. In addition to compiling an annual report on the implementation of the EU budget that it presents to the European Parliament, it takes decisions in its own right both to carry out specialised audits focusing on the management of funds and to verify the implementation of specific policies decided on by EU institutions, mainly the Commission, for which funds have been made available in the EU annual budgets. It is against this background that the ECA will now begin scrutinising the LEADER programme, which will be followed up by a report analysing how well the programme has been implemented. This scheme was launched as a Community initiative in pilot projects in 1991 and ran until 2006. The aim was to develop and test new approaches in policy that would have a positive impact on rural development. Between 2000 and 2006 the programme was known as LEADER +. The new 2007-2013 programming period saw LEADER become an integral part of rural development programmes at both national and regional level. LEADER is an acronym made up of the initial letters of French words (Liens Entre Actions de Development d\u2019Economie Rurale) and denotes the programme that is aimed at achieving rural development. It is managed from the bottom up, i.e. by agents in the local community (professional groups, local government, community representatives) who submit proposals in their capacity as \u201clocal action groups\u201d whose aim is to implement local development strategies, usually by using funds for local projects. The ECA has prioritised an audit of Leader because: a) the sum of five billion euro allocated for the 2007-2013 period is both fairly large and significant in that it covers between 50 % and 80 % of the cost of the proposed projects, b) there is a high level of risk, because the programme is being implemented through the activities of around 2000 \u201clocal action groups\u201d and c) this domain has not been audited since 2000. The main question that will be posed during the ECA\u2019s audit is the following: \u201cIs Leader being implemented in a way that adds value to rural development?\u201d Individual questions will cover the areas of both development of local strategies and cooperation that involves exchanges of experience at local level. ",
        "9 Audit of the European \u201cLEADER\u201d programme The purpose of the audit is to ascertain whether all those administering EU funds implement Leader in a way that adds value, and to make recommendations and suggestions so that results are improved. This can be achieved by making sound assessments and determining criteria for correct implementation. \u201cAdded value\u201d also involves requirements being met with regard to the sound management of EU funds (transparency, impartiality and accountability), as well as adherence to the basic principles of economy, efficiency and effectiveness. The approach of the proposed audit is to correlate the results of a representative sample of 200 local action groups from the 27 Member States by means of document- based checking and on-the-spot visits to 15 of those groups. Assessments will also be made of decisions taken by the Commission and national managing authorities in creating conditions for achieving the added value resulting from cooperation with the local action groups. The audit is expected to be completed by next autumn, its results will be evaluated by the end of 2009 and the ensuing report will be made public in mid-2010. The ECA believes that this is a crucial point in time, since it is when it is expected that the local action groups will evaluate and assess their initiatives, and may change their strategies for the period up to 2015, at the same time taking serious account of any recommendations made by the ECA. The audit timetable has also been drawn up in such a way that the Commission will be able to use the results to develop proposals to adjust the Leader implementing regulations. The Audit Planning Memorandum (APM) has been approved on 5 November 2008 by Audit group I. The APM was the result of a harmonious cooperation between the audit team and the Cypriot cabinet. We are convinced that the Special Report which will be produced after the completion of the audit will contribute positively to the overall work of the Court and will help to improve the management of the European funds for the benefit of the European citizens.

        "M rs Petra Roth , Mayor of Frankfurt, calls upon the participants to analyse the worldwide misunderstood consequences of deregulation. 30 000 jobs were lost when the system collapsed. The seriousness of the situation calling for a new order, there is urgent need for more confidence but also more responsibilities for the future. Who will be the key players in the future, will they be found inside or outside our Western world? The President of the Federal Republic of germany, Prof. Dr. Horst K\u00f6hler , addresses the audience with a clear message. His, at times very personal words, are all the more hard-hitting as they are spoken by a man who himself comes from the banking world. President K\u00f6hler was Germany\u2019s Chief Negotiator at the Inter-Governmental Conference which led to the Maastricht Treaty on European Economic and Monetary Union. He served as President of the german Savings Bank Association, was appointed President of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development in London and in 2000 moved to Washington, D. C., to serve as Managing Director of the International Monetary Fund (IMF). Does man first need to go through a personal tragedy before believing he is part of a wider plan, and feeling the urge to create real values? The crisis is global and eating into the real economy. Democracy has proven effective and the political authorities have taken ready action. Now, the banks are expected to make the right use of this courageous offer and restore the flow of money. There is the need for an intellectual and political concept of a new international economic and financial order which will get its legitimacy from serving the whole of mankind. President K\u00f6hler is clearly in favour of the creation of an international control body and the assignment of the surveillance function over the stability of the global financial system to the IMF, which for that purpose has to get a higher degree of independence. The great global imbalances have to be evened out, the role of exchange rates has to be reviewed and selfishness and protectionism have to be banned. Common ethics are needed also to face issues like poverty, climate change and safeguard of the environment. 1944 Bretton Woods I laid the foundation-stone for the social economy, now the PROF. DR. HORST K\u00f6HLER, PRESIDENT OF THE FEDERAL REPUBLIC OF gERMANy The President of the Federal Republic of Germany, Prof. Dr. Horst K\u00f6hler, opened on November 21, 2008 the Congress under the headline \u201cWorld Currency Regime \u2013 To Float or not to Float\u201d. His Royal Highness Prince Philippe of Belgium also honoured organisers and audience with his presence. 10 FRANKFURT EUROPEAN BANKINg CONgRESS 2008 By Rosmarie Carotti > Mrs Petra Roth , Mayor of Frankfurt Prof. Dr. Horst K\u00f6hler , President of the Federal Republic of Germany Mr Martin Blessing , Chairman of the Congress; Chairman of the Board of Managing Directors, Commerzbank, Frankfurt am Main Welcome ",
        "extent of the crisis calls for a Bretton Woods II, the credibility of the system of freedom being at stake. The crisis was created by people sitting in the big cities and financial centres of the industrial nations. The financial sector should therefore ask itself unpleasant questions and not forget its primary function as a provider of services to human beings. All of us need to refrain from finger pointing, be it at the US, the FED, or the rating agencies, we all have taken part in this hunt for easy money. Man made the crisis, man can overcome it. With more humility and willingness to learn, cooperating with each other at global level. During the crisis, Europe has proven to be present and strong and the European model of freedom has carried hope. Now the chance is there to shape globalisation in such a way that we all can benefit from it. Mr Martin Blessing , Commerzbank and Chairman of this year\u2019s Frankfurt European Banking Congress admits that the banks have made mistakes and appreciates what the german government has done. Loss of trust to such an extent can only be solved with the help of the State. The loss of trust has led investors to resort to sovereign bonds, the concern now being how the banks then can provide credit. Is this the survival test for the only ten year old euro? The banking industry needs adequate rules and regulations without loosing sight of the advantages of the free market. The global imbalances increase the risk of decoupling and contamination of markets. Prof. Beatrice Weder di Mauro worries about the fact that markets are not relaxing despite fiscal, governmental help. All seems to indicate that the bad news will continue. She is puzzled by the extent of fear and the failure of the surveillance system, and proposes that the IMF be given all the necessary information by the big systemic institutions. Mr. Thomas Mirow, President of the European Bank for Reconstruction appreciates the impressive efforts made by the new EU countries to undertake structural reforms. Many new countries would have no perspective without the prospect of the EU but the existing Member States have to stick to the Maastricht criteria, while binding deadlines need to be set in the Treaties for the eight countries wanting to join in order to take care that forces which can endanger the coherence of the monetary union will not develop. Mr Jong-Wha Lee from the Asian Development Bank looks at China\u2019s role today in the world. China\u2019s GDP has grown over the 10% in the last five years becoming the fourth largest economy. The financial crisis will fasten the development of a regional currency in Asia despite the fact that the Chinese financial system remains underdeveloped from an international perspective. The yen having failed mainly for political reasons to establish itself as a regional currency, China will play an important role in any new Asian currency. But first, next year, the global crisis will come to hit China and global recession will be protracted beyond 2009. I.

        "FRANKFURT EUROPEAN BANKINg CONgRESS 2008 \u201cThe decision to run this panel under the title \u201cFinance after the Turmoil\u201d proves that the organisers belong to the more optimistic camp. And like most optimists over the past months, they have been proven wrong\u201d. With these introducing words Prof. Dr. Axel A. Weber, President of the Deutsche Bundesbank shares some thoughts on crisis management - especially from a german point of view - and on crisis prevention - the latter of course, in a more international context and warns against taking protectionist measures, against creating new international institutions instead of promoting essential improvements in cooperation among existing ones, and against investing too much hope in crisis prevention by means of an institutionalised early warning system. Mr Lars H. Thunell, Executive Vice President of International Finance Cooperation stresses how the crisis due to deregulation and credit expansion is moving from Europe into the emerging countries where export is slowing down, credit is tighter and investment projects are being put back. Many lessons can be drawn from the Swedish banking crisis which was also caused by deregulation and over-expansion. The Swedish answer was a general guarantee for banks by the government, political support and good governance without political interference. Also today cooperation is extremely important, as proven by the g-20. According to Mr Cees Maas, Cerberus global Investment Advisors, the banks have recapitalized. This suggests that they are out of the storm but the IMF is expecting a recession and then, again, the capital situation of the banks will be hurt. The banks will have to reduce lending even if they agree that this should not happen. Banks should only sell what they can hold and review their remuneration structure. It is a matter of ethics. It is not enough to say that cooperation should be better coordinated. National supervisors are dominated by national interest; therefore supervision should be transferred to the European Central Bank and measures taken to safeguard its independence. Sultan Bin Nasser Al Suwaidi , governor of the Central Bank of the United Arab Emirates (UAE) recalls how the global financial system went off track and the UAE registered a massive outflow of money during the summer months due the sudden exit of hot money and some contagion effect. The UAE had taken the world financial system for granted and prefers now rather isolation to misleading information. This means some restrictions to the outward and to the inward flows. The banking regulation will be amended to lower the level of lending and there will be more regulation than in the past. Mr de Campos Meirelles, governor of the Central Bank of Brazil wonders what can be done to stabilize the financial markets even if Brazil has faced the storm better than others. Bretton Woods II or even III has been on the agenda of the recent G-20 in Sao Paolo and Washington. Trade financing and cross- bord lending are problems for the emerging countries and there is the need for financial cooperation, re-design of the financial architecture, an increase of II.

        "FRANKFURT EUROPEAN BANKINg CONgRESS 2008 legitimacy for IMF surveillance, an early warning system, global supervision and the creation of a College. But the discussion is still in a very preliminary phase and it still needs to be decided what falls under global or regional supervision. Mr Jean-Claude Trichet, President of the European Central Banks agrees that the Congress takes place at a very challenging point in time. The first element of a reform agenda for this system is taking action against the excessive focus on short-term returns. Short-termism can lead to the misjudgement of underlying risk. Second, transparency needs to be increased in various components of the global financial system \u2013 for financial instruments, markets and institutions. Third, it is important to reduce the pro-cyclicality of the financial system, namely its potential to amplify business cycle fluctuations and trigger financial instability. But changes to the financial system itself without greater discipline in the macroeconomic policy-making of all participants will not be enough in order to prevent a crisis like this from happening again. It is therefore important to have in place a well-functioning surveillance framework. The current crisis highlights the fact the IMF needs to gain more traction as regards systemically important countries. The Frankfurt European Banking Congress 2008 is each year a major event in Frankfurt, a Forum which gives a distinguished audience the opportunity to meet and to discuss informally. Needless to say that the Panels were chaired by no lesser persons than Mr Blessing, Chairman of Commerzbank, Mr Josef Ackermann, Chairman of the Management Board of Deutsche Bank and Mr Herbert Walter, Chairman of Dresdner Bank. And they did very well in this new career. One could also say they had to make up for their mistakes. In any case they must have felt compunction as they decided to cancel the ball originally planned for the evening, feeling it would be out of place in a time of financial crisis. A gesture which was appreciated. 13 Sultan Bin Nasser Al Suwaidi, Governor, Central Bank of the United Arab Emirates, Abu Dhabi Mr de Campos Meirelles, Governor, Banco Central do Brasil, Brasilia Mr Herbert Walter, Chairman of the Board of Managing Directors, Dresdner Bank, Frankfurt am Main Mr Josef Ackermann, Chairman of the Management Board and the Group Executive Committee, Deutsche Bank, Frankfurt am Main Mr Jean-Claude Trichet, President, European Central Bank, Frankfurt am Main ",
        "SEMINAR ON \u00ab OPINIONS FROM SAIS AND NATIONAL DECLARATIONS \u00bb > By Rosmarie Carotti ON 18 NOVEMBER 2008 THE ECA RECEIVED AT THE COURT SPEAKERS FROM THE NATIONAL AUDIT OFFICES OF THE UK, THE NETHERLANDS AND DENMARK 14 Mr yvan Pedersen, Rigsrevisionen DK Mr Ton Kok, Algemene Rekenkamer NL Mr Van Rozendal, Rekenkamer Mr Andrew Baigent, National Audit Office UK M r Hendrik Fehr, the Court\u2019s Liaison Officer, and Mr Ralph Otte, Chair of the meeting, welcomed the participants to this important exchange of views on what it means making possibly use of national declarations for ECA\u2019s work. What is the value of national declarations which go beyond the requirement of summaries imposed by the Financial regulation? They are statements made on a voluntary basis and are certified by the national Courts of Audit. There are great challenges there. Is the work of the SAIs (remit and audit) compatible with the work of ECA? It is interesting comparing the ECA and the SAIs audit methodologies. Everybody agrees that it is important to be able to share the findings, but how can audit programmes be shared and complexity be reduced? There are also political challenges which need to be faced. In the UK, the national declaration 2007 is accruals based using financial reporting standards. The audit is full ISA compliant and the opinion presented to the UK Parliament. For the Netherlands, the declaration for 2007 is the second annual statement submitted to the Dutch Parliament and the European Commission, the Dutch Parliament having introduced the national declaration to have a statement of assurance on national level. The National Audit Office of Denmark performs the audit on the same materiality and risk considerations that apply to the audit of government funds. The first statement was published in 2005, one of the reasons being that the negative DAS was considered not to be fair to Denmark. But so far, although there is a management representation letter, in Denmark there is no statement by the Minister of Finance. Member States need also to be informed about the findings of the Commission and the ECA, especially in view of possible later corrections made by the Commission on the expenditure. The approach of the ECA concerning the national declarations is very open. National declarations can be an instrument for the European Court, one of many, to come to result auditing the European spending. ECAs basic position is explained in its opinion on \u201cSingle Audit\u201d. For the ECA it is interesting to get evidence about the situation. So far only 4 out of 27 Member States produce national declarations, but apply different methods and approaches. Therefore, harmonising is one of the most important needs to fulfil to get wider acceptance for national declarations. But what does harmonisation mean? Is a new set of standards really needed or rather a common understanding of definitions? The discussion on national declarations has started. It is in the first place a political discussion which calls for a decision. Only then will there be an answer to questions of timing, access to working papers and the reliability of the national findings. ",
        "15 PRESENTATION TO CyPRUS OF THE 2007 ANNUAL REPORT OF THE ECA > By the Cypriot Cabinet M r Kikis Kazamias presented between 24-27 November the 2007 Annual Report to cypriot authorities. He met the President of the Republic of Cyprus, the President of the House of Representatives and to the Control, Finance and European Affairs Committees of the House of Representatives. He also had separate meetings with Ministers whose portfolios include management of EU funds (Finance, Agriculture, Commerce&Industry, Communications and Transport) and meetings with the general Auditor of the Cypriot Supreme Audit Institution and the Secretary general of the Cypriot Planning Bureau. He also made a Press Conference and TV and a radio interviews. During the fruitful discussions with the cypriot officials Mr Kazamias stressed especially the need for: simplification of procedures concerning applications for EU \u2022 funds particularly for beneficiaries such as farmers and stock farmers, strengthening of the internal control and supervisory systems \u2022 and the need for an increase of the primary checks taking into consideration the balance between additional value and cost for carrying out the checks. Mr Kazamias was pleased to see that year by year there is more and more interest in the work of the Court and a willingness from the Cypriot officials to cooperate closely with the Court for achieving an effective control of the budget for the benefit of all citizens of the Union.

        "VISIT FROM THE MAIN CONTROL AND REVISION OFFICE OF THE UKRAINE By Rosmarie Carotti > T he delegation was received by Mr Maarten B. Engwirda, Member of the European Court of Auditors and by Mr Jan Pieter Lingen, Head of Cabinet of Mr Engwirda. They gave an introduction on the role and functioning of the ECA, including on how the Court audits internal control systems, and how the Court relates to internal audit. Mr Jean-Pierre Jaboulay, auditor of ECA in the CEAD group, gave the definitions of irregularities and fraud and explained the Court\u2019s role as regards fraud and described the existing arrangements for cooperation with the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF). Mr Kurt Bungartz, auditor of ECA in Audit group III, made a presentation about his comprehensive experience from multiple audits covering the Ukraine and its neighbouring countries. This was followed by a discussion about EU-Ukraine technical cooperation, including future opportunities for Ukrainian administrations to benefit from the EU\u2019s European Neighbourhood and Partnership Instrument (ENPI) in which the Ukraine participates. Mr Lars Markstroem, senior auditor of ECA in Audit Group II, modified his originally foreseen presentation called \"Experience from ECA financial audits in transition countries\" to cover the audit of pre-accession funds. The reason was to make a link with PI f C-structures \u2013 the overall purpose of the visit. Because pre-accession support had been implemented under decentralised management, PI f C-structures were included in ECA audits. EU support to transition countries is normally implemented under centralised management, via EC delegations, where PI f C-structures are not included in the ECA audit reviews. VISIT The Court received the visit of a delegation from the Main Control and Revision Office of the Ukraine on 18 October 2008. 16 ",
        "17 From post-Communist chaos to orderly EU membership in less than a decade and a half. D uring the financial framework period 2000 \u2013 2006 around 3 billion euro annually was allocated to prepare candidate countries for accession. In no earlier Enlargement had any similar kind of support been made available. The support was implemented via three specific pre-accession instruments Phare, ISPA and Sapard. The Phare programme was set up already in 1989 while ISPA and Sapard were new instruments. All three instruments were implemented under decentralised management, Phare and ISPA initially with ex-ante control of procurement by the EC Delegations which was later waived after a Commission accreditation decision (the so called EDIS process). Sapard was fully decentralised from the beginning. Phare was the main pre-accession instrument with the highest budget allocation (around 1,5 billion euro annually). Indicatively 30 % of the Phare budget was for Institution Building and the other 70 % for Investment \u2013 including investment in Economic and Social Cohesion (ESC). The implementation timetable was very tight and ambitious. Each annual Phare programme should be contracted within the first two years and all disbursements should be made within the third year. Within the Court the Phare programme was audited by group III, ISPA by group II and Sapard by group I. This mix of chefs resulted in various approaches over the years, in some years there was one common APM, in other years three separate APMs. The Annual Report drafting was better coordinated within one consolidated chapter for the Pre-accession budget except in 2004 when ISPA and Sapard were reported in Structural Fund / Agriculture chapter with only conclusions in the Pre-accession chapter. ECA ExPERIENCE OF AUDITINg PRE-ACCESSION FUNDS By Lars Markstroem, senior auditor > ",
        "The annual DAS work included on average substantive testing of around 80 transactions. The basis for the sampling was MUS with, in some years, additional risk-based selected contracts (mainly within the high-risk ESC- sector). The system testing work focused mainly on the control of national co-financing and preparations for EDIS. Sapard, which was the first time for the Commission to fully decentralise an external assistance programme, had difficulties in the implementation. The Court\u2019s audit opinion was every year qualified on Sapard. The implementation of the ISPA programme was delayed, even as of today only a limited number of projects have been finished. P ublic Internal f inancial Control (PI f C) was a structure under development in the candidate countries (supported by Phare IB-funds). This work coincided with the Commission\u2019s own work on reforming its financial control system which in a way was lucky for the candidate countries since they could profit from lessons learned and start off with the latest modern standards on PI f C-structure. Audit and control issues had high priority and the ECA auditors sometimes had to queue-up in order to let the beneficiary finish his earlier meeting with other auditors! I remember one time we had to interrupt a meeting when the Ministry finally realised that we were not auditors from Dg REgIO\u2026 The main audit findings in the Phare programme were related to overambitious budgeting of projects, insufficient control of national co- financing and problems to apply public procurement rules. Some countries made rapid progress while others needed more time. In general, however, we found many positive developments during our audits, especially the positive commitment from the local staff working with implementing EU-programmes. In case weaknesses were identified we could see immediate action was taken to rectify it, in most of the countries. In total I made 27 Phare audit missions including more than 100 mission days. If I compare my first mission in January 2000 (Prag) with the last one seven years later in January 2007 (Warsaw) the changes are dramatic. The pre-accession budget was extremely interesting to work with and I feel very fortunate to have been able to take part in this stimulating and dynamic environment as an ECA auditor.

        "19 R. C. : Mr Skyrta, you come from the Main Audit Control Office of Ukraine. Is that the Supreme Audit Institution? Mr Viktor Skyrta: No, we are under the governance of the government, the Cabinet of the Minister, not the Parliament. In the Ukraine we have a separate Chamber of Accounts. R. C.: During the meeting with Mr Engwirda, you said that you were working on a project of internal control. Can you tell more about it? Mr Viktor Skyrta: Within the framework of our reforming the public financial control in the Ukraine we decentralise internal control to the different government agencies. Therefore issues of internal control are very interesting for us. We especially want to learn how internal control is implemented in the European Union. R. C.: But we are the external auditor. Mr Viktor Skyrta: Who controls the system of internal control. The Main Control and Revision Office of the Ukraine also controls the system of internal control in different ministries on a methodological level. R. C.: What will be the outcome of your visit here? Mr Viktor Skyrta: A deepened understanding of the role of the European Court of Auditors, the system of control of the European Commission, a better understanding of the role of the European Court of Auditors in respect of the Commission and the role of Olaf together with the European Court of Auditors and the Commission. R. C.: We are not Olaf. Mr Viktor Skyrta: We are not Olaf, either. But there will be a structure established in the Ukraine which will be similar to Olaf. That\u2019s why we are interested in your cooperation with Olaf as well. R. C.: Can you see some ways of strengthening our relationship in the future? Mr Viktor Skyrta: The functions of the European Court of Auditors over the internal control system are very similar to those performed by the Main Control and Revision Office regarding the different ministries in the Ukraine. And even if the Ukraine does not become part of the European Union in the next couple of years, meeting you will bring both of us some benefits.

        "20 MEETINg OF THE CONTACT COMMITTEE OF THE HEADS OF THE SUPREME AUDITS INSTITUTIONS (SAIS) OF THE EUROPEAN UNION 1 \u2013 2 DECEMBER 2008 AT THE EUROPEAN COURT OF AUDITORS IN LUxEMBOURg > by Petra Gebetsberger, Liaison Officer\u2019s Office T he meeting took place in the presence of Mr V\u00edtor Caldeira, President of the ECA and Mrs Dalia grybauskait\u00e9, Commissioner for Financial Programming and the Budget. Heads of the SAIs of Turkey, Croatia and the former yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, as well as representatives of IDI, EUROSAI and SIgMA had been invited to attend the meeting as active observers. After the welcome address and the opening of the meeting by Mr V\u00edtor Caldeira, President of the ECA and acting Chairman, the agenda was adopted and the minutes of the last CC meeting in Helsinki 2007 were approved. The last Contact Committee meeting held in Luxembourg goes back to 2004. Since then, cooperation and partnership in the spirit of the Treaty have constantly developed between the ECA and the SAIs. The 2008 Contact Committee meeting took place at a time when Europe and the rest of the world were still in the process of absorbing the global shockwaves originating from the crisis of the financial markets. Given the upheavals in the capital markets and the further economic slowdown foreseeable for 2009, we are certainly facing difficult times, but as Mr Barroso said, times of crisis open up new opportunities for the EU to accelerate changes. Against this background, the main thematic focus of the 2008 Contact Committee meeting were discussions on the EU Budget Reform and the revised Lisbon Strategy 2008-2010; two subjects that are of relevance to the management of the financial crisis currently affecting the EU and its Member States. Both subjects were elaborated during panel discussions followed by a lively debate. The planned reform of the EU Budget is the expression of a common desire for change and the result of public consultation. As Commissioner Grybauskait\u00e9 said in her presentation, it was the first time that the EU consulted the Member States on public budget matters. ",
        "21 MEETINg OF THE CONTACT COMMITTEE OF THE HEADS OF THE SUPREME AUDITS INSTITUTIONS (SAIS) OF THE EUROPEAN UNION Everybody agrees that the EU Budget needs to be modernised and that the reform should cover the whole budget, expenditure and revenue. The spending calls for new priorities like climate change, global competitiveness, energy supply and security, Trans-Euroepan Networks, innovation, research and education. Regional and cohesion policy need to be more concentrated on less-developed Member States and regions. The CAP funding, which is not able to pass the added-value test, calls for a radical reform while the adopted proposal of a Health Check is only a first step. The complex EU revenue system needs to be reformed towards more clarity, simplification and transpareny. There is no support for a genuine EU-tax but the contribution system could be simplified by eliminating the complex statistical VAT-based contribution and by abolishing the correction mechanism. In times of crisis the financial framework and the annual budget have to meet changing needs and emergency situations through more flexibility. The Commission is asked to prepare the budget reform paper by Autumn 2009, a paper which will be based on political options rather than on concrete amounts and percentages. The ensuing discussion confirmed that action is needed and showed how important the role of the SAIs is in this respect. Their risk assessment will play a decisive role in a financial environment where the flow of money is stagnating. They need to consider the cost of audits and the level of tolerable risk, the beneficiaries wanting more \u201csoft rules\u201d and the paymasters stricter control. Likewise, the second subject \u2013 the revised Lisbon Strategy 2008 -2010 \u2013 was discussed against the background of the current developments. There was optimism that the revised Lisbon Strategy might help to curb the adverse effects of the financial crisis. In Spring 2008, the European Council accepted the proposal to launch a new three year cycle of the Lisbon Strategy, which, as Mr Caldeira remarked, underlines the vitality and sutainability of this strategic initiative of the European Union. Furthermore, in the face of the current financial crisis, the Commission has proposed \u201cA European Economic Recovery Plan\u201d containing measures linked to the four priority areas of the Lisbon Strategy (people, business, infrastructure and energy, and research and innovation). ",
        "22 The goals and measures of the Lisbon Strategy are important to all EU Member States: increasing the rate of employment, reducing administrative bureaucracy, reducing the emissions of greenhouse gases are only some of them. In implementing the Lisbon Strategy, each EU Member State focuses its reform efforts on different issues and lays them down in its national reform programme. These programmes and the measures taken under the Lisbon Strategy offer a wide variety of challenging audit approaches for SAIs. In this context, Mr Caldeira underlined that the revised Lisbon Strategy provides a common \u201cumbrella\u201d and challenge to independent external auditors at all levels. given the stated goal of the panel discussion to explore ways of how the EU SAIs could optimise their cooperation in the field of the revised Lisbon Strategy, it was proposed to establish a voluntary network of auditors for identifying common audit areas and sharing best practices among SAIs. As the discussions showed, there are different experiences in this field and the SAIs can profit from them and may help enhance the effectiveness of implementing measures taken under the Lisbon Strategy. In this respect, participants welcomed the idea of setting up a network. The remaining agenda items were to provide the Contact Committee with an overview of the status of the various activities on which SAIs currently cooperate and of those they plan to cooperate on in the future years. Of particular interest was the presentation by Ms Eva Lindstr\u00f6m, Auditor general of the SAI of Sweden concerning an evaluation of the CC working groups. The results of the evaluation showed that there is room for improvement when it comes to mandate setting and dissemination and use of working groups\u2019 products within the SAIs. The Liaison Officers were mandated to develop a framework during 2009 aimed to improve the effectiveness of CC working groups and the benefits of their products to the SAIs. Other cooperation activities that were discussed at the meeting were, among others, the development of a platform for the exchange of ideas on EU audits, the results of a seminar on national declarations that was held in September 2008 in Copenhagen, and furthermore, the Contact Committee selected a number of new activites to be started in 2009. The working groups presented their activites during 2008 and their work plans for 2009, and the Network of SAIs of the Candidate and Potential Candidate Countries gave a brief overview of their activites. Before closing the meeting, Mr Hubert Weber (Member of the Court), who chaired the CC meeting on the second day because of Mr Caldeira\u2019s absence due to his presentation of the Annual Report to the ECOFIN Council, handed over the symbolic relay stick to Mr Arpad Kovacs, President of the SAI of Hungary, who invited all colleagues to the Contact Committee meeting in Budapest in 2009.

        "LES N\u00e9gOTIATIONS SUR LE TRAIT\u00e9 CONSTITUTIONNEL EUROP\u00e9EN ET LE TRAIT\u00e9 DE LISBONNE Par Rosmarie Carotti > M ario Hirsch amorce le d\u00e9bat en posant la question si les efforts jusqu\u2019ici entrepris ont \u00e9t\u00e9 vains et si c\u2019est vraiment souhaitable que l\u2019Europe un jour ait une Constitution sans qu\u2019elle ne porte ce nom. Lydie Polfer reprend l\u2019opinion g\u00e9n\u00e9rale exprim\u00e9e par les diff\u00e9rents intervenants, qu\u2019aujourd\u2019hui l\u2019Europe, malheureusement, ne suscite plus l\u2019enthousiasme d\u2019il y a dix ans, pas m\u00eame au Luxembourg, pourtant le pays europ\u00e9en par excellence. Malgr\u00e9 plus de 50 ans de paix gr\u00e2ce \u00e0 l\u2019Europe, le r\u00e9f\u00e9rendum au Luxembourg ne s\u2019est sold\u00e9 que par un vote positif de 56%. Cela s\u2019explique par la discussion en cours depuis presque dix ans sur les institutions au niveau europ\u00e9en. \u00c0 son avis, on devrait prendre plus au s\u00e9rieux l\u2019adage fran\u00e7ais \u00ab Le mieux est souvent l\u2019ennemi du bien \u00bb. Nice a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9poque le meilleur r\u00e9sultat qu\u2019on ait pu obtenir et restera certainement longtemps applicable. Mais, d\u00e8s son adoption, le Trait\u00e9 de Nice a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9cri\u00e9. C\u2019\u00e9tait m\u00e9conna\u00eetre qu\u2019il \u00e9tait le r\u00e9sultat d\u2019\u00e9normes efforts et du conflit entre int\u00e9r\u00eats nationaux et int\u00e9r\u00eats communautaires. Ainsi, les Pays-Bas r\u00e9clamaient le recalcul des voix par rapport \u00e0 la Belgique pour la majorit\u00e9 qualifi\u00e9e au Conseil des ministres. Et les grands pays, qui devaient abandonner un Commissaire pour pr\u00e9parer l\u2019\u00e9largissement, demandaient aussi \u00e0 ce titre des voix suppl\u00e9mentaires au Conseil des ministres. Le principe \u00e9tait acquis, mais encore fallait-il s\u2019accorder sur le nombre des voix. Il \u00e9tait impossible de faire mieux \u00e0 Nice, bien qu\u2019il n\u2019y avait encore que 15 \u00e9tats autour de la table. Pourtant, d\u00e8s que le trait\u00e9 fut sign\u00e9 \u00e0 Nice, d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e0 Laeken, on r\u00e9clamait \u00e0 25 qu\u2019il fallait faire mieux, m\u00eame si les nouveaux n\u2019\u00e9taient pas encore membres \u00e0 part enti\u00e8re. Les m\u00eames r\u00e9flexes ont jou\u00e9 pour les n\u00e9gociations de Nice ou pour le Trait\u00e9 constitutionnel. De l\u2019avis de Lydie Polfer, le plus important est toujours la volont\u00e9 politique. Il est possible d\u2019avancer aussi avec un texte ne fut-ce qu\u2019imparfait ; par contre, le meilleur des textes ne donne rien, s\u2019il n\u2019y a pas la volont\u00e9 d\u2019agir ensemble. Est-ce que l\u2019Europe a vraiment besoin de nouveaux arrangements constitutionnels ? Mario Hirsch, pose cette question \u00e0 la lumi\u00e8re d\u2019une \u00e9tude acad\u00e9mique r\u00e9cente, qui affirme que m\u00eame sous le Trait\u00e9 de Nice l\u2019Europe fonctionne tr\u00e8s bien. Alors, pourquoi toutes ces tentatives de trouver un texte constitutionnel ? Nicolas Schmit, Ministre d\u00e9l\u00e9gu\u00e9 aux Affaires \u00e9trang\u00e8res du Luxembourg, tient \u00e0 souligner que nous vivons d\u00e9sormais dans un processus de r\u00e9vision institutionnelle depuis plus de vingt ans, puisque la premi\u00e8re grande r\u00e9vision des Trait\u00e9s a eu lieu en 1985. L\u2019Acte Unique a \u00e9t\u00e9 un exercice absolument indispensable et a \u00e9t\u00e9 suivi par Maastricht. Sans Maastricht, il n\u2019y aurait pas eu l\u2019euro. Amsterdam am\u00e9liore en 1997 un certain nombre de points du Trait\u00e9 de Maastricht, notamment le volet Justice et Affaires int\u00e9rieures, mais n\u2019arrive pas \u00e0 r\u00e9soudre les grandes questions institutionnelles, comme la question \u00e9pineuse de savoir si chaque pays gardera son commissaire \u00e0 Bruxelles.

Il d\u00e9crit comment \u00e0 Nice l\u2019avanc\u00e9e est faite p\u00e9niblement pour deux raisons en particulier. D\u2019un cot\u00e9, il y avait la question de la double majorit\u00e9, le syst\u00e8me r\u00eav\u00e9 par l\u2019Allemagne et cat\u00e9goriquement rejet\u00e9 par la France, et de l\u2019autre cot\u00e9, il y avait le rapport difficile grands/petits \u00c9tats membres. Mais \u00e0 Nice on fixe d\u00e9j\u00e0 un deuxi\u00e8me rendez-vous. Il y a un malaise mais aussi une sorte de r\u00eave. Le r\u00eave est celui de donner une constitution \u00e0 l\u2019Union europ\u00e9enne. Nicolas Schmit con\u00e7oit difficilement que l\u2019on puisse rester ind\u00e9finiment avec Nice. \u00c0 son avis, bien que le syst\u00e8me de Nice marche, la Commission est actuellement en \u00e9tat de mort clinique. S\u2019il y a un leadership faible dans l\u2019Union europ\u00e9enne, comment l\u2019Europe peut- elle faire face \u00e0 ses crises ? Les \u00e9l\u00e9ments du Trait\u00e9 constitutionnel europ\u00e9en, et maintenant du Trait\u00e9 de Lisbonne, sont des \u00e9l\u00e9ments indispensables. Si l\u2019on reste avec Nice, il n\u2019 y aura qu\u2019un G4, G5, tout simplement. C\u2019est pour cela qu\u2019on doit tenter d\u2019am\u00e9liorer le fonctionnement de l\u2019Union. Le Trait\u00e9 de Lisbonne offre des possibilit\u00e9s qu\u2019il faut saisir. Une fois cela fait, il faut laisser \u00e0 l\u2019Europe une p\u00e9riode de tranquillit\u00e9 institutionnelle. Lydie Polfer, par contre, craint que dans le sch\u00e9ma de Lisbonne, avec un Pr\u00e9sident permanent pour 5 ans du Conseil europ\u00e9en, la Commission a encore plus \u00e0 perdre. Le gouvernement luxembourgeois a toujours \u00e9t\u00e9 attentif \u00e0 ce danger, bien qu\u2019il ait donn\u00e9 son accord \u00e0 la cr\u00e9ation de ce poste, conscient du fait que toutes n\u00e9gociations impliquent des compromis. Le Pr\u00e9sident du Conseil europ\u00e9en n\u2019a de l\u2019avis de Lydie Polfer aucune l\u00e9gitimit\u00e9 d\u00e9mocratique. Pour cela, il faut en tirer la meilleure part de Nice, d\u2019autant plus que pour le moment il faut de toute fa\u00e7on continuer avec le Trait\u00e9 de Nice et que les \u00e9lections europ\u00e9ennes de l\u2019ann\u00e9e prochaine seront faites selon Nice. Sans vouloir d\u00e9nigrer les avantages du Trait\u00e9 de Lisbonne, tels que la majorit\u00e9 qualifi\u00e9e et les contacts plus directs avec les parlements nationaux, Lydie Polfer est de l\u2019avis qu\u2019il ne faut pas surestimer certaines nouvelles institutions, tel que le r\u00f4le du Pr\u00e9sident du Conseil europ\u00e9en. Nicolas Schmit est plus prudent au sujet de la l\u00e9gitimit\u00e9. Si la l\u00e9gitimit\u00e9 c\u2019est les \u00e9lections, on peut se demander quelle est la l\u00e9gitimit\u00e9 de M. Sarkozy d\u2019\u00eatre all\u00e9 en Georgie. M. Sarkozy a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9lu en France et non pas en Europe. Il tient sa l\u00e9gitimit\u00e9 de Pr\u00e9sident en exercice du Conseil de l\u2019UE des Trait\u00e9s. Ce Pr\u00e9sident, qui certes n\u2019a pas une l\u00e9gitimit\u00e9 populaire dans le sens d\u2019un Pr\u00e9sident des \u00c9tats-Unis \u00e9lu, lui, est \u00e9lu par les repr\u00e9sentants des nations europ\u00e9ennes r\u00e9unis au Conseil europ\u00e9en. Son poste est pr\u00e9vu dans le Trait\u00e9 qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 approuv\u00e9 par tous les \u00e9tats membres. Il repr\u00e9sente l\u2019Union sur le plan externe. Certes, c\u2019est le conflit institutionnel, le cas \u00e9ch\u00e9ant, pr\u00e9programm\u00e9, mais comme pour chaque texte constitutionnel il y aura une dynamique d\u00e9gag\u00e9e par la personnalit\u00e9. La Commission peut y gagner du Trait\u00e9 de Lisbonne. Sa l\u00e9gitimit\u00e9 \u00e0 elle va \u00eatre augment\u00e9e. Ainsi, le Pr\u00e9sident de la Commission sera, dor\u00e9navant, propos\u00e9 par le Conseil et \u00e9lu par le Parlement europ\u00e9en.

        "27 L \u2019exposition est constitu\u00e9e d\u2019une r\u00e9trospective illustr\u00e9e par un diaporama de plus de 150 photos et extraits vid\u00e9o, ainsi que de divers documents historiques. L\u2019exposition qui se poursuit jusqu\u2019au 3 janvier 2008 a \u00e9t\u00e9 inaugur\u00e9e le 27 novembre 2008 par M. V\u00edtor Manuel da Silva Caldeira, Pr\u00e9sident de la Cour et M. Henri grethen, Membre luxembourgeois de la Cour. C\u2019est sur l\u2019initiative du Cabinet luxembourgeois et avec le soutien exemplaire des services comp\u00e9tents que cette exposition a pu \u00eatre mise en oeuvre dans le but de mieux faire conna\u00eetre notre institution au vaste public. Le vernissage de l\u2019exposition \u00e0 la Maison de l\u2019Europe a eu lieu en pr\u00e9sence des autorit\u00e9s luxembourgeoises. 30 ans d\u2019histoire s\u2019affichent donc \u00e0 la Maison de l\u2019Europe, avec un lien direct avec l\u2019ENA, le Centre virtuel de la connaissance sur l\u2019Europe, qui fait revivre entre autres la voix de M. Heinrich Aigner, Membre du Parlement europ\u00e9en et Vice-pr\u00e9sident de la commission des budgets au d\u00e9but des ann\u00e9es soixante-dix. C\u2019est lui qui est en quelque sorte le p\u00e8re de notre institution. La Maison de l\u2019Europe est le Centre d\u2019information europ\u00e9en \u00e0 Luxembourg-Ville ; il a \u00e9t\u00e9 inaugur\u00e9 le 23 mars 2007. Les institutions europ\u00e9ennes y contribuent financi\u00e8rement. La Cour des comptes a sign\u00e9 l\u2019arrangement administratif le 1 er avril 2007 et contribue actuellement \u00e0 hauteur de 25 000 euros \u00e0 son financement. Cette initiative visant \u00e0 faire mieux conna\u00eetre notre institution pourrait \u00e0 la demande d\u2019autres Membres de la Cour \u00eatre reconduite dans diff\u00e9rents autres \u00e9tats membres au sein de leur espace publique dans leur \u00ab Maison de l\u2019Europe \u00bb.
