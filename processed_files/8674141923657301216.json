In line with the Council Conclusions on the inclusion of a SALW element in agreements between the EU and third countries adopted in December 2008, several negotiations, including a SALW clause, were conducted in 2009. In this framework, a SALW elemen t was ag reed with Chin a, I raq, Lib ya an d South Korea. Assistance to third states, international and regional organisa\u00ad tions, in combating the destabilising accumulation of SALW con\u00ad tinued to be provided by the EU. This included the implementation of projects in the framework of several Joint Actions and Council Decisions as well as through development and cooperation instruments, and through projects supported by EU Member States on a national basis. In 2009, the EU continued to participate in the Arms Trade Treaty (ATT) process. All EU Member States (MS) voted in favour of the 2009 UNGA resolution on ATT, convening an International Con\u00ad ference to negotiate an Arms Trade Treaty in 2012. The EU also continued to en gage an d en courage third coun tries to support the process, including through the implementation of Council Deci\u00ad sion 2009/42/CFSP promoting the process leading towards an Arms Trade Treaty among third countries, with the organisation of five regional seminars in 2009. The EU Strategy to combat illicit accumulation and trafficking of SALW and their ammunition, adopted by the European Council on 15 and 16 December 2005, continues to provide the strategic guidance for EU and its Member States\u2019 activities in the field of SALW through the various instruments available. This report has been compiled as part of the implementation of Council Joint Action 2002/589/CFSP. It covers activities under\u00ad taken in 2009 and it is structured in three parts, plus an annex: \u2014 Part I covers Member States\u2019 efforts to address the problems related to small arms and light weapons at national level, \u2014 Part II deals with international implementation efforts, \u2014 Part III deals with participation in the work of international organisations and regional arrangements in the field of con\u00ad ventional arms, especially small arms and light weapons, \u2014 the Annex includes the list of EU Member States focal points in the field of SALW.

        "C 198/2 EN Official Journ al of the E uropean Un ion 20.7.2010 I. NATIONAL IMPLEMENTATION EFFORTS DURING 2009 The EU adopted on 8 December 2008 Common Position 2008/944/CFSP. The adoption of this legally binding instrument marked the formal successful conclusion of a review of the Code and set another milestone in improving the EU\u2019s export control standards. The Common Position constitutes a significantly updated and upgraded instrument which replaces the Code of Conduct. It includes several new elements, which deepen and widen the scope of application. These elements include the exten\u00ad sion of controls to brokering, transit transactions and intangible transfers of technology, as well as the implementation of strength\u00ad ened procedures in order to harmonise Member States\u2019 export policies. Recognising the special responsibility of military tech\u00ad nology and equipment exporting states, Member States have once again shown their determination to prevent the export of mili\u00ad tary technology and equipment which might be used for undesir\u00ad able purposes such as internal repression or international aggression or contribute to regional instability. I.A. Cooperation, coordination and exchange of informa\u00ad tion between administrative and law enforcement agencies The following are the contributions provided by EU Member States concerning their national efforts undertaken in 2009 to enhance cooperation between national administrative and law enforcement agencies responsible for addressing the risks posed by the illicit trade and excessive accumulation of SALW: AUSTRIA Austria has further fostered cooperation, coordination and exchange of information between administrative and law enforce\u00ad ment agencies. During 2009, inter-ministerial meetings between the Ministry of European and International Affairs, the Ministry of the Interior, the Ministry of Economics and Labour and the Min\u00ad istry of Defence were held. BULGARIA Bulgaria has further fostered interinstitutional cooperation, coor\u00ad dination and information exchange in order to counter the accu\u00ad mulation and spread of SALW as well as to prevent illicit trafficking. CZECH REPUBLIC According to the Act No 122/1997 Coll. on System of Ministries and Central Authorities of the State Administration of the Czech Republic, as amended, the control and surveillance of arms and ammunition, arms trade, transfer, brokering and licensing, and the observance of relevant laws, treaties, convections, decrees and regulations fall within the competence of the following institutions: Ministry of Interior Ministry of Industry and Trade Ministry of Defence Customs Administration Ministry for Foreign Affairs is a coordinator and a national con\u00ad tact point for liaison with abroad and with international organi\u00ad sations in matters relating to SALW, and in matters resulting from the international commitments of the Czech Republic. CYPRUS Within the Cyprus Police Headquarters, a national arms archive has also been established and an electronic database facilitates the sharing of information on SALW with other competent authori\u00ad ties of the EU, regional organisations and third countries. DENMARK The general system in Denmark The Danish Ministry of Justice administrates the Danish weapons and explosives legislation, which also includes the regulation of small arms and light weapons. Pursuant to the provisions of the Danish weapons and explosives legislation, weapons and ammunition may not be imported, manufactured, acquired, possessed or carried without a licence from the Minister of Justice or from the person authorised by the Minister to issue such licences. The legislation also stipulates that weapons or explosives of any kind, including ammunition, may not be exported without a spe\u00ad cific licence from the Minister of Justice. This provision also includes small arms and light weapons. The Minister of Justice has authorised the local police districts to issue certain of the abovementioned licences concerning small arms and light weapons (possession of firearms etc.) Databases and registers The Danish police have established a central electronic database (The Police Weapons Register) in which all persons authorised to possess firearms are registered on the basis of applications received for firearms licences and registrations of purchases of smoothbore shotguns etc. The register also contains information on lost and stolen weapons. The Police Weapon s Reg ister in cludes all relevan t in formation including category and type of weapon, manufacture, model, marking (number), calibre and special characteristics. Each weapon is registered under a specific identification number. The police may order that the weapon be marked with the identifica\u00ad tion number if the weapon is not marked from the manufacturer. The register also includes historical information which makes it possible to locate in formation on previous own ers of a weapon . ",
        "20.7.2010 EN Official Journ al of the E uropean Un ion C 198/3 Information on lost firearms etc. is also reported to the Schengen Information System (SIS). All Danish rifle associations are furthermore required to establish their own weapons registers which must include information on all firearms owned by the association and its members. In addition, business owners in possession of a permit to trade with weapons are required to keep a record and \u2014 upon specific instructions from the police \u2014 regularly report to the Police Weapons Register on their purchases and sales of weapons. ESTONIA During 2009, Estonia has further fostered cooperation, coordina\u00ad tion and exchange of information between relevant government ministries and agencies. Meetings with representatives from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Ministry of Defence, Ministry of Eco\u00ad nomic Affairs and Communications, the Security Police Board, Estonian Tax and Customs Board, and Estonian Law Enforcement Board were held under the auspices of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in order to address questions related to export control, to monitor and evaluate the relevance of the current legislation and identify outdated or irrelevant provisions on transfer of arms, military equipment and dual-use items. Furthermore, a day-long awareness seminar on export controls (focusing on small arms and light weapons as well) was organised in November 2009 in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The event was designed to raise awareness among the civil society, non-governmental organisa\u00ad tions and various sectors and manufacturers. FINLAND The National Coordination Group of SALW experts continued to work in 2009. The group includes representatives of the minis\u00ad tries involved with arms control, disarmament and non- proliferation of SALW and the representatives of national non- governmental organisations dealing with the issue. The group discusses, inter alia, the Finnish policy concerning SALW, imple\u00ad mentation of the national, regional and global provisions and regulations an d b ilateral assistan ce to SALW projects. The Supreme Command of the Finnish Police was separated from the Ministry of the Interior and the National Police Board was grounded on January 1 st 2010. The tasks concerning the licens\u00ad ing of the firearms for civilian use as well as the general supervi\u00ad sion of the Firearms Act were transferred to the National Police Board. The general supervision of the Firearms Act falls under the Min\u00ad istry of the I nterior\u2019s competen ce. The police supervise compli\u00ad ance with the Act. The Frontier Guard and the Customs supervise compliance with the Act in their respective areas of competence. The SALW which are confiscated or voluntarily handed over to the state, are destroyed if they are not handed over to the collec\u00ad tion s of state authorities. These SALW are destroyed by cutting into small pieces by the police. The total number of firearms destroyed was 6 338 in 2009, which is 97 per cent of the total amount of firearms confiscated or handed over to the state. GERMANY The threat to peace, security and development posed by the desta\u00ad bilising accumulation and spread of small arms and light weap\u00ad ons including their ammunition continues to be a matter of grave concern. Germany is committed to a comprehensive approach to combat, and to contribute to ending, the destabilising accumula\u00ad tion and spread of small arms and light weapons as well as their ammunition. In the pursuit of this objective, Germany as a Mem\u00ad ber State of the European Union is guided by the EU Strategy to combat the illicit accumulation and trafficking of SALW and their ammunition, which was adopted by the European Council on 15-16 December 2005. Regular meetings of the national coordination group for SALW issues were organised by the Federal Foreign Office. These meet\u00ad ings bring together arms and export control experts from minis\u00ad tries, administration, the military arms control and verification unit and non-governmental organisations in order to address questions related to small arms and light weapons including their ammunition. The group discusses, inter alia, German policy with regard to SALW in international and regional fora, multilateral and bilateral assistance as well as the implementation of national, regional and global provisions and regulations. The meetings are chaired by a representative of the Federal Foreign Office. Various initiatives were taken with regard to the cooperation between administrative bodies and law enforcement agencies at the national level. These covered newly enacted legislation, but also reviews of the practical functioning of existing legislation. Training measures were regular part of such efforts. In 2009, these initiatives included in particular the following: Germany has taken concrete steps in order to implement the pro\u00ad visions of the UN Protocol against the Illicit Manufacturing of and Trafficking in Firearms, Their Parts and Components and Ammu\u00ad nition, supplementing the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime and the provisions of the Inter\u00ad national Instrument to Enable States to Identify and Trace, in a Timely and Reliable Manner, Illicit Small Arms and Light Weap\u00ad ons. With the resulting amendments to the Weapons Act, the marking of arms and the duty of bookkeeping are extended also to essential parts of weapons and, as a consequence, tracking the origins of weapons is facilitated at international level GREECE The fight against the illegal trade in small arms and light weapons constitutes a top priority for the Ministry of Citizen Protection and the Hellenic Police Headquarters. Every possible effort is being made to reduce, if not eliminate, this phenomenon and to con\u00ad solidate the feeling of security amon g citizen s. ",
        "C 198/4 EN Official Journ al of the E uropean Un ion 20.7.2010 The goal set for the year 2009, according to the anti-crime policy, was to increase the confiscations of illegally possessed and traded SALW, through the elaboration of specialised-targeted action plans by the competent police authorities. Our efforts focus on two directions: 1. Controlling the legal trade in arms throughout all its stages (import, trade, possession, use); 2. Establishing more intensive controls, in cooperation with other competent authorities, so as to track down and confis\u00ad cate illegally imported, traded, possessed and used small arms and light weapons. (a) Measures for controlling the legal trade in SALW Our Agency run s an electron ic datab ase which con stitutes the National Central Authority for information sharing and is able to directly receive and forward information regarding all legally traded and possessed arms/weapons. This database is constantly updated with all changes in possession status. All missing arms/weapons \u2014 whether they are lost, stolen, embezzled, tracked \u2014 are entered into this database in order to be confiscated or used as evidence in criminal proceedings and to be identified in case they are tracked down. This database gives the history of each arm/weapon from its import up to its last legal holder (arms/weapons records). Further\u00ad more, this database facilitates the sharing of information on SALW with other authorities in Greece and abroad. A minimum number of controls on a monthly basis has been established for every enterprise that is legally active in arms trading. Control data are cross-checked with the data kept in the electronic database of our Agency. \u2014 The provisions of the applicable law 2168/1993 and the rel\u00ad evant Ministerial Decisions are strictly observed. These con\u00ad stitute the main reg ulatory framework in our coun try governing the issues of arms and weapons. This law has been harmonised with Directive 91/477/EEC and the Schengen Convention and in some cases it includes even stricter pro\u00ad visions (Article 15 of Law 2168/1993 and Article 272 of the Criminal Code, as amended by Law 2928/2001). \u2014 Legal trade in small arms and light weapons (import-export- trade and transit) in our country requires a special license issued by the competent authority pursuant to the provisions of Law 2168/1993. \u2014 Cooperation is excellent between national authorities (port and customs authorities, Agency of Special Controls) and Military Authorities which also share information with the competent authorities of the countries from which arms and weapon s are imported or transported through our country. (b) Measures for controlling the illegal trade in SALW \u2014 Given that bilateral cooperation at regional and international level is deemed to be absolutely necessary for the prevention and suppression of illegal trade in arms and weapons from one country to another, our country has signed agreements regarding police cooperation with its neighbouring countries and participates in international, regional and bilateral organisations (Adriatic-Ionian Initiative, SECI-EUROPOL- INTERPOL). \u2014 All vehicles and persons entering our country are checked at the established points of entry. \u2014 Constant controls are carried out at the land and sea borders (in cooperation with port authorities) so as to prevent illegal import of arms and weapons by persons entering the Greek territory illegally. \u2014 Disclosed cases are thoroughly in vestigated in order to track down and dismantle networks that may be active in the ille\u00ad gal trade in arms and weapons. \u2014 Special measures are taken in areas with intense problems of trading, possession and use of arms and weapons, in coop\u00ad eration with the local communities and bodies. HUNGARY Hungary has further fostered interinstitutional cooperation, coor\u00ad dination and information exchange in order to counter the accu\u00ad mulation and spread of SALW, as well as to prevent illicit trafficking. Regular meetings of representatives of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA), Ministry of Defence (MD), Ministry of Jus\u00ad tice and Law Enforcement (MJLE) and other agencies had taken place during 2009. IRELAND The Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, as the licensing authority for exports of military and dual use equip\u00ad ment, continued the implementation of the Control of Exports Act 2008. The Department of Foreign Affairs liaised throughout the year with the Department of Transport to ensure that they were fully aware of the risk of illicit arms being transported by air. LUXEMBOURG The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has the task of liaising with other States and organisations for the purposes of international coordi\u00ad n ation in the area of small arms an d lig ht weapon s. ",
        "20.7.2010 EN Official Journ al of the E uropean Un ion C 198/5 MALTA The Police, Customs, the Trade Department and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs engaged in constant cooperation and exchange of information. All movements concerning importation and the export of weapons involve a coordinated mechanism between the different departments as established by the pertinent national legislation. POLAND Poland has further fostered interinstitutional information exchange in order to prevent illicit trafficking. PORTUGAL Efforts to foster cooperation, coordination and exchange of infor\u00ad mation b etween law en forcement ag encies in comb ating the accu\u00ad mulation and spread of small arms and light weapons, as well on the prevention of illicit trafficking have continued. Regular meet\u00ad ings with representatives from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Ministry of Defence and the Ministry of Interior have taken place in 2009. SPAIN In 2009 Spain made significant progress in implementing the UN Programme of Action to Prevent, Combat and Eradicate the Illicit Trade in Small Arms and Light Weapons (SALW) in All Its Aspects, and in applying the international instrument on the marking and tracing of SALW. Activities to promote a culture of peace and to establish addi\u00ad tional standards to improve control have been carried out, and established links with the United Nations Office for Disarmament Affairs, Interpol, regional organisations (OSCE, NATO) and non- governmental organisations (both national and foreign) have been strengthened. The various ministerial departments responsible for coordinating action and exchanges of information in the area of SALW and ammunition have held regular meetings on these issues, in par\u00ad ticular in the Permanent Interministerial Commission on Arms and Explosives (CIPAE, two meetings a month), the Interministe\u00ad rial Regulatory Board on Foreign Trade in Defence and Dual-Use Goods (JIMDDU, one meeting a month), and the working groups responsible for detecting and combating trafficking in SALW. I.B. Newly enacted legislation, reviews of the practical functioning of existing legislation A number of Member States introduced newly enacted legislation in 2009 or are in the process of reviewing existing legislation. Lat\u00ad est developments in clude: AUSTRIA No new legislation specifically related to SALW issues was enacted in 2009. Arms export controls have been greatly improved by the Foreign Trade Act 2005 (FTA) and the subsequent Foreign Trade Regula\u00ad tion of 2006. This implementing legislation harmonises the grant\u00ad ing of licences with relevant provisions of the EU-Code of Conduct on Arms Exports and makes it obligatory for Austrian traders. Furthermore, it defines brokers and brokering activities in line with Council Common Position 2003/468/CFSP on the control of arms brokering. The Austrian War Material Regulation and the Ministry of Economy, Family and Youth\u2019s list of military equipment other than war material correspond with the EU Common Military List. Under the FTA the items of the EU Common Military List are sub\u00ad ject to a license requirement in export, transit and brokering. Intra community trade with goods of the EU Common Military List is \u2014 with certain exceptions \u2014 subject to a monitoring procedure. Technical assistance in connection with the development, produc\u00ad tion, handling, operation, maintenance or other servicing, stock\u00ad piling, testing or proliferation of conventional weapons systems with military capability is not granted in the following cases: if such assistance contradicts restrictive measures on the basis of EU Common Positions or EU Common Actions, OSCE Decisions or binding resolutions of the United Nations Security Council. Furthermore, a regulation passed by the Minister of Defence enu\u00ad merates war material and other weapons which are taken into consideration for destruction. The list is built upon definitions of the EU and the OSCE. Austria has raised awareness for the problems posed by SALW during its \u2018open day\u2019 in the Ministry for European and Interna\u00ad tion al Affairs on 26 October 2009. Posters and a documentary movie informed the public about the horrendous impact of the illicit trade in SALW. BELGIUM By the Royal Decree (an executive act by the federal government) of 14 April 2009, that modifies the Royal Decree of 24 April 1997, security and safety standards placed on storage, depot and the collection of firearms and ammunition held by gun dealers, collectors and owners were improved. For each class of arms and munitions, specific storage security standards are imposed. The new royal decree includes new security rules on the possession, exhibition, home depot and transportation of firearms. These measures must b e in force on April 25, 2010 at the latest.. ",
        "C 198/6 EN Official Journ al of the E uropean Un ion 20.7.2010 CZECH REPUBLIC As to the national legislation concerning SALW, ammunition and conventional arms, the national laws have been adopted during the previous years. Furthermore, implementing regulations, that control the exports, imports, transit, transfer and brokering are issued by the governmental authorities in order to enable rigor\u00ad ous, consistent as well as smooth application of the appropriate laws. Overall policy of the Government of the Czech Republic, including the system of laws, is compatible and fully in accor\u00ad dance with the relevant EU directives, international law, conven\u00ad tions, treaties and resulting obligations and commitments. The Government of the Czech Republic approved the Govern\u00ad ment Decree No 10 on January 5, 2009, which tasked relevant Ministries and State Authorities to prepare amendments concern\u00ad ing a unified system of treatment with commodities embodying a certain liability, to which both SALW and ammunition belong. During 2009 seven amendments to the existing laws have been adopted, four of them entered into force in 2009, three of them are still in the process of consideration with assumption of their effectiveness in 2010. The most important laws and regulations: Act No 38/1994 Coll.1 on Regulation of Foreign Trade in Mili\u00ad tary Material, as amended, (so-called \u2018Foreign Trade in Military Material Act\u2019) Act No 156/2000 Coll. on Proofs of Firearms, Ammunition and Pyrotechnic Devices, as amended, (so-called \u2018Firearms Proofing Act\u2019) Act No 594/2004 Coll. on Implementation of a Community Regime for the Control of Exports, Transfer, Brokering and Tran\u00ad sit of Dual-Use Goods and Technologies, as amended Act No 156/2009 Coll. on treatment of things useable for defence and security purposes, as amended Act No 220/2009 Coll. on Changes and Amendments to the Act No 38/1994 Coll. Decree No 332/2009 Coll. on Implementation of the Act No 38/1994 Coll., as amended Act No 484/2008 Coll.on Amendments to the Act No 119/2002 Coll. on Firearms and Ammunition, (so-called \u2018Arms Act\u2019) CYPRUS The export, transit and retransfer of SALW are regulated by the Ministerial Order 257/2005 \u2014 amended as 165/2008 \u2014 con\u00ad cerning the export of military equipmen t. The aforemen tioned Order is aligned with the EU Code of Conduct on Arms Export and the relevant Council Declaration of 13 June 2000 (2000/C191/01). In this regard, the Cyprus Ministry of Com\u00ad merce, Industry and Tourism is the competent authority for the issue of all export, retransfer (re-export) and transit licenses for SALW, while the Customs and Excis Department is responsible for applying export control, according to the provisions of the Customs Legislation. Moreover, the import, acquisition, possession and transport of SALW are regulated by Law 113(1)/2004 \u2018On Firearms and non- Firearms\u2019 which is aligned with the European Union Directive 91/477/EEC (as amended) and the Declaration 2000/C191/01. This Law provides for the prohibition of manufacturing of SALW by citizens or residents of the Republic, unless they hold a valid license for this purpose, issued by the Chief of Police. This license is granted to citizens, under certain conditions such as, inter alia, the absence of any criminal record on the part of the applicant and a governmental medical examination. Furthermore, the illegal manufacture, possession, stockpiling and trade of SALW is governed by Law 113(I)2004, which provides for sentences up to 15 years imprisonment and/or a penalty of EUR 42 715 in the case of violation of its provisions. DENMARK On 12 June 2008 the Danish Parliament adopted a new act with the purpose of enhancing the effort against possession of illicit weapons in public places. A new provision was inserted in the Danish Criminal Code after which the maximum sentence for possession, carriage or use of illicit weapons \u2014 under particular aggravating circumstances \u2014 in public places is 4 years imprisonment. On 1 October 2004 a new act containing rules on transportation of weapons between third countries (i.e. other countries than Denmark) entered into force. The rules ban transportation of weapons etc. to countries covered by a UN, EU or OSCE arms embargo. Furthermore, transportation between third countries that have not issued the necessary export and import licenses is banned. Furthermore, on 14 June 2005 the Danish Parliament adopted an act introducing, among other things, arms brokering. According to this act it is prohibited without a license from the Minister of Justice, or the person authorised by the Minister, as a broker to negotiate or arrange transactions that involve the transfer of weapons etc., as defined in the Danish weapons and explosives leg islation, b etween coun tries outside the E U. Furthermore, it is prohibited to buy or sell such weapons etc. as part of a transfer between countries outside the EU, or, as the owner of the weap\u00ad ons etc., to arrange such a transfer. The ban does not apply to activities carried out in another EU Member State or outside the EU by individuals residing abroad. The act implements the Euro\u00ad pean Council Common Position 2003/468/CFSP of 23 June 2003 on the control of arms brokering. ",
        "20.7.2010 EN Official Journ al of the E uropean Un ion C 198/7 ESTONIA In 2009, minor amendments were introduced to the Weapons Act which establishes the legal bases and procedures for the han\u00ad dling of weapons and ammunitions, the grant of permission for weapons and ammunition to be used for civilian purposes, the use of weapons and ammunition for civilian purposes and the removal of weapons and ammunition from civilian use, the requirements for firing ranges and field firing ranges and the bases and procedures for the exercise of state supervision in such areas in order to be fully in line with the European Union regulation on arms trade and to clarify the right of foreigners to own weapons. The process of amending and adapting the Weapons Act is still ongoing in order to comply with the European Parliament and the Council directive on control of the acquisition and possession of weapons (2008/51/EC). No other modifications on SALW related issues were enacted in 2009. Estonia is in the process of reviewin g the existin g Strateg ic Goods Act; nevertheless no changes have been made in 2009. FINLAND Legislative measures have been taken in order to nationally imple\u00ad ment the requirements of the Directive of the European Parlia\u00ad ment and of the Council amending the Council Directive 91/477/EEC on control of the acquisition and possession of weapons (2008/51/EC). A legislative proposal (Government Bill 106/2009) has been presented to Parliament for approval. FRANCE France has continued its work on implementation of the provi\u00ad sions of the United Nations Firearms Protocol, with a view to the entry into force of Directive 2008/51/EC of 21 May 2008. In connection with the adoption of the Wassenaar Arrangement\u2019s military list as the national reference list for the control of arms exports, France has adapted its regulations on small arms and light weapons. HUNGARY There was no new legislation adopted on SALW related issues in 2009. Hungary has implemented Council Common Position 2008/944/CFSP on defining common rules governing control of exports of military equipment. LATVIA The provisions of the EU Council Common Position 2008/944/CFSP defining common rules governing control of exports of military technology and equipment adopted on Decem\u00ad ber 8, 2008 have been fully incorporated into national legislation of the Republic of Latvia On December, 2009 the Cabinet of Ministers adopted new Regu\u00ad lations No 1665 \u2018Procedures by Which Licenses and Other Docu\u00ad ments of the Control of Strategic Goods Are Issued or Denied\u2019 implementing criterions set out in the Common Position for reviewing applications for licences for items listed in EU Common Military List. The Law on the Circulation of Goods of Strategic Significance of July 19, 2007 has been amended in March, 2009 by provisions concerning equipment for operational activities performed by law enforcement institutions. There have been several minor amendments introduced for exist\u00ad ing national legislation due to structural changes in different insti\u00ad tutions involved in the strategic goods control process in 2009. Regulations on The National List of Goods and Services of Stra\u00ad tegic Significance that containing the list of goods to be controlled additional to those included in the EU Council Regulation (EC) No 1334/2000 and Common Military List of the EU have been amended on November 24, 2009 by provisions on surveillance cameras used in operational activities performed by law enforce\u00ad ment institutions. In 2009 the Ministry of Defence adopted new \u2018Arms regulations\u2019 establishing unified requirements for the circulation of arms within the National Armed Forces. The process of accounting records and defining conditions for storage has been optimised, made more transparent, defining basic principles of the control at all levels of the National Armed Forces. New regulations are being elaborated regarding handling of weap\u00ad ons in order to incorporate norms of EU Council Directive 2008/51/EC of 21 May 2008 amending the EU Council Directive 91/477/EEC. LITHUANIA In June 2009, Lithuania conducted the outreach seminar to indus\u00ad try and academic community on export control regulation and policies, including prevention of illicit tracking in small arms and light weapons. Lithuania regularly updated the List of the States to which the Export or Transit of the Goods Listed in the Common Military List is Prohibited and for which Brokering in Negotiations and Trans\u00ad actions in the Goods Listed in the Common Military List is Pro\u00ad hibited in order to reflect changes of restrictive measures on military equipment imposed by the UN Security Council or the European Union. LUXEMBOURG No new legislation specifically dedicated to SALW was introduced in 2009. ",
        "C 198/8 EN Official Journ al of the E uropean Un ion 20.7.2010 The relevant legal basis is to be found in the Law of 15 March 1983 on arms and ammunition and in the Grand Ducal Regula\u00ad tion of 31 October 1995 on the import, export and transit of arms, ammunition and equipment intended specifically for mili\u00ad tary use and of related technology. These have been published in the M\u00e9morial, the official gazette of the Grand Duchy of Luxem\u00ad bourg. A review of existing legislation is currently under way. Prohibited arms Article 4 of the Law of 15 March 1983 on arms and ammunition prohibits the import, manufacture, conversion, repair, acquisition, purchase, holding, storage, transport, carrying, transfer, sale or export of, or trade in, certain types of arms and ammunition. Not\u00ad withstanding that provision, however, the Minister for Justice may in particular authorise: (a) the import, acquisition, purchase, transport, holding, sale, transfer or export of, or trade in, arms and ammunition con\u00ad stituting antiques, works of art or decorative items or intended to form part of a collection or display; authorisa\u00ad tion may be subject to the condition that the arm has been permanently disabled; (b) the import, acquisition, purchase, transport, holding, sale, transfer or export of arms and ammunition for scientific or educational purposes; (c) the import, export or transit of arms from abroad which are heading for another country. Such authorisation may be subject to the condition that the arms in question may be used for purposes other than those stated above. Luxembourg does not have any national marking system for use in the manufacture and/or import of small arms. There is no arms factory in the country. Gunsmiths and dealers in arms and ammu\u00ad nition have to keep a register showing incoming and outgoing arms, with the make, calibre and serial number of each arm and the names and addresses of its supplier and purchaser. The regis\u00ad ter must also show the number and date of issue of the ministe\u00ad rial authorisation. It must be produced at the request of any representative of the public authorities. Gunsmiths and arms deal\u00ad ers may be required to supply the Minister for Justice with a copy of their register. The maximum quantities of arms and ammuni\u00ad tion which gunsmiths and arms dealers are allowed to hold in stock are set by the Minister for Justice. I n the even t of riots, suspicious g atherings or pub lic order distur\u00ad bances, the Minister for Justice may order the closure or evacua\u00ad tion of any arms and ammunition shops or stores and the transfer of their contents to a specified location. Breaches of the Law of 15 March 1983 are punishable by impris\u00ad onment for from eig ht days up to five years. Export controls An application for export has to be lodged with the prohibited firearms department, attaching a photocopy of the acquirer\u2019s identity document. Applicants must also attach either \u2014 for EU Member States \u2014 a document confirming the prior agreement of the State of resi\u00ad dence of the acquirer, or \u2014 for countries outside the EU \u2014 a copy of the authorisation from that State, with a view to the acquisi\u00ad tion of the firearm. The authorisation which is issued then allows the acquirer physi\u00ad cally to collect the firearm in question from the seller and to trans\u00ad port it to the Luxembourg border. Given that such authorisation is only valid within Luxembourg, the acquirer must make enqui\u00ad ries of his State of residence about any authorisation necessary under the law of that State. An export licence must also be sought from the licensing office at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. In the framework and in application of Directive 91/477/EEC on control of the acquisition and possession of weapons (Article 11), Luxembourg notifies the other Member States concerned of licences issued for export to their territories. The licensing office may require applications for transit of arms, ammunition and equipment intended specifically for military use and of related technology to be accompanied by a document in which the competent authorities in the country from which the goods come certify that export to the stated country of destina\u00ad tion is authorised. Applications for export or transit licences have to be accompa\u00ad nied by an undertaking, signed by the applicant, to carry out the export or transit operation in accordance with the licence appli\u00ad cation. After each consignment of goods covered by an export licence, the exporter has to provide the licensing office, within three months, with proof that they have arrived in the authorised country of destination and that the importer has had them cleared for home use. Such proof is provided either by a document issued by the import\u00ad ing country\u2019s customs authorities, showing that the exported goods have been declared for home use, or by any other docu\u00ad ment showing the goods to have been directly taken receipt of by the authority qualified to do so in the importing country or by any business acting for that authority. Destruction of arms The method used in Luxembourg (by its army, police and cus\u00ad toms) is destruction by severing. This is carried out by their respective armouries. The cut-up metal is all placed in a container and then transported by armoury staff to a steelworks, where it is melted down in electronic blast furnaces, in the presence of wit\u00ad n esses. A record of the operation is then drawn up. ",
        "20.7.2010 EN Official Journ al of the E uropean Un ion C 198/9 THE NETHERLANDS With respect to legislation on small arms and light weapons, the Netherlands has made no major modifications in 2009. The Neth\u00ad erlands is currently in the process of preparing implementing leg\u00ad islation for the EU-Directive 2008/51/EC and the TOC weapons-protocol. PORTUGAL The following legislative initiatives took place: \u2014 Law 17/2009, amending Law 5/2006 (which established a comprehensive regime applying to all categories of small arms and light weapons, excluding only those for military use and for armed and security forces). \u2014 Law 49/2009, regulating brokering activities and all exports, imports, transit and transhipment of military weapons, mak\u00ad ing it mandatory for all brokers to be registered with the Min\u00ad istry of Defence. ROMANIA In 2009 the List of military goods subject to export controls regime was updated and amended according to European Union and Wassenaar Arrangement List (Government Decision no 1607/2009). SLOVAKIA As regards the national implementation of the EU Joint Action on SALW and the EU Programme for Preventing and Combating Illicit Trafficking in Conventional Arms and with respect to the legislation on SALW in Slovakia, a new legal framework entered into force in 2009 covering import, export, transfer, licensing, brokering and possession of weapons and equipments for mili\u00ad tary use, small arms and light weapons, their components and the respective ammunition as well. Slovak National Council adopted two Acts. The Act No 179/1998 Coll. has been fully amended by the new Act No 403/2009 Coll. enabling transfer of licensing responsibility from the Ministry of Economy to the Ministry of Defence. The Act No 292/2009 Coll. establishes a comprehensive regime for trade control, which applies to all categories of small arms and light weapons, excluding small arms and light weapons for mili\u00ad tary use. SLOVENIA The Act Amending the Weapons Act was adopted in 2004 (Offi\u00ad cial Journal of the Republic of Slovenia (OJ RS), No 61/2000, 73/2004). In the last amendment to the Weapons Act of July 2004, the Act again provided for a one-year transitional period for the amnesty and legalisation of weapons, and brokering in weapons was also classified in the segment of arms trade. Last Act Amending the Weapons Act was adopted in 2009. Act is provid\u00ad ing also legalisation in period of 3 months (till 14.2.2010). Act is totally harmonised with EU Directive 2008/51/EC of 21 May 2008. In 2004, the Criminal Code (OJ RS, No 63-2167/1994 and 95- 4208/2004) was amended by a definition and incrimination of brokering in transactions involving weapons, offering weapons and extending the prescribed prison sentence for the basic form of this criminal offence from three to five years of prison. The Act Amending the Criminal Code from 2009 (OJ RS, No 39/2009) brought some news regarding criminal act Illegal Manufacture of and Trade in Weapons or Explosive Materials. There are two new paragraphs 3. If the offence under the preced\u00ad ing paragraph involves individual firearms or a minor quantity of ammunition for such firearms, the perpetrator shall be sentenced to imprisonment of not more than one year and 4. Whoever forges or unlawfully destroys, removes or modifies the markings on firearms shall be subject to the same penalty as referred to in the preceding paragraph). Wearing, keeping and maintaining of weapons by authorised offi\u00ad cial persons at the Prison Administration of the Republic of Slo\u00ad venia are regulated by the Regulations on Wearing, Storage and Maintenance of Weapons at the Prison Administration (Official Gazette RS 85/2009, page 11418-11424). Chapter 2, from Article 2 to Article 17, of the Regulations lays down the ways of handling, storing and protecting weapons. Article 17 provides for the Director-General to appoint persons in charge for taking over and providing weapons, their storage and maintenance when not in use and for keeping special registers. Articles 4 and 5 provide that weapons shall be stored on suitable premises secured against unauthorised access, theft, fire and other dangers or misuse. The records of service weapons held by the prison authorised persons (prison guards) are regulated by the Regulations on Wearing, Stor\u00ad age and Maintenance of Weapons in the Prison Administration. Commanders of Prison Guard and heads (Wardens) of internal organisation units (Prisons) are responsible for supervision. The number of weapons in stock is reviewed at least once a year at the yearly inventory. The Prison Administration also keeps central record of service weapons, which is updated instantly, and every three years, the authorised person of the Head Office carries out supervision over the keeping and maintaining of the service weapons SPAIN No new regulations specifically dedicated to SALW were intro\u00ad duced in 2009. The relevant legal basis is to be found in Law 53/2007 of 28 December 2007 on control of foreign trade in defence mate\u00ad rials and dual-used goods which entered into force on 29 January 2008, and in royal decree (Real Decreto) 2061/2008 of 12 December 2008, which develops the implementing rules referred to in Law 53/2007. ",
        "C 198/10 EN Official Journ al of the E uropean Un ion 20.7.2010 The Law explicitly takes into account Common Position 2008/944/CFSP of 8 December 2008 defining common rules governing control of exports of military technology and equip\u00ad ment, as well as the criterion adopted by the OSCE for export transactions relating to SALW. Other rules applicable to the control of firearms, their ammuni\u00ad tion and explosives are royal decree 137/1993 of 29 January 1993 adopting the Firearms Regulation and royal decree 230/1998 of 16 February 1998 adopting the Explosives Regulation. This legislation refers to and complies with all the rules adopted by the European Union and the provisions of the Programme of Action and resolutions adopted by the United Nations General Assemb ly (UNGA), in cluding the application of the in ternational instrument on the marking and tracing of SALW, as well as the additional protocol to the Convention against Transnational Organised Crime (adopted by the UNGA on 31 May 2001) on the illicit trafficking in firearms, their parts and ammunition, known as the \u2018United Nations Firearms Protocol\u2019. Spain is also party to the Convention for the reciprocal recogni\u00ad tion of proof marks on small arms and to the rules of the Perma\u00ad nent International Commission (CIP), and adopts the decisions taken in the context of that Convention in its national rules. UNITED KINGDOM In 2009 the Government completed the legislative changes result\u00ad ing from the 2007 Review of secondary legislation introduced under the Export Control Act 2002. The Export Control Order 2008, which came into force on 6 April 2009, consolidated the three previous export and trade Orders: the Export of Goods, Transfer of Technology and Provision of Technical Assistance (Control) Order 2003, as amended; the Trade in Goods (Catego\u00ad ries of Controlled Goods) Order 2008 (which itself replaced the Trade in Goods (Con trol) Order 2003, an d in troduced the three- tier structure to the trade controls); and the Trade in Controlled Goods (Embargoed Destinations) Order 2004. The new Order thus brought together the UK\u2019s controls on the export of military and para-military items, the national dual-use controls, and the controls on trade i.e. controls on the UK involvement in the movement, or in arranging or facilitating the movement, of mili\u00ad tary and certain other g oods b etween two overseas coun tries. I.C. Training of administration, law enforcement agencies, judicial organs The following section includes national efforts and initiatives undertaken by EU Member States in the area of training of national administrations. MALTA Training of administration and law enforcement agencies feature annually in the curriculum of the respective agency. POLAND Moreover, in March 2009 an awareness-raising seminar on export controls (including small arms and light weapons issue) was orga\u00ad nised in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The event was designed to raise awareness among the producers and exporters of arms and military equipment. SPAIN In 2009, as in previous years, the various Spanish law enforce\u00ad ment agencies continued to organise courses and workshops on the criminal law framework for firearms and explosives and the application of information technology to their control. Regular seminars were also organised to raise awareness of the legal framework applicable to preventing and combating illicit traffick\u00ad ing in SALW, with the goal of maintaining and enhancing the knowledge of police officers responsible for these issues. UNITED KINGDOM As part of the Governments extensive awareness campaign on export controls for industry around the UK, 42 seminars and training courses were held nationwide during 2009, attended by over 820 people from 340 organisations. Whilst not SALW spe\u00ad cific, they do highlight the consequences of exporting controlled goods without an appropriate licence. These seminars and courses included: Beginners\u2019 Workshops for those new to export controls; Intermediate-level seminars, cover\u00ad ing a number of issues including; exporting technology, the dif\u00ad ferent sorts of licences available, company compliance with export control legislation and the UK control lists; an Open Licences and Compliance seminar; a new seminar on the revised Trade controls and a series of workshops on Control List Classi\u00ad fications and seminars on \u2018Making Better Licence Applications\u2019 usin g the on line licen ce application system SPI RE.

Other initiatives or activities DENMARK At regular intervals so-called safe-conducts are granted by means of which illicit weapons may be handed over to the police with\u00ad out the person being charged with a violation of the Weapons and Explosives Act. The latest safe-conduct action for the handing in of illicit weap\u00ad ons was made in May-June 2009 where a total of 8 085 arms were handed over to the police. In 2009 the Danish National Police continued to carry out an intensive and targeted investigation in relation to rockers and gang members, among other things in order to uncover and indict illicit possession of weapons. During these confrontations between different gang members \u2014 or persons associated hereto \u2014 weapons were used on several occasions. In 2009 the National Centre of Forensic Services received a total of 2 831 weapons for examination. The Danish National Police is not in possession of information on the amount of weapons that have been confiscated from gang members. ESTONIA In 2009, illegal weapons and ammunition disposal campaigns designed to collect illegally owned civilian arms were launched all over the country by Police prefectures. The aim of these cam\u00ad paigns were to reinforce civilians\u2019 awareness about their legal obli\u00ad gations related to the possession of firearms, to reduce the amount of illegal weapons and ammunitions and to raise the security of society. A total of 92 firearms have been collected from citizen by these campaigns. All collected and seized weapons are destructed. FRANCE France pursued its policy of transparency on arms exports, in par\u00ad ticular as regards SALW, with the publication of its annual report to Parliament on French arms exports. France started consideration at national level of the French approach to \u2018disarmament, demobilisation and reintegration\u2019 and of the con cept of \u2018armed violen ce \u2019.

When fully operational it will make it possible to trace electronically every firearm bound for the civil market, manufactured, imported, exported or held by Italian companies or nationals. In 2009, Italian Armed Forces destroyed more than 15 000 small arms and light weapons, identified as surplus, on the Italian territory. MALTA A total of 97 weapons/firearms were destroyed in 2009. POLAND During 2009, a total of 3 932 weapons were apprehended and 1 103 were destroyed. ROMANIA Since December 2009 National Agency for Export Controls is reorganised as General Division ANCEX within Ministry of For\u00ad eign Affairs. During 2009 the national authority for arms and dual use export con trols regime was integrated within Ministry of Foreign Affairs (the Government Decision no 1423/2009). Ministry of Foreign Affairs / DG ANCEX is responsible for Roma\u00ad nian export controls system (legal framework, licensing, enforce\u00ad ment, outreach to industry, transparency). SLOVAKIA The Slovak Republic has in place appropriate legislation and nec\u00ad essary administrative measures to control production, possession, marking, and trade in small arms and light weapons. Effective export control system enables respective authorities to identify and monitor movement of weapons at any time and throughout the territory of the Slovak Republic. This system effectively supports combating illicit trafficking in conventional arms in the Slovak Repub lic. ",
        "C 198/12 EN Official Journ al of the E uropean Un ion 20.7.2010 In 2009 a campaign for Firearm Amnesty was launched for the second time. General Pardon for all persons illegally keeping small arms and light weapons entered into force in November 2009. Persons under the terms of the pardon can register any small arms and light weapons at the Police Authorities with no penalty at all, or prosecution and without explanation of the origins of weapon and manner of acquisition. The goal of the Government\u2019s efforts is to give a chance to persons keeping unregistered and hidden weapons to surrender them without any sanctions. The General Pardon is valid for 6 months. SPAIN Coordinated by the Central Inspectorate for Arms and Explosives of the Guardia Civil, the competent Spanish authorities seized 227 illegal firearms (159 from Schengen countries and 68 from non-Schengen countries) in 2009. At present, the Spanish authorities are holding a total of 286 247 firearms of all kinds, of which 19 452 have already been selected for auctioning and 32 933 for destruction. In 2009, the authorities carried out 24 589 inspections, leading to the launch of proceedings in 742 cases against manufacturers, gunsmiths, individuals or security companies; of those cases, 151 related to firearms and 591 to explosives. Customs staff also carry out regular activities at airports and ports in the context of detect\u00ad ing offences in these areas. II. INTERNATIONAL IMPLEMENTATION EFFORTS DURING 2009 II.A. Measures to combat the accumulation and spread of small arms and light weapons, and to prevent illicit trafficking in conventional arms II.A.1. Financial, technical and other assistance given to relevant programmes and projects conducted by the UN, other international or regional organisa\u00ad tions and NGOs II.A.1.1.1. Actions and projects supported by the Euro\u00ad pean Union: support to international and regional instruments Support to the UN Programme of Action on SALW The EU continued its support for the implementation of the UN Programme of Action on SALW. In preparation for the next meeting in 2010 of the Biennial Meeting of States and of the Review Conference of 2012, the EU started to explore specific actions and projects to be developed in synergy with UN ODA and other don ors to rein force an d improve the implemen tation of the most relevant international instrument in the field of SALW. A Council Decision in support of UNODA is to be adopted dur\u00ad ing the first half of 2010 and will include actions in support of the full implementation of: \u2014 the Un PoA at regional and global level, \u2014 the International Marking and Tracing Instrument, \u2014 technical guidelines for the management of Conventional Arms Ammunition Stockpiles. Support to the Arms Trade Treaty Process As part of its commitment to promoting a future ATT vis-\u00e0-vis third states, the EU adopted and implemented in 2009 Council Decision 2009/42/CFSP promoting the process leading towards an Arms Trade Treaty among third countries, adopted by the Council in January 2009. The objective of the Council Decision is to increase the awareness by national and regional actors, United Nations Member States, civil society and industry, of the current international discussions around an ATT, and to foster debate among United Nations Member States, particularly among those who were not part of the GGE. During 2009, five regional seminars covering respectively West\u00ad ern and Northern Africa, the America and Caribbean, the Middle East, Asia, and Southern and Eastern Africa were held in Dakar on 28-29 April 2009, Mexico City on 18-19 June 2009, Amman on 28-29 July 2009, Kuala Lumpur on 13-14 October 2009 and Addis Ababa on 10-11 December 2009. The level of participa\u00ad tion in the seminars was very good both in qualitative and quan\u00ad titative terms. These events provided participants with the opportunity of acquiring a deeper knowledge of the issues addressed by a future ATT, and to discuss specific regional ques\u00ad tions in preparation of the UN debate on ATT. Side-events were also held in the margins of the July session of the Open-Ended Working Group on ATT and at UNGA First Com\u00ad mittee on 20 October 2009, to present to UN MS the preliminary results achieved during the first four seminars foreseen by the Council Decision. Support to the African Union In 2009, the EU supported the Africa Union in elaborating an AU SALW Strategy through the financing of an expert. The ad-hoc Steering Committee of the African Union started to examine the draft SALW strategy in view of a possible adoption in 2010. The adoption of an AU SALW Strategy would enhance the efforts of the AU in establishing a peace and security architecture and rein\u00ad force its commitment to fight against the illicit accumulation and trafficking of SALW. The E U an d the African Un ion, with the support of the I talian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and in collaboration with the Italian Institute for International Affairs, the EU Institute for Security Studies and Chatham House, organised a three-day Conference in Rome on the \u2018Implementation of the Africa-EU Peace and Secu\u00ad rity Partnership\u2019 with a dedicated focus on SALW issues and chal\u00ad lenges specific to Africa. The results of this conference have informed the elab oration of the draft AU SALW Strateg y. ",
        "20.7.2010 EN Official Journ al of the E uropean Un ion C 198/13 Promotion of the EU Common Position on Arms Exports (ex Code of Conduct) The EU and Member States continue to support, through the dedi\u00ad cated Council Joint Action 2008/230/CFSP, the strengthening of export controls and the promotion of the principles and criteria of the Code of Conduct on Arms Exports (now Common Posi\u00ad tion) among third countries through technical and practical assis\u00ad tance, inter alia, in drafting national legislation and in interpreting and applying the criteria of the code, as well as by promoting measures to improve coherence and transparency. In this frame\u00ad work, three outreach seminars for Ukraine, Western Balkans and Southern Caucasus countries took place in Kiev, on 23-24 April 2008, Tirana on 3-5 June 2009, and Tbilisi on 27 and 28 Octo\u00ad ber 2009, organised by the Czech and Swedish Presidencies. In 2009 the EU also agreed to continue outreach activities towards the beneficiaries of the above Joint Action, and finalised and adopted in Decemb er 2009 Coun cil Decision 2009/1012/CFSP. In addition to outreach seminars in the beneficiary countries or regions, the new Council Decision provides for staff exchanges of up to one month of officials from beneficiary EU candidate coun\u00ad tries to the relevant authorities of EU countries, and visits of offi\u00ad cials from EU countries to the relevant authorities of beneficiary countries. II.A.1.1.2. Actions and projects supported by the Euro\u00ad pean Union: support to SALW-related activities in third countries/regions: Ukraine Under Council Decision 2005/852/CFSP, the EU committed to providing EUR 1 million to the NATO Maintenance and Supply Agency (NAMSA) for equipment acquisition and SALW destruc\u00ad tion in Ukraine, as a contribution during the first phase of a 12-year NATO Partnership for Peace (PfP) project. While first phase of the project aimed at for the destruction of 400 000 SALW, 1 000 MANPADs and 15 000 tons of ammunition in Ukraine, SALW and ammunition destruction has been slowed down since the totality of 400 000 SALW previously earmarked for destruction were not made available by the relevant Ukrainian authorities. To date 130 000 SALW have been destroyed. Following a series of demarches, the Ukrainian authorities adopted in July 2009 the necessary decision to resume SALW and ammunition destruction in Ukraine, within the framework of the NATO Trust Fund PfP project. This is expected to result in the additional destruction of 54 500 SALW and 6 000 tons ammu\u00ad nition. Within the framework of the Coun cil Decision men tioned above, the EU contributes to the resumed destruction of the addi\u00ad tional 54 500 SALW, thus ensuring effective use of funds allocated. Western Balkans The EU continued to support demilitarisation efforts in the field of SALW, in particular through the preparation of a new Council Decision in support of Southern Eastern and Eastern Europe Clearinghouse for the control of SALW (SEESAC). The activities foreseen by the Council Decision aim at: \u2014 improving the management and security of unsafe and unstable stockpiles of weapons and ammunition, \u2014 reducing the available stockpiles of weapons and ammuni\u00ad tion throug h destruction activities, an d \u2014 implementing international and national instruments on marking and tracing in the Western Balkan countries. The Western Balkans countries, in particular Croatia, Serbia, Bos\u00ad nia and Herzegovina and Montenegro are the identified beneficia\u00ad ries of the Council Decision. Implementation of the activities by SEESAC will start in 2010. Kosovo ( 1 ) UNSCR 1244/1999. ( 1 ): the EU provided assistance through the financing of an expert for the establishment of a Division on Small Arms within the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Kosovo as well as for the implementation of the law on weapons. The overall objective is to strengthen the rule of law in Kosovo by establishing a modern system, conform to EU standards, required for use (licensing, trade, import, export) of weapons for non-military purposes. This project is financed through the TAEIX programme. Africa Regional economic communities (RECs): in 2009, the EU pursued the implementation of its ongoing projects in the field of SALW in support to RECs in Africa, including the Eco\u00ad nomic Community of West African States, the Economic Com\u00ad munity of Central African States or the East African Community. The different projects aim, inter alia, at enhancing the capacity of states to effectively manage illegal SALW, to tackle cross-border proliferation of SALW based on a regional approach and to ensure overall political oversight and efficient management of legal arms transfers in the sub-region. These projects are financed through the European Development Fund. ",
        "C 198/14 EN Official Journ al of the E uropean Un ion 20.7.2010 Regional Centre on Small Arms (RECSA): in 2009, the EU prepared the launching for early 2010 of a project to sup\u00ad port the Africa-EU strategic partnership in the fight against the illicit accumulation and trafficking of firearms in Africa, via the Regional Centre on Small Arms and Light Weapons (RECSA) located in Nairobi. The project aims at raising the awareness and knowledge of relevant institutional and civil society actors on the legislative and institutional aspects of the fight against the illicit accumulation and trafficking of firearms with the view to foster the role or establish National Focal Points and to develop and/or implement National Action Plans (NAPs). It also aims at strength\u00ad ening the African Regional Police Chiefs Organisations (RPCOs) and the capacity of and cooperation between national, regional and continental law enforcement agencies to fight cross-border illicit trafficking in firearms and explosive materials. This project is financed through the Instrument for Stability (EUR 3,3 million). Nigeria: on 19 November 2009, the European Commission and the Federal Government of Nigeria signed the Nigeria-EC Country Strategy Paper and National Indicative Programme for the period 2008-2013 of which one of the objectives is to assist authorities in their efforts to support stability and establish a secure environment both inside and outside the country under the rule of law. In this context, the EU could support measures to upgrade the technical competence of the specialised agencies deal\u00ad ing with organised crime and small arms issues and strengthen\u00ad ing the investigative and forensic capacity of the ordinary police in order, inter alia, to reduce the illicit flow and trafficking of small arms. This assistance may be implemented through con\u00ad crete projects to support national capacity building in areas such as the licensing of gun ownership and manufacture, the develop\u00ad ment of an arms stockpile management system and awareness raising among customs and other border control agencies. These projects could initially be launched in 2011. Central America Central American Small and Light Weapons Control Programme: in 2009, the European Union started to support the Central American Small and Light Weapons Con\u00ad trol Prog ramme (CASAC) to en hance the fig ht ag ainst the illicit trafficking of firearms and explosive material in Central America and neighbouring countries, including in the Caribbean region. The project is structured into two levels: on the one hand, it con\u00ad centrates on Central America, including the participation of Mexico and Colombia, to build capacities and strengthen national and regional institutions and state agencies responsible for the control of SALW, and to strengthen and increase the capacities of civil society organisations to promote arms control; on the other hand, it creates a trans-regional space for the exchange of regional experiences with emphasis on generating information and improving and creating capacities within the border and customs zon es. This project is fin anced throug h the I nstrument for Stab il\u00ad ity (EUR 1 million). In addition, the European Union supported development and cooperation projects related to the reduction and prevention of violen ce, including risk education and victim assistance, in a large number of countries (San-Salvador, Sri Lanka, Kenya, Uganda \u2026) with a view to contribute to break the cycle of violence and pro\u00ad mote a culture of peace within society. Furthermore, the EU con\u00ad tinued to support broader DDR projects (Central African Republic, Ivory Coast \u2026) to promote a safe and secure environ\u00ad ment by mitigating the social effects of restructuring of the armed forces, facilitating the retirement of army personnel or providing socio-economic opportunities for ex-combatants.

It also incorporates data and an evaluation of the situa\u00ad tion regarding incidents involving weapons (suicides, wounds) and the use of legal weapons in criminal offences. II.B. Participation in the work of international organisa\u00ad tions and regional arrangements in the field of con\u00ad ventional arms, especially small arms and light weapons The EU continued its support for the implementation of the UN Programme of Action on SALW which remains the basis for efforts undertaken at the global level. In preparation for the next meeting in 2010 of the Biennial Meeting of States and of the Review Conference of 2012, the EU continued to promote the full implementation of the UN Prog ramme of Action on SALW in its relations with third countries. During this inter-sessional period, the EU also started to explore specific actions and projects to be developed in synergy with UN ODA and other donors to rein\u00ad force and improve the implementation of the most relevant inter\u00ad national instrument in the field of SALW. A Council Decision to this end is to be adopted during the first half of 2010 (see sec\u00ad tion II.A.1.1 for a detailed description of the Council Decision). The open-ended working group (OEWG) established in order to facilitate further consideration on the implementation of the rec\u00ad ommendations of the 2008 UN Secretary General\u2019s report on ATT, met twice in 2009 in March and July. The EU has also been in the front line of the Arms Trade Treaty (ATT) process in 2009. EU Member States unanimously sup\u00ad ported the n ew UNGA draft resolution on ATT, adopted during the 64th session of the UNGA First Committee in October 2009. The resolution supported by an overwhelming majority of UN States contains the decision of convening an International Con\u00ad ference on ATT in 2012 which will be prepared by five Prepara\u00ad tory Committees to be held between 2010 and 2012. The EU also continued to engage and encourage third countries to support the process. EU Member States actively participated in the work of the two March and July sessions of the open-ended working group (OEWG), established in 2009 in order to facilitate further consideration on the implementation of the recommen\u00ad dations of the 2008 UN Secretary General\u2019s report on ATT. Opening and closing EU statements were delivered, while several EU MS substantially contributed to the thematic discussions on the scope, principles and parameters of an ATT. The EU fully sup\u00ad ported the adoption of the procedural report of the OEWG first two sessions, recognising the need to take international action to address the problems relating to the unregulated trade of conven\u00ad tional weapons and their diversion to the illicit market. The commitment of the European Union to promoting a future ATT vis-\u00e0-vis third states was also testified by the adoption and implementation of the Council Decision 2009/42/CFSP promot\u00ad ing the process leading towards an Arms Trade Treaty among third countries, adopted by the Council in January 2009 (see sec\u00ad tion II.A.1.1 for a detailed description of the Council Decision). In 2009 the EU also strengthened its cooperation with the OSCE, including through participation in SALW and conventional arms thematic discussions in relevant OSCE bodies. The Council Sec\u00ad retariat participated already on 22 September 2009 in the OSCE Forum for Security Cooperation meeting on SALW, when a pre\u00ad sentation of the EU SALW Strategy was offered to OSCE Partici\u00ad pating States. Contacts with the OSCE Conflict Prevention Centre have also been established by the Council Secretariat and the Commission to explore possible future EU-OSCE initiatives in the field of SALW. The following activities were also undertaken on a national basis by EU MS: CZECH REPUBLIC The Czech Republic regularly takes part in activities and work of the international organisations and bodies, which are dealing, inter alia, with small arms and light weapons, ammunition and conventional arms problems, namely the UN, the OSCE, as well as of the NATO activities and schemes, concerning the SALW and conventional arms.

FINLAND During 2009 Finland continued to actively participate in the work of international organisations and regional arrangements on SALW related issues (EU, UN, OSCE , NATO/E APC and Wassenaar). FRANCE Noting the almost complete absence of any mention of SALW in the European Union\u2019s agreements with third countries with a CFSP dimension, France had an article on SALW adopted as one of the \u2018political clauses\u2019 during its Presidency of the Council of the EU. Therefore in 2009 France supported the taking into account of SALW in negotiations on agreements between the European Union and third countries, so as to improve the implementation of the EU\u2019s 2005 strategy to combat illicit accumulation and traf\u00ad ficking of SALW and their ammunition. In the Working Party on Global Disarmament and Arms Control (CODUN), France encouraged implementation of the initiative to combat the illicit trafficking of SALW by air. It contributed to the drawing up by SITCEN of a list of airlines which may be involved in such traffick ing.

BELGIUM Via 2 experts Belgium is contributing to the UN supported work\u00ad ing group of ISACS (International Standard for Small Arms Con\u00ad trol). This project will develop a set of internationally accepted and validated standards that will provide comprehensive guidance to practitioners and policy makers on small arms and light weap\u00ad ons (SALW) control. These standards will enable more effective policymaking and programming on SALW by the United Nations, its Member States, international and regional organisations and civil society. Building on the UN\u2019s experience of developing inter\u00ad national standards in the areas of mine action and disarmament, demobilisation and reintegration, CASA members will work closely with policy and technical experts from a range of back\u00ad grounds (UN; in ternational, reg ional an d civil society org ani sa\u00ad tions; government agencies; research institutes and industry) to deliver a set of International Small Arms Control Standards (ISACS) in time for the 4th Biennial Meeting of States to consider implementation of the UN Programme of Action in 2010. CYPRUS Specifically, Cyprus provides national reports for the implemen\u00ad tation of the United Nations Programme of Action on Small Arms and Light Weapons.

GERMANY Germany continues to attach utmost importance to the ongoing process towards the elaboration of a comprehensive and legally binding Arms Trade Treaty. The German Government therefore actively supports the current UN process towards an Arms Trade Treaty and will continue to seek support for a strong Arms Trade Treaty both from importing and exporting States. Germany expects that the ATT process will also contribute to efforts to improve transfer controls of SALW and their ammunition. The issue of conventional ammunition stockpiles in surplus contin\u00ad ued to be a major concern. Over the past years, Germany and France have been at the fore\u00ad front of the issue of stockpile management of ammunition in the United Nations. In 2008, the report of the Group of Governmen\u00ad tal Experts (GGE) established to consider further steps to enhance cooperation with regard to the issue of Conventional Ammuni\u00ad tion stockpiles in surplus recommended that technical guidelines for the stockpile management of Conventional Ammunition should be developed within the United Nations, which would be made available for States to use on a voluntary basis (A/63/182, op.72) to assist States in, inter alia, improving their national stockpile management capacity. The GGE report was welcomed at the General Assembly (A/RES/63/61). Since July 2009, the United Nations Office for Disarmament Affairs has undertaken to develop these Technical Guidelines with the assistance of a highly qualified expert consultant. The drafts are reviewed and commented upon by a Technical Review Panel (TRP) con sisting of experts from coun tries selected on the b asis of equitable geographical representation. The 2009 work of the TRP and the consultant was financed by the German Government. Germany is represented in this group by the Federal Ministry of Defense. The draft of these Technical Guidelines will be finished until the end of 2010. After field-trials in the first half of 2011 the final Technical Guidelines will be recommended to the United Nations Gen eral Assemb ly in 2011. ",

The Italian Armed Forces provided technical assistance to the African Union and African Centre for strategic studies in Wind\u00ad hoek (Namibia), through sending a qualified trainer to an inter\u00ad national training Seminar held in from 28 September to 3 October 2009. The Seminar was provided training to the personnel of Ministries of Defence, Interior and Foreign Affairs of the countries in the region, in order to build capacity for tackling the SALW proliferation challenge more effectively.

SLOVENIA The Slovenian government established the International Trust Fund for Demining and Mine Victims Assistance (ITF) as a humanitarian and non-profitable organisation in 1998. ITF helps countries in South-Eastern Europe, the Caucasus and Central Asia in solving landmine problems and helps landmine survivors with physical and socio-economic rehabilitation. After more than ten years of experience, ITF is also planning to expand the programme of help to the SALW action role. ITF is currently implementing a one-year SALW risk awareness project in Albania, amounting to over EUR 200 000 and expects results to be visible in the next few years. With more than ten years of expertise in mine action, ITF adopted a new strategy for a five-year period (2009-2013) which allows ITF to also extend its scope of activities to other areas of opera\u00ad tion. The ITF shall thus work with national authorities and in part\u00ad nership with donors, NGOs, the private sector, international and regional organisations and others to reduce the threats to human security from post-conflict challenges other than landmines and E RW, and to support SSR and DDR programmes. Within a period of one year since the adoption of the new strat\u00ad egy, the ITF is already implementing four SALW/CWD related projects in Albania and Serbia, amounting to over 2,5 million USD. ",

The project is the exact replica of the one presented above. It uses the same approach and methodology; however it is being implemented in a different administrative region of Albania, \u2014 Gerdec UXO Removal and Site Remediation. On 15 March 2008, an explosion occurred at an ammunition process facil\u00ad ity in Gerdec close to Tirana, Albania. In order to successfully remedy the consequences of the devastating explosion, the aim of the project is to safely recover all mun itions availab le for safe transport from the depot and close the facility, as well as to reduce the surplus stockpile of munitions the Alba\u00ad nians have identified for destruction. In the case of Serbia, ITF implements the following project: \u2014 Small Arms and Light Weapons Abuse Prevention \u2014 the pri\u00ad mary goal of the project is the prevention of SALW abuse through the education on the risks and dangers of SALW abuse, as well as the prevention of psychological conse\u00ad quences of accidents caused by SALW.

In the last few years Slovenia financially supported various projects in those countries with EUR 120 000. SPAIN Spain is a member of the OECD\u2019s (Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development) Development Assistance Com\u00ad mittee task team on armed violence and poverty reduction and as such helps to increase the attention paid to the links between SALW and armed violence in development aid programmes.
