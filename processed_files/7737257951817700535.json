        "2 What is rEUnaissance? President Luca Jahier coined the slogan in April 2018 when he became the 32 nd president of the EESC. He is convinced more and more that Europe needs a new Renaissance. The Renaissance was a powerful and vast humanistic revolution, which re-established the real dimension of culture in its concrete relation science, the art of government and the organisation of economic and social life and provided the foundation for the modern transformation of Europe. Civil Society for rEUnaissance Civil society intends to play its part in the run up to the European elections scheduled for 23-26 May. With the aim of mobilising members and organisations at all levels, the European Economic and Social Committee organised an event entitled Civil Society for rEUnaissance on 21 February 2019. The event was moderated by Shada Islam, Director of Europe and Geopolitics at Friends of Europe , a renowned and influential independent think tank based in Brussels. In the words of the EESC President, Luca Jahier , the purpose of the event was to \u201crally the troops\u201d around the European Union to defend it against those who pretend to save it by killing it. Populist parties have tripled their vote in Europe over the past 20 years. They are in government in 11 European countries. More than a quarter of Europeans voted for populists in their last elections. \u201cToday is an important day for democracy. A little more than 90 days before the European elections, we have gathered here to ask ourselves: are we brave enough to grasp the urgency of the moment?\u201d President Jahier said in his introductory remarks. \u201cDemocracy is under attack. Euroscepticism, racism and anti-Semitism are growing, which is a great concern. Our values are being questioned, the right to work for the common good is not perceived as the core of our political action.\u201d Quoting Francis Fukuyama, Jahier said that the divisions and demands that are growing in Europe and the world are increasingly founded on the request for dignity or recognition and accompanied by a powerful return to questions of identity. These requests are intertwined with a widespread process of social nar- cissism, which is undermining the sense of the common good and the collective. ",
        "3 CIVIL SOCIETY FOR REUNAISSANCE This is not the time for resignation and depression, and even less a time for spreading fears and destructive envy. It is instead the time of betting on life, on the ability to dare, to risk, to dream. Time is not tomorrow, it\u2019s today. It is the time of responsibility, of convergences and of strong alliances between the most diverse forces. It is the time of a new emotional intelligence, of innovation and investment, of a new pact between the productive forces, between the generations and between the territories. Instead of the extremes, we must manage to raise the \u2018voices of the good\u2019, as Sergio Mattarella, President of the Republic of Italy said recently. Luca Jahier Give centre stage to the \u2018voices of good\u2019: Forza Buoni! The EESC President decided to invite those who represent this movement of \u201cgood voices\u201d, the symbols of what he calls \u201crEUnaissance\u201d, to the event, to inspire representatives of organised civil society and awaken their conscience. \u201cWe must listen to the people whose hopes and opinions are drowned out by the incessant violence of rallying cries. The majority whose constant, daily efforts to improve their lives and those of their communities are too quiet to make it into the headlines of the tabloids.\u201d Forza Buoni, Come on Good! Jahier said paraphrasing the President of Italy, Sergio Mattarella. Among other voices, the EESC President invited climate activist Greta Thunberg . She is only 16 years old and in less than six months, she has \u2013 with tremendous courage and determination \u2013 started a climate movement that is gathering consensus across the planet. \u201cGreta you\u2019re right!\u201c, said the President. \u201cShe is the voice of our conscience, of our children. The best way to face those who today oppose the European project without proposing anything concrete is to strongly affirm that Europe has a clear strategy for the next decade. This strategy is the Agenda 2030 for sustainable development based on the Treaty of the European Union, Article 3 of the Treaty voted on and approved by all.\u201d \u201cIf this strategy is firmly embraced by all Member States and by European civil society, it would allow us to embark on a virtuous economic, social, environmental and institutional path of renewal for the future.\u201d ",
        "4 ww Greta Thunberg We are not fighting for the future of young generations, we are fighting for everybody\u2019s future Greta spoke plainly when responding to President Jahier and speaking in front of European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker . \u201cWe are striking from school because we have done our homework,\u201d said Thunberg, \u201cwe know that most politicians don\u2019t want to talk to us. Good. We don\u2019t want to talk to them either,\u201d she told a roomful of EU policymakers. \u201cWe want them to talk to the scientists instead. Listen to them. Because we are just repeating what they are saying and have been saying for decades,\u201d she continued. \u201cWe want you to follow the Paris Agreement and the IPCC reports. We don\u2019t have any other demands. Just unite behind the science \u2013 that is our demand.\u201d ",
        "5 CIVIL SOCIETY FOR REUNAISSANCE ww European Commission President Jean- Claude Juncker praised the tireless advocacy of Thunberg and others of her generation, hundreds of thousands of whom have captured the attention of the world \u2013 and their governments \u2013 by staging weekly climate strikes since December. During his speech at the event, President Juncker pledged that 25% of EU funds will go to mitigating the effects of climate change in the next budgetary period. The EESC has asked for a minimum of 40% of the EU budget to be dedicated to sustainable development. President Jahier reiterated his commitment to the 16-year-old activist and the other young people from all over Europe who joined her on stage, including: Anouna de Waever, Ad\u00e9la\u00efde Charlier, Kyra Gantois, Luisa Neubauer, Josefien Hoer\u00e9e, Gilles Vandaele and Dries Cornelissens. \u201cFor the good of our children we need to do it too. #Whateverittakes we will dare a sustaina- ble Europe. We promise today to stay engaged for a real #rEUnaissance.\u201d The European Committee of the Regions\u2019 President, Karl-Heinz Lambertz, echoed the same commitment. European Parliament President, Antonio Tajani , who was unable to attend, underlined in a message to the EESC President and members that \u201cwe must listen more closely to our citizens if we are to provide effective responses to their problems.\u201d \u201cThe upcoming European elections are crucial and I urge everyone to vote. By voting, we can all make our voice heard more clearly in Europe, and defend this area of peace and freedom that is the envy of the entire world,\u201d he added. ",
        "6 Press conference with President Jahier and Greta Thunberg More than 135 journalists were present during the event and at the press conference. The number of articles reporting on Greta at the EESC totalled 700 at the end of February. ",
        "7 CIVIL SOCIETY FOR REUNAISSANCE Civil Society representatives give their vision for Europe\u2019s future During a panel discussion with leaders of civil society organisations, both BusinessEurope Director General, Markus Beyrer , and European Trade Union Confederation (ETUC) Secretary-General, Luca Visentini , underlined the need to defend Europe. \u201cOnly together we count in the world. Only if we stand together will we shape the global agenda,\u201d Beyrer said. Luca Visentini stressed that European problems from multinational tax avoid- ance to climate change, social dump- ing and injustice require not national but also European solutions. He added that a new Social Contract should be established based on new economic policies that boost sustainable growth for all citizens, in line with the climate, environmental and social justice prin- ciples, and prioritising social needs as well as social demands. CEEP Secretary-General, Valeria Ronzitti , also called on social partners and civil society organisations to be at the forefront of shaping the Agenda 2030 for sustainable development, which is going to be so instrumental in developing a sustainable future. \u201cWe can all together unite to preserve the social market economy. I think this is the key to preserving the Europe that we know today and that we want in the future,\u201d she added. Similarly, Luc Triangle, Secretary-General of IndustriALL , stressed the need to work on upward social convergence if we want to reconnect with the millions of citizens and workers who increasingly see Europe as a threat, rather than an opportunity. \u201cWe need to implement the Paris Agreement, we need to go for the energy transition, and we need to go for the zero carbon economy. These ambitious plans need to be accompanied with clear social policies.\u201d Conny Reuter, co-President of the Liaison Group and Secretary-General of Solidar , was not shy in outlining the warning signals. \u201cWe see that Europe is completely changing. We don\u2019t want this Europe to be in the hands of Salvinis, of Orb\u00e1ns, of Kaczynskis. I am not a populist. I am saying this because I am worried, because there is fire in the house and there are not enough firefighters,\u201d he thundered. \u201cWe have to defend the principles of living together, of living in democracy, of respecting minorities, of finding democratic compromises,\u201d he added, calling for a new era of civic engagement linked to the Sustainable Development Goals. \u201cWe need to make sure that this young generation can continue to live on a peaceful European continent and continue to enjoy democracy, with social rights and civil rights. Moreover, as Willy Brandt said: this cannot be taken for granted, no, we have to fight for it\u201d he insisted. Annemie Drieskens, President of COFACE Families Europe , also pushed for a strong defence of core democratic values. ",
        "8 A moment of Joy In honour of President Jahier and his call for a rEUnaissance, mezzosoprano Valentina Volpe Andreazza and her team performed their work, Euphon\u00eca , mixing dance and music, post-industrial and Renaissance atmosphere. The world premiere of the \u201cVitruvian Europe\u201d, composed by Marco Cazzuffi, was presented by the team. Inspirational speakers take the floor Immediately after the intermezzo, Eva Maydell, President of European Movement International , praised President Jahier\u2019s agenda for rEUnaissance. \u201cIt describes to a great extent what our tasks are today: to have a Europe where the citizens are its main focus and are put at the heart of our continent, and a Europe that does not leave anyone behind.\u201d After Ms Maydell, other inspirational speakers followed: Sne\u0161ka Quaedvlieg-Mihailovi\u0107, Secretary-General of Europa Nostra: \u201cPut culture and shared cultural heritage where they belong: at the heart of the entire European project. I want to thank Luca Jahier for challenging both civil society and the EU institutions to dream together to initiate a new rEUnaissance for Europe. Is this a utopian or realistic dream? We think that we can make this dream come true. The question is not whether we should have less or more Europe, the question is how we together can join forces to make Europe a better, more inclusive, more beautiful and more meaningful place to live for present and future generations. Let us show the world that our Europe is an enchanting theme with variations \u2013 that Europe stands for joy and not for fear.Let us put culture and education and especially our shared cultural heritage where they belong: at the heart of the entire European project.\u201d Anna Widegren, Secretary-General of the European Youth Forum: \u201cWe have seen young people receive increased attention and have recognised the need to involve them. I could not agree more. Unfortunately, at many levels we still have a situation where leaders seem very keen on involving young people, but do not actually involve them. Europe is about tearing down barriers and creating a better world and young people are eager to shape the world we live in. The path that young people want for Europe is clear. This path is one of a Europe where young people are not at risk of ending up worse off than their parents. A Europe where resources are spent in a sustainable way, in which public governance does not systemically exclude them and in which human rights are not the privilege of a few. A Europe where not just 0.5% of parliamentarians are under the age of 30. Our generation will have to find solutions to some of the world\u2019s most challenging problems, such as an aging population, social division, climate change and technological revolutions. Reach out to young people because young people do want to engage.\u201d ",
        "9 CIVIL SOCIETY FOR REUNAISSANCE Second panel debate with leaders of civil society organisations highlighted the need for a new paradigm Jouni Nissinen, President of the European Environ- mental Bureau , stressed that since 1970, humanity has wiped out 60% of the animal population \u2013 i.e. three out of every five wild animals \u2013 and that the future EU we want can only be achieved if we ad- dress the triple crisis of climate change, biodiversity loss and chemicals. Arnaldo Abruzzini, CEO of Eurochambres, Josef St\u0159edula, President of the Czech- Moravian Confederation of Trade Unions (CMKOS) and V\u00e9ronique Willems, Secretary- General of SME United , underlined the need to deliver on citizens\u2019 expectations and to bring real added value to their work and lives. Katja Lehto-Komulainen, Deputy Secretary-General of the ETUC , argued that there are a lot of dangerous things in the world, but one of the most dangerous is the silence of wise people and failure to take action. \u201cWe want a fairer Europe. For us this means: democracy, justice, just transitions. What we really need are measures that really boost fairer wages, upward convergence, and quality employment.\u201d More inspirational speakers take the floor Madeleina Kay (aka EU Super Girl) is a superhero for Europe who fights against the evils of populism, nationalism and apathy and strives to communicate a positive pro-EU narrative and inspirational vision for the future of Europe through art, music, literature and performance. Kay stressed that the problem does not just exist in the UK, but across all of Europe. She warned against sitting idle and encouraged instead examining BREXIT to reflect upon what needs to change to prevent a reoccurrence in other Member States. \u201cThe truth is that people do not realise how imperative the EU is to their quality of life. So, we must ask ourselves what have we been doing wrong and what can we do better in the future to alter public perception of the EU?\u201d If young people do not make the effort to stand up for Europe, they are handing power over to the populists, she insisted. Considering BREXIT a stumbling block in achieving our European dream, she stressed it was a distraction from tackling the real issues such as education, healthcare, criminal justice, providing jobs and opportunities, achieving equality and combatting climate change. \u201cThe future is Europe and we are stronger when we work together\u201d she concluded. ",
        "10 The closing panel The closing panel brought together presidents of national economic and social councils, including Tiziano Treu (CNEL, Italy), Lalko Dulevski (ESC, Bulgaria), John Bencini (MCESD, Malta) and Carole Couvert (ESEC, France) . The two central areas when it comes to the European promise are a fair social model that provides opportunities for everybody and sustainable growth, said Tiziano Treu. There is no alternative to investing more in social infrastructure, healthcare, education and housing. \u201cWithout a functioning economy, we have nothing. We have huge opportunities offered by the technologies of the future, if we can invest in this area with common programmes,\u201d he added. \u201cWe shouldn\u2019t just look for more Europe but for a better Europe\u201d , echoed Carole Couvert. According to Lalko Dulevski, the rEUnaissance can be treated as a return to humanitarian values, accompanied by innovation. The focus is on innovation, which we will need in order to preserve the European Union. EESC Vice-Presidents Isabel Ca\u00f1o Aguilar and Milena Angelova closed the morning by highlighting the campaign #ThisTimeImVoting. The EU must be defended. Our force is our voice, our vote, said Ms Ca\u00f1o Aguilar. ",
        "11 CIVIL SOCIETY FOR REUNAISSANCE Afternoon session: participants took part in seven round table workshops As part of its Civil Society for rEUnaissance conference on 21 February, the EESC organised seven parallel thematic workshops, focusing on seven issues that will be decisive for the future of Europe. The panels, which gathered together some 230 people, saw EESC members and other participants discuss how to mobilise civil society in the run-up to the European elections. What Europe do we want to see emerge from the elections was the basic question running through the discussions. The workshops focused on the following issues: \u2022 Why favourable conditions for European business are good for all citizens \u2022 How to strengthen EU as a global economic player \u2022 Overcoming inequalities: investing in a more sustainable Europe \u2022 A European Union Agenda on the future of work \u2022 European values and fundamental rights: a key for the European Union of tomorrow \u2022 Turning the next generation into European citizens through civic education \u2022 Peace and culture : tools for strengthening the European project The questions sparked lively discussions among the many participating civil society organisations, who provided a wealth of input. Overall, there was consensus that Europe needed to make a qualitative leap in communication to better bring home to ordinary citizens the real benefits the EU has brought for them and to showcase its success stories. At the same time, it also needed to take a critical look at some of its policies against a background of increasing poverty and inequalities, international competition and the fear of the impact of widespread digitalisation. A new, more sustainable economic model taking the Sustainable Development Goals as its compass was called for. The need to develop a European cultural identity through education, to encourage Europeans to take ownership of their multiple identities and help them to realise that they can be proud to be Europeans without betraying their local roots was prominent in discussions. The key role of European values in shaping identity and the need to hold on to these values, which are now coming under threat, was also a recurrent theme. The findings and conclusions of these workshops are available on the EESC website: www.eesc.europa.eu/en/agenda/our-events/events/civil-society-reunaissance ",
