Country Reports (Reports assessing the health status and health-related lifestyle attributes of the Roma population) Country Profile: Austria Main Characteristics of the Roma in Austria Demography The presence of Sinti has been documented since the 15 th century; however their continuity of residence on today\u2019s Austrian landmass can be proven only from the middle of the 18 th century. Roma in Austria are mainly divided in two main categories: \uf0a7 A group coming from different areas of the Austro-Hungarian Empire at the beginning of the last century. This group can be divided into several autochthonous sub-groups: Burgeland-Roma, Sinti, Lovaraths and Vlax-Roma (Kalderas, Gubet); \uf0a7 A group originating the Former Yugoslavia Republic from the 1960s onwards, with a common Muslim faith. The Census carried out in 2001 reported a total of 6 237 members of the Roma community, of which 4 348 were of Austrian nationality and 1 925 of other nationalities. In reality the Census count underestimates the total population. According to official estimations 1 this is between 10 000 and 20 000; while Romany sources report the autochthonous community at 20 000 \u2013 25 000. This figure is confirmed by an academic paper published in 2005 2 . Geographical distribution Roma in Austria are both urbanised and rural and this does not depend on whether they are indigenous or migrants. They are distributed as such: Lovara (horse traders), Kalderas (tinkers), Gurbet, Arlije and the Sinti are mainly city dwellers. The majority live in Vienna and eastern Austria. The Burgenland Roma are mainly rural. They settled in the eastern provinces of Burgenland (especially in the area of the town of Oberwart), Vienna and Lower Austria 3 .

        "Report on the health status of the Roma population in the EU and monitoring data collection in the area of Roma health in the Member States August, 2014 7 Roma are the only minority to have been recognised in Austria since 1993. However because of historic reasons linked to the issue of Nazism, data on ethnicity is not collected 4 5 . Consequently, analysis of discrimination is not very easy. It should be noted that this site has only provided two examples of discrimination; one based on a small-scale study conducted in the district of Oberwart and the second referring to the prejudice and discrimination in the relationship that Roma have with law enforcement reported by the Council of Europe Anti-Racism Commission in 2005 6 . The National Roma Integration Strategy (NRIS) is included in more general mainstreamed actions for social policy. There are no positive actions targeting Roma explicitly, but the strategy for integration includes support in the fields of housing, health, education and employment 7 . The government has been focused on Burgenland Roma, because they are the most disadvantaged groups; however they are a small proportion of the total Roma population 8 . As illustrated in the next section, several health problems have been detected in parts of the country where the Roma community resides. Mortality and Life Expectancy As previously stated, there are no data broken down by ethnicity. However, by observing rates of mortality at territorial level the highest mortality rates are recorded in the Burgenland district (Oberwart) where most of the autochthonous Roma population reside. In this district mortality was 14 % higher than the rest of the country. The rate of deaths due to chronic diseases was higher than the rest of the country (18 %) with obesity rates also representing a problem. Prevalence of Major Infectious Diseases The research team have not found any qualifications for this indicator. Healthy Lifestyles and Related Behaviours The main source regarding Roma health status in Austria is: \u2018The Labour Market Development of Oberwart and the Socio-Economic Situation of the Roma\u2019 9 . Although this is a study based on a specific local community, and does not specify the nationality and or legal status of the Roma participants, several points can be extracted from it. The study has analysed the Roma community from Oberwart. According to the study\u2019s main findings, Body Mass Index (BMI) is higher in both male and female Roma than in non-Roma (respectively 30.9 and 30.4 against 25.5. and 24.4 of non-Roma). Younger Roma have a healthier BMI. However, after the age of 40, obesity becomes 4 The Vienna Review, (2013), \u2018Reinventing Roma\u2019, (7 June), [Online].

        "Report on the health status of the Roma population in the EU and monitoring data collection in the area of Roma health in the Member States August, 2014 8 an issue for a much larger share of the Roma population. Less than 20 % of Roma aged 15 \u2013 40 have a BMI index over 30. For Roma aged 41 \u2013 55, BMI is more than three times as high at 66.7 %. The Oberwart Roma population have a higher share of smokers; 40 % more than the general population. In fact, in the general population 30 % of persons aged 16 and older smoke, but the corresponding figure for Roma is 72.7 %. Moreover, 64.7 % of interviewed men, and 81.3 % of women (i.e. almost four times as many as in Austria as a whole) have indicated that they are currently smokers. Frequency of smoking is also high, with 80 % of Roma men and 60 % of Roma women smoking an average of one packet of 20 cigarettes per day 10 . No comparable data are available. Access and Use of Health Services and Prevention Programmes Little information is available about access to health services and participation in prevention programmes. The WIFO working paper reports the number of Roma who pay regular visits to the dentist is very low at just over 30 %. By comparison a Vienna Health Survey (from 2011) concludes that 54.3 % of Viennese men and 62.1 % of Viennese women had been at the dentist's at least five times over the past five years 11 . Further, psychosomatic and mental illnesses pose a problem to the Roma population. Psychological issues are seen as a taboo within the community, hence Roma are more reluctant to seek medical assistance for mental health ailments. This problem is compounded by geographical issues. A large proportion of Roma reside in rural Burgenland where health care access is an issue. Those that live in urban areas may still be deterred from visiting a health centre due to the required paperwork that must be completed and the associated language barriers. 12 This reluctance to utilise the health service was mentioned by the ambulance head for Styria, where about 50 % of their patients are uninsured. Although ethnic origin data has not been collected for this patient cohort, data relating to nationality does exist. According to the ambulance\u2019s annual report, in 2011 of the 767 uninsured patients, 353 had either a Romanian or Slovakian nationality \u2014 common within the Roma group. 13 Prevalence of Major Chronic Diseases There is very little or precise data available. According to the research carried out by the WIFO published in 2004, 41 % of the Roma population seems to show prevalence for chronic illnesses 14 but comparable data with the general population is not available. 10 Leoni (2004), \u2018The Labour Market Development of Oberwart and the Socio-Economic Situation of the Roma\u2019, WIFO Working Papers, 226. 11 Ibid. 12 Interview with the Viennese Roma-NGO \u2018Romano Centro\u2019 (27 August 2012). 13 Marienambulanz (2012), \u2018Jahresbericht 2011\u2019, p. 12. 14 Leoni (2004), The Labour Market Development of Oberwart and the Socio-Economic Situation of the Roma, WIFO Working Papers , 226.

        "Report on the health status of the Roma population in the EU and monitoring data collection in the area of Roma health in the Member States August, 2014 9 Health Factors Related to the Role of Women in the Roma Community The research team have not found specific qualifications for this indicator. Anecdotal reports come from the NGO \u2018Romano Centro\u2019 based in Vienna. According to their reports, the female population is less informed than the non-Roma population about the necessity of health care services and the need for medical investigations in case of pregnancy and breastfeeding. This lack of awareness is more serious for Roma with a migratory background where many Roma women (especially) are reliant on co- insurance on their husbands\u2019 schemes. This situation is aggravated by the fact that when women do not have medical insurance, there are very few maternity wards available. Environmental and other Socio-Economic Factors \uf0a7 Housing The RAXEN study clearly establishes that there is no quantitative information on the housing situation of Roma: \u2018[...] there is no quantitative data \u2014 either official or unofficial \u2014 available that explicitly describes the housing situation of Roma. Nothing can be said about the housing situation of Roma women, children or seniors or Roma with disabilities\u2019 15 . Nevertheless evidence gathered in the field confirms that in general the housing situation of third country nationals (including Austrian Roma) is well below average 16 . Major problems are related to overcrowding, humidity/mould and noisy neighbourhoods. Even when naturalisation takes place, the housing situation of Roma is still worse than the general population. \uf0a7 Education According to the working paper \u2018Roma in Austria \u2014 A Historical Perspective\u2019 17 since 1995 several improvements have occurred in the education system for Roma, especially in primary schools. For instance, Roma children receive assistance to access schooling. However, the information provided covers less than a decade (1995 \u2013 2002); therefore outside the scope of this country report. \uf0a7 Employment The unemployment rate of members of the Roma community is reported to be much higher than that of the major population 18 , due to a variety of factors including low school education, migratory background and poor health status 19 . Male Roma are reported to be more likely to be unemployed than female Roma or non-Roma. Compared to non-Roma there is a higher percentage of Roma employed part time. There is a high share of multiple employment, particularly among female Roma 20 . 15 Ludwig Boltzmann Institute of Human Rights, Research Association and ZARA, Zivilcourage und Anti- Rassismus-Arbeit, (2009), \u2018Austria RAXEN National Focal Point Thematic Study Housing Conditions of Roma and Travellers\u2019. 16 Ibid. 17 Leoni, T.

        "Report on the health status of the Roma population in the EU and monitoring data collection in the area of Roma health in the Member States August, 2014 11 Country Profile: Belgium Main Characteristics of the Roma in Belgium Demography The first mention of Roma (Gypsies) in Belgium was in 1421 21 . There are two broad categories of Roma in Belgium: \uf0a7 Travellers who have lived in Belgium or neighbouring countries for centuries; \uf0a7 Roma, who are mainly recent migrants from Eastern and Central Europe, from either new EU member States or from third countries. The two groups have different histories, legal status and lifestyles, and they face separate challenges in terms of integration. Their common denominators are issues relating to stigmatisation and discrimination 22 . With the fall of the communist regimes in central and eastern Europe in the 1990s and EU accessions in 2004 and 2007 23 , Belgium has seen an increase in Roma immigration. Estimates on the size of the Roma population in Belgium vary between 10 000 \u2013 15 000 24 and 40 000 25 . The Council of Europe estimate stands at 30 000 26 . This is the most commonly quoted figure yet it does not distinguish travellers from Roma and the estimate dates back to the mid-2000s 27 . Li\u00e9geois (2007) estimates the population of Roma and Travellers at 20 000 \u2013 40 000. One estimate from 2003 puts the number of Travellers at 10 \u2013 20 000, while another from 2009 suggests 12 \u2013 15 000 28 . Nevertheless exact data on Roma or Traveller population size is lacking 29 . For the purpose of this study we will consider both groups. Geographical distribution Roma and Traveller populations are distributed across the country. Roma tend to be more concentrated in urban areas 30 . Travellers are distributed more or less equally 21 RomaniNet, \u2018A Multimedia Romani Course for Promoting Linguistic Diversity and Improving Social Dialogue: Report on Roma People\u2019, [Online].

Travellers typically live in encampment sites, although some of them have a semi-itinerant lifestyle 32 . The Flemish Minorities Centre (Kruispunt Migratie-Integratie) estimates that in Flanders alone, there are 850 families or 2 500 persons living permanently in trailers and 1 000 families travelling through the region in trailers. 33 According to an assessment made for the Walloon region in 2005 by the Mediation Centre for Travellers in Wallonia, Travellers are travelling in relatively small groups (around 30 caravans), camping essentially along the major axes of circulation for short-term durations (around three weeks) 34 . For the Roma population, estimates in Flanders (including Brussels) stand at 15 000 \u2013 20 000 35 . According to the Flemish Minorities Centre the Roma population in Flanders stem from: \uf0a7 Romania and Bulgaria; \uf0a7 the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia; \uf0a7 the Slovak Republic and Bulgaria; \uf0a7 Kosovo 36 . Other Information (including highlights of data gaps) Health data collection in Belgium is decentralised \u2014 the main data collectors are authorities on a regional level and data is thereafter aggregated nationally 37 . There are no ethnic statistics in Belgium. Indeed collecting data on the basis of ethnic origin is in principle prohibited in the country for constitutional reasons. However, advice issued by the Commission for the Protection of the Privacy and existing legislation make it clear that the collection of ethnic data is possible, albeit under strict conditions 38 . However, policy-makers and the administration are reluctant to collect ethnic data although progress has been made especially in the domain of socio- economic monitoring 39 . A number of studies rely on data on nationality and country of birth as a proxy indicator, as this type of data can more easily be collected by public registers and surveys. 31 Ibid. 32 Belgian NFP Centre for Equal Opportunities and Opposition to Racism, (2009), \u2018Belgium RAXEN National Focal Point Thematic Study Housing Conditions of Roma and Travellers\u2019. 33 Belgian NFP Centre for Equal Opportunities and Opposition to Racism, (2009), \u2018Belgium RAXEN National Focal Point Thematic Study Housing Conditions of Roma and Travellers\u2019. 34 Centre de M\u00e9diation des Gens du voyage de Wallonie 2011), \u2018Recommandations du CMGVW au niveau communal 2011\u2019, [Online].

        "Report on the health status of the Roma population in the EU and monitoring data collection in the area of Roma health in the Member States August, 2014 13 As a result, quantitative information about Roma and travellers is fragmented and sparse 40 . Regional data collection also appears to have shortcomings in quality in terms of timeliness, methods and reporting. Thus data presented may be old or based on small-scale studies only 41 . Ultimately, this country report has derived data and estimations from either regional or international (EU) commissioned studies and from academic literature. Data gaps are notable particularly for the following indicators: \uf0a7 population figures (including population density in urban and rural areas); \uf0a7 poverty and social exclusion indicators, particularly on income; \uf0a7 employment; \uf0a7 health (life expectancies, mortality and morbidity rates); \uf0a7 housing. Mortality and Life Expectancy The study team has found no quantifications of this indicator pertaining specifically to the Roma population as ethnically disaggregated data is not collected. Eurostat\u2019s latest data on life expectancy in Belgium is from 2010 at 79.6 years. Data from 2011 is estimated at 79.8 years 42 . Anecdotal data and evidence obtained from EU funded initiatives (national peer review) find: \uf0a7 According to the municipal social services Roma health status in Brussels is poor, even compared with refugees and undocumented migrants. The life expectancy of Roma is unclear with some suggestions that Roma lead lives that are 10 years shorter than the general population and anecdotal evidence that \u2018few reach the age of 55\u2019 43 .In Limburg between 2005 and 2009, the average life expectancy was just 65 for Roma and 80 years old for Belgians. 44 Prevalence of Major Infectious Diseases The study team has found no evidence of quantified health data relating to this disease group for Roma communities. Anecdotal data and evidence cover the following: \uf0a7 According to municipal health services \u2018even young people (e.g. 30 years old) are already dealing with illnesses usually found among older persons (e.g. rheumatism)\u2019 45 . 40 Pe\u00f1a-Casas, R.

        "Report on the health status of the Roma population in the EU and monitoring data collection in the area of Roma health in the Member States August, 2014 14 Healthy Lifestyles and Related Behaviours Although no national quantifications have been found, s everal national studies 46 underline the poor health conditions of Roma in Belgium and the difficulties that they experience in accessing health services. The Belgian municipal services (CPAS) state that the Roma population\u2019s health is at least partly related to living conditions in their country of origin. It is suggested that Roma stemming from Central, Eastern and South-eastern Europe who arrive in Belgium often already suffer from poor health, which further deteriorates in Belgium as a result of poor living conditions 47 . According to data shared by the FRA, Roma tend to have illnesses associated with poor diet and stress 48 . Documentation compiled by FRA suggests that many Roma suffer from poor health. It is not uncommon for Roma families to have one or two persons with a severe illness or disability. It is thought that the poor health of Roma may be attributed to excessive use of coffee, sugar, salt, fats and medicines. However, there have been no reports of problematic drug abuse 49 . The most frequent diseases are diabetes, obesity, asthma and infections of the respiratory tract. Additionally, causes are attributed to poverty and culture as Roma tend to focus on short-term rather than long-term health concerns. The pressure of living with anxiety and traumatic war experiences impacts on mental health; depression and psychosomatic complaints are common. There are also high frequencies of eye and dental problems 50 . Access and Use of Health Services and Prevention Programmes There is anecdotal evidence that: \uf0a7 Despite a right to emergency medical care regardless of migrant status, Roma illegally residing in Brussels often encounter difficulties accessing medical care. This appears to be the result of incidents where doctors or hospitals refuse to care for fear that they will not be paid for their services 51 . In a study carried out by Dokters van de Wereld among Roma women in Brussels, 46 % did not have health insurance and 65 % had experienced difficulties accessing the health care system 52 . \uf0a7 Price and administrative requirements (complexities) of municipalities in order 46 Including Benelux (2011), \u2018Afflux inattendu et difficilement g\u00e9rable des personnes en provenance d\u2019Europe centrale et orientale dans certaines villes du Benelux et des r\u00e9gions limitrophes\u2019, Bruxelles.

For example, each municipality has different social security procedures, which may be a disadvantage to vulnerable groups at risk of discrimination, including Roma 53 . \uf0a7 Access to preventative services seems to pose a major problem. In a study carried out among Roma women and their children in Brussels it was found that only 39 % of the children had received all recommended vaccines and only 13 % at the recommended age 54 . \uf0a7 Although issues of access persist with the Roma population, services provided by the National Office for the Child, and Child and Family; the Flemish public institution providing help and advice on the wellbeing of children, are frequently attended by Roma, especially the latter, which operates within Brussels 55 . Prevalence of Major Chronic Diseases The study team has found no quantifications of this indicator. Anecdotal data and evidence is very vague but finds: \uf0a7 \u2018Some illnesses that had been eradicated in Belgium are relatively common to the Roma, such as tuberculosis\u2019 56 . Health Factors Related to the Role of Women in the Roma Community The health situation of Roma women has been described as \u2018worrying\u2019 57 . Major issues affecting Roma women in Belgium include a low life expectancy (not quantified). Multiple pregnancies are frequent, as well as abortions which are used as a contraceptive method. Two studies state that health concerns with regard to Roma also include a lack of awareness and use of contraception, 58 pre-natal health and postnatal care 59 . Psychosomatic diseases are also frequent and Roma women\u2019s access to health care is often limited due to language barriers, lack of information, low income or non- eligibility, as well as the presence of cultural and religious barriers; Roma woman, for example, may not be allowed to visit a male doctor 60 .

        "Report on the health status of the Roma population in the EU and monitoring data collection in the area of Roma health in the Member States August, 2014 16 and Travellers. Two main issues arose: 1. Travellers : A significant lack of encampment sites and related access to basic facilities. According to the report, there were 416 residential lots spread out over 28 official encampment sites in Flanders and Brussels. Despite regional plans to increase this number, the number of halting sites per family actually decreased in Flanders from 2003 to 2007 62 . In the Walloon Region only one camp has been created. An alternative to public accommodation were private encampments, however they reportedly lacked sufficient water and sanitation facilities. Other alternatives include renting or purchasing a caravan plot, yet Travellers often faced legal difficulties and discrimination. With the exception of Flanders, caravans are not considered proper dwellings by regional housing laws. In Wallonia and Brussels, building permits are still needed in order to permanently settle caravans. Hence, Travellers are very dependent on the regional authorities. According to the report, less than half of the Travelling families have access to the existing encampment facilities, leaving a significant proportion living on illegal sites 63 , yet many Travellers are Belgian citizens 64 . 2. Roma : Belgian Roma tend to live sedentary lifestyles in urban neighbourhoods. Housing conditions are generally poor, with physical and mental health implications. Moreover, Roma often live with other immigration communities and tensions between different communities can arise. Roma are often in a weaker position with respect to other groups, and the resulting relocations and displacements can make it difficult to maintain social links which are a lifeline for Roma 65 . Employment Unemployment rates are extremely high for Roma in Bulgaria. 48 % of Roma women declared themselves unemployed with the male figure generally similar at 43 % 66 . Self-employed Roma workers are often not formally registered with health insurance for small risks due to a lack of information on health insurance access. As a consequence, they are less eager to contact a doctor in order to avoid problems with the National Health Service 67 . Education Most Roma stop education after primary school due to a combination of different cultures, historical rejection and difficult migration circumstances, including; Roma parents lacking experience with school visits; language barriers hindering good understanding of school personnel; material implications of children in school; itinerant lifestyles negatively affecting the child\u2019s track record in school; good practice of adult education (2009); falling behind on the school curriculum and extreme truancy and school absence (2010).

However, expert assessment places the number of Roma between 640 000 and 800 000 71 . The Roma population is characterised by an inverted age pyramid and a youthful population; Roma aged 19 and below constitute 39 % of the total Roma populace, while among ethnic Bulgarians, only 15 % are aged below 19.

        "Report on the health status of the Roma population in the EU and monitoring data collection in the area of Roma health in the Member States August, 2014 20 Age pyramid of the majority population Geographical distribution The Roma community is present in all territorial units of Bulgaria. The highest concentration of Roma is in the towns of Montana, where Roma represent 12.7 % of the local population, the town of Sliven, where Roma constitute 11.8 % of the overall population, and in Dobrich and Yambol, where Roma constitute 8.8 % and 8.5 % of the population respectively 73 . Other Information (including highlights of data gaps) International attention toward the disadvantaged position of the Roma minority in Southeast Europe and the relatively large presence of the minority in Bulgaria have prompted numerous surveys and studies by international agencies (notably the World Bank, UNDP, FRA) and NGOs (notably, the Open Society Institute, the Health of the Roma Foundation and the Amalipe Foundation). The studies provide a plethora of information on socio-economic determinants of health and, to some extent, healthy lifestyles and health-related behaviours. Comparative and local studies focusing specifically on the health status of the minority also provide information for most parameter data, such as the prevalence of major diseases, self-assessment of health and access and barriers to health care. A shortcoming of the representative surveys, however, is that they conceal important regional and sub-group differences in the health and socio-economic status of the Roma communities. A data gap in research concerns quantitative data on several important indicators such as HIV spread, hepatitis A, B and C, ante-natal care and cancer screening as well as obesity. Nevertheless, qualitative data from interviews and focus group discussions quoted in reports reveals that there are frequent outbreaks of hepatitis in geographically segregated Roma communities. In addition, health practitioners have 73 National Statistics Institute, (2011). 0 100000 200000 300000 400000 500000 600000 700000 800000 900000 0 - 9 10 - 19 20 - 29 30 - 39 40 - 49 50 -59 60 - 69 70 - 79 80 + ",
        "Report on the health status of the Roma population in the EU and monitoring data collection in the area of Roma health in the Member States August, 2014 21 indicated that there is a high level of HIV spread among vulnerable Roma, such as prisoners and drug users. The UNGASS 74 report identifies young Roma with risk behaviours as a group that is highly at risk of HIV infection. Mortality and Life Expectancy One of the most alarming health status differences between the Roma communities and the majority population concerns infant mortality rates. Infant mortality rates among Roma are 28/1 000 compared to 9.9/1 000 for the general population (almost three times higher for Roma than for non-Roma). The data on infant mortality rates is quoted in national policy documents and is somewhat outdated, as it refers to statistics from 2003 75 . Nevertheless, there is little reason to believe that the rates have changed significantly over the past decade and infant mortality remains one of the most serious health concerns among the Roma community. An NGO report cites an infant mortality rate that is insignificantly lower (24/1 000), though as the source quoted is again a public policy document the difference may be derived from earlier national statistics 76 . According to the National Health Strategy for Disadvantaged Persons Belonging to Ethnic Minorities, the life expectancy of Roma is at least 10 years less than the general population. The mortality rate among Roma is highest in the 40 \u2013 49 age group, with the biggest cause of death being cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases. The strategy refers to data from a \u2018survey\u2019, although the survey sample or agency in charge is unclear. Publicly available life expectancy data provided by the National Statistics Institute is not disaggregated by ethnicity. The demographic profile of the Roma community confirms that the average life expectancy of the population is significantly lower than the majority population. For instance, only 2.7 % of Roma are aged 65 and over compared to 16.1 % of the general population (according to census results in 2001) 77 . Prevalence of Major Infectious Diseases Although significant data gaps exist with regards to the prevalence of major infectious diseases, both quantitative and qualitative data reveals that Roma are especially vulnerable to outbreaks of measles and hepatitis A, B & C, while high rates of HIV spread have been witnessed among the most socially excluded, such as prisoners, drug addicts and prostitutes. An outbreak of measles registered in 2009 revealed that 89.3 % of the 24 047 people affected were of Roma origin and 22 out of the 24 deaths were Roma patients 78 . Qualitative information from interviews with health practitioners working with Roma reveals that there are frequent outbreaks of hepatitis A, B & C in geographically segregated Roma communities. Field work among 12 towns and villages with a segregated Roma neighbourhood reveals significantly higher rates of infection of tuberculosis among Roma than the 74 UNGASS, (2011), \u2018Republic Of Bulgaria: Country Progress Report On Monitoring The 2011 Political Declaration on HIV/AIDs: the Dublin Declaration and the Universal Access in the Health Sector Response. 75 Council of Ministers of Republic of Bulgaria, (2012), \u2018National Roma Integration Strategy of the Republic of Bulgaria (2012\u201320)\u2019, Sofia: Bulgaria. 76 Krumova T., Ilieva, M.

For instance, in the village of Sevar the rate of tuberculosis among Roma is 1 587.3/100 000 compared to an average rate of 78/100 000 for the region of Razgrad. Similarly, the rate of tuberculosis among Roma in the village of Kotel is 1 454.5/100 000 compared to 73.4/100 000 for the region of Sliven. Recent outbreaks of measles cases in Bulgaria have been registered almost entirely among the Roma community. In 2009 \u2013 10, 90 % of 21 470 cases were Roma. Measles cases often evolve with complications such as pneumonia, encephalitis and diarrhoea. A study of 206 measles cases in Burgas, found that there is a correlation between the cases with complications (88 % of the caseload had complications) and educational attainment of the mother. Poorer education increased the chances of complications when controlling for other variables such as immunisation status and number of family members in the household (ECDC 2012). Overpopulation of Roma settlements and households (discussed in a later section of this report) makes it more difficult to isolate virus carriers, and disease outbreaks frequently turn into epidemics. In addition, scholars have also identified cultural norms such as frequent empathy visits to the sick as contributors to the spread of infectious diseases 79 . Another important factor increasing the vulnerability of the community towards infectious diseases is the low coverage of vaccination of preventable diseases among Roma children. According to the National Health Strategy for Disadvantaged Persons Belonging to Ethnic Minorities, 15 % of Roma children are without complete mandatory vaccinations 80 . It is likely that in some segregated communities the rates of Roma children with incomplete vaccinations are much higher. In the case of the measles outbreak in 2009, the vaccination status was known in 482 cases of whom 142 (29 %) were not vaccinated, 248 (52 %) had received one dose and 91 (19 %) had received two doses of the vaccine (ECDC 2013). Healthy Lifestyles and Related Behaviours There are several key indicators that reveal that the typical lifestyle and health-related behaviours among the Roma community are not conducive to a good health status. Some of the key differences in the lifestyles of the minority and the majority population could be explained by higher rates of poverty and lower levels of income of Roma compared to the general population (poverty rates are discussed in a later section of this report). One of the most striking differences between the Roma minority and the majority population is evidenced in food consumption, and particularly the inability to afford basic foods which is six times more common among Roma. Notably, 42 % of Roma live in households in which someone went to bed hungry at least once in the past month compared to just 7 % of the general population 81 . Unsurprisingly, Roma consume only 13.6 % of the daily recommendations of meats and 25 % 82 of cheeses; basic foods that are relatively more expensive. Other healthy lifestyle indicators that could be explained by the typically low income of Roma households is the access to essential drugs; 70 % of 79 Tomova, I.

        "Report on the health status of the Roma population in the EU and monitoring data collection in the area of Roma health in the Member States August, 2014 23 Roma do not have access to essential drugs, a difference that is more than threefold compared to the majority population (21 %) 83 . Available data on dependencies does not allow for comparison between Roma and the general population. Nevertheless, the rates of dependencies on drugs and alcohol among Roma are evidently high; according to one source, 17 % of Roma live in households with at least one member who has problems with alcohol or drugs 84 . Tobacco consumption is also typically high among Roma; according to a representative survey 52 % of Roma aged 30 \u2013 44 are heavy smokers, smoking on a daily basis 85 . Interestingly, the only comparable data on alcohol and cigarette purchases reveals that the share of Roma who purchase alcohol and cigarettes regularly is almost the same as that of the general population; 29.78 % for Roma and 30.45 % 86 for the general population. However, these rates need to be considered when accounting for the lower income levels and reduced purchasing power of Roma, and also bearing in mind that cigarette and alcohol purchases may in fact replace the purchase and consumption of other necessities, such as foods and medicines. Another alarming indicator revealing behaviour that is not conducive to good health is the sedentary lifestyle of the Roma community. 83.7 % of the adult Roma and 40.5 % of the children do not perform any kind of physical activity, while rates for the weekly practice of physical activities are extremely low for both groups; 0.7 % and 1.5 % respectively 87 . This is partially due to a lack of sport facilities and open spaces for recreation purposes in Roma neighbourhoods. However, sporting activities and keeping in shape are also not a priority among the Roma community 88 . Access and Use of Health Services and Prevention Programmes The most significant barrier to accessing health services beyond emergency care for the Roma minority is low rates of health insurance. Two sources reveal similar rates of health insurance among Roma at 48 % 89 and 45 % 90 compared to 85 % for the general population 91 . However, the rates of health insurance, as well as other health determinants and health status, need to be considered on a micro level as substantial variation is evident between different Roma settlements. For instance, 91.4 % of the members of 76 interviewed households (402 people) in the village of Veselinovo (Yambol region) stated that they had health insurance. This rate is significantly higher than for the 43.5 % of interviewed Roma in the village of Kitanchevo (Razgrad region) who had health insurance, and is significantly higher than the average values of 45 \u2013 48 % registered by the general studies cited above 92 . In general, doctors and health facilities tend to be further away from Roma communities than the general population.

        "Report on the health status of the Roma population in the EU and monitoring data collection in the area of Roma health in the Member States August, 2014 24 existence of segregated Roma neighbourhoods, which are isolated from infrastructure, public services and health facilities. Around 59 % of the general population and 43 % of Roma live within a kilometre of a medical centre, but 41 % of Roma compared to 30 % of the general population live between 1 km and 3 km of a medical centre 93 . Another barrier to access of health care is discrimination by health personnel towards Roma. In a survey examining different types of discrimination, the most frequently cited discrimination by Roma respondents was discrimination by staff of health centres and hospitals experienced by 43.10 % compared to 34.70 % by social services and 32.30 % at job interviews 94 . Again, there are significant differences at a micro level, and surveys, representative of Roma populations in 12 villages with higher concentration of Roma show that there are various degrees of trust and content/discontent with the general practitioners treating the community. In addition, the study reveals that health mediators have in many cases positively influenced patient-doctor relationships 95 . Having in mind the above-mentioned barriers to access to health, it is not surprising that Roma tend to receive different types of medical checks less frequently than the general population. For instance, only 14 % of the Roma in household surveys had received a cholesterol test, as compared to 33 % of the general population, 24 % had received a heart check-up as compared to 44 % of the non-Roma population. The exception to the rule is the incidence of performance of x-rays or other types of scans, where 11 % of the Roma had received such a test, as compared to 6 % of the non- Roma population 96 . A clear tendency in the treatment of illnesses among the Roma is the self-prescribed use of medicines. A quarter of the Roma respondents of a survey declared that they had consumed blood pressure medicines without prescription in the past two weeks, another 18 % stated that they had consumed painkillers in the preceding two weeks without a medical prescription 97 . Members of the minority group have generally more positive health self-assessment than the general population. 71 % of the Roma people perceive themselves to be in good health, compared to 62 % of the majority population. Respectively, the percentage of those who perceive themselves to be in bad health is lower in the minority (12 %) than in the majority (15 %) population 98 . This positive perception among the Roma, however, does not necessarily correspond to a more positive health status, but could be explained by lack of awareness of health problems due to infrequent visits to doctors and hence lack of diagnosis of health conditions. Another explanation is provided by the perception of good health among the Roma as the absence of biological disease 99 . An important initiative with regard to improving the access to health is the establishing of the profession and network of health mediators. The profession started as a pilot model in 2001 in Kjustendil with the employment of the first five health mediators. In 2007 the profession was institutionalised and the state started to 93 Eurofound, (2012), \u2018Living conditions of the Roma: Substandard housing and health\u2019. 94 FRA, (2009), \u2018European Union Minorities and Discrimination Survey\u2019, Budapest: Hungary. 95 National Network of Health Mediators (published on their website), (2009), \u0410\u041d\u0410\u041b\u0418\u0417 \u0418 \u041e\u0426\u0415\u041d\u041a\u0410 \u041d\u0410 \u041f\u041e\u0422\u0420\u0415\u0411\u041d\u041e\u0421\u0422\u0418\u0422\u0415 \u0418 \u041f\u0420\u041e\u0423\u0427\u0412\u0410\u041d\u0415 \u041d\u0410 \u041f\u0420\u0418\u041b\u041e\u0416\u0418\u041c\u041e\u0421\u0422\u0422\u0410 \u0417\u0410 \u041f\u041e\u0414\u041e\u0411\u0420\u042f\u0412\u0410\u041d\u0415 \u041d\u0410 \u0418\u041d\u0424\u041e\u0420\u041c\u0410\u0426\u0418\u041e\u041d\u041d\u0410\u0422\u0410 \u0418 \u041c\u041e\u041d\u0418\u0422\u041e\u0420\u0418\u041d\u0413\u041e\u0412\u0410 \u0421\u0418\u0421\u0422\u0415\u041c\u0410 \u0412 \u0417\u0414\u0420\u0410\u0412\u0415\u041e\u041f\u0410\u0417\u0412\u0410\u041d\u0415\u0422\u041e. 96 UNDP, WB, EC, FRA, (2011) \u2018UNDP/WB/EC Regional survey 2011 and FRA Pilot survey 2011\u2019. 97 Fundaci\u00f3n Secretariado Gitano, (2009), \u2018Health and the Roma Community, analysis of the situation in Europe: Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Greece, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia, Spain\u2019, Madrid: Spain. 98 UNDP, WB, EC, FRA, (2011) \u2018UNDP/WB/EC Regional survey 2011 and FRA Pilot survey 2011\u2019. 99 Eurofound, (2012), \u2018Living conditions of the Roma: Substandard housing and health\u2019.

        "Report on the health status of the Roma population in the EU and monitoring data collection in the area of Roma health in the Member States August, 2014 25 allocate a budget for health mediators to the municipalities. In 2007 there were 55 health mediators. In 2013, 130 health mediators work in more than 70 municipalities in Bulgaria (and 17 others are trained and hired under a project). The health mediators played a key role in coping with the measles epidemic outbreak in 2010 when 24 000 people were infected and 24 children died. Health mediators cooperate with general practitioners and subdivisions of the Ministry of Health (Regional Health Inspectorates) to obtain better vaccination coverage among children, to prevent epidemic outbreaks and to increase the health culture and awareness of Roma communities. Prevalence of Major Chronic Diseases Particular concerns regarding health status of Roma in Bulgaria are high rates of disabilities and serious chronic diseases among the Roma population \u2014 12 % of all Roma, including children. The share of persons with disabilities and serious chronic diseases reaches 70 % for Roma aged 65 and over. Other frequently diagnosed maladies among the community include high blood pressure (12 % by diagnosis for Roma, 23 % for the general population), high cholesterol (7.4 % for Roma, 7.5 % for the general population), asthma and chronic bronchitis (8 % for Roma and 14 % for the general population) 100 . It must be noted however, that the occurrence of these health problems is by diagnosis. Having in mind the less frequent use of health services and medical checks by the Roma, it could be expected that the actual occurrence of these chronic diseases is higher that the diagnosed rates. Health Factors Related to the Role of Women in the Roma Community Although on the whole, the Roma population perceive their health as better than the average, a disproportionately high number of Roma women over 50 report a \u2018bad\u2019 or \u2018very bad\u2019 health status \u2014 48 % compared to the Bulgarian average of 31 % 101 . This trend could be strongly related to the low number of Roma women who are not covered under a health insurance plan; almost 3 times more Roma women are uninsured in comparison to the general population 102 . One of the most notable indicators related to the role of women in the Roma community is related to the infrequent use of contraceptives. According to a report on the health status of the Roma women in Bulgaria, almost 60 % of women do not use any contraceptives 103 . Other sources confirm the low use of contraceptives \u2014 according to a survey, only 9 % of the respondents had consumed birth-control pills in the preceding two weeks 104 . Different authors have pointed out that the use of contraceptives is unacceptable in many Roma communities, and is especially denounced by male Roma. Roma women visit the gynaecologist quite frequently. One quarter of the Roma visited a gynaecologist during the last year for reasons other than pregnancy. Young Roma women go for gynaecological check-ups for reasons other than pregnancy three times more often than those over 45. Breast and uterine cancer prevention in the Roma community is insufficient. Women between the ages of 30 and 44 submit to pap smear tests more frequently than younger women \u2014 almost half of this age group had this test. Only one quarter of Roma women examine themselves for breast cancer. 100 Fundaci\u00f3n Secretariado Gitano, (2009), \u2018Health and the Roma Community, analysis of the situation in Europe: Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Greece, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia, Spain\u2019, Madrid: Spain. 101 FRA (2013), \u2018Analysis of FRA Roma Survey Results by Gender\u2019, p. 15. 102 FRA, (2013), \u2018Analysis of FRA Roma Survey Results by Gender\u2019, p. 18. 103 Krumova T., Ilieva, M.

        "Report on the health status of the Roma population in the EU and monitoring data collection in the area of Roma health in the Member States August, 2014 26 Mammograms are especially uncommon for the rural population: women from the villages had mammograms 2.8 times less frequently than those living in the capital 105 . Environmental and other Socio-Economic Factors Plenty of studies have provided ample evidence that the Roma community is socially excluded. The social exclusion in key areas such as education, labour market and housing translates into an environment that brings about health inequalities between the Roma and non-Roma population. A history of school segregation and discrimination brings about early drop-out rates among the Roma or overall non- attendance of school and high rates of illiteracy among the Roma (21.80 % among Roma, 0.9 % among the general population) 106 . Poor educational attainments and functional illiteracy lead to exclusion from the labour market \u2014 unemployment rates among the Roma aged 15 \u2013 64 reach 40 % as opposed to 20 % of the general population 107 . All socio-economic indicators, unemployment and employment included, display high macro and regional variations. For instance, data on socio-economic and health status of Roma in 16 villages/towns reveals the relative share of the employed in the two years is highest in Damianitsa \u2014 39.4 % (2006) and 40.4 % (2008), lowest in 2006 in Straldzha \u2014 0.9 %, and in 2008 \u2014 in Vazovo \u2014 4 %; biggest share of registered unemployed in the two years in Straldzha \u2014 45.8 % (2006) and 37.2 % (2008), lowest in 2006 in Satovcha \u2014 2.7 %, in 2008 \u2014 in Damianitsa \u2014 1.8 %; biggest share of not registered unemployed in 2006 in Rakovski \u2014 25.9 %, and in 2008 \u2014 in Vazovo \u2014 45.9 %, lowest in 2006 in Straldzha \u2014 1 %, and in 2008 \u2014 in Veselinovo \u2014 0.3 %. The high levels of unemployment and low incomes of Roma households explain the high at-risk-of-poverty rates (88 % among Roma, 51 % among the general population) and the high share of households with severe material deprivation (82 % of Roma, 37 % among the general population). The severe material deprivation limits the possibility of leading a healthy lifestyle, to buy basic foods and medicines (discussed earlier in this report), but also negatively affects the housing situation of the Roma. The problem of high unemployment presents future issues relating to pensions. Approximately 79 % of non-Roma Bulgarian residents over 45 will be eligible for a future pension compared to the lower Roma figure of 66 %. 108 The poor housing conditions of the Roma minority in Bulgaria have been widely documented. Studies reveal that one quarter of the Roma population lives in sub- standard housing and 4 % live in shanty towns 109 . According to the FRA, 51 % of Roma in Bulgaria live in deprived housing conditions (with either no piped water, sewage and/or electricity) in contrast to 17 % of the general population. 110 Overcrowding (Roma typically have 14 square metres per household member, as compared to 26 for the majority of the population) leads to the fast spread of any disease. The lack of access to water supply (affecting 40 % of Roma households) and lack of indoor bathroom facilities (80 % of the Roma do not have an inside bathroom), together with infrequent waste disposal leads to poor hygiene both in Roma 105 Eurofound, (2012), \u2018Living conditions of the Roma: Substandard housing and health\u2019. 106 Council of Ministers of Republic of Bulgaria, (2012), \u2018National Roma Integration Strategy of the Republic of Bulgaria (2012\u201320)\u2019, Sofia: Bulgaria. 107 UNDP, WB, EC, FRA, (2011) \u2018UNDP/WB/EC Regional survey 2011 and FRA Pilot survey 2011\u2019. 108 FRA, (2013), \u2018Analysis of FRA Roma Survey Results by Gender\u2019, p. 25. 109 Fundaci\u00f3n Secretariado Gitano, (2009), \u2018Health and the Roma Community, analysis of the situation in Europe: Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Greece, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia, Spain\u2019, Madrid: Spain. 110 FRA, (2013), \u2018Analysis of FRA Roma Survey Results by Gender\u2019, p. 20.

        "Report on the health status of the Roma population in the EU and monitoring data collection in the area of Roma health in the Member States August, 2014 28 Country Profile: Croatia Main Characteristics of the Roma in Croatia Demography The 2011 census: number of Roma in Croatia increased to 16.975 (0.40 %) compared to the census data 2001 9.463 (0.21 %). However, it is important to note that according to the estimates of the Council of Europe there are about 30 000 or 40 000 Roma living in Croatia. According to the National strategy 112 55 % of the population belong to the age group 0-19, 40 % to the age group 20-59 and only 3 % is older than 60. Roma live in the whole territory of Croatia but are most numerous in the Me\u0111umurje county, the City of Zagreb, Osjek Baranja county, Sisak Moslavina County, Istria county and Primorje county. In the majority of cases Roma live in marginalised and segregated communities which are to be found both in urban and rural areas. When looking at the unemployment rate, the difference between Roma and non-Roma is as follows \u2014 65 % unemployed Roma compared to 24 % unemployed non-Roma. According to the UNDP report Faces of Poverty 113 the poverty rate is two and a half times higher for Roma compared to non-Roma \u2014 thus 76 % of Roma and 20 % of non-Roma living nearby Roma settlements live in absolute poverty.

One of the main obstacles in data collection is the fact that Croatian National Institute of Public Health and Croatian Institute of Health Insurance \u2014 the two main institutions responsible for conducting health-statistical research \u2014 do not collect data on health conditions or the accessibility of health services based on ethnicity 114 . Additionally, there is limited scientific research in this area, apart from several articles focusing on a small sample. Mortality and Life Expectancy Concerning the indicators on life expectancy 115 \u2014 expected life expectancy of non- Roma is 76.6 years (73.50 for men and 70.60 for women) while the estimates for average life expectancy for Roma is 10 years less \u2014 66.6 years. As for infant mortality 116 there are some indicators of a higher infant mortality rate among the Roma population. Thus, according to the Report on Implementation of Action plan of Roma Inclusion for 2009 and 2010, Roma infants, in almost 50 % of cases did not receive any medical treatment prior to death and have died outside of medical institutions, in 63 % of cases they have died at home compared to a non-Roma average of 95 % of infants who were medically treated and have died in hospital. The main challenge with the existing data is that there are no ethnically disaggregated data so these only present estimates. Prevalence of Major Infectious Diseases As regards the prevalence of major infectious diseases there is a complete lack of data \u2014 due to the fact that data are not collected based on ethnicity we could not identify any sources. However, according to the UNDP/WB/EC regional Roma survey 2011 117 the perceived vaccination rate is as follows: (0-6) Roma \u2014 97 % (97 % male and 96 % female) and non-Roma \u2014 99 % (97 % male and 100 % female) (6) Roma \u2014 98 % (98 % male and 95 % female) and non-Roma \u2014 100 % (100 % male and 100 % female). 114 Rodin, U.

        "Report on the health status of the Roma population in the EU and monitoring data collection in the area of Roma health in the Member States August, 2014 30 Thus, it can be concluded that the level of vaccination is high, almost 100 %. This data is consistent with the National Strategy 118 which provides data on child vaccination among Roma 119 120 . Accordingly, absolute vaccination in 2010 was 75.8 %, partial vaccination was 6.4 % and the percentage of non-vaccinated children was 17.7 %. Healthy Lifestyles and Related Behaviours With reference to tobacco usage the UNDP/WB EC Regional Roma Survey 121 observed 52 % more Roma smokers than non-Roma in Croatia , and existing data report the number of smoking adults (+16) at 64 % Roma and 31 % non-Roma. The same survey includes data on malnutrition which is present in 38 % among Roma and 5 % among non-Roma. Access and Use of Health Services and Prevention Programmes There are several reports on self-reported health status. These include Refs 1 and 5 with the difference that Ref 1 refers to the region while Ref 5 refers to data collected in Croatia. Thus, according to Ref 1 the perception of the general health status of the Roma population is lower, compared to neighbouring non-Roma, but with a small difference. Altogether 16 % of the Roma sample has a negative perception of their health status, compared to 14 % of the non-Roma population. In general, 85 % of the entire surveyed population (both Roma and non-Roma) are positive about their health status \u2014 an unexpectedly positive perception. Another indicator of the perceived health status used by the survey is reported limited activity because of a health problem during the last six months. In total, no significant differences between the Roma and the non-Roma exist according to the data \u2014 82 % of respondents, equally for the Roma and non-Roma, report \u2018no limited activity\u2019. There are some statistically significant differences in the responses \u2018strongly limited\u2019, showing higher vulnerability in the Roma sample. However, the overall data verifies similar levels of reported restricted activities due to health problems for the Roma and their non-Roma neighbours. Furthermore, the Regional Roma Survey data 122 confirms that the perceived health status of the Roma is not significantly lower, as compared to the control non-Roma sample. On the contrary, the reported prevalence of chronic disorders shows, in total, 17 % of the Roma sample has such a disease or problem, while it is 18 % for the non- Roma sample. Expectedly, the reported long-standing illnesses increase with age, both among the Roma and the non-Roma sub-samples. It is important to note that the age factor is 118 Government Office for Human Rights and Rights of National Minorities, Croatia, (2013), \u2018NACIONALNA STRATEGIJA ZA UKLJU\u010cIVANJE ROMA, ZA RAZDOBLJE OD 2013.

        "Report on the health status of the Roma population in the EU and monitoring data collection in the area of Roma health in the Member States August, 2014 31 significant for both populations. However, the increase of reported health problems, among the Roma in older age groups, is much steeper, reaching 70 % for those of 65 years old, compared with 56 % of the non-Roma. The reported long-standing illnesses are more frequent among female respondents for both samples. Furthermore, differences between the Roma and the non-Roma are found when looking at in-patient stays. The number of adults (16+) who have visited hospitals during the last 12 months (with and without insurance) is higher among Roma than among non-Roma \u2014 17 % versus 12 % for the insured respondents, and respectively 14 % versus 9 % for people without the health insurance. When it comes to access to health care, the overall regional data prove a very high disparity between Roma and their non-Roma neighbour samples \u2014 74 % of the Roma in the region report having medical insurance (\u2026 either in your their name or through another member of their household) compared to 90 % of the non-Roma living in their proximity. When it comes to financial affordability of medicines, there is a difference between the Roma and the non-Roma sample which is very high. 55 % of the Roma sample report instances in the past 12 months when household members could not afford to purchase prescribed medicines. Only 25 % of the non-Roma sample reports such instances. Report data proves a lower quality of accessed services among the Roma, compared with their non-Roma neighbours. At the individual level, 10 % of the interviewed Roma report being very dissatisfied with the services provided at their last visit, compared with 6 % of the non-Roma respondents. The difference is even higher for the perception of health safety \u2014 24 % of the Roma households do not feel safe, compared to 12 % of their non-Roma neighbours. In reference to this data it is important to point out that data covers all interviewed households in the region, not only Croatia. When it comes to Croatia 123 , the share of people with a bad health assessment is 12 % of Roma and 11 % non-Roma while the share of people with a good health assessment is 78 % of Roma and 71 % of non-Roma. Thus, we can conclude that there is a positive perception of health and no significant difference between Roma and non-Roma. When it comes to access to medical insurance the data show that 82 % of Roma have insurance in comparison to 97 % of non-Roma, thus showing disparity between these two groups. The same report collected data on incidence of specific medical check-ups and the data shows the following: \uf0a7 Dental check-ups \u2014 34 % Roma and 44 % non-Roma participated; \uf0a7 X-ray, ultrasound or other scan \u2014 29 % Roma and 34 % non-Roma participated; \uf0a7 Cholesterol test \u2014 25 % Roma and 40 % non-Roma participated; \uf0a7 Heart check-ups \u2014 27 % Roma and 35 % non-Roma participated. 123 UNDP, (2011), \u2018UNDP-WB-European Commission regional Roma survey 2011\u2019.

        "Report on the health status of the Roma population in the EU and monitoring data collection in the area of Roma health in the Member States August, 2014 32 In terms of barriers to accessing health care, the survey 124 shows that when it comes to access to essential drugs there is a high disparity between Roma and non-Roma. Thus, 44 % of Roma reported having no access while only 16 % of non-Roma reported the same. Additionally, in accessing health services, 92 % of Roma have access compared to 98 % of non-Roma. Prevalence of Major Chronic Diseases When it comes to the prevalence of major diseases, the only available data is from 2005 \u2013 06 and refers to the prevalence of hypertension. However, it should be noted that the research refers only to a small group of Roma, more precisely to 423 members of the Bayash Roma minority population living in two regions of Croatia (144 men and 279 women, aged 18 \u2013 84 years). Accordingly, hypertension was found in 24.8 % Bayash Roma (21.5 % men and 26.5 % women). The prevalence increases from 5.9 % in the age group 18 \u2013 34; 35.0 % in the age group 35 \u2013 64, and 51.4 % in the age group 65+. The prevalence of hypertension in the Bayash Roma is almost half of what is usually reported for the general population of Croatia. It is also lower when compared with other European populations and this finding is not due to a comparatively younger average age of the Bayash sample 125 . Health Factors Related to the Role of Women in the Roma Community We identified two indicators for health factors related to women. Cervical cancer screening: \uf0a7 The gap between Roma females (74 %) and their non-Roma neighbours (86 %) in cervical testing widens for the older age groups, while there is a reverse vulnerability for the youngest age group (15 \u2013 24 years), where the cervical attendance rate among Roma is higher. The latter is understandable, taking into account other research showing that the Roma start sexual life at a younger age, compared to the national majorities 126 . However, this data refers to the region as a whole. Country specifics, however, emerged as the strongest factor showing the high level of access to maternity health services in Croatia. Probit analysis shows increasing probabilities of cervical testing if living in Croatia (+15 %). Similarly, the probability of attending a gynaecological test is significantly higher in Croatia (+19 %). \uf0a7 In terms of becoming a mother at 15 years of age, according to the National Strategy 127 60 % of girls start sexual relationships and are mothers at the age of 15.

Additionally, according to Roma NGOs this data should be taken with caution. Environmental and other Socio-Economic Factors When it comes to data on the environmental and the socio-economic status of the Roma in Croatia, the majority of data is taken from the UNDP survey (Ref 5). Additionally, a recent FRA report 128 includes data on the Roma population in Croatia and basic information about education, employment, housing, health, poverty/economic situation and active citizenship/rights awareness of Roma in Croatia. The employment rate is 14 % for the Roma and 49 % for the non-Roma (15 \u2013 64 of age) (Ref 5). Furthermore, In 2009, a non-governmental study carried out in five counties of the Republic of Croatia and Zagreb found that there were 7 % of Roma women verses 16 % of Roma men employed (13 % vs 33 % registered, respectively (Ref 4). Unemployment rate is 65 % for the Roma (significant gender difference: 59 % male vs 76 % female) and 23 % for non- Roma (15\u201364 age group) 129 130 . Educational level Literacy rates show that 84 % of Roma (significant difference between gender: 92 % men vs 77 % women) are literate compared to 99 % of non-Roma 131 . Also, when looking at the enrolment rate in secondary schools there is 31.42 % Roma enrolment in comparison to 77.05 % of non-Roma. Additionally, a non-governmental report published in 2009 highlighted issues in the situation of the Roma in education in five counties and Zagreb and provided an insight into the gender inequalities in this regard. Considering the younger generation, the study showed that 23 % of Roma men vs 17 % women finished elementary school and 21 % men vs 15 % women finished secondary school 132 . When analysing data on the highest completed education (25\u201364) the data show that 40 % of Roma in comparison to 2 % of non-Roma have no formal education. There is a significant gender difference in Roma population \u2014 29 % of men and 50 % of women have no formal education. In terms of primary education, 34 % of Roma have finished only primary education in comparison to 9 % non-Roma. 16 % of Roma have finished lower secondary education in comparison to 21 % of non-Roma while 9 % of Roma have finished upper secondary education in comparison to 60 % of non-Roma 133 . 128 FRA.

        "Report on the health status of the Roma population in the EU and monitoring data collection in the area of Roma health in the Member States August, 2014 34 However, the number of Roma enrolling in primary education appears to be on the rise. According to official statistics, Roma enrolment in elementary schools quadrupled (from 1 013 to 4 186) between the school years 2005/06 \u2013 2009/10 134 . This is in line with the UNDP survey which showed that the average years of education (ages 25\u201364) is 4.49 years for Roma compared to 10.58 years for non-Roma 135 . When it comes to housing and the number of rooms per household member the ratio is 0.48 % for Roma in comparison to 1.20 % for non-Roma 136 137 . The proportion of the population not having access to secure housing: 26 % for Roma and 4 % for non-Roma 138 . The proportion of the population not having access to an improved water source: 35 % for Roma and 4 % for non-Roma 139 . The proportion of the population not having access to improved sanitation (not having a toilet or bathroom inside the dwelling): 45 % for Roma and 5 % for non-Roma 140 . According to the FRA 141 this ratio is 53.91 % of Roma in comparison to 6.30 % for non-Roma. Access to electricity: 88 % for Roma and 99 % for non-Roma 142 . EU material deprivation index. Material deprivation: 88 % for Roma and 42 % for non- Roma 143 . Severe material deprivation: 70 % for Roma and 24 % for non-Roma 144 . Absolute poverty rate PPP 145 USD 4.30 expenditure-based: 5 % for Roma and 5 % for non-Roma 146 . PPP USD 4.30 income-based: 9 % for Roma and 5 % for non-Roma. Relative poverty rate (60 % equalised median income): 92 % for Roma and 42 % for non-Roma 147 . Hence, the relative poverty rate in Croatia is twice as high for the Roma when compared to non-Roma. There are also significant differences in income levels between the two groups: 3 517.15 HRK for Roma and 5 646.92 HRK for non-Roma. According to the People\u2019s Ombudsman, ethnic discrimination is the most frequent type of discrimination, and Serbs and Roma are the most discriminated-against ethnic minorities.

It is believed that they came originally from Corfu, employed later by the Ottomans for military purposes and later converting to Islam 154 . However, there is also a minority of Roma who are Christian. The country is divided between the Cypriot and the Turkish-Cypriot areas, where the majority of the Roma live nowadays: because of this jurisdictional separation collection of data on Roma population is not precise. Roma in Cyprus are estimated to be between 1 500 and 2 500. According to the Administration of District Officers, there are between 650 and 700 Roma who live in areas where the Republic of Cyprus exercises effective control. Moreover, there are Romanian and other Balkan Roma living in Cyprus, although their numbers are not officially known 155 . Geographical distribution Roma in Cyprus are mainly Muslim, therefore when the country was split in two parts they were deemed to be part of the Turkish-Cypriot community, although this was not self-determined. In the late 1990s and early 2000s, a number of Roma crossed from the Turkish-controlled north to the Greek Cypriot-controlled south and settled in the old Turkish quarter of Limassol. They settled in properties abandoned by Turkish Cypriots many decades ago, which are in a poor state of repair. There, they faced extreme poverty, exclusion and hostility from the host population and were treated with suspicion and intolerance by the authorities 156 . This internal migration from the North to the South of the island has put the recognition of Roma ethnicity on the government agenda 157 .

Prevalence of Major Chronic Diseases The research team have not found any qualifications for this indicator Health Factors Related to the Role of Women in the Roma Community The research team have not found any qualifications for this indicator Environmental and other Socio-Economic Factors Anecdotal evidence is reported below: \uf0a7 Housing According to the investigation of the Ombudsman, Roma are one of the most vulnerable groups in society 159 . The Ombudsman\u2019s report refers to them as \u2018one of the most vulnerable groups in society\u2019, because they were not recognised as a minority by the Republic\u2019s National Action Plan for Social Inclusion 160 . This vulnerable status is fully reflected in their accommodation conditions, from the research and data available, it emerges that housing is one of the least optimal aspects of Roma life 161 . The RAXEN study reports that Roma in Cyprus do not live in encampments and their access to private housing is severely limited. Roma live either in abandoned Turkish Cypriot properties administered by the Government or in prefabricated houses in specially designated Roma settlements 162 . Accommodations have temporary structures and are in isolated areas, primarily to satisfy the local communities, who treated them with hostility and did not wish to live close to them. This accommodation is free of charge and supplied with basic facilities: water, electricity, sewage systems and solar heaters. Part of the Roma community is also present in the old Turkish quarter of Limassol, where the houses are decaying. Repairs and improvements have been carried out recently on 45 houses in the districts of Paphos and Limassol, under the initiative of Welfare Services of the Ministry of Labour and Social Insurance. \uf0a7 Education The 2011 Report from the European Commission against Racism and Intolerance (ECRI) observed that there is a disproportionately high concentration of Turkish 158 ECRI REPORT ON CYPRUS (fourth monitoring cycle) Adopted on 23 March 2011, Published on 31 May 2011. 159 Ombudsman\u2019s Office, (2005), \u2018Annual report 2004\u2019, Available: http://www.ombudsman.gov.cy/ 160 Trimikliniotis, N.

This disproportionate concentration may be a result of the fact that Roma pupils attend schools that are closer to where they live. However, this does not explain the lack of attendance in rural areas. An ethnographic study (2012) based on interviews carried out in two schools in Cyprus found that teachers have insufficient understanding of Roma cultural practices, beliefs and attitudes towards schooling, making the integration of Roma students more difficult 164 . However, a study from 2009 reports some improvement in primary school attendance due to supportive measures such as providing school meals, uniforms and school materials. Secondary school enrolment and attendance are still poor in comparison to non-Roma populations. \uf0a7 Employment Both qualitative and quantitative studies illustrate a sub-optimal labour situation for the Roma in Cyprus. The NRIS study observes that the main barrier to employment is language The majority of the Roma do not speak English or Greek, the local government is providing Greek classes for citizens not able to speak the language.

        "Report on the health status of the Roma population in the EU and monitoring data collection in the area of Roma health in the Member States August, 2014 41 Country Profile: Czech Republic Main Characteristics of the Roma in the Czech Republic Demography The total country population of the Czech Republic is 10 526,214 165 . The Roma population is estimated to be approximately 200 000 (1.9 %). Moreover 13 150 (0.2 %) inhabitants reported their nationality as Czech and Roma and 5 199 reported themselves as Roma exclusively. The majority of Roma reported themselves as Czech, Moravian and other non-Roma nationality. The trend of self-reported Roma nationality is declining from 32 903 in 1991 to 11 746 in 2001 166 . This may be caused by increased Roma integration into Czech mainstream society and/or a wish to integrate. Another explanation could be the increasing indirect discrimination in the job market, services and other parts of society. It is possible that this has had knock-on effects for Roma civic participation, with turnout to the previous national election extremely low \u2014 26 % of Roma citizens voted compared to 60 % of non- Roma. 167 Geographical distribution The Roma live on over 300 socially excluded localities 168 . A locality is a village or a part of a house in a town Although inhabitants are not exclusively Roma \u2014 nevertheless localities are characterised by poverty and social exclusion. They are spread throughout the country, however larger and/or poor Roma communities are concentrated geographically in the northeast (Ostrava, Hole\u0161ov, P\u0159erov, Jesenicko) and the northwest (Fr\u00fddlant, Rumburk, \u00dast\u00ed nad Labem). Slovak and other foreign Roma have immigrated to those regions and consequently increased the number of inhabitants in these poor and excluded communities. Roma migrants combine two burdens or causes of exclusion: unregistered migration and poverty. Central Bohemia is a region with a Roma population that is highly integrated, less poor, has higher levels of education and employment and is thus less excluded 169 . Other Information (including highlights of data gaps) Due to personal data protection policy, data on Roma are generally difficult to find in official statistics. Official statistics and data on Roma population ceased to be available after 1990. Most data on health and related to health are available from scientific studies and surveys published in professionals journals, from NGOs working with Roma, from governmental reports (annually since 2003) or reports on the status of Roma communities (monitoring). Data is generally collected by questionnaires or through face-to-face interviews with Roma and sometimes with non-Roma people as a control group. Few data are collected from medical or other professional records. The most important sources of data are studies and surveys undertaken by international organisations such as the FRA, World Bank, UNDP, Open Society Fund 165 Census 2011. 166 Czech Statistical Office official website, [Online].

        "Report on the health status of the Roma population in the EU and monitoring data collection in the area of Roma health in the Member States August, 2014 42 and EU \u2014 Eurostat and Euro Barometer statistics. Data from these studies (health status, health indicators, lifestyle, use of health services and other issues related to health of Roma) have been collected from questionnaires or interviews with Roma. Gaps in knowledge on Roma health include verified health indicators such as mortality, life expectancy and disease prevalence. Interviews and questionnaires are the only channels through which information on Roma health can be gathered. The selection and information bias therefore needs to be carefully interpreted. Other data gaps stem from a lack of comparison of findings and data with the controls \u2014 non-Roma population, both, living in proximity as Roma in under a survey or controls with similar social economic determinants or with official data for the general population. Such data should better help to find the causes of differences and/or inequalities in the health status of Roma and non-Roma populations and the distinction among differences caused by genetics or biology and inequalities or inequity caused by social economic and culture determinants. Mortality and Life Expectancy Estimates suggest that the mortality rate of Roma is higher than in the general population. However, no exact data are available on this. Life expectancy is predicted to be about 10 \u2013 15 years lower than the general population. This is an estimate that is generally accepted for the Roma population in Europe. Data that is more precise has not been found (very probably it is not available). Czech life expectancy at birth in 2011 is 74.3 years for men and 80.5 years for women 170 . The estimates for Roma are 64 years for Roma men and 70 years for Roma women. However, the average age of death in 2011 was 59.2 years for Roma men (65.6 years for non-Roma men) and 63 years for Roma women (80.2 for non-Roma women) according to data from a questionnaire which included the question: \u2018At what age did your parents die?\u2019 in a study 171 . Differences between age of death and/or predicted life expectancy are more pronounced for women: 17 years, while for men this discrepancy is seven years. This is an alarming finding and will need further research to find causes and prevention. If we compare the life expectancy of Czech people to social economic determinants like education, we find that less educated men live 18 years less than university- educated men. 172 For women, the difference in education has a lesser influence on life expectancy \u2014 three years. It is generally observed that social determinants have a gender gradient; they influence men more than women. Poor education is a typical social determinant for Roma communities and mortality and life expectancy should remain different between the sexes in the Roma group. In reality, the opposite model seems to be valid: women are more vulnerable to socio-economic determinants of health than men in Roma communities. Infant mortality was 24 % for Roma children in 1985, which is twice as much as for non-Roma children (12.5 %).

        "Report on the health status of the Roma population in the EU and monitoring data collection in the area of Roma health in the Member States August, 2014 43 infant mortality is decreasing, but it still remains 2.5 times higher than in the non- Roma population 173 . Causes for this higher infant mortality among Roma are suggested to stem from the poorer lifestyles of pregnant women, especially smoking being common in pregnancies (57 % 174 ), poor environmental conditions, especially housing, low education levels of mothers and inadequate care for infants. Causes of higher morbidity in children and higher frequency of doctors\u2019 visits among adults could be the result of poor living and hygienic conditions, especially housing, and related to low income and unemployment, or low levels of education but also to specific cultural characteristics insofar as a smaller value is put on education and disease prevention. Prevalence of disease among Roma children is very high as studies published in 2008 have stated. This causes high absenteeism of children at school and leads to a low educational performance. Poorer lifestyles of pregnant women could also be related to lower birth weight and other non-favourable outcomes 175 . Birth weight was less than 2 500 g in 14.1 % of Roma newborns, in comparison to 3.6 % of non-Roma newborn. These unfavourable birth outcomes also included pre-term birth (less than 37 weeks): 9.9 % for Roma 3.9 for non-Roma women. Intrauterine growth retardation (IUGR) was prevalent in 22.2 % of Roma babies and 8.9 % of non-Roma babies. Other source states that 50 % of Roma newborn babies have a weight of less than 2 500 g 176 . As positive trend in the country is that 90 % of Roma women give birth in hospitals (maternity wards) in comparison to 97 % of non-Roma women. Moreover 7 % of Roma women give birth at home with health care (midwife) assistance compared to 2 % of non-Roma women. Only 3 % of Roma women give birth at home without health care assistance (non-Roma women 1 %) 177 178 . These could however be non- intent cases (not reaching a hospital in time). Prevalence of Major Infectious Diseases Child morbidity and paediatric visits are higher for Roma children according to a study published in 1993 179 . More recent data was not found. The frequency was calculated based on medical records: 2.2 diseases were suffered by a Roma child per year in comparison to 1.5 diseases by a non-Roma child per year. The total number sickness day per year was 16.5 for a Roma child in comparison to 12.4 for a non- Roma child. The difference was statistically significant for Roma and non-Roma girls, 13.88 sick days for Roma girls and 9.64 sickness days for non-Roma girls. Very small differences were found between Roma boys (17 sickness days) and non-Roma boys (18). 173 Davidova, E. a kol.

More Roma children had been prescribed antibiotics (45 %) than non-Roma children (32 %). Vaccination rates for nine obligatory vaccinated diseases (tetanus, pertussis, diphtheria, measles, rubella, parotitis, hepatitis B, polio, hemofilus influensae) are high in the Czech Republic. Child vaccination is obligatory by law and free of charge. Estimated vaccination rates for Roma children is 95 % in comparison to the total population 98 %. 180 Measles prevalence: 17 cases in 2011 in total, most of them foreigners or migrants, no data on Roma 181 . Vaccination against hepatitis A is not obligatory according to the law. It is easily accessible but not free. Vaccination rates among Roma population are estimated as being low, together with lower hygiene standards in some Roma communities. Moreover two epidemics of the disease have been recorded: \uf0a7 In 2009 30 % of Roma from all reported cases were ill; \uf0a7 In 2010 more than 50 % of Roma from all reported cases were ill 182 . The public health response was immediate: vaccination against hepatitis A for the population at risks was provided for free. Vaccination against hepatitis B is free of charge and obligatory for all children (citizens of CR), hepatitis A is voluntary and must be paid for.

No more than 2 % of adults are engaged in regular physical activity or sport, 70 % do not engage in any physical activities 187 . Obesity as a result of high energy intake and low energy uptake among Roma, 27 % of the Roma is overweight, 17 % suffer from obesity, (17.4 % for the Czech Republic), men are slightly more out of the normal weight range, the age group 45+ is 70 % overweight and/or obese, 28 % of children 1\u20139 years is obese, 5 % children of 10\u201315 years is obese 188 . Differences between men and women are less pronounced than in the non-Roma population: 45.5 % of non-Roma men is overweight and 17.3 % obese, 29.9 % of non-Roma women is overweight and 17.5 % obese 189 . The data on obesity are based on self-reported height and weight and might underestimate the prevalence of obesity. Culturally, overweight people are perceived as normal. We can assume from this reviewed data that the percentage of obesity in the Roma population is the same as in the non-Roma population. Smoking : 56 % of women and 65 % of men in the Roma population smoke every day. Children smoke regularly from the age of 16 but occasionally also at a younger age. Self-reported numbers slightly differ in different sources 190 191 192 193 . Smoking among the non-Roma population is prevalent: 30 % of men and 19 % of women 194 . Pregnant women admitted to smoking in pregnancy \u2014 58 %, in comparison with 20 % of non-Roma pregnant women. 85 % of pregnant Roma women reported smoking before pregnancy 195 .

        "Report on the health status of the Roma population in the EU and monitoring data collection in the area of Roma health in the Member States August, 2014 46 chemical inhalation is one of the most widespread, and is also cheap. Other substances include cannabis and stimulants. Illicit drugs are quite easily accessible in communities and the number of addicted young people is increasing 197 . Increased criminality is associated with illicit drugs abuse 198 . Only 2.5 % of the adult Roma population admitted to illicit drug abuse \u2014 at least once in their life, in comparison with the non-Roma population: 19 % of men and 13 % of women reported taking an illicit drug, most often marijuana 199 . It is generally believed that Roma drink more alcohol than the non-Roma populations. Results of sociological studies where self-reported data is used should be interpreted carefully due to possible information bias, misinterpretation and positive stylisation. According to a study, only 9 % of men and 23 % of women had not drunk alcohol in the last 12 months 200 . Frequency of drinking alcohol decreases with age in both the Roma and non-Roma population. It seems that alcohol drinking in the Roma population does not exceed alcohol drinking among the non-Roma population. Beer is consumed every day in 20 % of the Roma population. The equivalent number for strong alcohol is 5 %. Roma children begin to drink alcohol later than they start smoking, at 15 \u2013 16 years. Almost all of adult alcohol drinkers admitted that they started to drink before the age of 18 201 . Access and Use of Health Services and Prevention Programmes According to numerous documents and surveys, Roma\u2018s barriers to using health services stem from poor accessibility (distance) and financial burdens . Yet if we analyse data for the Czech Republic we can see that the opposite seems to be the case. The Czech health care facilities network is well developed. Accessibility issues are no different for Roma than the population generally. Social capital among Roma is high; wider family members care for each other and mutual help is more frequent than among the non-Roma population. On the contrary, an obstacle to using health services is the perception of disease and health. Roma people take disease seriously if it is life threatening or very disabling. However once treated, there is a tendency to cease to access medical care 202 . Health care services are paid for by universal health insurance which is obligatory for Czech citizens. If a Czech citizen is not able to pay, insurance is paid for by the State. If a respondent reports that he/she has no health insurance, he/she is probably not a citizen of the Czech Republic. This holds true for migrants and Roma migrants, too. It is possible to have health insurance debts but it is not an obstacle 197 Ka\u0161parov\u00e1, I. a kol.

Roma people reported more obstacles to accessing health care, however they use it more than the majority population: 44 % of the Roma use it every month (28 % for the majority population of 18+), 34 % at least once a year and 23 % less than once a year. Only 1 % of the Roma population has never contacted a doctor during his/her life time. The number of visits does not differentiate among GPs or specialists 203 . Some studies state that in-patient ward or emergency wards are more frequently visited by Roma than the majority population, others conclude that the increased frequency of doctors\u2019 visits by Roma is only true for GP visits 204 . Visits to specialists and dentists are less frequent in comparison to the majority population. The data are very similar across the majority population and dependent on the social economic group; the less wealthy people visit GPs more often than the most affluent part of population but make fewer visits to dentist and specialists 205 . Moreover, there are fewer seniors (60+) in the Roma population; however, they are the most health care-consuming population group among the non-Roma 206 . It is important for the analysis and interpretation of results and outcomes of different sources that not only different methods of data collecting are noted but also the locality where respondents live. Roma in the Czech Republic are not a homogenous group regarding their inclusion, poverty or education. The main difference could be length of living in one place \u2014 the most excluded, poor and hard to reach are Roma who have recently immigrated from Slovakia and Romania. That community has a triple burden: to be poor, to be migrant and to be Roma. Causes of higher frequency of doctors\u2019 visits among adults could be the result of poor living and hygienic conditions, especially housing, and related to low income and unemployment, or a low level of education but also to specific culture characteristics insofar as a smaller value is put on education and disease prevention 207 . Access and use of preventative services All Czech citizens have the right to health insurance by law 208 and are entitled to free preventative checks including dental checks once a year (twice for pregnant women), general check-ups (including blood pressure and cholesterol) once every two years, gynaecological examination including smear test every year from the age of 15, once every two years, mammogram for women over 45 years, colorectal cancer early signs for persons over 50 once every two years. Children have preventative health checks by paediatricians every month in the first year, and subsequently less frequently up to the age of 19. 203 Nesvadbov\u00e1, L., Sandera, J., Haberova, V.

The reasons for these differences may stem from different cultural perception of health, different views on the benefits of preventative checks and a lack of information about the affordability of the services. Disability benefits (fully or partially) are more frequent among Roma: 9.4 % has a full disability benefit (3.2 % of non-Roma population), 9.2 % has a partial benefit (1.2 % of non-Roma).

        "Report on the health status of the Roma population in the EU and monitoring data collection in the area of Roma health in the Member States August, 2014 49 Headache, migraine and depression are more frequently found among women in comparison to men. Generally, as in majority population, diagnosis of diseases is more frequent among women. Level of education and employment status influence the number of reported diseases; lower education and unemployment increase number of reported diseases. The high prevalence of mental health problems and psychiatric diagnoses are related to alcohol abuse among Roma men 215 216 . Moreover, limited daily physical activity is largely the result of pain and musculoskeletal impairment especially of spine and joints (osteoarthritis) 217 . Health Factors Related to the Role of Women in the Roma Community General overview: Almost double the number of Roma women self-reported bad health compared to their non-Roma counterparts. This ratio is largely unchanged in both the over 16 and over 50 cohorts 218 . This may not be entirely separate from the issue of health insurance facing the female Roma population in the Czech Republic where 8 % of women are uninsured and 3 % of non-Roma women reported being uninsured. The overall figures on non-insurance may be low internationally, yet a significant disparity still exists on ethnic grounds 219 . Fertility rate: the last official number from 1970 \u2013 80: 5.8 children per Roma woman, 3.6 per non-Roma woman. Now Roma women have mostly two (17.7 % of families) or three (15.3 %) children, more than in the non-Roma population 220 . Smaller families and fewer children among Roma seems to be a trend as a study published in 2003 found that 40 % of Roma mothers had more than three children, in comparison with only 5 % of non-Roma mothers 221 . Younger age of first conception: 18 \u2013 19 is the average age of the first pregnancy of Roma women (non-Roma: 29 years). A higher proportion of children are born outside marriage: this is partly because marriages between Roma are often not fully legalised by the authorities. However, numbers of children born outside marriage among Roma copies trends in non-Roma society. The percentage of women being single mothers at the time of the child\u2019s birth is 62 % among Roma and 22 % among non-Roma women 222 223 . 215 Ka\u0161parov\u00e1, I. a kol.

        "Report on the health status of the Roma population in the EU and monitoring data collection in the area of Roma health in the Member States August, 2014 50 Low birth control: hormonal pill: expensive and regular intake is more difficult to maintain. 10 % of Roma women reported use of some form of female contraception 224 . Men do not use any contraception. Gynaecologist\u2019s checks (ante-natal visits) and prevention checks: 80 % of women reported visiting their doctors regularly from the beginning of the pregnancy. The frequency decreases with age and the number of pregnancies \u2014 older women use ante-natal consultancy less often 225 . 58 % of women reported gynaecologist\u2019s visits every year when they are not pregnant. Preventative screening \u2014 mammogram: 42 % of Roma women were invited or received information about preventative screening, compared to 28 % women in the same age group to whom cervical smear tests were recommended 226 . Female sterilisation is a very sensitive issue for all women and for Roma women especially as traditionally, higher fertility and more children mean higher status for a Roma woman. Forced sterilisation or sterilisations without prior knowledge were undertaken in Czech hospitals during the 1972 \u2013 91 period. Women and Roma women especially, were sterilised without consent or knowledge during childbirth or gynaecological procedures either as a discriminatory measure or the woman may have been offered a financial reward if she agreed to sterilisation. This human rights violating practice has now stopped. New legislation is in place to better protect and inform women, including Roma women about medical procedures and sterilisation. During the period the sterilisation took place, around 80 lodged a complaint against their treatment. The Czech Government has since issued an apology 227 . Environmental and other Socio-Economic Factors In socially excluded (poor) areas housing can be an environmental risk: because of overcrowding, problems with property owners' and authorities' waste management, lack of water supply and storage of food (if no refrigerator) Moreover, in some areas there are rats and insects 228 . The average number of persons per room in Roma households are (excluding kitchen, corridor, toilet, bathroom): 2.2 (non-Roma 1.2).

High unemployment rates and a lack of financial resources gave Roma a poor reputation as tenants. Roma are considered to be a problematic population group and they are concentrated in the outskirts of towns and villages. Social housing is not a universal concept in the Czech Republic 232 . Education : Only 15 % of Roma women have completed further education after completing lower secondary education (schooling is obligatory until the age of 15 in the Czech Republic) 233 . 27 % of Roma men have completed upper secondary and/or higher education. This is below national standards \u2014 95 % of the majority population has finished upper secondary education. Nursery school and/or other pre-school facilities are used less by Roma parents. An international study concluded that slightly more than 30 % of Roma children aged 4 \u2013 7 attend pre-school facilities in comparison to 80 % of non-Roma children 234 . However, just 2 % of Roma women and 1 % of Roma men over 16 have reportedly never attended school 235 . Reasons for very low education among Roma are rooted in cultural values: education is not a priority. Evidence suggests that children are not motivated to go to school or to learn 236 . Employment : A survey indicates that around 38 % of Roma are unemployed 20 but other estimates suggest that 70 \u2013 100 % of Roma are unemployed in some excluded areas 237 238 . An FRA survey found that 36 % of Roma women declared themselves to be in paid work, with the male figure slightly lower (33 %) 239 . Furthermore the Roma employee is often not entitled to paid days off or sick leave. In the cases where employment is legal, jobs are often short-term, part-time or in other ways insecure. Social benefits, child benefits and disability benefits are the main incomes for many, especially excluded, Roma families 240 241 . Although a similar number of Roma and non-Roma are entitled to pensions, discrimination in the job market is endemic \u2014 42 % of Roma males and 35 % of Roma females reported experiencing a degree of ethnicity-related discrimination when looking for a job in the last 12 months. 242 Bibliography 232 Zurovcov\u00e1, H.

        "Report on the health status of the Roma population in the EU and monitoring data collection in the area of Roma health in the Member States August, 2014 54 Country Profile: Denmark Main Characteristics of the Roma in Denmark Demography There is a lack of clarity around the number of Roma in Denmark with estimates ranging from 1 000 \u2013 25 000. The Council of Europe estimates the Danish Roma population to be 1 000 \u2013 10 000 243 although the basis for this estimate is unknown. The Danish Ministry of Social Affairs reports 2 000, citing a Danish Refugee NGO (Dansk Flygtningehj\u00e6lp) 244 . An international study from 2009 245 states that this figure (2 000) is often cited for Denmark without proper reference and that it is unclear from where it actually derives 246 . The study further cites \u2018some Roma organisations\u2019 as estimating the population to be 15 000 \u2013 25 000. When \u2018Danish Roma NGOs\u2019 are cited in Danish newspaper articles, 10 000 is the estimate most frequently provided 247 . The Raxen study suggests that most Roma in Denmark are settled (i.e. not travellers) and prefer to register according to nationality and to hide their Romani identity in public to avoid discrimination from the authorities and others active in the communities 248 . Most of the persons with Roma background in Denmark arrived in the 1960s and 1970s as migrant workers. As a result of the war in the Balkans in the 1990s, Denmark also received approximately 21 000 refugees from the former Yugoslavia, of which an unknown number have a Roma background. It is thought that the early immigrating Roma have almost fully integrated into Danish society whereas a greater body of the more recent refugees have struggled to settle in. Many of these may also suffer from trauma and depression following the war in former Republic of Yugoslavia 249 . Denmark occasionally experiences a seasonal influx of a small number of Roma from other EU Member States which temporarily stay in the country, but generally the number of persons with a Roma background in Denmark is estimated by the authorities to have been relatively constant for the last decade 250 .

        "Report on the health status of the Roma population in the EU and monitoring data collection in the area of Roma health in the Member States August, 2014 55 The largest Danish Roma population is found in the town of Elsinore, approximately 50 km north of Copenhagen, and is estimated to total 1 000 251 \u2013 1 200 252 . The majority of the remaining Roma are, according to a Roma NGO, concentrated in the greater metropolitan area of Copenhagen 253 . Other Information (including highlights of data gaps) No information is collected on the Roma population as such in Denmark. According to a Danish journalist and author of a recent book on Roma in Europe 254 , Denmark is the country in Europe collecting the least amount of data in the area 255 . The Danish National Health Board has produced a rich literature on the health of ethnic minorities in Denmark. This includes indicators for sickness and the use of health care services 256 , social-risk groups 257 , prevention and health promotion 258 . The majority of these studies draw on register data, which in Denmark offer a wide range of individual data records associated with the social security number (CPR). In public registers it is possible to distinguish between ethnic minorities on the basis of the birthplace and citizenship of their parents 259 . Neither of these indicators, however, reveals the ethnicity of the individual in question, which may explain why publications in the area do not consider Roma as a distinct group 260 . A publication from 2008 of the Danish authorities on the health of ethnic minorities in Denmark was based on a survey carried out among seven ethnic groups. 424 of the included respondents were immigrants of ex-Yugoslavia or their descendants 261 . However, this group constitutes a poor proxy for the Roma population as many Roma who have integrated into Danish society have acquired Danish citizenship and figure as \u2018ethnic Danes\u2019 in public registers 262 . Also this population presumably comprises a large majority of persons from the former Yugoslavia, which are not Roma. However, where appropriate, data on this group has been reported below. 251 Number quoted in Ministry of Social Affairs and Integration (2011), Presentation to the European Commission of Denmark\u2019s National Roma Inclusion Strategy.

        "Report on the health status of the Roma population in the EU and monitoring data collection in the area of Roma health in the Member States August, 2014 56 In the late 1980s and throughout the 1990s the local authority of Elsinore recorded the ethnicity of Roma in relation to social work. The practice has now been abandoned due to concerns about the legality of providing social services on the basis of ethnicity 263 .

Environmental and other Socio-Economic Factors Housing A main source of data for housing is the 2009 study commissioned by the Fundamental Rights Agency of the EU \u2014 the Raxen National Focal Point for Denmark 268 . This study undertook a thorough assessment of the housing situation of Roma. Although the study found no specific data on Roma and housing, the following key findings for ethnic minorities are presented below: \uf0a7 Sixty per cent of ethnic minorities \u2014 compared to 14 % of the majority population \u2014 live in social housing and many live in multi-ethnic areas where more than 40 % of the population is from an ethnic-minority background 269 . In other words, two out of three immigrant families live in social housing areas. \uf0a7 Ethnic minorities generally have fewer square metres per inhabitant than ethnic Danes. On average, the population occupies 60 square metres per person. The latest immigrants to arrive have on average 32 square metres per person and \u2018older\u2019 immigrant groups a little more. Immigrants who have obtained Danish citizenship, descendants and immigrants in mixed families have more square 266 This study has also been used by the FRA in their attempt to derive an understanding on Roma health in Denmark. 267 Signhammer, John (2008) Etniske minoriteters sundhed.

An additional survey carried out on five homeless Roma in Copenhagen pointed to a strong experience of discrimination and exclusion in the society in general 270 . Employment Anecdotal evidence: in a newspaper article from 2010, a senior social worker in the town of the largest Roma community, Elsinore, states that approximately 100 out of a total Roma community of 1 200 are unemployed 271 . It is likely that due to lower education levels, employment poses more of a challenge for the Roma minority. Attempts to reduce this problem in Elsinore have often been deemed discriminatory and thus abandoned. Education For a period of approximately 20 years the authorities in Elsinore introduced specialised classes for Roma children. This practice was found illegal by the Ministry of Social Affairs and terminated in 2004 after having received international criticism 272 . In a study from 2004 of these classes an absenteeism rate was found to be approximately 66 % 273 . This type of data is no longer collected. However, the use of \u2018morning ladies\u2019 (city council consultants who pick up truants from home) in Elsinore is hoped to reduce the problem. Although statistical data does not exist on the topic, the municipality assesses that Roma adults have a typically lower level of education to their non-Roma counterparts and likewise, Roma children have higher levels of absenteeism 274 .

        "Report on the health status of the Roma population in the EU and monitoring data collection in the area of Roma health in the Member States August, 2014 60 Country Profile: Estonia Main Characteristics of the Roma in Estonia Demography The official number of Roma in Estonia, according to the Council of Europe, is 584. However, the estimated number of Roma living in Estonia is between 1 000 and 1 500 persons 275 . The estimate from average figures (1 250), Roma population would then translate into 0.1 % of the total population of Estonia 276 . However, according to Statistics Estonia, the national statistics office, there were 215 Roma males and 241 Roma females living in Estonia in 2011, which makes a total of 456 enumerated permanent residents of Roma in Estonia 277 . There are some official data concerning the numbers of Roma in Estonia. However, the data are somewhat unreliable, since it has been reported that some members of Roma are reluctant to describe themselves as Roma 278 . Moreover, Roma in Estonia is not a nationally recognised ethnic minority, because Roma doesn\u2019t reach the necessary threshold of 3 000 279 . The most common native language for Roma in Estonia is their home tongue Romani, followed by Russian and then Estonian. A little under half of Roma had Estonian citizenship; the next most common was undetermined citizenship; and finally citizenship of another country. 280 The majority of Roma in Estonia today has arrived from the former USSR and Latvia after WW2. Few descendants from Roma communities that lived in Estonia before WW2 exist. Many were victims of the National Socialistregime and later were subjected to assimilation attempts by the USSR 281 . Thus, there is very little available information on Roma in Estonia, both from national surveys as well as academic research. Due to the lack of data collection concerning Roma in Estonia, this country research relies mostly on national statistics (or the lack thereof), European (EU) and regional commissioned studies, non-formal sources, such as NGOs, and reports by EU 275 COE Roma and Travellers Division (2010), Population Statistics.

Geographical distribution The majority of Roma communities are found in southern Estonia, (185 Roma), north- eastern (92 Roma) and western Estonia (69 Roma) 282 . 78 % of Roma live in urban settings. The largest Roma community lives in Valga by the Latvian border, followed by the capital city, Tallinn. 283 The majority of the Roma population is sedentary and does not travel. Roma are usually found in small concentrated communities in settlements or towns throughout Estonia, apart from 2 of the 15 counties 284 . Other Information (including highlights of data gaps) Estonia does collect ethnically disaggregated data. There are insufficient data available for Roma, as they are not recognised as a national minority group. Other minority groups are included in the official data. It is thus assumed here that Roma are usually included within official data in \u2018other ethnic nationalities\u2019 or \u2018ethnic nationalities unknown \u2019 285 . Publication is scheduled for a report on population with native background on 21 June 2013; Health of the population on 30 June 2013 and households and families on 28 August 2013 286 . Whether Roma will be included as a minority is unclear. There is no information on the number and activities of Roma, and there are no separate data on the movement and citizenship of Roma in Estonia. However, a survey of sub-cultures is being conducted during 2012 \u2013 13, where Roma are one of the target groups. The results will illustrate how the target group cope in society as well as map the needs of Roma 287 . The national census is conducted online, as an e-census, where citizens can access and fill in the form themselves. Those who fail to partake may be interviewed at home, if previously agreed by enumerators. Data is collected in all 2,000 \u2018enumeration areas\u2019, overseen by supervisors in supervision areas (12). The head of each district (15) manages the conduct of the census 288 .

Mortality and Life Expectancy The study team has found no quantifications of this indicator. Anecdotal data and evidence cover the following: The general consensus is that Roma have lower life expectancy than the average population within Europe, which is due to inadequate living conditions such as extreme poverty and sub-standard housing 290 . Prevalence of Major Infectious Diseases The study team has found no quantifications of this indicator. Healthy Lifestyles and Related Behaviours The study team has found no quantifications of this indicator. Access and Use of Health Services and Prevention Programmes The study team has found no quantifications of this indicator, but there is some anecdotal evidence. According to the study on women in Estonian Roma communities undertaken by the Estonian government, Roma are covered by national health insurance and there were no reported problems in accessing health insurance. The study further found that Roma women did not seek medical assistance, although there are many different health concerns within Roma communities. It also found that women rarely went to the doctor for preventable purposes. Women showed little dissatisfaction with the compliance and work of doctors. However, they were often unable to purchase medicine due to lack of financial means 291 . Prevalence of Major Chronic Diseases The study team has found no quantifications of this indicator. Health Factors Related to the Role of Women in the Roma Community The study team has found no quantifications of this indicator. Anecdotal data and evidence cover the following: Economic difficulties have been reported in the majority of families where both parents are ethnic Roma. For many families, State support is very important as it provides a permanent source of income. A widely used option, even among young Roma women, is the pension for incapacity to work 292 . 289 Population and Housing Census (2013), PHC 2011 results.

        "Report on the health status of the Roma population in the EU and monitoring data collection in the area of Roma health in the Member States August, 2014 63 According to one study undertaken by the Estonian Institute of Humanities of Tallinn University (2007), awareness amongst Roma women regarding social benefits varies greatly 293 . This would suggest that there is a wide discrepancy amongst Roma women who access social benefits. Furthermore, inadequate housing and overcrowding have been reported to be acute problems for some Roma 294 . It is reported that most Roma women in Estonia earn their living through selling goods at the market and fortune telling as well as simple cleaning and kitchen work. Men are reported to earn their living by gathering scrap metal and auxiliary farm work as well as auxiliary work in workshops 295 . Environmental and other Socio-Economic Factors Due to prejudice and stereotyping, Roma continue to face discrimination in all spheres of society, in particular when it comes to health, housing and employment 296 . Education: Although there are no data concerning drop-out rates amongst Roma children, Estonian authorities have reported a high drop-out rate, as well as late entry into the education system for Roma children 297 . Furthermore, Roma children are often found in \u2018special needs\u2019 schools. This creates a further barrier to a future life as it provides Roma children with a second-class education as well as segregation from non-Roma children and society 298 . Data from the census of 2000 found that almost 50 % of Roma aged 18 and older lacked basic education. One third had completed basic education whereas even fewer had completed secondary school (15.6 %). Only one Roma was recorded as being in higher education 299 . According to the Ministry of Education and Research there were, at secondary level, 22 ethnic Roma studying in Estonian schools during the school year of 2011/2012. Five of these pupils were studying in \u2018special schools\u2019 and one pupil in the adult gymnasium 300 . 293 Tali, M., Kollom, K., Velberg, M.-L. 2007. Women in Estonian Roma Communities.

        "Report on the health status of the Roma population in the EU and monitoring data collection in the area of Roma health in the Member States August, 2014 64 According to a study conducted among Roma women in South Estonia, two main factors were highlighted explaining why Roma children are more likely to go to \u2018special needs\u2019 schools. Firstly, because of the lack of Estonian language skills and secondly for economic reasons; parents send their children to \u2018special schools\u2019 as they provide boarding 301 . Employment : It is said that Roma have high unemployment rates due to lack of knowledge of the Estonian language as well as lack of education 302 . According to data in one report, 30.2 % of Roma aged 18 and over were unemployed; 54.4 % were inactive in the labour market, while only 15.1 % of the Roma population were in employment 303 . The ECRI estimates that approximately 90 % of Roma are unemployed 304 . It is also noted that Roma do not register their unemployment officially, which affects their access to unemployment benefits and other social assistance. Of those Roma who do register, lack of education and local language skills prevent them from accessing social assistance, to which they are entitled 305 . Housing: There is no information on the housing situation of Roma in Estonia. The FRA has conducted research and produced National Focal Point Studies on the housing conditions of Roma and Travellers in 24 European countries. However, Estonia, together with Malta and Luxembourg, were excluded from the research because of the small numbers of Roma living in these countries. This in turn is an indicator of the lack of data on the housing situation of Roma in Estonia 306 . However, according to the Estonian Ministry of Culture, the housing situation for many Roma families is often of moderate nature. The report does not explain further what this description implies. However, a study on women in Estonian Roma communities reported that overcrowding, and in some cases very poor living standards were acute problems 307 . This would suggest that Roma often have sub-standard living conditions and that there are issues concerning the housing situation for Roma in Estonia.

        "Report on the health status of the Roma population in the EU and monitoring data collection in the area of Roma health in the Member States August, 2014 66 Country Profile: Finland Main Characteristics of the Roma in Finland Demography The Kale population comprises groups of Roma who arrived through Sweden as early as the 16 th Century. Russian immigrants in the 19 th Century merged with the Finnish Kale, strengthening the group of Finnish Roma. Kale in Finnish Romani language, Roma and the Finnish word Mustalainen all refer to the same group, the Finnish Roma 308 . They are Finnish citizens and were recognised as a traditional minority in Finland in the 1990s. It is the largest national minority in Finland 309 . Finnish Roma speak both Finnish and Romani, Romani being the original language. However, the majority today consider Finnish to be their mother-tongue, with fewer Roma speaking Romani. The Romani language has been identified as an endangered language in Finland and thus several policy recommendations have been made to preserve the language. Furthermore, Finnish Romani has been recognised by Finland as a traditional non-territorial minority language 310 . There are approximately 10 000 Roma in Finland. Roma make up 0.2 % of the total population in Finland. There are around 3 000 Finnish Roma living in Sweden. However, there are no official data on the number of Roma in Finland 311 . Therefore, estimates are based on the knowledge of various NGOs, studies and authorities\u2019 estimates and the Roma community 312 . There has been an increase of Roma asylum seekers from eastern Europe over the past few years. Between 4 000 and 5 000 requests have been filed between 1990 and 2004. The majority of applications however have usually been rejected 313 . The Directorate of Immigration has traditionally accepted few asylum applications. The majority of unsuccessful asylum seekers are rejected because the Directorate found no evidence of persecution or threat of persecution in their country of origin 314 . Roma migrants from Romania, Bulgaria and former Yugoslavia have arrived in recent years. Numbers are unavailable, however it has been estimated they are somewhere in the hundreds 315 . 308 \u00c5berg, K.

        "Report on the health status of the Roma population in the EU and monitoring data collection in the area of Roma health in the Member States August, 2014 67 Geographical distribution Although there are Roma communities throughout the country, the majority live in cities in western and southern Finland. More than 40 % inhabit the Province of Southern Finland 316 . Other Information (including highlights of data gaps) Finland does not collect ethnically disaggregated data. The Personal Data Act is enacted to protect private life and to safeguard rights when processing personal data. It is prohibited to process sensitive data, which includes amongst other data items, race or ethnic origin. However, data may be processed in cases where the subject has given consent or for statistical, scientific or historical purpose. Thus, there are insufficient official data concerning Roma in Finland, due to the protection of the Personal Data Act and because the ethnic definition of Roma is problematic 317 . The reason why the ethnic definition is deemed problematic is because interpretations on who is a member of the Roma community vary greatly. A broad definition based on self-identification is used in National Policy for example. A member of the Roma population is here defined as someone who identifies herself/himself as Roma, lives within the Roma community or is of Romani origin 318 . According to a report by the Ministry of Social Affairs and Health (2009) Roma usually have a weaker socio-economic and educational position when compared to other Finns 319 . Finland is one of the first countries to develop administrative structures of the policy of Roma. The National Board on Romani Affairs was founded in 1956 and monitors the development and improvement of the social situation of the Roma 320 . In June 2008 the City of Helsinki and the Helsinki Deaconess Institute initiated a project called the Rom po drom (the Roma in the Road) project. Its purpose was to document the living conditions of people who were begging, selling or performing on the streets, and to provide humanitarian assistance. 196 people were interviewed, out of whom 76 were women. The majority of respondents (around 90 %) were ethnic Roma, with most of them originating from Romania. The study found that they were living in tents often, as well as caravans and apartments.

The numbers of homeless Roma beggars were unreported 322 . There are numerous documents concerning Roma in Finland. However, few of them contain quantitative or qualitative data. Most documents concern the inclusion of Roma, such as policy documents and/or a focus on culture and history of Roma. There are insufficient data concerning Finnish Roma and health. Few documents or research studies report on migrant Roma. According to Eurodiaconia the concept of social inclusion of migrant Roma has not yet been understood or developed in Finland and is so far not a part of the political agenda 323 . There are no data concerning Roma\u2019s need for services and their allocation as well as the welfare and health of Roma 324 . Moreover, there are insufficient ethnically disaggregated data concerning: \uf0a7 Health and welfare; \uf0a7 Living conditions; \uf0a7 Housing conditions; \uf0a7 Employment. Due to the lack of data collection concerning Roma in Finland, this country research relies mostly on European (EU) and regional commissioned studies, non-formal sources, such as NGOs as well as academic literature, which mainly provide qualitative information and/or an analysis of secondary sources. Mortality and Life Expectancy The study team has found no quantifications of this indicator. Anecdotal data and evidence cover the following: It is estimated that Roma have lower life expectancy and higher mortality rates than the average population 325 .

        "Report on the health status of the Roma population in the EU and monitoring data collection in the area of Roma health in the Member States August, 2014 69 Access and Use of Health Services and Prevention Programmes Anecdotal data and evidence cover the following: Roma tend to use health services less than the general population. As Finnish citizens, Roma have the same entitlements to health care services as the rest of the population. However, linguistic and cultural differences, as well as lack of knowledge of their entitlements concerning welfare-related issues and available services are highlighted as factors which impede the access to health care services by Roma 326 . For example, a stoic outlook on illness is ingrained in Roma culture and according to their perceptions of cleanliness, Roma tend to regard hospitals as dirty and unhygienic places 327 . One study on the service needs of elderly Roma found that many were unaware of services that are available to them. Low levels of education and cultural barriers hindered the elderly population\u2019s access to public services. Services provided by the third sector were equally unused 328 . Homeless Roma who may not be in possession of a valid proof of identity tend to forgo the use of public services, saving a few euro a day but being ineligible to any health care treatments available 329 . Prevalence of Major Chronic Diseases It has been reported through the Ministry for Social Affairs that compared with the majority population, elderly Roma often have higher incidence of respiratory disease and diseases of the musculoskeletal system, such as rheumatic diseases and asthma. It is believed that poor housing, damp, cold and malnutrition contribute to the high incidence of these diseases in elderly Roma 330 . Another report revealed that there is a high rate of pulmonary and cardiovascular disease among Roma community. This was linked to either their genes or lifestyles, such as smoking, drinking and fatty food 331 . Health Factors Related to the Role of Women in the Roma Community The study team has found no quantifications of this indicator.

        "Report on the health status of the Roma population in the EU and monitoring data collection in the area of Roma health in the Member States August, 2014 70 According to the fifth periodic report of the government of Finland on the implementation of the Convention on the Elimination of all forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW), Roma women face discrimination predominantly in the availability of private services and in the labour market 332 . Female Roma also suffer health problems related to their traditional dress. The velvet skirt that Roma women often wear weighs between six and eight kilos and rests entirely on the waist causing strain on joints in the hips and legs and putting the back, respiratory and other internal organs at risk 333 . Environmental and other Socio-Economic Factors Education There is a general concern in regard to the low levels of education amongst Roma based on observations of the basic educational levels, the low participation and difficulties in accessing vocational training together with high levels of school drop- outs. Only 2 % of Roma children go to pre-school. This means that they are missing out on learning important language skills and coping mechanisms in order to fully engage in schoolwork at a later date 334 . Some Roma do successfully navigate the Finnish school system. It is worth noting however, that on average more ethnically Roma children struggle at school. This may be due to a poor socio-economic situation at home. For instance, the Office of the Ombudsman for Minorities handled 23 cases involving Roma children who were victims of violence or had received threats of violence 335 . Employment Unemployment rates are often higher for Roma than the rest of the population. This is usually a result of prejudices of employers and low educational attainment. Finnish Roma have the same entitlement to unemployment benefits and services as the rest of the population. However, less-educated Roma are often unable to access these services, due to a lack of knowledge of this complex welfare system. Some Roma are also suspicious of the authorities, believing they would do more harm than good 336 . Green European Foundation reports unemployment rates of Finnish Roma at 20 \u2013 50 % 337 . However, as young girls and women have pursued further educational attainment in the last few years, the employment situation for Roma women has been developing favourably 338 . 332 CEDAW (2003) The fifth periodic report of the government of Finland on the implementation of the Convention on the Elimination of all forms of Discrimination Against Women.

        "Report on the health status of the Roma population in the EU and monitoring data collection in the area of Roma health in the Member States August, 2014 71 A study on Roma and labour market participation (2008) reported that there were 1 471 Roma job-seekers in the client data system of the labour administration in 2008. This information was collected based on surname (family name) and does not represent the whole Roma population. However, within this group only 12 % had found jobs through the labour administration, whereas 61.5 % of this group were unemployed 339 . Housing In the 1970s, more than half of Roma lived in numerous inadequate housing conditions or were entirely homeless. Today, Roma are no longer homeless and their living conditions are to a large extent similar to the rest of the population. Nevertheless, the majority live in State-subsidised housing owned by the local authorities and only a few own their own property 340 . According to a report undertaken by the Ministry of the Interior (2008) the majority of Roma respondents were satisfied with the size of their apartment. 45 immigrants and 12 Roma living in the Helsinki metropolitan area were interviewed for the report. One of the issues highlighted was the feeling of discrimination when seeking housing. Respondents were of the opinion that they had to wait longer for a council flat or that the flat was in bad condition due to their ethnic background. Roma respondents were dissatisfied with the location and public services in the nearby area, or the conditions and size of the flat. The report also found that Roma preferred to be integrated into society, and saw authorities\u2019 attempts to house many Roma in the same neighbourhood as discriminatory and problematic 341 .

        "Report on the health status of the Roma population in the EU and monitoring data collection in the area of Roma health in the Member States August, 2014 73 Country Profile: France Main characteristics of the Roma in France 342 Demography In 2010, it was estimated that 15 000 to 20 000 sedentary Roma lived in France, mostly from Bulgaria and Romania 343 344 . These European citizens mainly originate from the Balkans and Central and Eastern Europe. Most of them speak Romani ( romani chib ) They are divided into sub-groups and aren\u2019t a united group. In the Balkans, there are also groups who regard themselves as Roma, but do not speak Romani. These include the Boyash (Beash, Bayash, Banyash, Baiesi or Rudari, depending on the country) whose language derives from Romanian. In France (in particular Alsace), this group is known as \u2018Manouches\u2019 which stems from the Romani word meaning human being . Counter to common belief, 90 % of Roma in Europe are sedentary 345 . In European countries where nomads are the most numerous, as in France, two thirds are sedentary and semi-sedentary; they are nomadic during certain periods for work, family or religious festivities, or as a result of evictions 346 . In contrast, Gens du voyage , which is used in Europe rather than in France, is an administrative term which is also applied to non-Roma groups, mostly of French nationality, with itinerant lifestyles, due to their jobs, interests and so on. It thus covers the various branches of Roma (Roma, Sinti/Manush, Kale/Gypsies, whose ancestors came from northern India), but other communities as well. For the purpose of this report, we will separate the Gens du voyage situations from that of the Roma. Romani people and specially women, in Europe, face a significant amount of discrimination, based on their ethnicity and their gender. This negatively impacts all areas of their daily life, including housing, health care, employment, education, political or civic participation and family relationships. Furthermore, they have often been victims of human rights violations: trafficking, racially motivated violence, hate crimes and coercive sterilisation, in the past century. Geographical distribution In 2010, approximately 5 000 Roma lived in the Paris Region of Ile-de-France, about half of them in Seine-Saint-Denis county north of Paris 347 . Likewise, Roma live mostly in the outskirts of major French cities, such as Lyon, Marseille, Bordeaux, Toulouse, Nantes, Strasbourg or Lille, and in middle-sized cities. M\u00e9decins du Monde provides long-term medical and social support for Roma in the 342 In particular beneficiaries of M\u00e9decins du Monde (MdM) programmes for Roma in France. 343 Romeurope (2012), Les Roms, boucs-\u00e9missaires d\u2019une politique s\u00e9curitaire qui cible les migrants et les pauvres Rapport 2010\u201311 Collectif National Droits de l\u2019Homme Romeurope, p. 30. 344 Amnesty International (2013), Facts of shame.

Point interventions have also taken place in Aix-en-Provence, Grenoble, Valenciennes, Montpellier, Nancy and Toulouse 348 . Other Information In France, non-profit organisations such as the FNASAT Association ( F\u00e9d\u00e9ration nationale des associations solidaires d'action avec les Tsiganes et les Gens du voyage ) and M\u00e9decins du Monde collect most of the Roma health-related data. Consequently, data availability is limited and refers to specific projects. In 2011, 2 766 Roma sought care with physicians from MdM Roma programmes. Roma have a young population structure: in 2011, the average age of the beneficiaries of MdM Roma programme was 22.06 years old for women (median = 20.95) and 18.82 years for men (median = 12.73). At that time, 48.6 % of Roma beneficiaries were under 18 years old 349 . More women than men seek support from MdM Roma programmes \u2014 57.8 % compared to 42.2 %, respectively. It should be noticed that women in general tend to seek medical care more often than men; including for pregnancy care or accompanying sick children. \uf0a7 According to our research, there are no recent data on Roma in France in the areas 350 of domestic violence, teenage pregnancies, alcohol consumption, drug consumption, tobacco use or mental disorders. \uf0a7 M\u00e9decins du Monde systematically collects data on reasons for visit and diagnosis, as well as socio-demographic indicators, using a standardised social and medical questionnaire for every patient coming to the walk-in centres. These social and medical records are analysed by M\u00e9decins du Monde\u2019s Observatory of Access to Health Care 351 . It must be noted that those visiting the walk-in centres are unwell, thus some diseases might be overrepresented, or misrepresented in the case of Roma unable to seek care elsewhere. \uf0a7 Mother and Child Protection ( Protection maternelle et infantile \u2014 PMI ) is a free health service with the mission to provide follow-up for pregnant women in the last six months of their pregnancies and child health maintenance until the child reaches the age of 6. PMI is also responsible for family planning and education, especially for low-resource families living in hardship conditions. Roma usually refer back to the common Health Law: PMI, to take care of their children. \uf0a7 Moreover, the PMI gives particular attention to the risks of child abuse, linked with the \u2018 Aide sociale \u00e0 l'enfance \u2019 (ASE/ Social assistance to childhood). Mortality and Life Expectancy There is no data on mortality and life expectancy. 348 M\u00e9decins du Monde (2011), Parias, les Roms en France, Dossier de Presse, p. 15. 349 M\u00e9decins du Monde (2012), Actions mobiles aupr\u00e8s des Roms, 2011, not published. 350 Halfen, S.

        "Report on the health status of the Roma population in the EU and monitoring data collection in the area of Roma health in the Member States August, 2014 75 Prevalence of Major Infectious Diseases There are only restricted data available on the prevalence of major infectious diseases among Roma in France in general, and among beneficiaries of M\u00e9decins du Monde Roma programmes. However, there is data to conclude that Roma are more vulnerable to airborne pathogens that thrive in closed, crowded spaces: diphtheria, pertussis or whooping cough, and invasive pneumococcal infections \u2014 despite these being preventable through immunisation. Tuberculosis In 2011, a total of 2 766 Roma patients made 4 303 medical visits at M\u00e9decins du Monde, and there were 19 diagnosis of TB, representing 2.7 % of all visits 352 . In Seine-Saint-Denis, north of Paris, M\u00e9decins du Monde Health Care and Guidance Centre (Caso) offer chest X-rays once a week. In 2011, 257 Romanians (almost exclusively all Roma) had a chest X-ray, of which two were diagnosed with tuberculosis (no prevalence should be calculated from this figure). Seine-Saint-Denis has a very high prevalence of TB, 30/100 000 compared to 8.2/100 000 in France as a whole in 2011 353 . Thus, Roma living in Seine-Saint-Denis have a higher risk of exposure to the Koch bacillus 354 . Moreover, in addition to a very low coverage of the BCG (Bacillus Calmette\u2013Gu\u00e9rin) vaccine among Roma in France (38.9 % in 2010 in under 30-year-olds 355 ), poor living conditions that favour the spread of tuberculosis, a high prevalence of the disease among Roma in Eastern Europe, and low access to prevention and health care in France all add up to an easy spread of TB among Roma 356 357 . Roma in France often settle in vacant plots or squats and are often evicted or face compulsory departure from French territory. For those few who have been diagnosed and are being treated for TB, the lack of a permanent home imposed by evictions prevents them from being treated by the same doctors or from being followed-up at all. This is an important barrier to a continuous access to treatment. Furthermore, a lack of knowledge within the Roma community often makes TB a stigmatised topic, which makes it all the more important to have a certain continuity in a holistic follow- up that also includes psycho-social interventions. It has also been reported that, because of the instability of their living place, Roma detected with TB are frequently not offered treatment. Indeed, health care professionals fear they might stop the treatment and in doing so accelerate the development of multi-resistant tuberculosis. Instead of temporarily postponing treatment until durable solutions for the access to health care are found, they create a major inequality in the access to health care of Roma 358 . Moreover, evictions force Roma to seek new settlements, sometimes in vacant plots or 352 M\u00e9decins du Monde (2012), Actions mobiles aupr\u00e8s des Roms, 2011, not published. 353 Rapport de l\u2019observatoire de l\u2019acc\u00e8s aux soins, (2011), M\u00e9decins du Monde. 354 M\u00e9decins du Monde (2011), La Mission Banlieue: Rapport d\u2019activit\u00e9, p. 198. 355 M\u00e9decins du Monde (2011), Rapport d\u2019enqu\u00eate sur la couverture vaccinale des populations roms rencontr\u00e9es par les \u00e9quipes de M\u00e9decins du Monde en France, Rapport de la Direction des Missions France, p. 22. 356 M\u00e9decins du Monde (2012), Actions mobiles aupr\u00e8s des Roms, 2011, not published. 357 Halfen, S.

Similarly, during compulsory departures to Romania and Bulgaria, Roma are put into buses, in an enclosed space that favours transmission, travelling for days, thus increasing the epidemic risk 359 . Measles In visits of Roma patients to MdM Roma programmes in 2011, measles was diagnosed in 35 cases (2.3 %) where there was a diagnosis of a short-term health condition 360 . The 2010 vaccination survey conducted by MdM found that only 50.9 % of Roma under 30 years old had been vaccinated against measles, mumps and rubella 361 , whereas the European target for eradication of measles as defined by WHO/ECDC and the achievement of herd immunity is only reached at a vaccination coverage of 95 % with two vaccine doses. According to the WHO, the average measles vaccination coverage (MMR 1) for the general population is at 89 %; this rate quickly drops for the second MMR injection (only 67 %). Between 2008 and late 2011, France experienced a measles outbreak. In 2011, 15 000 measles cases were diagnosed, among them 1 008 with severe pneumopathy, 26 with neurologic complications and 10 recorded deaths 362 . This major outbreak led MdM to launch a vaccination campaign with local government health institutions in Seine-Saint-Denis, where 288 measles cases were diagnosed in 2011, compared to 79 in 2010 and 38 in 2009. In the 13 settlements where MdM was responsible for the vaccination, 250 persons received a measles vaccine injection 363 . The same vaccination campaign took place in Roma settlements in Marseille, without the participation of local health authorities. In the city of Marseille, 2 565 measles cases were notified between January and June 2011, as opposed to 497 cases in 2010 and 44 cases in 2009. During the MdM campaign, 326 Roma were vaccinated, representing only 45.3 % of the target population 364 . The high vaccination figures both in Marseille and Seine-Saint-Denis reveal the lack of immunisation coverage among Roma in France. Vaccination among Roma will be further discussed in a later section of this country report. Hepatitis A Several hepatitis A outbreaks have been described across Europe in communities with poor access to water and sanitation. In France, a community hepatitis A outbreak involved a total of 492 cases over the 2008\u201309 period, including eight clusters of cases among communities living in sites with poor sanitation 365 . 359 M\u00e9decins du Monde (2011), La Mission Banlieue : Rapport d\u2019activit\u00e9. 360 M\u00e9decins du Monde (2012), Actions mobiles aupr\u00e8s des Roms, 2011, not published. 361 M\u00e9decins du Monde (2011), Rapport d\u2019enqu\u00eate sur la couverture vaccinale des populations roms rencontr\u00e9es par les \u00e9quipes de M\u00e9decins du Monde en France, Rapport de la Direction des Missions France. 362 Laurence, S., Chappuis, M., Rodier, P., Labaume, C., Corty, J-F.

        "Report on the health status of the Roma population in the EU and monitoring data collection in the area of Roma health in the Member States August, 2014 77 Healthy Lifestyles and Related Behaviours Roma communities in France frequently live on vacant lands or squats without access to drinking water or water supply, toilets, sewage and waste management, and with overall low sanitary and living conditions. In 2011, 47.5 % of Roma coming to MdM Roma health programmes had lived in a shed or hut in the 30 days prior to the visit, 19.8 % in caravans, 11.1 % in converted squats, 8.8 % in empty squats, 6.1 % in tents and 3.3 % were homeless 366 . Moreover, Roma are often evicted from the vacant plots or squats they live in, forcing them to seek out new places to resettle, often in worse conditions than the previous settlement. The accumulation of waste and the lack of sewage are major problems in most settlements, exposing their inhabitants to infections. Nutrition and acute infections As a result of inadequate housing conditions, it is common for Roma to have health problems such as dermatitis (psoriasis and acariosis account for 7.8 % of short-term health problems diagnosed in 2011) and gastric complaints (among the short-term health problems diagnosed in 2011: gastric troubles, 4.2 %, worms and parasites, 4.2 %, gastroenteritis, 3.3 %, other gastric infections, 0.7 %) 367 . The lack of water to drink, cook or wash cooking utensils \u2014 in addition to limited resources to buy food in a state suitable for consumption and the fact that Roma do not dispose of any cooking utilities \u2014 hinder many Roma from having a decent and healthy diet. Indeed, among the Roma who sought care with MdM in 2011, 7.4 % of those with a chronic health condition were obese. Among those with short-term health problems, 0.3 % was overweight 368 . We do not have data on malnutrition but, as stated before, many Roma are unable to have a healthy diet or may even undergo difficulties accessing any food on a regular basis. MdM does not have records on alcohol, tobacco or illicit drug use among Roma beneficiaries. Access and Use of Health Services and Prevention Programmes Barriers to access health care The repeated evictions and compulsory removals of Roma from their settlements \u2014 even in winter \u2014 and from the French territory, constitute major barriers to effective health care access and make it challenging for the communities to settle and stabilise. The current French legislation and the European transitory measures concerning Romanians and Bulgarians are the primary causes for this situation. Although both countries joined the European Union in 2007, their nationals are only allowed to stay in France for over three months if they either hold either a valid work permit or prove to have enough funds to live in France without being a burden to the French social security system, which means subscribing to private health insurance 369 370 371 372 373 . 366 M\u00e9decins du Monde (2012), Actions mobiles aupr\u00e8s des Roms, 2011, not published. 367 Ibid. 368 M\u00e9decins du Monde (2012), Actions mobiles aupr\u00e8s des Roms, 2011, not published. 369 Romeurope (2012), \u2018Les Roms, boucs-\u00e9missaires d\u2019une politique s\u00e9curitaire qui cible les migrants et les pauvres\u2019, Rapport 2010\u201311, Collectif National Droits de l\u2019Homme Romeurope, p. 30. 370 Amnesty International (2013), \u2018Facts of shame.

        "Report on the health status of the Roma population in the EU and monitoring data collection in the area of Roma health in the Member States August, 2014 78 After this three-month period the right to further reside becomes subject to conditions: \uf0a7 Either the person is engaged in an economic activity (on an employed or self- employed basis); \uf0a7 Either the person has \u2018sufficient resources\u2019 and sickness insurance \u2018to ensure that they do not become a burden on the social services of the host Member State during their stay\u2019. These evictions have major negative consequences on Roma\u2019s health, on their eligibility for social health protection, and thus on their access to health services and effective use of health care 374 375 . The instability resulting from evictions and compulsory departures is a further barrier to accessing social health protection and health care as the administrative steps required for social health protection and the links with health professionals are broken. Families and groups are dispersed by evictions and compulsory departures. Since 2011, the number of Roma compulsorily removed from the French territory and returned to Romania or Bulgaria by the French government has increased. It is estimated that two thirds of Roma living in France have already been compulsorily removed, with most coming back to France in the following months 376 . According to Amnesty International, in 2012 11 803 evictions were carried out in Roma informal settlements, 80 % of them estimated to be forced evictions 377 . Evictions lead to interruption of treatment, as people must leave the settlements as quickly as possible and can lose personal documents such as health records, prescriptions, medicines or the addresses of health care facilities. As stated before, stopping treatment can lead to resistance to treatment for patients with chronic diseases or infections like tuberculosis. Evictions have also taken place while immunisation campaigns were being carried out, making it harder to lead preventative actions and tackle epidemics as the measles epidemic in France during 2008\u201311 378 379 380 . Because of repeated evictions from their living place, Roma are further isolated from the health care system and other public services. Housing instability hinders the 371 Halfen, S.

The instability and stigmatisation of Roma also makes it difficult for them to learn French, as the majority have not attended school as a result of evictions. Only a minority of Roma women reached by a health mediation pilot project was able to express themselves in French and fewer were able to read and write in French 382 . Social Health Protection Another barrier to the access to health care is the current legislation concerning Social Health Protection. The Aide Medicale d\u2019Etat (AME) is a free-of-charge social health protection granted to legal or illegal immigrants who can justify residence in France for an uninterrupted period of over three months and lack financial resources to pay for health care. Asking for AME is a bureaucratic process, especially for non-French speakers without knowledge of French social and health care and for those unable to prove their domicile, revenues or the time spent in French territory since their arrival 383 . Proof of a lack of financial resources is a delicate issue, as Bulgarians and Romanians are only able to stay in France for more than three months if they hold a work permit, which most Roma do not; nationals from both countries can only be hired for the 291 categories of low-wage jobs approved in France 384 385 386 387 and usually have informal jobs. Once one is granted AME, he or she needs to complete the same paperwork annually in order to renew his/her coverage for another year. The lack of a registered address accounted for the majority of refusals for Romanians and Bulgarians in 2011, who also undergo difficulties in renewing their AME for the same reason 388 . In 2011, among the patients of MdM Roma programmes, 22.6 % were not entitled to health coverage because they had been living in France for less than three months at the time. Many of those could have been living in France for years and have been compulsorily returned to their country of origin by French authorities or have travelled voluntarily, losing their possibility to ask for health care for three months when they returned 389 390 . Therefore of the 77.4 % Roma entitled to get AME health coverage among MdM beneficiaries, only 14.10 % had actually received it 391 . 85.2 % of Roma beneficiaries of MdM programmes had no health coverage at the time of the visit. The figure is even higher for minors: 87.5 % of those under 18 years old did not have any kind of social health protection.

The consequence is that Roma without AME cannot go to health care facilities or seek general practitioners without paying. Even for those who have AME, regular visits to physicians can be difficult, since there are reports of general practitioners and hospitals that refuse AME beneficiaries 393 both Roma and non-Roma. Furthermore, Roma lack information on where to seek medical care and are often not aware of their rights as AME beneficiaries 394 395 . In 2011, 82.5 % of Roma patients declared having given up the search for health care in the last 12 months. Because they lack health care coverage and general knowledge of health care facilities, Roma only get health attention when symptoms become very debilitating. Indeed, MdM doctors stated that 54.4 % of the health problems seen in surgery in 2011 should have been treated earlier 396 . Health Mediation Health mediation between Roma and health care facilities is a tool to address the lack of information and the barriers to access health care. The MdM Roma mission in Nantes and other associations working with Roma in Lille and the Parisian outskirts have participated in a 24-month pilot programme of health mediation 397 398 . This pilot programme has been positively evaluated and has illustrated that health mediation is a useful method for closing the gap between the Roma and the health care system in France. Mediation professionals speak both Romanian and French but have a larger scope of action than just translation: they are linked to a network of social workers and health care professionals and notify these actors on social factors (housing, living conditions, marginalisation and education) and barriers to the access of Roma to the institutions. Interventions took place among Roma to inform and help them acquire AME, accompany them to a doctor's surgery and carry out health education interventions. Interventions also took place among practitioners and staff of health care facilities in order to increase their awareness of Roma health issues, clarify the barriers to access health care and how to avoid stigmatising this population 399 . The pilot programme was focused on mother and child health, but families also benefited from the mediators\u2019 actions. After the mediators\u2019 intervention 86 % of Roma women participating in the programme had acquired AME, whereas only 37 % had AME at the beginning of the programme. Consequently, there was an increase in the frequency of medical visits per 100 persons, from 22 % to 57 %. Moreover, 40 % of the visits at the end of the 18-month pilot programme were obtained by Roma women alone. The mediators\u2019 action had thus helped them to achieve autonomy of their 392 Ibid. 393 ASAV, AREAS, M\u00e9decins du Monde, Romeurope, (2012), Projet de M\u00e9diation sant\u00e9 en direction de femmes et jeunes enfants Roms, Rapport final, p. 59. 394 M\u00e9decins du Monde (2012), Rapport 2011 de l\u2019Observatoire de l\u2019Acc\u00e8s aux Soins de la Mission France, p. 215. 395 M\u00e9decins du Monde (2008), M\u00e9decins du Monde aupr\u00e8s des femmes Roms, p. 8. 396 M\u00e9decins du Monde (2012), Actions mobiles aupr\u00e8s des Roms, 2011, not published. 397 M\u00e9decins du Monde (2012), Rapport 2011 de l\u2019Observatoire de l\u2019Acc\u00e8s aux Soins de la Mission France, p. 215. 398 ASAV, AREAS, M\u00e9decins du Monde, Romeurope, (2012) Projet de M\u00e9diation sant\u00e9 en direction de femmes et jeunes enfants Roms, Rapport final, p. 59. 399 Ibid.

Several positive impacts were noted by the mediator\u2019s action: at the beginning of the programme, 16 % of Roma needing health care had not been to a doctor's surgery, and at the 18-month evaluation report this figure had dropped to only 9 %, with other barriers to access health care also overcome: lack of AME, Roma\u2019s fear of not being understood by practitioners and transport issues 401 . The mediator could also support health institutions to visit the areas where Roma live to promote services, such as vaccination campaigns 402 403 404 . Immunisation In 2010 a survey was conducted in three M\u00e9decins du Monde Roma programmes to evaluate the vaccination coverage among Roma under the age of 30. It showed that the vaccination coverage among Roma reached by M\u00e9decins du Monde teams was insufficient for all of the mandatory and highly recommended vaccines on the French vaccination schedule 405 . The results from this survey confirmed that although the majority of Roma were vaccinated at some point in their life course, it was very difficult to confirm this. Less than half of the respondents (38.5 %) had a health record or any document showing they had been vaccinated and for which diseases. Interviewers assessed that only 19.4 % of those who had an immunisation record were up-to-date on the recommended or mandatory vaccines schedule in France 406 . Among those who had immunisation records, vaccination coverage was globally satisfactory, but still below the national French objective of 95 % coverage for the only mandatory vaccine DTP at 84.3 %. It is to be noted that in France, the \u2018P\u2019 in DTP stands for polio and not for whooping cough (a cellular Pertussis) as in the rest of Europe. Moreover, DTP vaccination coverage was lower for children under two years old. Vaccination coverage was even lower for other vaccines such as BCG (38.9 %), measles, mumps and rubella (50.9 %), hepatitis B (43.5 %) and whooping cough (70.4 %) 407 . Many respondents declared having been vaccinated in their home countries, particularly for mandatory vaccines at birth. But since coming to France, they had had little or no access to vaccines, which led to incomplete vaccination coverage for those requiring boosters 408 . 400 Ibid. 401 Ibid. 402 M\u00e9decins du Monde (2011), Rapport d\u2019enqu\u00eate sur la couverture vaccinale des populations roms rencontr\u00e9es par les \u00e9quipes de M\u00e9decins du Monde en France, Rapport de la Direction des Missions France, p. 22. 403 Laurence S., Chappuis M, Lucas D., Duteutre M., Corty J-F., Campagne de vaccination rougeole des populations pr\u00e9caires: retour d\u2019exp\u00e9rience, (submitted for publication). 404 ASAV, AREAS, M\u00e9decins du Monde, Romeurope, (2012) Projet de M\u00e9diation sant\u00e9 en direction de femmes et jeunes enfants Roms, Rapport final, p. 59. 405 M\u00e9decins du Monde (2011), Rapport d\u2019enqu\u00eate sur la couverture vaccinale des populations roms rencontr\u00e9es par les \u00e9quipes de M\u00e9decins du Monde en France, Rapport de la Direction des Missions France, p. 22. 406 M\u00e9decins du Monde (2011), Rapport d\u2019enqu\u00eate sur la couverture vaccinale des populations roms rencontr\u00e9es par les \u00e9quipes de M\u00e9decins du Monde en France, Rapport de la Direction des Missions France, p. 22. 407 Ibid. 408 Ibid.

        "Report on the health status of the Roma population in the EU and monitoring data collection in the area of Roma health in the Member States August, 2014 82 Children followed in Mother and Child Protection health care facilities (PMI) or attending school are better protected and covered by vaccines, but only 52.7 % of school-age Roma children were effectively attending classes and only one third of children under six years old (30.2 %) were effectively being followed in PMI. The main reason for non-vaccination was the lack of information; most Roma do not know where to go, often ignore that boosters are necessary or the number of injections needed to achieve effective immunisation and/or doubt the utility of vaccines. It should be noted that these families were known and followed by M\u00e9decins du Monde and had already had prevention talks, medical visits and follow-up. According to the Mediation Project Evaluation report, before the mediators\u2019 action, only 36 % of children in Roma communities reached by the project had a health record and only 13 % a vaccine record. After the mediators\u2019 intervention, 98 % of children had a health record including vaccine records. During the project the vaccination coverage for all vaccines increased to 61 % for BCG (10 % before), 73 % for measles, mumps and rubella (28 % before), 68 % for hepatitis B (15 % before), 72 % for whooping cough (70.4 % before), 77 % for DTP (17 % before) and 80 % for tetanus (25 % before). Although vaccine coverage increased, the mediators identified other barriers after informing the families about vaccines, mostly due to the fear of vaccines and their side effects (fever, pain, etc.) 409 . The low vaccine coverage and the identified barriers call for adapted prevention and vaccination strategies, particularly partnerships with the public health care facilities involved (PMI, vaccination centres). Awareness and mediation promotion must be achieved through information, explanations, persuasion, verifying that the messages are understood and facilitating the access to services, rights and general practitioners 410 411 412 413 .

        "Report on the health status of the Roma population in the EU and monitoring data collection in the area of Roma health in the Member States August, 2014 83 Prevalence of Major Chronic Diseases M\u00e9decins du Monde cannot establish the prevalence of chronic diseases within the Roma population because it only has data on Roma who sought physicians of MdM programmes. In 2011, 32.6 % of patients seen in a doctor's surgery had a chronic health problem or disease 417 . Chronic diseases are often related to Roma living conditions and lack of health education. As stated before on mediation, because of the barriers to health care access and the evictions, Roma do not have access to adapted prevention for chronic diseases explained in their language. Without prevention and regular medical follow up, and considering the sub-optimal conditions they experience, Roma who suffer from chronic diseases are likely not to be diagnosed or to be diagnosed at a late stage. Once diagnosed, they have fewer chances to be followed by a general practitioner and to get periodic control exams or treatment. With the delays in the follow-up, chronic diseases get worse, consequently leading to the worsening of the global health status of the patients 418 419 420 . Among the chronic health problems diagnosed during consultations with MdM Roma programmes in 2011, there were 12.9 % non-complicated hypertension, 7.4 % obesity, 3.6 % non-insulin-dependent diabetes, 2.7 % tuberculosis, 1.1 % insulin- dependent diabetes, 0.9 % complicated hypertension 421 . As MdM doctors usually see Roma patients 1.56 times per patient, it is difficult for them to diagnose a chronic disease. Moreover, MdM services are not intended to replace the French health care system. Every patient seen by MdM is orientated to get Social Health Protection and with it access the local health care facilities or visit general practitioners: Therefore, MdM seldom diagnoses chronic diseases among its patients and does not have the means to follow-up or treat patients with chronic diseases. Health Factors Related to the Role of Women in the Roma Community Self-Reported Health The FRA gender study found that poor health was a significant problem for the female Roma population. 10 % of non-Roma women aged 16+ reported to be in bad health compared to 19 % of Roma women. This trend worsened higher up the population pyramid with 14 % of non-Roma women above 50 reporting bad health and a staggering 47 % of Roma women in this age cohort describing their condition as in bad health 422 . It is worth noting that in general, the Roma community concern themselves less with health issues. As a consequence, these inequalities may be an underestimate. 417 M\u00e9decins du Monde (2012), Actions mobiles aupr\u00e8s des Roms, 2011, not published. 418 Halfen, S.

        "Report on the health status of the Roma population in the EU and monitoring data collection in the area of Roma health in the Member States August, 2014 84 Contraception The lack of information and the difficulties of access to family planning services account for the low rates of contraception coverage: in 2008, only 10 % of the women surveyed were using a birth control method 423 . In 2011, only 26.9 % of women between 12 and 49 years old and coming to MdM for care were using contraception. The same year, 67.90 % of Roma women between 12 and 49 years old had never used contraception 424 . Although there is a demand for information about contraception, it has been noticed that Roma women have a modest attitude concerning sexual issues and gynaecological examinations 425 426 . Because of the lack of information on contraception, Roma women might resort to abortion when a pregnancy is unwanted 427 . In 2011, 19 % of pregnant women coming to MdM wanted to have an abortion 428 . 43.3 % of Roma women coming to MdM had had an abortion (the average age was 22 years old) without follow-up for infections or haemorrhages, a fact that can make them vulnerable regarding their health. In 2011, 36.1 % of Roma women who came to MdM Roma programmes had had at least one abortion. Among these, the average number of abortions per woman was 5.20 429 . Mediation has been found to be an efficient strategy to address the lack of information on contraception. In communities where mediation was introduced, the level of awareness of Roma women as to where to obtain contraception rose from 17 % to 65 %, and finally reached 89 % at the end of 18 months of mediation 430 . Almost half of the women followed by mediators (43 %) started using contraception during the project and all went to a public health facility in order to obtain it. These behaviour changes were considered very positive compared to the low figures of women aware where to obtain contraception at the beginning of the project. It also provided evidence that the implementation of mediation among women in Roma communities can have a positive impact 431 . Pre-natal Care and pregnancies According to the Mediation Evaluation Report, women in the settlements where the mediation project was carried out had on average three children. One third of the women with children under six years old were below 23 years old, and two thirds were younger than 31 years old. Around 25 % of them had their first child before they were 18 years old, the legal majority age in France 432 . In 2008, MdM conducted a survey among Roma beneficiaries of a pre-natal programme that provides information and follow-up of Roma pregnant women to local hospitals for pre-natal care 433 . Although pre-natal care in France is free and delivered in specific Mother and Child Protection health care facilities (PMI), for those without 423 M\u00e9decins du Monde (2008), M\u00e9decins du Monde aupr\u00e8s des femmes Roms, p. 8. 424 M\u00e9decins du Monde (2012), Actions mobiles aupr\u00e8s des Roms, 2011, not published. 425 Halfen, S.

Consequently, the MdM has documented miscarriages, in-uterus foetal deaths and many other preventable complications related to pregnancies 434 435 . In 2011, 50 % of pregnant women who came to MdM Roma programmes were not being followed during their pregnancy. 70.8 % of them had a pregnancy follow-up delay as they had been pregnant for more than 12 weeks without any care 436 . Among the 12.7 % of Roma women who had already had at least one miscarriage in 2011, there were the average was 1.88 miscarriages per woman. Among the 6.3 % of Roma women who had at least one stillborn baby, the average was 1.44 stillborn babies per woman 437 . On average, only two out of four pregnancies result in a living infant among Roma women 438 . The absence of pre-natal care is also a matter for concern since Roma women tend to have their first child at a very young age, 17 years on average in the 2008 survey (this average age has been confirmed again in the 2011 survey). It should be noted that the average age of the population in both surveys was 22 years old 439 440 . For the 8.3 % of pregnant women who actually receive PMI, they seldom complete pre-natal care due to evictions that force them to move away further from the health care facility where they were being monitored and treated. Stress from the fear of evictions, identity checks and the experience of living and coping in informal settlements without water, electricity or sanitation also result in higher proportions of women not able to access pre-natal care 441 442 . In the settlements where mediation has taken place, there was an improvement in the number of follow-ups of pregnancies. At the beginning of the mediation project, none of the pregnant women were being monitored during their pregnancy. After 18 months of mediation of the Roma women, most pregnant women started their pre-natal care between the second and third month of pregnancy, having regular visits at medical facilities and ultrasound scans. Any delays in the follow-up were mostly due to an instable living situation as a result of repeated evictions 443 . Cancer Screening The mediation pilot project carried out found that only 23 % of Roma women reached by the mediators had had a Pap smear prior to the implementation of the mediation project. After the 18 months of mediation action, 42 % had undertaken the screening (although the age of these women was not specified). As for breast cancer screening, 434 Ibid. 435 M\u00e9decins du Monde (1999), Donn\u00e9es m\u00e9dicales et socio-d\u00e9mographiques: les populations Roms/ Tsiganes migrantes en situation de grande exclusion dans trois pays d\u2019Europe.

        "Report on the health status of the Roma population in the EU and monitoring data collection in the area of Roma health in the Member States August, 2014 86 only one 55-year-old woman had a mammogram during the project after receiving information on breast cancer prevention 444 . Environmental and other Socio-Economic Factors Living conditions and housing In France, Roma communities usually settle in vacant plots or abandoned fields surrounding urban or industrial areas. 84 % of Roma live in \u2018deprived\u2019 housing conditions compared to just 2 % of the non-Roma population 445 . They live there because they lack the financial resources to pay for decent housing, a consequence of the barriers to employment, and because they lack access to social housing from the government, mostly on the grounds that they are undocumented migrants 446 447 448 . In the last 10 to 15 years, the main policy towards these settlements has been to evict the inhabitants using police force, without resettlement proposals. Although a recent government circular of August 2012 determined otherwise, it is seldom applied by local public officials. Moreover, the current French Minister of Interior, Manuel Valls, publicly confirmed in March 2013 that the policy of evicting informal Romany settlements will be pursued, without clarifying how safeguards against forced evictions will be implemented 449 . Roma are thus forced to move to other vacant plots, usually worse than the previous one 450 451 . As stated before, the instability imposed by evictions can prevent Roma from treating health problems and receiving health care coverage Roma communities therefore experience extremely poor and unhealthy life conditions: they live in shanty towns or squats, in dilapidated caravans or in sheds without water or electricity, lacking privacy, overcrowded and lacking appropriate heating and ventilation. The lack of drinking water, toilets, sewage systems and waste management in most vacant lands and squats in which they settle generate hygiene issues alongside potentially harmful dermatologic and digestive pathologies (infectious dermatitis, infected wounds, intestinal parasites, diarrhoea...) as previously stated. The squats and shanty towns also present numerous dangers for their inhabitants: fire and collapsing risks, respiratory intoxications and lead poisoning, etc. These precarious life conditions also expose Roma populations to high epidemic risks of tuberculosis, whooping cough, measles, rats and other pests 452 . Decent housing for Roma communities and halting evictions are major demands from associations reaching Roma. Addressing this issue would greatly contribute to improving Roma\u2019s health as it would stop illnesses due to the unhealthy living conditions in the settlements. Access to housing and work would also contribute to 444 ASAV, AREAS, M\u00e9decins du Monde, Romeurope, (2012), Projet de M\u00e9diation sant\u00e9 en direction de femmes et jeunes enfants Roms, Rapport final, p. 59. 445 FRA, (2013), \u2018Analysis of FRA Roma Survey Results by Gender\u2019, p. 20. 446 Romeurope (2012), \u2018Les Roms, boucs-\u00e9missaires d\u2019une politique s\u00e9curitaire qui cible les migrants et les pauvres\u2019, Rapport 2010\u201311 Collectif National Droits de l\u2019Homme Romeurope, p. 30. 447 Amnesty International (2013), \u2018Facts of shame.

Legal Status and Employment Employments rates are only about 13 % for Roma aged 20 to 64 years old versus 62 % for non-Roma in France. The current French law requires the possession of a work permit for Bulgarians and Romanians in order to stay in French territory for more than three months. These measures are real barriers to employment in France, This is in stark contrast to the non-Roma surveyed, who report much higher employment rates: in most EU Member States, Romas are unemployed, at least, more than double the number of the non-Roma. Most Roma prefer to consider themselves as self- employed across France (above 20 %), according to an FRA survey in 2012 454 . The FRA gender-based report on Roma living in Europe points to a discrepancy between female and male employment figures. 49 % of males reported being in paid work (significantly below the non-Roma average) and just 10 % of Roma females reported being in employment. Roma are still a traditional people and as a result, Roma women tend to classify themselves as home-makers 455 . Although Romania and Bulgaria joined the European Union in 2007, Roma from these two countries and Roma from non-EU member countries (Balkans) are not allowed to work in France without a work permit paid for by their employer 456 457 458 . Since Roma mostly do low wage jobs that demand few qualifications, the sum for the work permit is almost equivalent to a month\u2019s wage (from EUR 70 to EUR 300 for a work contract of less than a year, 50 % of the wage for work contracts of one year or more 459 . This obligation makes it very expensive to hire Roma, discouraging employers from doing so and therefore contributes to excluding Roma from employment 460 461 . Work permit requirements for Romanians and Bulgarians were supposed to be lifted in December 2011, but have been extended until the end of 2013 462 . In October 2012, a list of 291 jobs (low-skilled jobs) allowed for Romanians and Bulgarians was published by the Labour and Interior Ministries, increasing the number of allowed jobs from the previous 62 allowed in 2008 463 . Without access to regular employment, Roma do informal work such as collecting scrap iron, non-declared construction work, as street sellers or street musicians and as beggars, usually earning EUR 10\u201315 per average day of working for 6 \u2013 8 hours up to 12 hours 464 .

As these activities are not included in the labour laws, Roma are thus exposed to exploitation and do not have access to social security. Because of the low earnings of this kind of work, Roma are not able stop working in fear of lacking resources to live on 466 467 . Adding to the fact that these activities do not allow Roma to live normal lives, they also expose Roma to stigma as they usually interact with the population and experience depreciating looks and racist attitudes or discourses 468 . It is also a source of self-depreciation and shame for Roma that can have consequences for their mental health and general well-being, which is added to the constant fear of being evicted or deported, the identity checks and intimidation from the police 469 . Indeed, as most of the informal jobs require Roma to be visible on the streets, they can be easily spotted by the police for control. The absence of visa or work permit also excludes Roma families from the social benefits to which poorer French and legal foreign families are entitled. Some families reached by the Mediation Project could benefit from monthly allowances from the local government ( Conseil G\u00e9n\u00e9ral ) on behalf of the Social Aid for Children ( Aide sociale \u00e0 l\u2019enfance ) however there is little evidence that they do 470 . Education Approximately, 5 000 to 7 000 Roma children or teenagers are of school age, and when they arrive in France, they may already lack some education 471 . On average, only one out of two Roma children attends pre-school or nursery. The FRA also underline that, in France, most Roma children between 7 and 15, are in education (84 %), albeit a lower percentage than the non-Roma population (97 %). Only 5 % of the Roma 20 \u2013 24 age group has completed any type of upper- education 472 . This may be reflected in the low literacy rate of Roma women aged 16+ where just 71 % of females and 80 % of males declared themselves to be literate 473 .

Although every child is unconditionally entitled to education and cannot be denied this right, schools refuse Roma children on the grounds that they lack health and immunisation records (health records may not exist or might have been lost during the evictions) 474 . Although all children must have been vaccinated to enter school, French law forbids schools from denying children without immunisation or who are partially vaccinated. Among other criteria for enrolling Roma children in schools there is the demand of an address from schools, the discrimination in access to school transport, school lunch and the denial of the basic allowances to buy school stationery and decent clothing for children. Among the few who are able to enrol in schools, they usually do so for short periods because of the repeated evictions, deportations and stigma. It has been estimated by Romeurope that 5 000 to 7 000 Roma children in France do not attend any school 475 . This civic isolation is likely to contribute to the remarkably lower voter turnout figures among the Roma based in France \u2014 just 13 % of Roma chose to vote in the last French national elections in contrast to 81 % of the general population 476 . These actions have been documented previously by the MdM 477 478 479 480 481 and continue to be a matter of concern in 2013 as mayors put Roma children in separated classrooms or refuse them on arguments of lack of places at local schools according to R\u00e9seau \u00e9ducation sans fronti\u00e8res (RESF). There is also a need for specialised teachers, as many Roma children do not speak French, and for those who start school above the recommended age. Finally, the procedures for work permits, school enrolment and health coverage require Roma to fill in paperwork in French and to navigate bureaucratic processes which, besides the language barrier, constitutes a major obstacle to obtaining these rights 482 . These obstacles have been documented previously 483 484 485 486 487 488 , 474 M\u00e9decins du Monde (2007), Les Roms que l\u2019Europe laisse \u00e0 la porte, p. 30. 475 M\u00e9decins du Monde (2010), Synth\u00e8se \u2014 forum \u2018La sant\u00e9 des Roms en France: une urgence sanitaire ?\u2019, M\u00e9decins du Monde \u2014 25 February 2010, p. 10. 476 FRA, (2013), \u2018Analysis of FRA Roma Survey Results by Gender\u2019, p. 30. 477 Romeurope (2012), \u2018Les Roms, boucs-\u00e9missaires d\u2019une politique s\u00e9curitaire qui cible les migrants et les pauvres\u2019, Rapport 2010\u201311 Collectif National Droits de l\u2019Homme Romeurope, p. 30. 478 M\u00e9decins du Monde (2007), Les Roms que l\u2019Europe laisse \u00e0 la porte, p. 30. 479 M\u00e9decins du Monde (2010), Synth\u00e8se \u2014 forum \u2018La sant\u00e9 des Roms en France : une urgence sanitaire ?\u2019, M\u00e9decins du Monde \u2014 25 February 2010, p. 10. 480 Romeurope (2010), Rapport sur la situation des Roms migrants en France 2009-2010, Collectif National Droits de l\u2019Homme Romeurope, p. 154. 481 M\u00e9decins du Monde (1999), Donn\u00e9es m\u00e9dicales et socio-d\u00e9mographiques: les populations Roms/ Tsiganes migrantes en situation de grande exclusion dans trois pays d\u2019Europe.

        "Report on the health status of the Roma population in the EU and monitoring data collection in the area of Roma health in the Member States August, 2014 90 demonstrating that there are few improvements on health status and living conditions as a whole for Roma in France. On the contrary, in recent years Roma have increasingly faced deportation and exclusion from basic public services, such as health care and education. These actions contradict human rights principles and public health policies principles 489 490 491 . In September 2012, France was condemned by the European Committee of Social Rights of the Council of Europe for violating the European Social Charter on grounds of denying Roma living in France of their rights and access to their rights. Specifically, the Committee condemned the French government for not providing Roma with access to adequate housing, not ensuring access to shelter, for violating the right of Roma children to access the French education system, the non-access of Roma to health care and social health protection, and for lacking disease and accident prevention in Roma settlements 492 . The Committee also found that evictions of Roma communities from their settlements have taken place without respecting the European Social Charter, thus violating the dignity of the evicted Roma. The Committee considered that the French policy towards Roma is insufficient, especially regarding their access to education and health care. Because of the lack of general resources invested by the French government to improve Roma\u2019s poor living conditions, the Committee declared that Roma living in France undergo discriminatory treatment and requested that France change its policies towards Roma to ensure their rights 493 . It was the fourth condemnation of the European Committee of Social Rights against France concerning its treatment of Roma, thus making it urgent that the French government change its policies towards Roma and to apply already existing laws and regulations ensuring their rights.

        "Report on the health status of the Roma population in the EU and monitoring data collection in the area of Roma health in the Member States August, 2014 93 Country Profile: Germany Main Characteristics of the Roma in Germany Demography Roma and Sinti have lived in Germany for around 600 years. Sinti refers to those of Western and Central Europe origin and Roma refers to those living in Western and Central Europe 494 . Three different groups of Sinti and Roma may be differentiated: \uf0a7 Those members of Sinti and Roma, which have been living in Germany for many generations and are officially recognised as a national minority; \uf0a7 Roma migrant workers from former Yugoslavia, that arrived between 1968 and 1973 and have been living in Germany for many years; they have in general a strong legal status and are entitled to enjoy the same rights as Germans; \uf0a7 Roma refugees, asylum seekers from mostly (south-) eastern European countries, in particular since the 1990s; many of them have still to obtain refugee status and thus are not eligible for full social protection and housing rights 495 . During the National Socialist regime, Roma were persecuted and faced extermination. Furthermore, many were deported from Germany to allied countries, such as Italy, Croatia, Romania and Slovenia during WW2 496 . The Roma and Sinti who survived the camps, had a difficult time rebuilding their lives, having lost family members and friends, their property destroyed or confiscated and many had developed serious health problems. After the war, some tried to seek compensation, but their requests were rejected for many years 497 . It is estimated that there are between 70 000 and 140 000 Roma and Sinti in Germany. Most estimates are around 70 000 Roma with German citizenship, and between 40 000 and 50 000 who are refugees or migrants without full citizenship 498 . There is no national census of disaggregated data on the basis of ethnicity in Germany. It is therefore difficult to provide an accurate demographic picture of the Roma and Sinti population living there. All figures are estimates and may include or exclude members of different backgrounds and legal status within Germany. 494 Documentation and Cultural Centre of German Sinti and Roma (1999) Sinti & Roma.

        "Report on the health status of the Roma population in the EU and monitoring data collection in the area of Roma health in the Member States August, 2014 94 According to the average estimate (105 000) by the Council of Europe, Roma make up 0.13 % of the total population of Germany. This is a fairly small number in comparison to other European countries 499 . According to one study, the absolute majority of Roma and Sinti in Germany are sedentary. The study found that some Roma still owned caravans, used to go on holiday during the summer or to visit family and friends in other parts of Germany and Europe 500 . Geographical distribution The majority of German Roma lives in large or medium-sized cities of Western Germany. Cities mentioned are Berlin, and surrounding areas, Hamburg, Dusseldorf and Cologne as well as East Friesland, Palatinate, Hesse and Baden. It is estimated that 35 000 Roma and Sinti live in North Rhine-Westphalia, 12 000 in Bavaria, more than 10 000 in Baden W\u00fcrttemberg, 8 000 in Rhineland Palatinate and 5 000 in Schleswig-Holstein. The biggest concentration of Roma and Sinti can be found in Hamburg, with an estimate of 37 000 living in the city 501 . Due to the already-mentioned restriction of available data from national census as well as non-formal sources, estimates may be precarious concerning the geographical distribution of Sinti and Roma. Other Information (including highlights of data gaps) The national statistic bureau of Germany does not collect ethnically disaggregated data. However, one variable in the official census 2011 is persons with migrant background, which is defined as \u2018all foreigners who have immigrated or not immigrated as well as all Germans who have immigrated to today\u2019s territory of the Federal Republic of Germany after 1955 and all Germans with at least one parent who has immigrated to today\u2019s territory of the Federal Republic of Germany after 1955. Foreigners are persons who do not have the German citizenship\u2019. Another variable is \u2018migrant background by region\u2019, which is divided into four values; EU-28 countries, other European countries, rest of the world and unknown foreign countries. The last variable includes stateless persons and persons with uncertain citizenship without information on immigration as well as persons without foreign citizenship 502 . However, there is no official data that show further details of ethnicity and/or different nationalities living in Germany. Moreover, information from non-formal sources regarding the number and status of Sinti and Roma living in Germany are equally insufficient. 499 COE Roma and Travellers Division (2010), Population statistics.

        "Report on the health status of the Roma population in the EU and monitoring data collection in the area of Roma health in the Member States August, 2014 95 Federal statistical surveys are mostly conducted in a decentralised way. Data is usually collected and processed by the statistical offices of the 16 federal states, and aggregated at the federal state level (Statistisches Bundesamt 2013) 503 . There is a large gap within the literature on demographics and the status of Roma and Sinti in Germany. There are some data concerning living conditions of Roma and Sinti from 2002, which was compiled by the association of Sinti and Roma in Baden-Wurttemberg. This was a (unpublished) non-representative regional survey, which showed that 22 % of the questioned Sinti and Roma lived in private flats, 11 % owned their own homes and 67 % lived in council flats. There is no quantitative data on regulated encampments, due to the fact that the majority of Roma and Sinti encampments no longer exist 504 . There is no quantitative information concerning Sinti and Roma in Germany. The majority of information concerning Sinti and Roma is based on qualitative research, showing a wide information gap of quantitative data. This is likely to be due to several different reasons: \uf0a7 The official collection of ethnic data is greatly restricted by the Federal Data Protection Law, partly due to the historically sensitive nature of the subject. \uf0a7 Roma and Sinti often do not identify themselves as belonging to the ethnic minority. \uf0a7 The number of Roma and Sinti are not large enough to warrant nation-wide surveys. \uf0a7 Roma and Sinti are often inclined to neglect official data-collection efforts 505 . Official demographic data on Sinti and Roma divided into gender, age and employment status is non-existent. Moreover, there is an even a greater information gap concerning migrant Roma and Sinti with weak legal status 506 . Due to the lack of data collection concerning Roma and Sinti in Germany, this country research relies mostly on European (EU) and regional commissioned studies, non-formal sources, such as NGOs as well as academic literature, which mainly provide qualitative information and/or an analysis of secondary sources.

        "Report on the health status of the Roma population in the EU and monitoring data collection in the area of Roma health in the Member States August, 2014 96 An epidemiological study into the outbreaks of measles in Hamburg from December 2008 to June 2009 found that a local Roma community in one of the seven boroughs of Hamburg notified comprised more than 50 % of the notified cases. Stratified analysis found that there was a difference in the incidence between Roma and non-Roma of the age distribution: 33 % among the non-Roma measles cases were infants (0 \u2013 11 months), whereas in the Roma community only 4 % belonged to this stratum. 50 % of measles cases within the Roma community were found in the older stratum (5 \u2013 17 year-olds), compared with only 8 % of non-Roma cases in the same stratum. These findings may reflect different trends in vaccination preferences 507 . Healthy Lifestyles and Related Behaviours There are no official data on the health status of Roma migrants in particular. One study looked at the health situation of the general migrant population in Germany instead. This study argues that migrants often face similar health problems, due to their low socio-economic status. The study further suggests that migrants are more likely to have health problems related to physically and psychologically stressful living and working conditions, which would then include migrant Roma 508 . Access and Use of Health Services and Prevention Programmes The study team has found no quantifications of this indicator, but anecdotal data and evidence cover the following: Statutory Health Insurance Statistics and other health statistics do not record ethic origin, which means that there are no official data on the state of health of Roma and Sinti in Germany. All German citizens are obliged to contribute to the statutory or private health insurance scheme, which then guarantees the provision of health care. This also applies for nationals of other EU countries as well as nationals of Contracting States to the agreement of the European Economic Area, once they have established their residency in Germany. Third-country nationals are also required to contribute to a health insurance scheme, which means that foreign Roma living in Germany are in general required to be insured. There are various non-governmental organisations (NGOs), which help migrants and refugees and in some cases particularly Roma and Sinti to access health care services as well as other assistance 509 . 507 European Parliament (2011), Measures to promote the situation of Roma EU citizens in the European Union \u2014 Study.

        "Report on the health status of the Roma population in the EU and monitoring data collection in the area of Roma health in the Member States August, 2014 97 One field research in the district of Neuk\u00f6lln in Berlin found that there were insufficient vaccination certificates amongst Roma communities and especially amongst children 510 . There is very little information available on the health situation of Roma and Sinti in Germany. There are however some indications that Roma and Sinti lack awareness of their entitlement to benefits, in particular of public health services. The literature also draws attention to mistrust of health providers and personnel, which in turn limits access to health services by Roma and Sinti 511 . Prevalence of Major Chronic Diseases The study team has found no quantifications of this indicator, but anecdotal data and evidence cover the following: It is suggested that poor living conditions (overcrowding, poor housing quality) result in a higher risk of health problems, such as respiratory illnesses, tuberculosis, psychological problems, chronic illnesses, being overweight and disability 512 . According to one study, specific health problems among Roma in Hamburg seem to be heart disease, asthma and rheumatism. Another study shows that obesity and associated health problems such as metabolism disorder and hypertension are of concern within the migrant Roma population 513 . A German study of Roma, Ashkali and Egyptian children from Kosovo found that children also deal with psychosomatic problems, such as post-traumatic stress disorder often expected within migrants from war-torn regions, such as Roma immigrating to Germany in the 1990s. 514 Health Factors Related to the Role of Women in the Roma Community There is no official disaggregated data based on ethnicity, gender, age and health status. Lack of education opportunities often result in difficulties in accessing public services, such as health care providers. Poor housing and living standards normally affect women disproportionately, as they tend to spend more time at home than men do. Furthermore, there is a general distrust of health care providers and personnel 510 FRA. (2012), FRANET National Focal Point: Social Thematic Study: The Situation of Roma\u2019, FRANET, [Online].

There is also a reported lack of cultural sensitivity amongst health care providers. This has most likely provided a negative effect on Roma and Sinti women\u2019s access to health care services 515 . Inadequate nutrition and lack of access to health care services are of particular concern for pregnant Roma and Sinti women. One report states that dystrophy, caries and anaemia have been observed in German Roma and Sinti children at birth. It has been noted that many foreign Roma and Sinti women often suffer from depression. Many have to cope with traumatic experiences. Additionally, many have to cope with the uncertainty of expulsion, which itself can be a cause to stress and depression 516 . Environmental and other Socio-Economic Factors Housing According to the Federal Government, there is little or no difference in the provision of housing to Roma and Sinti compared to the rest of the population 517 . However, qualitative research indicates that Roma and Sinti are still classified as a low socio- economic group, with higher levels of unemployment, lower educational attainment and lower standards of living than non-Roma 518 . The majority of Roma and Sinti are sedentary and there are few encampments in Germany. German citizens and migrant face different housing situations. German citizens are entitled to housing benefits, unemployment benefits and other social welfare means as a support when faced by unemployment. Roma often live in segregated communities, which has resulted in the emergence of segregated neighbourhoods in several cities 519 . Overcrowding appears to be a significant problem within Roma and Sinti populations in Germany. Furthermore, Roma and Sinti usually appear to be living in the outskirts of cities, often with poorer infrastructure and at times close to industrial zones and waste sites. This may contribute to a higher level of health-related problems 520 . Moreover, several accounts report sub-standard housing for Roma and Sinti. A report by the ERRC records inadequate living situations where the inhabitants are not protected from the damp and cold. In order to keep warm, they use oil lamps or burn wood in their homes. Without adequate ventilation this becomes a health 515 EU Monitoring and Advocacy programme/European Roma Rights Centre (2004), Shadow Report Provided to the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination Against Women.

Education Reports from NGOs working with Roma and Sinti have recorded a high school drop- out rate at the primary school level. The report stated that in some cases almost 50 % of all school age Roma and Sinti children do not finish primary school. The majority of those who go to school attend \u2018special schools\u2019. Girls are more likely to drop out than boys, due to early marriage and hence obligations within the family as wife, mother and homemaker. Girls with travelling parents in particular suffer further problems in attaining an education 522 . A qualitative study about the educational situation of German Roma and Sinti reported several interesting findings. There is a common understanding that German Roma and Sinti often have lower educational attainment than the majority population. The study gives some insight into the barriers faced by Roma and Sinti in attaining formal (higher) education. Firstly, it confirms the lack of ambition/incentive for formal education and secondly highlights intra-familial circumstances, as well as institutional and social conditions that act as barriers to the attainment of (higher) education. Low parental education, and trauma caused by the prosecution under National Socialism influence the relationship to school as an institution. There is little evidence of self-education 523 . Employment The federal Government has put forward objectives in order to increase employment for youth and disadvantaged groups. The objectives are in line with the EU framework for National Roma Integration Strategies up to 2020. By law, German Roma and Sinti and EU nationals are free to take up employment and vocational training in Germany. The federal employment agency has several integration policies in place, in order to help migrants and other disadvantaged groups into employment.

        "Report on the health status of the Roma population in the EU and monitoring data collection in the area of Roma health in the Member States August, 2014 102 Country Profile: Greece Main Characteristics of the Roma in Greece Demography It is estimated that there are between 180,000 and 350 000 Roma living in Greece. Roma makes up 2.47 % of the total population, according to the average estimate (265 000) 525 . There is no common definition of what constitutes a Roma identity. The government recognise a large Muslim minority of Thrace as Roma, however, almost all Roma living in the prefecture of Evros, identify themselves as a Turkish ethnic minority. Therefore, numbers of Roma in Greece needs to be treated with caution 526 . The Roma community is significantly younger than the general population of Europe. The average age for EU-27 is 40.2 whereas it is 25.1 for Europe\u2019s Roma population. The average age for Roma in Greece is even lower (21.56). The percentage of persons aged 65 and over within the Roma population in Greece is only 2.16, compared to the EU-27 at 17.04 527 . Geographical distribution Roma are concentrated in four main regions, namely Eastern Macedonia-Thrace, Thessaly, Western Greece and Central Macedonia 528 . Roma can be found in both urban and rural settings in Greece, although Roma are often found in segregated rural settlements. One study found that 63 % of Roma in Greece live in immigrant/minority population areas 529 . It is estimated that more than 25 % of the Roma population is living in segregated rural settlements, in particular in Northern Greece. Most Greek Roma are sedentary, however some Traveller communities can be found in Greece 530 . 525 COE Roma and Travellers Division (2010) Pop ulation statistics.

        "Report on the health status of the Roma population in the EU and monitoring data collection in the area of Roma health in the Member States August, 2014 103 Other Information (including highlights of data gaps) Roma in Greece face multifaceted discrimination, particularly in the areas of housing, education, employment and health. Roma are not recognised as a national minority and are considered as Greeks without separate ethnic identity. Therefore, ethnic disaggregated national data are non- existent. The minority term (which is protected by international legal instruments) is only used for groups that are explicitly included in bilateral treaties. For example a minority group of 12 000 Muslim Roma living in Western Thrace is considered a minority group, due to the 1923 Lausanne Treaty 531 . There is a lack of data on regulated and unregulated encampments, social housing, private renting, ownership and household types, as there are no official or unofficial quantitative data available on the housing conditions for Roma and Travellers 532 . There are several studies and surveys regarding the health status of Roma in Greece by international agencies, such as the UNDP, the World Bank and FRA. However, a lot of this data has been published before 2008 and thus may now be considered outdated. Some studies use a small sample pool, which means that it will have little statistical value over the national circumstances of Roma in Greece. Others use a self- assessment method concerning the health status of households and individuals. No ethnic disaggregated national statistics exist, as Greek Roma are not considered a minority. The data gap also concerns quantitative as well as qualitative data of the prevalence of HIV, Tuberculosis and MDRTB as well as the prevalence rates for cancer. Greece has established a network of 33 socio-medical centres for Roma, which is acknowledged as being the most successful practice for Roma in Greece. A multi- dimensional approach is adopted by the centres, which not only provide health care and arrange hospital appointments but also provide social services and educational advice. These centres often focus on women and children and are considered to be user-friendly, flexible and multi-faceted, when they function effectively 533 . Mortality and Life Expectancy For this indicator there is no data regarding mortality rates or life expectancy. However, there is data in the form of an age pyramid, which can be compared with both mainstream population of Greece, as well as the age pyramid of EU-27. The data on the age pyramids on EU-27 and European Roma are reliable as the data is based on Eurostat data of 1 January 2008 and the European Survey on Health and the Roma Community, 2009. It is however unclear what sources the age pyramids for the Greek Roma population and Greek population are based on. Therefore, this data may be unreliable. On the other hand, the data for both the Greek and Greek Roma age pyramid are consistent with the data for EU-27 and European Roma, respectively. This 531 Pavlou, M.

        "Report on the health status of the Roma population in the EU and monitoring data collection in the area of Roma health in the Member States August, 2014 104 would suggest that the data might be indicative of the age distribution of both the Greek population and the Greek Roma population. As mentioned above, the population pyramid of Greek Roma and EU-27 differs significantly. The Greek Roma population is much younger and fewer old people, with the majority of people under the age of 20. The EU-27 population pyramid, on the other hand shows that the majority of people are between 0\u201349, and have more old people 534 . This age distribution indicates low life expectancy and high fertility rates for Greek Roma, but may also reflect migration to other areas 535 . Since Greece does not collect data on ethnicity there are no national data on mortality or life expectancy of the Greek Roma population. However, conclusions can be made from the age pyramid, which shows that Roma are much younger with fewer old people than that of both the mainstream national population and that of EU-27. The data suggests that Greek Roma have a lower life expectancy at birth than the mainstream population in Greece, as well as in the EU-27. Even though the survey included a small percentage of the total estimated Roma population, there is a general consensus that Roma are younger than the average population in EU-27. Prevalence of Major Infectious Diseases For this indicator there is data from published medical research papers as well as EU department sources concerning major infectious diseases amongst Roma in Greece. The first cases of the measles virus D4-Hamburg in Greece were identified in the beginning of 2010, among Roma households of Bulgarian nationality. The virus then spread to Greek nationalities, mainly Greek Roma. In 2010 there were 91 confirmed cases of the D4-Hamburg measles, which subsequently reached to 149 cases 536 . It is estimated that 33 % of the cases belonged to Greek Roma and 29 % to Bulgarian Roma in Greece 537 . In the majority of the cases it was children between 0-14 years of age, half of whom were 0\u20134 years old. 88 % of the 106 cases with known vaccination status were unvaccinated. During the first weeks of outbreak, the majority of cases belonged to Bulgarian Roma, then it spread to the Greek nationalities, and after week 21, most cases belonged to Greek Roma 538 . This suggests that Greek Roma is more vulnerable to outbreaks of infectious diseases than the mainstream population. The most significant reason may be the fact that a large percentage of Greek Roma children don\u2019t adhere to the vaccination programme. Other factors such as sub- standard housing, poverty, lower educational attainment, unemployment, discrimination on the grounds of ethnicity may also play a key role. One study 539 found that among non-Roma children 32.7 % had detectable antibodies to hepatitis A, compared with 98.3 % among Roma. No past infection of hepatitis B 534 EFXINI POLI et.al.

Only 14 % of Roma children had markers of past vaccination of hepatitis B, compared with 96 % of non-Roma. Sub- standard housing, lack of child insurance, frequent change of residence and the lack of primary health care delivery associated with the prevalence of hepatitis B infection amongst Roma. The data indicates that Roma are more vulnerable to major chronic diseases than the mainstream population. Even though the study included a small sample of children for seroprevalence for hepatitis A, B, and C, the data is still an indicator on the differences in health status between Roma and non-Roma. This may also indicate that one of the factors to why Roma children are more vulnerable than non-Roma is the non-adherence to vaccine programmes. Please see below. Healthy Lifestyles and Related Behaviours For this indicator there is data from a study compiled by several NGOs with funding from the European Union. This study found that the majority of the interviewees are daily smokers (56.3 %) compared to 40 % of the mainstream population. 26.2 % of Roma doesn\u2019t smoke and has never been a habitual smoker, A smaller percentage of women (46.8 %) as compared with men (66.3 %) are daily smokers 540 . 42 % of the mainstream population consumes alcohol and 1 out of 5 drinks daily. According to this study, 56.8 % of the adult Roma population had consumed alcohol during the last 12 months. The data shows a gender difference of alcohol consumption, with 77.3 % of men had consumed alcohol in the preceding 12 months, compared to 38.5 % of women. Furthermore, the overwhelming majority of the Roma population in Greece have no problems with alcohol or drugs. 3 % has problems with alcohol and 0.7 % has problems with drugs. However, when looking at the household level, drug and alcohol problems affect 17.2 % of all Roma households in Greece, which is higher than Europe\u2019s Roma average at 11.4 %. Obesity: According to the study, 9.4 % of Roma in Greece are obese, 23.3 % overweight and 35.6 % with normal weight. However, the statistics are unreliable since there is a lack of information from 31.7 % of the interviewees. 57.7 % of the mainstream population are considered overweight 541 . Even though the study used a small-scale survey, it can be used as an indicator for the need of further research into the health of Roma in Greece. The data does not reveal if Roma are more likely to be obese than the mainstream population, due to gap in the data collection. The data indicates however, that many households are affected by alcohol and to some extent drug abuse. Further research is needed to establish the prevalence of alcohol and drug abuse. The data also indicates that Roma are more likely to be smokers than the rest of the Greek population. However, as and non-Roma Children in a deprived area of Athens, Greece.

The main reason given by parents is \u2018I forgot\u2019, whilst other reasons included lack of information (13.5 %) and lack of economic resources (11.7 %). 6.6 % thought it\u2019s not useful and possibly dangerous and 2.8 % had difficulties in accessing the vaccination centre. This may suggest that the reason behind non-adherence to vaccination programme is associated with economic difficulties and lack of information. Moreover, significant gender differences were found where girls were less likely to adhere to the vaccination calendar than boys 542 . These gender differences are most likely a reflection of unequal gender structures, where girls are deemed to have lower status than boys. The data indicates that Roma children are less likely to adhere to the vaccine programme than children from the mainstream population. However, the data is unreliable since it comes from a small-scale survey and thus would indicate that more research into the immunisation status of Roma children is needed. The same study found that one of the most significant barriers to accessing health services is the economic situation, such as inability to leave work, too expensive, no health insurance and/or no means of transport. Half of the Roma population visit a physician once a month, whereas the rest of the population visit a physician once a year. 5 % have never visited a physician, which is significantly higher than the overall Roma population in Europe (2.4 %). The most common reason for visiting a physician was for diagnosis and/or treatment 543 . Another interesting finding is the disproportionate use of emergency services amongst Roma. 31.5 % had used the emergency services during the preceding 12 months. The main age group using the emergency services is 45 and older (39.5 %) and 0\u201315 (32.0 %). The disproportionate use of emergency services could be explained that these services are free in most countries. In terms of access to health services, there is insufficient data to conclude if Roma is worse or not worse off than the mainstream population, because the data comes from a small-scale study. On the other hand, the disproportionate use of emergency services may indicate that Roma are worst off, due to lack of economic resources and long distances to health care centres. Health Insurance cover: For this indicator there is data from a larger-scale study of both Roma and non-Roma, from international organisations (FRA & UNDP). Although the data for the mainstream population is not representative for the majority of the population, it acts as a benchmark for the Roma, since the non-Roma share the same residential areas and socio-economic environment. The data is reliable because the results represent Roma residing in higher than national average density areas. 542 Ibid. 543 Ibid. ",
        "Report on the health status of the Roma population in the EU and monitoring data collection in the area of Roma health in the Member States August, 2014 107 There are significant differences between Roma and non-Roma when it comes to health insurance cover. More than 90 % of non-Roma is covered by health insurance, compared to 60 % of Roma. A significant number of Roma (20.5 %) fail to access medical assistance when needed, due to lack of economic means, the insurance doesn\u2019t cover the visit or they have no medical cover. Another significant factor is not having health care centres in the vicinity 544 . The data indicate that Roma are worse off compared to the mainstream population because a significant number of Roma lack medical insurance, which means that many fail to access health care services when needed. Prevalence of Major chronic Diseases For this indicator there is data from both the small-scale study by several NGOs, as well as a larger-scale study from international organisations. According to the small-scale study, 35 % of the mainstream population claims to suffer from chronic diseases, (30.7 % male and 39 % female). The most common diseases in the mainstream population are: hypertension 16 %, hyper-cholesterol 9.1 % and osteoarthritis 6.1 %. The same study 545 found that most of the Roma population (over 90 %) does not suffer from any chronic disease. The most common disease is menopause-related problems suffered by women. 98 % of Roma under the age of 45 have no disabilities or chronic disease. This may also reflect the younger average age of the Roma population as compared to the mainstream population. Moreover, the prevalence of diabetes within the Greek Roma community is 4 %, which is slightly lower than within the mainstream population at 6.4 %. The data do not reveal if the Roma population is worse off because the data relies on self-assessment on their own health status. Moreover, the study in not representative of the majority of Roma population in Greece, since it is a small-scale survey. The data from the larger-scale study indicates however that Roma are worse off than non-Roma in terms of health problems. The FRA Roma pilot survey 2011 showed that more than 15 % of Roma respondents aged 35 to 54 said to have health problems that limit their daily activities, compared to less than 10 % of non-Roma 546 . This contradiction between the two studies may suggest that due to a younger population, the majority are considered themselves as healthy. However, the older generations show tendency to have more health problems than the mainstream population. The data indicates that adult Roma and older generations are more likely to face health problems than the mainstream population in the same age category. 544 FRA (2009) \u2018 The situation of Roma in 11 Member States \u2019. 545 EFXINI POLI et.al.

All respondents were born in Greece and 2 out of three household lived in urban areas and the remaining lived in encampments. The households were randomly selected, where one member of the household over the age of 16 were chosen (also randomly) to fill in the questionnaire. Interviews were broken down into three themes, where the head of the household answered questions about the general status of the family, the primary care giver was asked about preschool experiences of children, whereas the randomly selected person 16 of age or over answered health related questions. Non-Roma households living in the same area and with the same socio-economic Infrastructure were interviewed to allow for comparison of the results. ",
        "Report on the health status of the Roma population in the EU and monitoring data collection in the area of Roma health in the Member States August, 2014 108 Health Factors Related to the Role of Women in the Roma Community For this indicator there is data from the same small-scale study. The majority of women from the mainstream population in Greece have never had a pap smear. Moreover, 44 % of women have had a mammogram and 54 % have had a breast test. According to EFXINI POLI et.al. (2009), 21.5 % of Roma women in Greece had never visited a gynaecologist. 35.5 % had only gone for the reason of pregnancy, whereas only 8.6 % had made the visit during the last 1 \u2013 3 years for other reasons than pregnancy. The main reason why women had visited the gynaecologist (other than pregnancy) was gynaecological problems. Moreover, the study also showed that 31.9 % have had a pap smear and as few as 8.4 % have had a mammogram at some point in their lives. However, the sample base in Greece was too small to have any statistical significance 547 . A survey from the FRA indicates that Roma women are significantly worse off than their non-Roma counterparts. 13 % of Roma women over 16 reported having bad health compared to 5 % of non-Roma females. This trend is exacerbated as the female population ages with 34 % of Roma women above 50 in bad health in contrast to 9 % of non-Roma women. 548 This data reflects the trend observed that health problems in the Roma population develop earlier than the general population. Environmental and other Socio-Economic Factors For this indicator (education) there are data from both European studies as well as a study from international organisations. The data indicate that the Roma population is significantly worse off than non-Roma when it comes to educational attainment. Education: Less than 10 % of Greek Roma children are reported to be in pre-school or kindergarten, compared with less than 50 % of non-Roma. Greece (together with Slovakia) shows the lowest participation rates for children in pre-school and kindergarten for both Roma and non-Roma. The data suggests that the literacy rate for Roma in Greece differs significantly by gender \u2014 just 43 % of female Roma are literate compared to 55 % of male among the over 16s. It is worth noting that literacy rates are equal for 16-24s, hence gender differences may be more pronounced for the older generations. 549 Additionally, more than 35 % of Roma children aged between 7 and 15 in Greece do not attend school, compared to less than 5 % of non-Roma children. Furthermore, less than 5 % of Roma between the age of 20 and 24 have completed a general or vocational upper-secondary education, as compared to 80 % of non-Roma 550 . Unsurprisingly, enrolment rates for minors (0\u201315) are low for Roma. Compared to EU- 27 (79.8), only 34.9 % of Roma minors are enrolled in school. 56.0 % of Roma minors 547 EFXINI POLI et.al.

Only 8 % of 15\u201324 year olds from the Roma community in Greece are still in school 551 . This data for enrolment rates comes from EDIS S.A. European Survey on Health and the Roma Community and data furnished on EU-27 by Eurostat 2007 (quoted in EFXINI POLI et.al. (2009) Health and the Roma community, analysis of the situation in Europe. Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Greece, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia, Spain). However, the data are unreliable as they are old. Employment Data on employment comes from both the small-scale study by several NGOs, as well as a larger-scale study from international organisations. One study showed that around 25 % of Roma are in paid employment (excluding self- employment), compared to more than 40 % of non-Roma. However, a significant proportion (around 20 %) of Roma stated that they were self-employed. More than 1 in 10 Roma children are reported to work outside the home in Greece. 552 Another survey 553 showed that 38.2 % of Roma are economically active, whereas 19.4 % are unemployed and 42.5 % are inactive. These figures are based on the self- perception of the interviewees and therefore not comparable to the official figures of unemployment. Data suggests a big difference in employment rates between Roma men and women over 16 \u2014 64 % of males are in paid work compared to just 16 % of females. This can entirely be explained by cultural reasons as 47 % of women are full time homemakers compared to 0 % of men. 554 The data do not reveal if the Roma are worse off than the non-Roma population. Furthermore, the data are unreliable since the first data exclude self-employment and the second data are based on self-perception. The data concerning child labour are also unreliable. Different cultures understand child labour differently and without using an international agreed definition, child labour will be difficult to determine. Housing: For this indicator there is data from European studies, international organisations and NGOs. Both national and international reports on Greece, agree that Roma live segregated from the rest of the population, both spatially and socially 555 . 22 % of Roma population live in shanty towns, whereas 54 % live in rural settings. Almost half of Roma in Greece live in either shanty towns (21.9 %) or in sub-standard housing (25.5 %). A significant proportion (37.3 %) of the Roma population live in isolated areas and have poor health, compared to Roma that live in integrated neighbourhoods with good health (29.2 %).

There is a considerable difference in housing conditions between Roma and non-Roma in Greece. The average person per room (excluding bathroom, toilet, kitchen, hall, corridor and any rented out room) for Roma is almost 2.75, compared to non-Roma with the average of just over 1 person/room. There is also a significant difference between Roma and non-Roma when it comes to basic amenities, such as indoor kitchen, indoor toilet, indoor shower/bath and electricity. More than 35 % of Roma lack at least one of these basic amenities, compared to an insignificant portion of non- Roma (less than 1 %) 557 . According to Eurofound (2012) over 80 % of Roma household experience some kind of housing deprivation. The majority experience lack of space, rot in windows, doors or floors and many cannot afford to keep the place adequately warm. Damp from leaks in walls or roofs is also another common problem. Additionally, more than 30 % of Roma in Greece had experienced discrimination in the last 5 years in accessing housing 558 . The data indicate that Roma are significantly worse off than the mainstream population. Moreover, the data concerning the housing situation are consistent, which indicates reliability. Even though the Eurofound (2012) study is a review of secondary literature of which some is slightly outdated, it shows a general trend that the Roma population is worse off than non-Roma population when it comes to the housing situation. For the poverty indicator there is data from international organisations. According to FRA Roma pilot survey 2011 around 60 % of Roma respondents said that somebody in their household had gone to bed hungry at least once on the last month due to insufficient resources to buy food, compared to less than 10 % of non-Roma. Moreover, almost 90 % of the Roma live in households at risk of poverty, compared to less than 55 % of non-Roma 559 . The data indicate that the Roma population are significantly poorer than the mainstream population. The data also indicate that Roma are more vulnerable to unforeseen economic events than the non-Roma population. The data are reliable because the results from the survey are representative of Roma residing in higher than national average density areas.

The latest representative sociological survey in 2003 estimated the number of Roma to be around 570 000. Based on statistical projection the number now is around 750 000 (more than 700 000 and less than 1 000,000). The rate of 0-14 children is 36.8 % for the Roma and 15.4 % for the non-Roma (2003). 60 % of Roma live in rural areas. Employment rate among men is 20 % and among women is 10 % (2003). Poverty rate: 70 % 560 . Geographical distribution According to the 2003 (the latest representative) survey the rate of Roma population was about 5 %; counties where their rate was higher than the average: Borsod-Aba\u00faj- Zeml\u00e9n and Heves \u2014 above 11 % (North Hungary region); B\u00e9k\u00e9s 9 \u2013 11 % (South Alf\u00f6ld region); Szabolcs-Szatm\u00e1r-Bereg and J\u00e1sz-Nagykun-Szolnok 7\u20139 % (North Alf\u00f6ld region); Baranya (South Hungary region), Hajd\u00fa-Bihar (North Alf\u00f6ld region) and Pest (Central Hungary region) 5 \u2013 7 %. Other information (including highlights of data gaps) Except for a few indicators, it was possible to cover almost all types of indicators. (Indicators missing: maternal mortality; measles; ante-natal care) As a general observation it can be concluded that we have some representative surveys but they are mainly from the early 2000s and we have some important scientific publications but they usually have a small and focused (e.g. geographical location, age group, lifestyle) sample. As a consequence, official documents still rely on data from the early 2000s. There are some important indicators from a more recent survey (the UNDP/WB/ECFRA/ 2011), however, it has indicators only on access/barrier to health care services, vaccination and health assessment. Other more recent international surveys usually cover indicators on access/barriers to health care services but not on specific diseases. 560 T\u00c1RKI, 2009 non-representative. ",

As to the infant mortality indicators for Roma there are no ethnically disaggregated data. Nevertheless, there are regionally disaggregated data 565 that allow for an approximation as to the rate of Roma infant mortality with some limitations. \uf0a7 The three regions where the rate of infant mortality is the highest are the North Hungary region, the North Alf\u00f6ld region and the South Alf\u00f6ld region. This indicator is used in the Hungarian Roma Strategy (National Inclusion Strategy) pointing out that regional differences play an important role as to the rate of infant mortality Another infant mortality indicator that could be used is the \u2018Mother\u2019s educational qualifications, elementary or lower\u2019 \u2014 given the low educational level of the Roma population. \uf0a7 That is two times higher for this indicator (10.1 perthousands) than the national average. Prevalence of Major Infectious Diseases We have aggregate as well as separate indicators on hepatitis A, B and C as well as HIV and syphilis or chlamydia. \uf0a7 The aggregate indicators (B) come from a survey carried out in Budapest among drug users in 2005\u201306 and it looked at the number of infections among injecting drug users (IDU) 566 . It was found that Roma always had a higher rate of the number of infections than non-Roma.

Interestingly no HIV infection was found. The same applies to this set of indicators as to the previous one; it is based on an important scientific work but it is very limited in scope (it is a rapid assessment survey) and cannot be generalised to the more general Roma population. (Dzsumbuj, where the survey was undertaken, is a very specific neighbourhood of Budapest with an extremely high concentration of poverty and all the related problems). The other limitation of the indicators is that they date back to 2004 and 2006. Nevertheless, they can serve as good starting points to develop a more general survey on these indicators. The indicator on the rate of tuberculosis dates back to 2000 568 569 570 . \uf0a7 The rate of tuberculosis for Roma is 4 % and for the non-Roma it is 1 % . The data is old, nonetheless, the survey was representative which means that by repeating the same survey we could get a solid basis for comparison as to how the health situation of Roma has changed in the course of the last decade. We have indicators on the vaccination rate of children (0 \u2013 6 or 6 years old) 571 . \uf0a7 The level of vaccination is almost 100 % for Roma as well. The data are recent (2011) and come from a big sample size but focus on Roma living in areas with high rate of Roma population. We could not identify any source with reference to indicators on the rate of measles among the Roma population. Healthy Lifestyles and Related Behaviours We identified one publication with indicators on drug use among the Roma 572 : \uf0a7 The rate of adolescents (13 \u2013 16) who already used drugs. Difference between the rate of drug use among Rome and non-Roma is very high: 22 % as opposed to 2 %. The survey is not representative. Indicators on the use of alcohol among the Roma come from four different surveys 573 . The surveys were undertaken in 2004, 2006 and 2008 (one unspecified). \uf0a7 One important finding is that Roma men in all age groups had a higher prevalence of abstinence than did all of the general population 574 . 567 Gyarmathy V., Ujhelyi, A.

The surveys have different indicators (adolescents, mothers, general population) on alcohol drinking habits and except for Roma adolescents, all other groups of Roma are more likely to be abstinent or drink less than the non-Roma. None of the surveys is representative. We identified seven documents making reference to indicators on smoking habits among the Roma population 578 . \uf0a7 The prevalence of smoking was considerably higher among Roma people older than 30 years than in the lowest income quartile of the general population. Roma persons were younger than the general population when they started smoking 579 . \uf0a7 The Roma Strategy reported on smoking among the Roma using the sources of the Health Survey, 2009 by the Central Statistical Office and the Roma population state of health survey, 2009. The rate of smoking among the Roma is significantly higher than for the non-Roma: 77 % and 31 %; and it is also much higher among Roma pregnant women than non-Roma: 62 % and 25 % 580 . \uf0a7 The indicator LBW/PTB mothers stopped smoking during pregnancy reveals that 10 % of Roma and 66 % of non-Roma mothers stopped smoking while pregnant. 581 \uf0a7 Rate of smoking adolescents, both active smokers, or those who had only smoked once, is significantly higher among the Roma than the non-Roma: 45 % to 18 % 582 . \uf0a7 Taking into account the impact of educational level, religiosity and age, it is found that Roma are twice as likely to smoke as the non-Roma. 583 575 Bal\u00e1zs P., Foley, K.

The indicators suggest that Roma ethnicity plays an important role in smoking habits 584 . All smoking indicators suggest that Roma ethnicity makes it about twice as likely to be inclined to smoking compared to the non-Roma. There are older and more recent data as well mainly focusing on specific groups and not on the general Roma population. For BMI, obesity and low weight we identified three sources 585 . \uf0a7 The distribution of body weight was broadly similar in the two populations, except that obesity tended to be slightly less frequent in Roma women in all age groups 586 . \uf0a7 Low weight among LBW/PTB Roma mothers is twice as high as among the non- Roma, while obesity is less frequent (11 % for non-Roma and 7 % for Roma) 587 . \uf0a7 Obesity is more likely among the Roma than the non-Roma (20 % and 35 %) 588 . With the latest source the problem is that the author does not give a reference. In most studies it is found that Roma are less likely to be overweight than the non-Roma or the general population. The contradiction cannot be accounted for because of the lack of reference. For unhealthy diet we have two different sources. 589 \uf0a7 Unhealthy diet (less consumption of fruits and vegetables daily) was more prevalent for Roma than for the lowest income quartile of the general population 590 . \uf0a7 LBW/PTB mothers having fresh fruits or vegetables and meat less than once a week is more frequent for Roma than for non-Roma 591 .

Almost all Roma and non-Roma have access to health care services (97 % and 97 %) 616 . These latter indicators do not contradict each other although they may seem mutually exclusive. In fact, the first one 617 618 is the actual use of health care services whereas the second one 619 is the possibility of the use of health care services.

        "Report on the health status of the Roma population in the EU and monitoring data collection in the area of Roma health in the Member States August, 2014 122 economic status of the Roma in Hungary. Most of the data, however, use different measurements and breakdown so they are not comparable. There are only the following indicators that appear in more than one reference: Employment rate is 20 % for the Roma and 55 % for the non-Roma (15\u201364 of age) 658 . In the UNDP/EC/WB/FRA 2011 survey 659 employment rate for the Roma is 23 % and for the non-Roma 41 % (15\u201364 of age). The difference can be explained by the following: the UNDP survey focuses on Roma households and on the non-Roma living in the vicinity. So the data on general employment rate is not representative for the whole population. Educational level Highest completed education: primary (eight grades) (15\u201364): 50.9 % for the Roma and 24.2 for the general population 660 . Highest completed education (25\u201364), Primary education \u2014 ISCED 1 is 22 % for Roma and 6 % for non-Roma 661 . Share of people with primary school education (40 \u2013 49): 58.9 % for Roma and 18.9 % for non-Roma 662 . The UNDP survey (2011) shows a much lower rate of low educational level than the census (2001) and the other representative survey (2002). Highest completed education: secondary/vocational (15\u201364): 9.1 % for the Roma and 26.3 % for the general population 663 . Highest completed education (25\u201364), Lower secondary education \u2014 ISCED 2: 56 % for the Roma and 35 % for the non-Roma 664 . Share of people with vocational education (40 \u2013 49): 8.9 % for Roma and 31.2 % for non-Roma 665 . The huge difference comes from the different categorisation in the education levels in the two surveys: in the UNDP this indicator is the summary of \u2018Upper basic\u2019, \u2018Incomplete secondary voc/technical\u2019 and \u2018Incomplete secondary general\u2019 were summarised as Lower Secondary Education \u2014 ISCED 2\u2019 whereas the first and third indicators refer to only complete vocational/technical school education. Highest completed education: secondary/final exam, high school degree (15\u201364): 2.5 % for Roma and 27.9 % for the general population 666 . Highest completed education (25\u201364), Upper secondary education \u2014 ISCED 3: 16 % for the Roma and 52 % for the non-Roma 667 . 658 For full bibliography please see reference section Ref 4. 659 UNDP-WB-European Commission, (2011),\u2018FRA regional Roma survey\u2019. 660 For full bibliography please see reference section Ref 4. 661 UNDP-WB-European Commission, (2011),\u2018FRA regional Roma survey\u2019. 662 For full bibliography please see reference section Ref 12. 663 For full bibliography please see reference section Ref 4. 664 UNDP-WB-European Commission, (2011),\u2018FRA regional Roma survey\u2019. 665 For full bibliography please see reference section \u2019Ref 12\u2019. 666 For full bibliography please see reference section Ref 4. 667 UNDP-WB-European Commission, (2011),\u2018FRA regional Roma survey\u2019.

Here, we also have very different categorisation: in the UNDP survey this indicator refers to \u2018Secondary voc/technical (3 or 4 yr)\u2019, \u2018Secondary general (4 yr)\u2019, \u2018Incomplete college or university\u2019 were summarised as Upper Secondary Education \u2014 ISCED 3\u2019 whereas the first and third indicators only cover people with secondary final exam, high school degree. Highest completed education: university (15\u201364): 0.7 % for Roma and 12.9 % for non-Roma 669 . Highest completed education (25\u201364), Post-secondary education \u2014 ISCED 4+: 0 % for Roma and 6 % for non-Roma 670 . Share of people with university degree (40\u201349): 1.8 % for Roma and 17.6 % for non- Roma 671 . In the UNDP sample there are no Roma with university degrees so it can be assumed that it is due to the sampling of the survey (focusing on Roma households and thus probably excluding more integrated Roma living in integrated areas). This is supported further in a 2011 survey by the FRA. This showed that Hungarian Roma have the highest levels of continued education past the age of 16 out of the 11 EU Member States covered. 67 % of female Roma and 85 % of male Roma continued education past the age of 16 672 . Other important indicators that only appear in one reference: Unemployment rate (15\u201364): 50 % for Roma and 24 % for non-Roma 673 . The high level of unemployment rate for the non-Roma is due to the sampling: focusing on the non-Roma population living close to the Roma, assumably poorer areas (national unemployment rate: 10.7 % end of 2012). The rate of people that felt that they were negatively discriminated in the course of their efforts to find a job in the last five years (prior to 2009): 68 % 674 . The rate of people that felt that they were negatively discriminated in the course of their efforts to find a job in the last 12 months (prior to 2009): 47 % 675 . These data, however, have been reported on more recently by the FRA (2013). Their findings showed 39 % male Roma and 28 % of female Roma unemployed. They also found that 32 % of men and 23 % of women claimed they had been discriminated against while looking for work in the last five years 676 . People living in segregated housing conditions (not specified as Roma): 3 % 677 . Share of the population not having access to secure housing: 29 % for Roma and 8 % 668 For full bibliography please see reference section Ref 12. 669 For full bibliography please see reference section Ref 4. 670 UNDP-WB-European Commission, (2011),\u2018FRA regional Roma survey\u2019. 671 For full bibliography please see reference section Ref 12. 672 FRA (2013). \u2018Analysis of FRA Roma survey results by gender\u2019. 673 For full bibliography please see reference section Ref 12. 674 For full bibliography please see reference section Ref 4. 675 Ibid. 676 FRA (2013). \u2018Analysis of FRA Roma survey results by gender\u2019. 677 For full bibliography please see reference section Ref 4.

The limitations of the survey are that it was not representative of the overall Hungarian Roma population. By design, it excluded those Roma who have, to various degrees, assimilated with the majority population; it captured the characteristics of the most disadvantaged section of the Roma population. However, the needs of this group are the most important to understand from a policy perspective.

In 2009 Statistics Iceland, for the first time, published statistics on the immigrant population in the country. According to their definition, an immigrant is a person born abroad with two foreign born parents and four foreign born grandparents. Second generation immigrants are defined as persons born in Iceland with two immigrant parents. Iceland has experienced strong growth in the immigrant population since 1996 when immigrants were 5 357 (1.8 % of the total population) compared with 25 265 (8 %) in 2008. The share of immigrants in Iceland is now comparable to other Nordic countries. Until the 1990s, the Icelandic population was very homogenous and a vast majority of immigrants came from the neighbouring Nordic countries. As late as 1996, 30 % of all immigrants were from one of those countries. In 2008 this share had dropped to 7 %. Now, a vast majority of immigrants come from Europe outside the Nordic countries (68 % in 2008 compared to 40 % in 1996) 686 . 685 Council of Europe. 686 European Commission \u2014 DG Employment (2007) \u2018Feeding in\u2019 and \u2018Feeding out\u2019, and Integrating Immigrants and Ethnic Minorities Key lessons.

        "Report on the health status of the Roma population in the EU and monitoring data collection in the area of Roma health in the Member States August, 2014 130 Country Profile: Ireland Main Characteristics of the Roma in Ireland Demography The Roma population in Ireland can be divided into two main broad categories: \uf0a7 Irish Travellers, who are native to Ireland and have been present in the country since the 5 th century \u2014 this is predominantly a homogenous group; \uf0a7 Central and Eastern European Roma, who are mainly recent migrants from the Oriental part of Europe, a less homogenous ethnic group who have entered the country mainly via Britain since the beginning of the 19 th century 687 . Although the first ethnic group is an indigenous population, they have much in common with European Roma, Sinti and Gypsies, including their nomadic tradition, a tendency to live in extended families, a history of having to protect their identity from attempts to assimilate them into the majority population and problems of social exclusion and discrimination at all levels of society 688 . Differences between the indigenous Roma in Ireland and Roma from other parts of Europe are instead mainly related to the activities carried out by the two groups. Prior to the Industrial era, Irish Travellers had been mainly craftsmen and traders whereas, Roma from Europe have traditionally undertaken seasonal work, such as farm labouring, before eventually moving back to England and to Continental Europe. This migration was of a temporary nature and included small numbers so went relatively unobserved. However, after the collapse of communism, the number of Roma who have arrived in Ireland seeking asylum has risen significantly. This is consistent with the overall increase in asylum seekers in Ireland that has occurred since the mid- 1990s. The first major arrival of Roma in Ireland was from Arad in North Eastern Romania in 1998. Most of this group were granted refugee status. A second impetus for Roma immigration to Ireland arose after the admittance of an additional 15 states \u2014 mainly Eastern European countries \u2014 to the European Union. The total number of Irish Travellers recorded in April 2011 was 29 573, accounting for just over half of one per cent (0.6 %) of the total population. The figure represents a 32 % increase on 2006 (22 435) 689 . Figures on Irish Travellers are gathered by the Irish Central Statistics Office, as one of the main variables collected for the Census is \u2018membership of the Traveller Community\u2019 690 . In contrast, the number of Central and Eastern European Roma in Ireland is roughly estimated, because even if data are collected on ethnic origin this is based on self- perception of belonging to a specific ethnic group, therefore there is a certain level of 687 Lesovitch, L.

It is estimated that there are 2 500\u20133 000 Central and Eastern European Roma individuals in Ireland (2005) 691 with the majority originating from Romania 692 , but also from the Czech Republic, Bulgaria, Hungary, the Former Yugoslavia Republic, Lithuania and Poland 693 . An estimation by the Council of Europe, which does not make any differentiation among Irish Travellers and Central and Eastern European Roma, established that there are between 32 000 and 43 000 thousands Roma individuals 694 . Another study carried by the School of Public Health, Physiotherapy and Population Science (2010) 695 estimates that the Traveller population amount to 40 129 people, but the origin of the population is unspecified. As a consequence of the uncertainty in designing a precise demographic profile of Roma population in the country, both groups \u2014 Irish Traveller and Central and Eastern European Roma \u2014 will be considered, however when possible they are referred to separately in this country report. Geographical distribution The Roma population is spread across the country, mainly concentrated in urban areas. More than four out of five Irish Travellers live in cities, this compares with 62 % for the general population. Of the cities, Dublin (including suburbs) has by far the largest number of Irish Travellers with 5 168 persons. This is followed by Galway (West) with 1 667 and Cork (South) with 1 050 696 . The majority of Irish Travellers live in houses rented from local authorities 697 . A different study illustrates a similar urban concentration of Central and Eastern European Roma, mainly residing in private rented houses in the Irish capital, in Monaghan (North of Ireland) and Carlow (South-East) 698 . Other Information (including highlights of data gaps) In contrast to many EU Member States, Ireland collects data on the ethnicity of its population.

        "Report on the health status of the Roma population in the EU and monitoring data collection in the area of Roma health in the Member States August, 2014 132 However in spite of this, quantitative data on both Travellers and Central and Eastern European Roma in Ireland is only partly reliable. For instance the Census count reported a decline of the Roma population between 2002 and 2006 (from 23 681 to 22 435), but this was contradicted by figures from the annual count of families carried out by local authorities and submitted to the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government. This report shows a 28.2 % growth in the number of Traveller families from 2002 to 2007. In 2007 there were 8 099 Traveller families, compared with 6 289 families in 2002 699 . The most recent data report a total of 9 911 Traveller families (the number of Traveller families living in private house on their own resources are estimated). Specific data on Central and Eastern European Roma are based on estimation, because even if the Irish Central Statistics Office collects data on ethnicity, this seems to be matched in relation to nationality. In other word, data on Roma are collected not only for those that are Roma/Travellers, but also Irish citizens. This difficulty in obtaining reasonably accurate figures is also compounded by the fact that many Roma do not reveal their ethnicity because of a fear of persecution 700 . Moreover there is a lack of data about their legal status in Ireland (i.e. asylum seekers and/or refugees). This uncertainty about Roma status impedes also the understanding of their entitlement in accessing public health services. There is consensus about the fact that the Irish National Census undercounted the number of Irish Travellers 701 . For this reason the \u2018All Ireland Healthy Study\u2019 research team relied, first, upon data provided by the Roma NGO network 702 (the National Traveller Health Network) and, after, it verified them against data from the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government. The mapping exercise resulted in a Traveller family population of approximately 9 548 households, which were multiplied by four members in each family, for a total of 40 129 individuals. From the above it descends that estimation based on the number of Roma family members and households, rather than mere counting, is more appropriate to picture the demographic profile of Roma 703 . This is due to the local \u2018antenna\u2019 gathering data being closer to the Roma community are better able to detect demographic changes in this population. With regard to health data collection, there are no official records that focus on Roma population in Ireland. Although studies from the mid-1980s raised considerable concern about the health status and inequalities of the Traveller community 704 , there is still a lack of systematic collection on Roma health. In fact, the Department of Health publishes health statistics 705 and Survey of Lifestyle, Attitudes and Nutrition in Ireland (SLAN) 706 , but data by ethnicity group are of very poor quality. 699 Watt, P.

        "Report on the health status of the Roma population in the EU and monitoring data collection in the area of Roma health in the Member States August, 2014 133 Nevertheless, the Irish government has shown a considerable level of commitment regarding Roma health conditions. In particular, The Primary Health Care for Travellers Project 707 has established a network of 40 territorial care points able to interpret Roma health needs and produce related quantitative and qualitative statistics. One of the outcomes of this project has been the elaboration of the study All Ireland Travel Health Study which gathers, systematised and enriches recent studies on Roma health 708 , offering a detailed overview on this topic, for both Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland regarding: \uf0a7 general demographic information (composition of population age, sex, marital status); \uf0a7 mortality (cases of death and also infant mortality); \uf0a7 adult and children health conditions (self-assessment health status and lifestyle i.e. smoking, use of alcohol and drugs habits); \uf0a7 access (and the related frequency) to health services; \uf0a7 housing, educational and employment conditions. The analysis of the existing systems and studies on Roma health in Ireland shows a high level of commitment of the national, regional and local institutions regarding this topic. Both the Census system and the \u2018All Ireland Traveller Health Study\u2019 represent a good starting point to elaborate a feasible and innovative model to be extended to other European countries when facing Roma Health issues. Not all the EU countries gathered data on the base of ethnicity, but the Irish system, based on community care networks, seems to be a promising model to obtain data through qualitative and quantitative methods. Moreover the attempt to compare and triangulate the results obtained with other studies regarding the sedentary population seems to pave the way for further study in this field. The research nevertheless has some limitations. First of all it is unclear whether the Central and Eastern European Roma population is included in the census of the families. Second, the assessment about the health of the individuals considered is based on self-assessment and is only partly contrasted with some other information (i.e. hospital and medical institutions\u2019 records), making the results partly biased. Third, not all of the variables studied are compared with the majority of the sedentary population, therefore is not always possible to ascertain in relative term the health status of nomadic populations. Finally and more importantly the \u2018All Ireland Traveller Health Study\u2019 is an ad-hoc study, whose repetition and sustainability across time has not been granted. 706 A survey based on face-to-face interviews and postal questionnaires involving 10 364 respondents representative of the census population.

Available at: http://www.dohc.ie/publications/slan07_report.html. 707 The Primary Health Care for Travellers Project is the operative tool of the overarching National Traveller Health Strategy 2002\u201305. \u2018The aim is enabling individuals and organisations to improve health through informed health care, self-help and mutual aid. It means encouraging and supporting local initiatives for health. Crucially it is a flexible system that can be adapted to the health problems, the culture or \u2018way of life\u2019, and the stage of development reached by the community. Design and implementation of successful PHCTPs is determined through a process that values empowerment, partnership and advocacy, allowing partners to highlight inequity and negotiate solutions. This approach has empowered individuals to enhance skills, take control and participate in decisions that affect their lives in order to address the health of their community\u2019.

        "Report on the health status of the Roma population in the EU and monitoring data collection in the area of Roma health in the Member States August, 2014 134 Mortality and Life Expectancy Evidence on life expectancy among Roma individuals shows that they are estimated to live for a shorter duration than the general population. The All Ireland Travel Health Study reports that \u2018[\u2026] compared to the general population, Travellers are dying younger. In general population 59.9 % of deaths occur in those aged 75 years or over. In the traveller population only 17.6 % of deaths occur above that age. For deaths in those aged 85+ the figures are 28.8 % in the general population and 5.0 % in Travellers 709 . This is also because in terms of age cohorts the Traveller population is younger, however the excess of mortality seems to be an endemic problem across all ages. There is a discrepancy related to gender, indeed according to the All Ireland Travel Health Study the mortality rate is higher among men (4.7 % higher than the general population) than women (2.3 % higher than the general population), while Clark and Greenfield (2006) report that Irish Traveller women and men are estimated to live 12 years less and 10 years less respectively than the sedentary population. In a same vein the study, The situation of Roma in the EU \u2014 Health, carried out by the Fundamental Rights Agency (FRA) 710 states that Irish Travellers have a lower average life expectancy than the majority of the population. Further, in 1999 the differential in the longitudinal rates in sudden infant deaths was 12 times greater for travellers compared to the settled population 711 . The Irish Traveller infant mortality is currently one of the highest in Europe 712 . Prevalence of Major Infectious Diseases The study team has found no quantification of this indicator, but anecdotal data and evidence include the following: According to FRA study 713 public health epidemiology for the Roma population remains scant, with indications of higher rates of diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidaemia, coronary artery disease and obesity. There are higher levels of nutrition-related illnesses than in majority populations. Healthy Lifestyles and Related Behaviours Data on lifestyle and related behaviour are mainly based on individual\u2019s self- assessment. According to the Census 2011, Travellers declare in absolute terms a good level of satisfaction with their health (86.6 % of the population considered) 714 , however when compared with the majority of the population 27 % of Roma individuals aged between 30 and 49 years old indicate bad or very bad health conditions, a percentage far 709 All Ireland Traveller Health Study (2010) of Technical Report II.

This difference increases when considering older segments of the population. Respectively 49 % of Travellers between 50 and 69 years report bad or very bad health conditions, 31 % more than sedentary population of the same age. Similarly the All Ireland Travel Health Study confirms that among the 4 141 individuals interviewed the level of health satisfaction declined when looking at 65+ individuals. However in terms of a general level of satisfaction with their health, Travellers in the All Ireland Travel Health Study score their health as better than Travellers included in the Survey of Lifestyle, Attitudes and Nutrition (SLAN) 715 . The two studies therefore report contrasting results. Regarding the incidence of specific illnesses, the Traveller population appear to have a greater burden of chronic diseases than the general population (as illustrated in the related section below). Concerning smoking, drinking alcohol and use of drugs, small-scale qualitative studies based on interviews and focus groups show that the Roma population is more likely to present these form of risk behaviours. Even when young people have a similar behaviour in consuming drugs in comparison to the \u2018settled\u2019 group of the same age, the former are less aware of drug side effects and the related health services available 716 . The All Ireland Travel Health Study states that half of the Traveller population was currently smoking. Total daily cigarette consumption was high, with a majority of smokers reporting smoking 16 or more cigarettes per day 717 . This indicates a higher consumption of tobacco than in the majority population. In relation to illicit drugs, the majority of respondents (65.45 %) considered illicit drugs to be a problem in their community and this was a consistent pattern for both men and women and across age groups. In conclusion, a more consistent and detailed collection of data to this regard is recommended with a higher level of emphasis on Central and Eastern European Roma.

The Traveller community have a lower level of satisfaction with the services received and less trust in medical personnel (37 % against 80 %) than the comparable majority population. According to this study, the Traveller population makes greater use of Accident and Emergency (A&E) services, this is consistent with the fact that they have higher rates of non-accidental injury and thus a greater need of A&E services. The above mentioned study from FRA 719 confirms that there is a high utilisation rate of A&E services and paediatrics and obstetrics. On the contrary the All Ireland Travel Health Study reports that a lower level of assistance was granted to Traveller children for problems that needed attention (8.3 %) in comparison with similar situations in the sedentary population (2.8 %) 720 . The reason given of paying for the care. The FRA study confirms a lower level of participation in prevention programmes. For instance 96 % of the general population is immunised against Rubella, whereas among Roma the percentage is lower: 89 % 721 . Prevalence of Major Chronic Diseases While data on infectious diseases are not available, more sources are available for chronic diseases, however specific explanations are not always provided to understand the causes for these illnesses. The Census 2011 reports that Irish Travellers had higher rates of disability than the general population. In 2011, 17.5 % of Irish Travellers had one or more disabilities compared with 13.0 % for the State as a whole 722 . The traveller population is also at much greater risk from depression. Much of this may be linked to migrational issues. The depression rate among Travellers was reportedly as high as 41 %. 723 Amongst Irish Travellers, the most common type of disability was \u2018difficulty with pain, breathing or any other chronic illness\u2019 (7.7 %). This was followed by \u2018difficulty with remembering, learning or concentrating\u2019 (6.6 %) and \u2018difficulty with basic physical activities\u2019 (6.3 %). This is confirmed by the All Ireland Travel Health Study: \u2018[\u2026] regarding the incidence of specific illnesses, the Traveller group appear to have a greater burden of chronic diseases than the general population, with conditions such as back conditions, diabetes and heart attack increased by a factor of two in the Traveller group, and 719 FRA, (2012), \u2018The situation of Roma in 11 EU Member States\u2019. 720 National Longitudinal Study of Childhood 721 FRA, (2012), \u2018The situation of Roma in 11 EU Member States\u2019. 722 Central Statistics Office, Information Section, Profile Central Statistics Office, Information Section (2011) Profile 7: Religion, Ethnicity and Irish Travellers. 723 Donegal Travellers\u2019 Project.

According to the analysed study Irish Roma consume more fried food 725 . Health Factors Related to the Role of Women in the Roma Community Women Traveller health conditions in Ireland are mainly assessed with specific regard to maternity and the associated risks. Census figures report that among 40\u201349 year olds (women who have typically completed their fertility) those with no children made up just 11.6 % of women amongst Irish Travellers compared with 18.7 % of women generally. 26.9 % of Irish Traveller women had given birth to five or more children in contrast to just 2.6 % of women overall. Furthermore, just more than one in eight (13.0 %) of Irish Traveller women had given birth to seven or more children, compared with 0.4 % of women generally. In general there is a higher level of spontaneous delivery among pregnant Traveller women (37 %), then the matched groups. In 2008 a higher level of infant mortality was also registered (+ 10.8) of the average of infant mortality. Notably artificial feeding is higher among Irish Roma women (96 %) than the matched population (57 %) 726 . As a concluding remark it has been reported that generally a small male network of family members accompany Roma women during their maternity hospital appointments and visits. Roma men in these instances translate for women, raising important issues in relation to the translation abilities of medical terms, complications and procedures. Translation services are usually refused. This is a relevant issue in relation to bereavement and counselling in cases of infant mortality and access to culturally sensitive support 727 . Environmental and other Socio-Economic Factors The national Census provides abundant data regarding the socio-economic conditions of Roma population in Ireland, as a result this section is drafted mainly on the information published in 2011 by the Irish Central Statistics Office in the Profile No 7: Religion, Ethnicity and Irish Travellers . This brief overview contains the most updated data and allows for comparisons with the majority of the population. Further information is retrieved from the RAXEN study on Roma housing conditions, the All Ireland Travel Health Study and the Fundamental Rights Agency study. It must be specified that there is an overlap among these studies and this section is built only on the most up-to-date and comparable data. 724 Ibid, p. 209. 725 FRA, (2012), \u2018The situation of Roma in 11 EU Member States\u2019. 726 All Ireland Traveller Health Study, (2010) of Technical Report I.

Almost half (45 %) were accommodated in non-Traveller- specific housing (i.e. standard social rented, voluntary and co-operative housing, etc.), and a third (33 %) were in other accommodation types (i.e. private rented, unauthorised sites) 728 . In fact the Central Statistics Office reports that between 2006 and 2011 the percentage of Irish Traveller households residing in caravans or mobile/temporary structures halved from 24.7 % to 12.3 %, possibly confirming an increasing use of standard accommodation with central heating on the rise (+17 %). However, the rate of home ownership within Roma households is lower than the general population with one in five (20.2 %) households owning their home compared with 69.7 % for the general population. Moreover, the average number of rooms available for Irish Travellers is inferior to that of the general population (4.3 against 5.5) and the percentage of households with only one room was higher in the Roma population, in comparison with the matching population (4.5 % against 1.5 %). In general it can be said that housing conditions of Irish Travellers have been improving, however for those households living in mobile and temporary accommodation the sewerage and water supplies are still unsatisfactory (one in five households had no piped water source and one in three did not have a sewerage facilities) 729 . \uf0a7 Education According to the All Ireland Traveller Health Study (2010) the level of literacy among Roma based on self-assessment is far lower than the rest of the population. Of the 24 243 Roma considered by the study 6 108 completed primary education, 1 635 reached secondary education and only 942 reached tertiary education. These data are confirmed by the Census 2011, which states that only 1 % of the Roma population considered completed third/advanced studies, whereas within the general population instead 30.7 % completed advanced studies 730 . Researchers observed that the lack of literacy is not only a factor that might prevent Roma from obtaining jobs and then improve their socio-economic situation in the long- term, but it is also a factor that might hamper access to health services or the understanding of medical prescriptions, in the short and medium term. However, the situation has been improving. The percentage of Irish Travellers who have completed upper secondary education more than doubled from 3.6 per cent to 8.2 per cent between 2002 and 2011. Possible explanations of these positive results can be ascribed to the country strategy for Roma education, which focuses on individual needs independently from the ethnicity. \uf0a7 Employment In 2011 the level of unemployment among Roma was 84.3 %. Out of a total labour force of 9 973, 86.6 % of the 5 829 males were unemployed while 81.2 % of the 4 144 women were without work. The labour force participation rate among Irish Travellers was 57.3 % compared with 61.9 % for the general population 731 . 728 Watt, P.

Similarly, the rate of Irish Travellers aged 15 and over unable to work due to permanent sickness or disability was nearly twice the rate of the general population (17.5 % against 4.4 %).

        "Report on the health status of the Roma population in the EU and monitoring data collection in the area of Roma health in the Member States August, 2014 141 Country Profile: Italy Main Characteristics of the Roma in Italy Demography The Council of Europe Roma and Travellers Division estimates 732 that 140 000 Roma live in Italy as an average amount corresponding to 0.23 % of the total population, ranging between 110 000 and 170 000. The majority of Roma, about 50 \u2013 60 %, are Italian citizens while the remaining 40 \u2013 50 % is made up of foreign citizens who arrived in Italy within successive flows. According to the European Roma Rights Centre 733 20 \u2013 25 % are from other EU member states, chiefly Romania and Bulgaria; a percentage that translates to around 35 000 Roma with EU citizenship. However, the European Commission Against Racism and Intolerance estimates a total of 50 000 Roma mainly from Romania. Geographical distribution Comprehensive and accurate data pertaining to the geographical distribution of the Roma are not available. In fact, data on regional and municipal distribution are partial and fragmented while also tending to be lower than the overall national estimate. Yet, most of the presence is recorded in: Rome with 15 000 to 18 000 people 734 ; Lombardy with 13 000 people 735 ; Campania and Calabria, with 9 000 people each 736 ; Piedmont with 6 500 people 737 . Lastly, in 2008 the Ministry of the Interior carried out a Roma census in Milan (Lombardy), Rome (Lazio) and Napoli (Campania). However, since many Roma had removed themselves before the census took place, the data considerably underestimate Roma presence 738 . Other Information (including highlights of data gaps) Generally, there is a dearth of data regarding Roma health condition and the few available data mainly derive from small-sample epidemiological surveys. Particularly, there are no available data inherent to: maternal mortality rate, mortality aggregate, tuberculosis, MDRTB, hepatitis, diabetes, cancer and rates of (cervical and breast) cancer screening. In order to improve data comparability, it would be advisable to carry out further studies that compared similar groups of Roma (Italian, Migrant, EU Migrant) living in similar contexts (authorised and unauthorised settlements, caravans, apartments, etc.) and also holding constant another aspect such as the number of years that the 732 Council of Europe Roma and Travellers Division estimates (CoE), (2010), \u2018Statistics\u2019. 733 Strati, F.

        "Report on the health status of the Roma population in the EU and monitoring data collection in the area of Roma health in the Member States August, 2014 142 target group has resided in the country. On the other hand, the absence of such studies, in a comprehensive fashion, and the reliance on the ones available, are key in helping to define the above-mentioned variables as conducive to very different health prospects. Mortality and Life Expectancy Data pertaining to infant mortality rates are scarce, outdated and somewhat inconsistent. In addition, there are no available data inherent to maternal mortality rate and mortality aggregate. According to a Save the Children report (2008) 739 , that presents data from 1992 \u2013 95 in the Lazio region, the rate of infant mortality at birth for Roma equalled 6.5/1 000 as opposed to 3.5/1 000 for Italians, while infant mortality within the first week equalled 15.3/1 000 for the Roma, as opposed to 4.4/1 000 for Italians. The Presidency of the Council of Ministers indicates the same data used by Save the Children with regards to infant mortality within the first week. In addition, it underlines that the main causes of death are infections and hypoxia. The European Monitoring Centre on Racism and Xenophobia 740 estimates that in 1991 the infant mortality rate for the Roma in Italy was almost three times the rate of the wider population. Data on life expectancy are even more inconsistent and scarce than mortality-related indicators. Further, there are not any data for life expectancy rates at age 45 and at age 65. According to the CEPS 741 , Roma life expectancy is 20 years lower than the national average. However, according to one study 742 Roma life expectancy is about 40 \u2013 45 years. The two reports contradict each other as life expectancy for the wider population in Italy is particularly high: 78.8 for males and 84.1 for females. Also, there is no indication regarding how the data were obtained or calculated. Prevalence of Major Infectious Diseases There is a dearth of data regarding the prevalence of major infectious diseases. In particular, there are no data related to tuberculosis, MDRTB and hepatitis. The scientific literature focuses on describing outbreaks of measles cases and the obstacles in meeting the World Health Organization\u2019s (WHO) target of eradicating measles. In doing so, a common denominator of the reviewed studies pertains to four aspects: a) low vaccine coverage; b) nosocomial transmission; c) age distribution differences between the Roma and the wider Italian population; d) similar methodologies \u2014 data were obtained from several sources: the routine infectious diseases surveillance system, field epidemiological investigations, and molecular genotyping of virus by the national reference laboratory Motta and Geraci 743 describe a project promoted by Caritas and funded by the Ministry of Health which extended vaccine coverage, firstly in Rome and then in five other cities. Data from Rome show that the coverage before the project totalled a mere 60 % of the local Roma population.

        "Report on the health status of the Roma population in the EU and monitoring data collection in the area of Roma health in the Member States August, 2014 143 vaccine doses were distributed. The strategy adopted was pulse vaccination either actively administered to the Roma in 24 camps or by the means of guidance to low- barrier public services in eight camps. As a result of the campaign the coverage was extended to 80 % of the local population. In 2010 two measles outbreaks are described 744 in the Lazio region between 2006 and 2007 and underline the importance of pockets of low vaccine coverage in hard-to- reach populations (HRP), particularly Roma and Sinti, in sustaining the infection. However, the authors state that the subsequent spread of measles cases was facilitated by non-immunised health staff: to this regard, tackling nosocomial transmission is deemed a vital part of the overall strategy aiming at the eradication of measles. Roma affected by measles were 102 of a total of 409 cases. The age distribution of measles cases was different among the Roma/Sinti population (median age two years) with respect to the rest of the population (median age 15 years). 70 % (72/102) of Roma/Sinti cases occurred in children aged 0 \u2013 4 years and over 90 % (93/102) were aged below 15 years. The age distribution of cases in the Italian ethnic population was more even among all age groups. Only 23 % of cases (80/ 347) were aged 0 \u2013 4 years, and less than 50 % (170/347) occurred in children below 15 years of age. In 2007 three clusters of measles cases that occurred between June and September 2006 in three different Italian regions are described 745 : the Autonomous Province of Bolzano-South Tyrol (17 cases); Lazio (161 cases); and the island of Sardinia (nine cases). Again, the authors stress the need of achieving high vaccine coverage in the general population and in the hard-to-reach population as well as the full immunisation of health care personnel. Roma affected by measles were 13 of a total of 17 cases in South Tyrol. The median age of those infected in this outbreak was 13 years (range 2 \u2013 29 years); 53 % of cases (9/17 cases) were below 15 years of age. Overall, 10 of 17 cases, including six of the 13 Roma/Sinti cases, were serologically confirmed, and the remaining seven were epidemiologically linked. Measles virus genotype D4 was isolated from three cases. Roma affected by measles were 74 out of a total of 161 cases in Lazio (the outbreak analysis corresponds to the first of the two outbreaks investigated in 2010 746 ). Overall, children aged 0 \u2013 4 years were the most affected age group, representing 46 % (74/161 cases) of all reported cases. However, the age distribution of measles cases differed between the Roma/Sinti and the general population. In fact, while 68 % (50/74) of Roma/Sinti cases occurred in children aged 0\u20134 years and over 90 % (68/74) were aged below 15 years; in the general population only 52 % of cases (44/84) occurred in children below 15 years of age. The study underlines that none of the Roma/Sinti cases had previously been vaccinated against measles. Additionally, five of the cases (5.7 %) from the general population had received only one dose of 744 Curtale, F, F. Perrelli, J. Mantovani, M. Ciofi degli Atti, A. Filia, L. Nicoletti, F.

The number of Roma cases in Sardinia was nine, representing 100 % of the outbreak. The authors note that four of the affected children had recently travelled to Rome, thus making it most plausible to establish an epidemiological link with the Rome outbreak There is a report about an outbreak of measles in the Pisa territory in 2008 747 . In total, 44 cases were investigated, 34 of which refer to the Roma population living in camps. Out of the 34 Roma patients, 20 were males and 14 females. The disaggregation by nationality points to 27 Macedonians and 7 Romanians. The age ranges from 5 months to 16.3 years. In particular, 30 cases (88.23 %) referred to children younger than 8. No Roma patient had been previously vaccinated. A report by the Ministry of Interior (2006) 748 mentions targets related to reducing the incidence of HIV and other STDs as well as tuberculosis. However, no measurable target is indicated. Further, no incidence of HIV, serving as a benchmark, is provided. Healthy Lifestyles and Related Behaviours Data inherent to healthy lifestyles are particularly scarce and outdated. Five studies deal with at least one of these aspects, albeit in a residual way. Yet, they offer a glance on this domain of Roma health and clear evidence of the greater prevalence of underweight Roma infants as compared with Italian ones. More specifically, available data relate to weight at birth (three studies); addiction, alcohol and drug abuse (four studies); and, finally, body mass index (one study). Monasta et al 749 recorded 14 children whose weight at birth was < 2.5 kilograms corresponding to 17 % of the sample (14/147). The latter consisted of Khorakhan\u00e9 Roma (from Kosovo and Macedonia) who were interviewed, between December 2001 and March 2002, in five cities: Florence (Tuscany); Bergamo and Brescia (Lombardy); Venice (Veneto) and Bolzano (Trentino Alto Adige). Similarly, data by the Epidemiological Observatory of Lazio in the period 1999 \u2013 2001, found 18.4 % underweight Roma children. According to the same study, the percentage of Italian children below 2.5 kilograms at birth was, at the time, 5.7 %. Also, Save the Children 750 cites UNICEF data dating back to 2002 that reveal an incidence of underweight birth among Roma of 10 % as opposed to 6 % among the wider population. In fact, the data by Save the Children show a lower incidence than the previous two. However, from the combined analysis of the three studies, it could be stated that Roma children are almost two to three times more likely to be underweight at birth than the wider population. Furthermore, this evidence is consistent with the vast array of risk factors that Roma women are exposed to during their pregnancy, namely: severe immaterial and housing deprivation, young age of first pregnancy, lower access to health care, especially ante-natal screening and infections, etc. 747 Vierucci, F, T.

        "Report on the health status of the Roma population in the EU and monitoring data collection in the area of Roma health in the Member States August, 2014 145 Nosotti et al 751 (2004) analysed data related to 2 483 medical examinations, between 1996 and 2002, of Roma belonging to six different communities based in Rome. The authors mention an increasing trend regarding alcohol and illicit drugs abuse. Colombo et al. (2011) report recent and alarming data concerning 1,142 EU Roma mainly from Romania who were visited by the Naga mobile unit, a voluntary association based in Milan, during. In detail, they record a total of 300 opioid addicted and 400 cocaine/crack addicted. 752 . Data regarding healthy lifestyles, however, are available for a limited sample of 665 Roma. In particular, there were 372 smokers, which translate to a percentage of 56 %, and 63 heavy smokers or 17 %. The authors emphasise that the distribution of smokers was similar between men and women (59 % and 53 % respectively); however, men tended to be heavy smokers more than women (22 %and 12 % respectively). By contrast, There are 753 disaggregated results of a sample constituted by 401 migrants, including 70 Roma, the data refer to the period 2000 \u2013 02. The proportion of smokers was highest in male Roma, yet only 3.5 % of Roma were smokers and 21.8 consumed alcohol. All women reported that they had never smoked or consumed alcohol. It has also been pointed out that the exposure to risk factors such as smoking, alcohol consumption, coffee and unhealthy food (high content in fat and salt) were all co-factors for high rates of hypertension. Concerning body mass index, the only study available is on a total of 70 Roma 754 . With regard to women, 15.4 % had a BMI lower than 18.5; 33.3 % had a BMI between 25 and 29.9; and 12.8 % had a BMI higher than 30. No man had a BMI lower than 1.5; 35.5 % had a BMI between 25 and 29.9; and 32.3 % had a BMI higher than 30. However, there appear to be missing data. Notwithstanding this, the authors note that among male migrants, only the Roma had a mean BMI value significantly greater than that of native Italians. Male Roma BMI value was 27.70 (25.2 for Italians and 24.6 for all immigrant groups). Conversely, the mean BMI for each female ethnic group (Roma excepted) was significantly higher than that of native female Italians while female Roma BMI value was 24.5 (23.9 for Italians and 25.9 for all immigrant groups). Access and Use of Health Services and Prevention Programmes There is a relative wealth of information related to access and use of health services. By and large, the literature points to both legal and non-legal barriers with regard to access to health care, and relies mainly on site visits in settlements to gather quantitative data. Also, the literature focuses on services aiming at improving accessibility. Concerning the legislative context, in 1978, Italy adopted a Beveridge \u2010 type health care system that favours universal health coverage. However, access still depends largely on nationality and status. Italians, regular third-country nationals and employed EU nationals and their relatives have the right to register to the National Health Service ( Servizio Sanitario Nazionale ).

        "Report on the health status of the Roma population in the EU and monitoring data collection in the area of Roma health in the Member States August, 2014 146 receive emergency treatments across the national territory by means of a special card called Tesserino STP ( Straniero Temporaneamente Presente ). EU nationals who either are not in possession of medical insurance from their country of origin (Romania, Bulgaria), thus are not in possession of the TEAM card ( Tessera Europea Assicurazione Malattia ), or are not regularly employed in Italy, find themselves in a position of vulnerability since they can no longer access the services of STP. However, albeit heterogeneously, regions have provided for a specific card, called ENI ( Europeo non iscritto ) which puts them on a par with STP holders. It ought to be noted, that, since EU Roma (from Romania and Bulgaria) face difficulties in being employed, their situation is of particular vulnerability in those regions where the ENI card has not been put in place, such as Lombardy. Broadly speaking, non-legal barriers pertain to: language issues; bureaucracy- administrative-organisational issues; and different cultural habits. Furthermore, the EU Commission (2008) recognises that Roma women use health care services less than the rest of the population, because medical treatments may conflict with their customs, or due to discrimination by health care professionals. Also, lack of information at the individual level hinders their overall access. Four main studies have recorded Roma access to health services, such as: registration to the SSN or possession of the STP, TEAM and ENI cards. A study in 2008 755 conducted field research over a two-week period in Roma settlements (EU origin unspecified). In fact, not all the people were of Roma ethnicity but 75.63 % (1 494/1 970). In total, 22 % were registered to the National Health Service (SSN), 50 % were not registered to the SSN but held the STP card. The remaining persons did not have any access to health care. A 2009 study 756 records access to health services in various Roma camps. In the Quaracchi, Osmannoro and Longinotti camps (Florence), of a total of 65 Romanian Roma, 1 was registered to the SNN, 20 had the STP card, and 43 did not have any kind of access to health service (data is missing for 1 interviewee). In the Villaggio 1 (former Poderaccio camp) and Villaggio 2 (former Masini camp), in Florence, out of a total of 101 non-EU Roma, 95 were registered to the SNN while 6 were in possession of the STP card. In the Favorita camp (Palermo), out of a total of 118 non-EU Roma, 60 were registered to the SNN while 33 were in possession of the STP card and 25 did not have any kind of access to health services. In the Messina-based S. Ranieri Camp, out of a total of 70 (mainly) non-EU Roma 38 were registered to the SNN while 30 were in possession of the STP card and 2 did not have any kind of access to health services. While mainly from Montenegro and Kosovo, there were also seven Italian Roma: all of them were registered to the SNN. In the Maregrosso Camp (Messina), out of a total of 44 EU Roma no one was registered to the SNN, 24 were in possession of the ENI card and 20 did not have any kind of access to health services. According to these data, it seems that the situation of EU Roma is the least optimal. The same trend is confirmed in Trento, Milan and Rome: low access to health services, excluding emergency ones (STP or ENI), and even lower access for the EU Roma from Romania. Using data collected by the mobile unit of Naga, a voluntary association based in Milan, during two years of activity (2009\u201310) found that 850 EU Roma from Romania 755 GrIS, Gruppo Immigrazione e Salute-Lazio, (2008), Salute senza esclusione: campagna per l\u2019accessibilit\u00e0 dei servizi socio-sanitari in favore della popolazione rom e sinta a Roma, Rome. 756 Geraci, S, F.

        "Report on the health status of the Roma population in the EU and monitoring data collection in the area of Roma health in the Member States August, 2014 147 had no access to any health service (SNN, TEAM; ENI; STP) out of a total sample of 907 757 . By contrast, a FRA/UNDP survey (2012) 758 found access to health care as high as 80 %. The proportion, which is similar to that related to Italians (living in the same neighbourhood), seems very high. However, the FRA/UNDP survey includes Roma not living in settlements. Therefore, the data reinforces, instead of undermining, the view that spatial segregation is key in limiting access to health care. Also, it should be noted that Roma living in settlements, especially unauthorised ones, may face higher obstacles in obtaining a job or accessing education, thus reinforcing the vicious cycle of exclusion. In view of both legal and non-legal barriers, Caritas has developed considerable experience in increasing vaccine coverage and facilitating access to health services by the means of a holistic and tailor-made approach. A holistic approach includes all the aspects of discrimination, namely: health access, housing, employment, and education. A tailor made approach is one that can be synthetised as \u2018explicit but not exclusive targeting\u2019. More specifically, the approach is informed by some methodological milestones, such as: creating a network of public and private sector intervention; multi-professional approach (physician, anthropologist, psychologist, cultural mediator/facilitator) including a Roma component; empowerment of the Roma community; bridging the gulf of mistrust; guaranteeing health services in the camps, in the short run, while aiming to normalise the access to public health services in the medium run 759 . Prevalence of Major Chronic Diseases Data on the prevalence of major chronic diseases are particularly scarce as there is no data regarding diabetes and cancer. However, there are data regarding hypertension and asthma. Respiratory difficulties and asthma prevalence in children aged 0 \u2013 5 in the five Roma settlements were found in a 2004 study 760 . 23 % of the children had respiratory difficulties or wheezing; 17 % of the children had respiratory difficulties in the past 12 months; 5 % had recurrent respiratory difficulties (at least four times in the previous 12 months). Asthma period prevalence equalled 17 %. Monasta et al 761 single out the risk factors associated with diarrhoea, cough and respiratory difficulties. Risk factors are divided into two main categories: camp-related and household-related ones. The former category includes: the presence of water stagnating because of ruined paving or inappropriate drainage systems, size of the 757 Colombo, Cinzia, A. Galli, M. Pero, R. Giani, S. Jucker, P.

The latter category includes: poor condition of housing, overcrowding (more than 2.5 people per room), no indoor access to sanitation and use of wood-burning stoves. With regard to hypertension, one study 762 found 33.3 % hypertensive male subjects and 23.5 % female subjects. Furthermore, the main waist circumference (WC) for Roma male was 95.1 and for Roma female 80.5. As the study analysed 401 migrants, including 70 Roma, among men, the highest prevalence of cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk associated with hypertension in overweight/obese subjects with high WC values (> 102 cm) was found in Roma. Similarly, among women, the highest prevalence of CVD risk associated with hypertension in subjects with WC > 88 cm was found in Roma. The authors warn, however, that a limitation of the study might be the extension to different ethnic groups of the WC cut-off points associated with obesity in Caucasians. Lastly, GrIS (2008) found 384 hypertensive subjects (19.5 % of the sample) aged 0 \u2013 60. Disaggregating by age range, a percentage as high as 77 % was found vis-\u00e0-vis people older than 35. Health Factors Related to the Role of Women in the Roma Community There is a paucity of data pertaining to health factors related to women. In particular, there is no information for rates of (cervical and breast) cancer screening. Available data includes: average age of first pregnancy, average number of children, number of abortions and use of contraception. However, data are not comprehensive but, rather, refer to small samples. It was reported in 2009 763 that, in the Florence-based Quaracchi. Osmannoro and Longinotti camps, there is a general mistrust by Roma women in undergoing ante- natal visits: this situation depends on cultural barriers between the Roma and the wider population; and also depends on the fact that sometimes they have been asked to pay. The study also emphasises how abortion is used as a method of contraception; further, the average age of the first pregnancy is 16, the average number of abortions is 1.6 and the average number of children is 2.8. Another source reports the average number of children is 2.8 for women older than 15 (similar to the above-mentioned study) 764 . Disaggregating by age range, the average is 1.2 for women aged between 15 and 25 and 3.6 for women aged between 36 and 46. It should be noted that according to ISTAT (2013) the average number of children for an Italian woman is 1.4. Further, 32 % (146/453) of women had undergone at least one abortion. Only 7.8 % of women made use of contraception while the use of prophylactics seemed to be rare and aimed at avoiding STDs. 762 Gualdi-Russo, E , A. Zironi , G. V. Dallari ,S.

        "Report on the health status of the Roma population in the EU and monitoring data collection in the area of Roma health in the Member States August, 2014 149 In 2008 Save the Children 765 recorded 15 women out of 76 who used contraception: eight used a coil, six the pill and one prophylactics. The percentage of women who did not undergo any ante-natal screening equalled 18 % (14/76) as opposed to 0.5 % of Italian women. More specifically, 46 underwent an ante-natal ultra-sound scan, 53 an ante-natal gynaecological visit, 48 an ante-natal blood exam and 37 all three ante- natal examinations. The Ministry of the Interior 766 mentions the target linked to the improvement of the assistance to pregnant women and the reduction of abortion. However, no specific, measurable target is indicated. In addition the self-declared health status of Roma women was shown to be much worse than the non-Roma population. Women aged 50 and over who described their health status as \u2018bad\u2019 or \u2018very bad\u2019 was 67 % in the Roma population compared to only 9 % in the non-Roma population. This is the largest difference of this kind shown by Member States included in this FRA report 767 . Environmental and other Socio-Economic Factors There is a wealth of information regarding this section. This is due the fact that the topic as defined is quite comprehensive \u2014 dealing with housing, employment, and education, and the fact that these areas are the most studied. The scope and objective of the present study necessarily demands to limit our analysis to few key reports. It is important to note that the main reason for the interest in these areas is due to the understanding that housing, employment and education impact deeply on the overall situation of Roma. To put it concisely, housing deprivation directly influences the overall health status of Roma, education is paramount in fostering integration and enhancing chances of upward social mobility that ameliorates the health status, and employment is linked to the resources available to oneself as well as to access to social rights in case of migrant Roma. In all three domains, Roma score considerably lower than the wider population. With regard to housing, Tarnovschi et al 768 report that 70 % of the sampled EU Roma (mainly from Romania) respondents lived in unstable conditions: 43.4 % in shanty towns and caves, 18.7 % in temporary barracks, 3.2 % in mobile homes, 2.4 % in caravans, 2.2 % in spaces designed for other purposes other than housing. Only 14.6 % lived in apartments and 11 % lived in a house or part of a house. By contrast, a quarter of Italian Roma families lived in single-family houses, 20 % lived in condominiums, while nearly half of respondents (48.5 %) lived in unstable conditions. More generally, it is estimated that about a third of the Roma population in Italy lives in either authorised or unauthorised camps on the peripheries of large cities (ECRI, 2012). The existing literature also points to the fact that there are substantial differences among the various Roma groups living in Italy. As a result, Romanian and Bulgarian Roma face the direst housing conditions as they live predominantly in shacks in unauthorised settlements. Results of an FRA survey also showed that the difference in housing conditions between Roma and non-Roma was one of the largest 765 Save the Children, (2008), Studio sulla Salute Materno Infantile nelle comunit\u00e0 Roma.

        "Report on the health status of the Roma population in the EU and monitoring data collection in the area of Roma health in the Member States August, 2014 150 in the EU Member States represented (35 %). This report states that 36 % of Roma households had no piped water or no sewage or no electricity 769 . Focusing on employment, it has been 770 found that only 45.8 % of male Roma and 46.9 % female Roma were employed. According to FRA/UNDP (2011) 771 , household members aged 20 \u2013 64 in paid employment equalled 10 %. Data, however, do not include self-employment. Additionally, around 25 % of the Roma surveyed said they were self-employed. In 2012 it was reported 772 that Roma employment was only 37 %; the unemployment rate equalled 22.5 % and the rate of inactivity was as high as 39.8 %. Finally, the picture with regard to education illustrates inequity. In 2009 773 36 % of male and 38.2 % of female Roma had no education at all; that primary education attainment ranged from 32 % for males to 35.3 % for females. The percentage decreases considerably for women vis-\u00e0-vis secondary education (26.5 %) while it remains constant for men. However, according to FRA/UNDP household members aged 20 \u2013 24 with at least completed general or vocational upper-secondary education roughly equalled 15 %. Further, Tarnovschi et al. (2012) report a lower education attainment of 94.3 % that drops to 5.2 % for middle education and as low as 0.5 % for higher education. Additionally, they provide an illiteracy rate of 15.7 %.

        "Report on the health status of the Roma population in the EU and monitoring data collection in the area of Roma health in the Member States August, 2014 154 Country Profile: Latvia Main Characteristics of the Roma in Latvia Demography Latvia is within those countries in Europe with a large proportion of ethnic minorities: 156 are present in the country, Roma is one of those 774 . There are three main broad categories of Roma in Latvia according to the language that they speak: \uf0a7 Polish Roma; \uf0a7 Russian Roma; \uf0a7 Latvian Roma 775 . The three groups are mainly homogenous and they have a sedentary lifestyle. In Latvia the Census assumes ethnicity as a variable. Figures from 2012 report that today there are 8 482 Roma, which constitutes 0.4 % of Latvia\u2019s population 776 . Nevertheless, a 2009 RAXEN study pointed out that according to unofficial information provided by leaders of Romani NGOs, the total number of Roma in Latvia may reach 13 000 or 15 000. This discrepancy is based on the fact that many Roma do not indicate their true ethnicity because of fear of discrimination and they instead declare other ethnicities/nationalities (Latvian and Russian) 777 . Geographical distribution The three groups of Roma living in the country are mainly urbanised. In particular the Latvian Roma live in Riga and Kurzeme (by the Baltic Sea, in the western part of Latvia), whereas Russian speaking Roma live in Latgale (region close to the Russian border). Other Information (including highlights of data gaps) The Ministry of Health publishes a yearbook of health care statistics. The main information collected concerns demography, mortality, hospital services, maternal and infant health care and figures on health insurance, which in Latvia is compulsory. However, those data are not collected on the base of ethnicity. As a result data on Roma health are very limited and only little information can be obtained regarding the following indicators: \uf0a7 Drugs use, extrapolated from the Register on Drug and Substance users and already illustrated in the Fundamental Rights Agency (FRA) study; \uf0a7 HIV infected persons, because of information derived from a pilot project and NGOs; 774 Margevi\u010da, I.

Considering the segmentation of the country in several ethnic groups, data collected on ethnicity by the national statistics office should be better used and matched with the health system. Data are instead fragmented and based on qualitative interviews with practitioners and members of the Roma community, therefore data are only partly reliable and might result in bias. Mortality and Life Expectancy The only information available is that the Latvian Roma is the only ethnic group with a positive balance of birth rate (births exceed the mortality rate: in the period 2000 \u2013 07, natural population growth was 697.). Despite the positive balance, the birth rate is steadily decreasing among Latvian Roma 778 , also because the high level of unemployment has led to migration, causing a demographic impoverishment 779 . Prevalence of Major Infectious Diseases According to the FRA study, 335 Roma were registered as HIV infected (2011). This is noted as 42 HIV infected persons per 1 000 Roma inhabitants in Latvia. The information is available because the Latvian HIV centres supporting patients registered them on the base of ethnicity. In addition in 2012 because of an awareness project against HIV/Aids, 36 Roma persons were provided of free HIV test 780 . Healthy Lifestyles and Related Behaviours Quantifications regarding Roma health status are very poor. A study from FaFo on poverty in Latvia (2005) states that Roma is the Latvian minority at major risk of social exclusion, low incomes and thus poorer health than the average of population 781 . The only quali-quantitative research assessing Roma health and the prevalence of addictions is provided in a descriptive epidemiological study (2009). The research was carried out, anonymously questioning volunteer Roma children \u2014 59 in Vilnius (Lithuania) and 31 in Ventspils (Latvia) schools. Results were compared with an identical study, carried out in five Vilnius schools 782 . The main findings were that 45.2 % of the children in the Ventspils school score their health as poor and 19.4 as very poor, whereas within the control group only 3.4 % 778 Ibid. 779 Margevi\u010da, I.

The researchers cited this result to the long- term influence of negative perceptions of the Roma conditions. This is consistent with the fact that within the Ventspils students there were high and frequent levels of emotional symptoms concerning loneliness (35.5 %) and depression (32.3 %). Turning to lifestyle and related behaviour, the same research explains that children from Ventsplis have a low consumption of nicotine and alcohol, whereas 10 % have used drugs and within those 3.3 % carry out daily use. The control group reports a lower percentage with only 4.4 % having tried drugs, of which only 0.6 % consume them every day. Further on the use of drugs in the Roma community, from 2006 to 2011 the Register on Drug and Substance Users registered 166 new Roma becoming addicted to drugs 783 . It was also noted in the Riga Drug User\u2019s Cohort Study that 66 % of Roma drug users have been in prison 784 . Access and Use of Health Services and Prevention Programmes Health insurance is compulsory in Latvia, with the population able to access the health system by paying EUR 30 monthly or for free (means tested). Data on insurance are gathered by the Health Compulsory Insurance State Agency, but these are not broken down by ethnicity. Roma have low levels of employment and are therefore likely to be less favoured by this system 785 . More precise data on access to the health service can be extracted from the above- mentioned descriptive epidemiological study. Researchers have observed that the rate of Roma applications to the doctor during the year was considered as similar to the children of the control group. These findings contrast to some extent with the common idea that Roma have less access to health services. Prevalence of Major Chronic Diseases The study team has found no quantifications of this indicator. Health Factors Related to the Role of Women in the Roma Community The study team has found no quantifications of this indicator. Environmental and other Socio-Economic Factors \uf0a7 Housing According to the RAXEN study, ethnic affiliation data are not collected in the framework of household annual surveys. In addition the results of the 2000 population census are, for the scope of the present study, outdated and the existing reports on Roma in Latvia do not extensively investigate this aspect, focusing instead mainly on policy in the field of education. From the review carried out it emerges that even if Roma in Latvia are mainly sedentary and thus potentially more likely to rent or buy houses, their low level of 783 FRA.

        "Report on the health status of the Roma population in the EU and monitoring data collection in the area of Roma health in the Member States August, 2014 157 participation in the labour market prevents them from paying the related bills or obtaining a mortgage. As a consequence Roma families live in old, temporary, overcrowded accommodation. Local authorities support social housing for vulnerable groups, however the recent report from the European Commission against Racism and Intolerance (ECRI) in Latvia (2011 \u2013 12) states that Roma continue to face discrimination in accessing social housing services because the concrete possibility of obtaining publicly funded accommodation depends on the attitude of the mayor of the town or on whether Roma are present on the committee which takes decisions about social housing concessions 786 . \uf0a7 Education A national programme \u2018Roma in Latvia\u2019 was adopted by the government between 2007 and 2009 and the main focus of the programme was education. As a result several activities were carried out, for instance 20 Roma assistant teachers and 30 teachers were trained for work in the inclusive groups of the educational institutions. Today, 7 of 20 are working as assistant teachers. In addition several studies prove that the number of Roma children in pre-schools and institutions of basic education has increased 787 . These findings contrast with ECRI (the European Commission against Racism and Intolerance) observations, which recognised the efforts of the Latvian authority to integrate Roma into school, but which admonishes the fact that funds for the programme have been diverted. Further, according to the authorities in 2011, 1 182 Roma pupils were enrolled in Latvian schools; however the number of those attending would appear to be far lower. It has been indicated that 13.7 % do not complete basic education. Several reasons justify this: seasonal migration of parents; early marriage age for girls; and lack of sufficient transportation arrangements, especially for those groups that live in the countryside 788 . \uf0a7 Employment The national programme \u2018Roma in Latvia\u2019 2007 \u2013 09 has marginally focused on measures for employment, despite the initial intention. Researchers report very low levels of employment ranging from 1 % to 5 % among the Roma population and despite this very few members of the Roma community are registered as unemployed (10 %) with the State Employment Agency. ECRI has recommended to the government to undertake a programme against discrimination targeting employers.

Unofficial estimates suggest that the actual number of Roma in Lithuania range from 2 000 \u2013 4 000, with the Council of Europe estimating 3 000 Romani people accounting for 0.08 % of the population in July 2009 792 . Geographical distribution Roma were reportedly living throughout Lithuania according to the 2001 census with the largest number in the Kirtimai settlement located in the industrialised outskirts of the capital Vilnius and concentrated in some of the largest cities in Lithuania: Kaunas, Siauliai, Panev\u0117\u017eys and Klaip\u0117da. However, these are dynamic values as emigration, immigration and intra-country movement affect the number of Roma families in any location 793 . The majority of Lithuanian Roma is sedentary. According to survey data from 2008, more than half of the Roma respondents (52 %) indicated that they had been living in the same municipality for more than 20 years. Roma reportedly changed their type of residence more frequently than location. No data are available concerning itinerant Roma 794 . No regulated encampments exist in Lithuania and temporary encampments and halting sites are rare. There is also evidence of increased social marginalisation of Roma as they move into cheaper housing and therefore become more geographically and socially distant from urban centres and opportunities for social development 795 . Other Information (including highlights of data gaps) A wide range of national statistics are available in the areas of population and social statistics, including population composition, births, mortality, life expectancy, health, employment, income, living conditions, alcohol and tobacco consumption and culture. Much of this information can be broken down by factors such as age, gender, education and geographical location; however, it is not broken down by ethnicity. In general there is a lack of current and reliable information on the situation of Roma with respect to the target areas of this study. 791 The official number was 2 300 in 2009. [Online].

Barriers to accessing health care identified: Roma live in remote areas with poor infrastructure and lack of accessibility to public services 802 . Prevalence of Major chronic Diseases The study team has found no quantifications of this indicator. Anecdotal data and evidence cover the following: One study 803 suggests that Roma children are much more likely to self-assess their health as poor or very poor than the general population. It also found that the prevalence of chronic diseases in Roma children was less than that of the general population with the main diseases reported by the Roma children being bronchitis, neurodermitis, heart diseases and diseases of the immune system.

This study undertook a thorough assessment of the housing situation of Roma; much of the quantitative data was based on old data, however a number of issues arose: \uf0a7 Six programmes exist under the Lithuanian Housing Strategy covering assistance and social housing development but there is no information on the ability of Roma to access these programmes. \uf0a7 A much greater proportion of Roma are dependent on public housing compared to the Lithuanian population at large. \uf0a7 The mean size of a Roma household is several times larger than the national average. \uf0a7 To qualify the housing adaptation programme for people with disabilities, houses have to be legally constructed and have certain amenities which is likely to disqualify many Roma 806 . \uf0b7 The quality of existent housing for Roma is poor. \uf0a7 There are limited opportunities for Roma to legitimise their present form of housing, which may involve illegal construction works or dwellings on State- owned land, or to change one's place of residence. \uf0a7 There was a great shortage of rental housing, especially for low-income persons and families. In 2008, social housing accounted for only 2.7 % of the total housing stock. Social housing however was also not always a viable alternative for the Roma because it increased living costs and they found it difficult to afford. Additionally the location of settlements is not ideal \u2014 they tend to be remote and in the case of the Kirtimai settlement in Vilnius, located in an industrial and possibly polluted area (the Vilnius International Airport and several factories operate close to it), where, according to the general city plan, no dwelling should be allowed. Data from the Lithuanian Institute for Ethnic Studies shows persistent negative attitudes towards Roma with Roma consistently being voted the people least wanted as neighbours from 2005 to 2012 807 . Studies in 2008 and 2009 identified two main problems were with Roma housing in Lithuania: 1) the quality of the existent housing and 2) the opportunities to legitimise present housing (illegal structures and status of state land) or change the place of residence. Anecdotal data and evidence cover the following: Education Statistical data on the enrolment of Roma pupils at Lithuanian secondary schools show similar levels of matriculation in 2000\u201301 (571 pupils) and in 2008\u201309 (579 pupils). 808 Roma children reported little formal education with only 28 % of 231 surveyed in 2008 had any contact with school in the past 12 months.

Other Information (including highlights of data gaps) Luxembourg does not recognise the presence of minorities in its territory. Statistics on population are based on country of birth, citizenship and spoken language, therefore no census figures on ethnicity are provided. Data on Roma are retrieved from the number of requests of international protection. A permanent travelling lifestyle is not contemplated in the country\u2019s legal framework; as a consequence a nomadic population in Luxembourg can only reside in the country if they settle, adopting a sedentary lifestyle. No National Roma Integration Strategy has been put in place, but rather an integrated set of policy measures. Roma immigration to the country has then been treated as an ordinary one: Roma people are required to have a passport when needed, means to sustain themselves or apply for asylum. Luxembourg is defined as a new hosting country, which see controlled immigration as a means of dealing with potential labour shortages 811 . However administrative barriers complicate hiring of third-country nationals and some forms of discrimination have been reported in the labour market 812 . Statistics on Roma health conditions are not available, the main body dealing with integration in the country is the Office Luxembourgeois de l\u2019Accueil et de l\u2019Integration (OLAI), from which the study team has tried to unsuccessfully obtain data. 810 Council of Europe. 811 European Commission \u2014 DG Employment (2007) \u2018Feeding in\u2019 and \u2018Feeding out\u2019, and Integrating Immigrants and Ethnic Minorities Key lessons. 812 Council of Europe, ECRI Rapport (2012), [Online].

Public authorities are trying to provide economic support for households to obtain mortgages and the OLAI works to support refugees, immigrants and homeless foreigners through reception facilities.

As a result Malta has not adopted a national Roma integration strategy. Malta has traditionally been a country of emigration, but since its entrance to the EU, the country has become a destination for Northern African migrants. This form of immigration might become problematic, especially when a sizeable proportion of the migration is illegal. The extent of this illegal immigration is stretching the capacity of Maltese resources to manage immigration and hampering the observation of international humanitarian obligations. The country\u2019s respect of human rights has been the subject of scrutiny from EU Council 822 commissioners.

        "Report on the health status of the Roma population in the EU and monitoring data collection in the area of Roma health in the Member States August, 2014 169 Country Profile: the Netherlands Main Characteristics of the Roma in the Netherlands Demography The Council of Europe estimates that there are between 32 000 and 48 000 Roma in the Netherlands. Based on average figures (40 000), Roma make up 0.24 % of the total population. However, there are no official numbers from the last census, thus all figures are estimates 824 . However, according to a report by the European Commission (2010) there are 6 000 Roma in the Netherlands and most of them now have Dutch nationality. This report divides Roma into five groups; Dutch nationals (most of Roma), stateless people, political refugees, non-Dutch EU citizens and non-EU citizens 825 . The first mention of Roma in Netherlands was in 1420. New groups of Roma arrived in several immigration waves during the 1950s and 1960s from predominantly Yugoslavia and Hungary. Previous to this Roma were almost completely expelled due to new legislation. The Netherlands was one of the preferred countries in which to go and work abroad after the fall of the communist regimes in Eastern Europe 826 . There are two different ethnic groups of Roma heritage in Netherlands: \uf0a7 Travellers \u2014 who live in caravans and usually have their origins in the Netherlands. \uf0a7 Roma and Sinti \u2014 an ethnic group, which originates from outside of the Netherlands. Some Roma and Sinti live in caravans and others in houses. Language, culture and at times geographical origin and type of dwelling differentiate Roma and Sinti from Travellers. They often live in segregated small communities in around 100 municipalities across the country 827 . Geographical distribution Roma in the Netherlands can be divided into three different categories: \uf0a7 Roma 1900 \u2014 140 households \u2014 they arrived in around 1900 and live primarily in Noord-Brabant and Limburg and one family can be found living in Groningen. They live in caravans as they always have done and are not represented in any other regions. \uf0a7 Roma 1978 \u2014 arrived from Eastern Europe during the 1970s.

It is estimated that there are around 550 households. The majority have lived in houses since 1987 within one of the 12 designated host municipalities. The one exception is the municipality of Ede, where several households have been allocated a halting site. \uf0a7 Roma \u20181990\u2019 \u2014 is a small immigrant group of Roma in the Netherlands. They arrived in the 1990s as asylum seekers and refugees from Eastern Europe. However, their numbers are not known. This small group of Roma is less recognisable than other groups as they do not travel much and live in houses 828 . Other Information (including highlights of data gaps) According to the last official count (before 2000) the Traveller population is younger on average than the primary population. 69 % of Travellers were under 40, compared with the rest of the population at 54 % 829 . Collection of national data is centralised and is conducted by Statistics Netherlands. There are no indicators to suggest that the Netherlands (Statistics Netherlands) collect ethnically disaggregated data 830 . There are surprisingly very little official data as well as independent qualitative research on Roma communities in the Netherlands, in particularly on health. There are no indicators to suggest that research and other information sources distinguish between Roma groups based on differences in culture and/or geographic backgrounds. It is much more likely that Roma are differentiated based on their legal status within the Netherlands. Furthermore, large discrepancies in number of Roma in the Netherlands, as well as definition suggest that data is insufficient and unreliable. There are notable gaps in data collection for the following indicators: \uf0a7 Education; \uf0a7 Health; \uf0a7 Population; \uf0a7 Employment; \uf0a7 Household size and type (including overcrowding). Due to the lack of data collection concerning Roma in the Netherlands, this country research relies mostly on national statistics (or the lack thereof), European and regional commissioned studies, non-formal sources, such as NGOs, and reports by EU organisations as well as academic literature, which mainly provide qualitative information and/or an analysis of secondary sources. 828 Ibid. 829 Schriemer, R.

Prevalence of Major Infectious Diseases The study team has found no quantifications of this indicator. Healthy Lifestyles and Related Behaviours The study team has found no quantifications of this indicator. In 2012, the Trimbos Institute (Netherlands Institute of Mental Health and Addiction) conducted a qualitative study on truancy amongst Roma girls. The study was based on interviews with municipal representatives. A total of 27 Roma girls and parents participated in the study from 10 different cities. Some of the health problems identified in the report were; obesity, bad teeth, high levels of smoking, unhealthy lifestyles and psychological and psychosocial problems such as depression, anxiety, migraine and tensions 832 . Access and Use of Health Services and Prevention Programmes The study team has found no quantifications of this indicator. It has been reported that foremost the elderly and disabled are unfamiliar with services designed for them, thus make very little or no use of them 833 . According to Doktoers van de Wereld (Doctors of the World) health problems are faced by many Roma in the Netherlands. However, no further information is provided of what kind of health problems. The report informs of high level of stress due to discrimination and a limited knowledge of the health care system 834 . Doctors of the World conducted a study on Roma in the Netherlands between 2005 and 2009, called 'Roma and Sinti on the road... to a better welfare' ( Roma and Sinti op weg... naar een beter welzijn ).

        "Report on the health status of the Roma population in the EU and monitoring data collection in the area of Roma health in the Member States August, 2014 172 Many Roma have limited access to health care providers. There is a constant miscommunication between health practitioners and Roma due to lack of cultural sensitivity. Some issues within the Roma culture are taboo to talk about and thus some may not want to discuss their health worries. Moreover, many Roma are unaware of their medical rights and may not know where to go for assistance 836 . Further barriers, which limit Roma from accessing health care services have been identified as; income status, debts, language barriers and discrimination. In some instances it may be due to the lack of identity documents (and thus no health insurance) and/or lack of financial means to pay the medical bill (and hence further treatment) that act as barriers. Stateless Roma or those who lack legal documentation are unable to get medical insurance. Without medical insurance, the only way to access health care is to pay for it. However, even in those circumstances health providers might turn them away 837 . Prevalence of Major Chronic Diseases The study team has found no quantifications of this indicator. Health Factors Related to the Role of Women in the Roma Community The study team has found no quantifications of this indicator. According to the Raxen research, the uncertainty of halting sites creates feelings of insecurity about the future. Women also expressed frustration that the redistribution of free sites was carried out in a random way 838 . It is generally observed that Roma girls are likely to become mothers at a relatively young age 839 . Environmental and other Socio-Economic Factors The study team has found no quantifications of this indicator. Roma, Sinti and Travellers lag behind the rest of the population in health, education and employment levels. And political will seems to be lacking in tackling the discrimination and subordinate position of Roma, Sinti and Travellers in the Netherlands 840 . Housing Both the quantity and quality of caravans are insufficient, according to an advisor in caravan affairs at the Overijssel Support Office. Moreover, an article in the Het Wiel reported that almost half of Travellers would like to live in a caravan. People expressed their desire for a quality caravan with sufficient space, bedroom and study room for the children; that was exploitable and well isolated as well as having the possibility to obtain a mortgage 841 . 836 Ibid. 837 Ibid. 838 Schriemer, R.

It is believed that the majority of them live in houses and not caravans 842 . A study was conducted by the EU-SILC in 2007 on housing conditions of Roma, which included several variables such as shortage of space, adequate plumbing/water installations, dwelling equipped with heating/comfortable warm during winter/comfortable during summer/accessibility of grocery/banking/health care services/compulsory school to name a few. The study was based on an ad-hoc module. The study found that the Netherlands was one of the countries where most of the respondents were \u2018very dissatisfied\u2019 (64 %) 843 . Education According to an NGO report in 2002, 90 % of all Roma and Traveller children attended secondary school. However, a large percentage is enrolled in vocational training or special needs schools. The study was based on the analysis of quantitative data 844 . Another study reported that the educational needs of Roma children are unmet, which results in higher unemployment rates for Roma and Travellers compared to the rest of the population. Furthermore, Roma and Travellers tend to remain unemployed for longer periods of time. The study was based on the analysis of quantitative data 845 . According to the EU Network of independent experts on social inclusion (2011) the current issue with Roma education is not the enrolment of Roma and Sinti in primary education.

It is noted that several organisations representing this group have been established in recent years 848 . According the Council of Europe the number of Roma in Norway (presumably encompassing both sub-groups) is estimated to be 4 500\u201315 700 849 . According to a Government action plan from 2009, little information is available concerning the situation of the Roma for the period 1991 \u2013 99. When Norway was to consider the Council of Europe\u2019s Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities and which groups might be affected by the Convention, some Roma were contacted via teachers who had a certain amount of contact with the group. The Roma that the Norwegian authorities were then in contact with expressed a wish to be included in the Framework Convention as one of the five national minorities. In meetings with the Ministry, Roma have expressed a need for specific measures, such as support for self-organisation, for establishment of meeting places/points of contact and for literacy training via adult education 850 . During recent years, an increasing number of Roma have arrived in Norway, particularly from Romania. In response to an enquiry from the Council of Europe, the Norwegian authorities have informed then that no special measures have been established in relation to this group. The situation of this group of people, who support themselves, among other ways, by means of begging and busking, has been raised by the Equality and Anti-Discrimination Ombudsman 851 . 847 Ministry of Labour and inclusion (2009), Action Plan for improvement of the living conditions of Roma in Oslo.

        "Report on the health status of the Roma population in the EU and monitoring data collection in the area of Roma health in the Member States August, 2014 178 Country Profile: Poland Main Characteristics of the Roma in Poland Demography The first mention of Roma in Poland dates back to the beginning of the 15 th century. Poland hosted Roma who fled persecutions in neighbouring countries. Part of that population settled in Poland permanently, resulting in four main ethnic groups: \uf0a7 Carpathian Roma (Bergitka Roma), who came from Hungary and Slovakia during the 15 th century and who are sedentary; \uf0a7 Polish Roma who came mainly from Germany between the 16 th and the 18 th centuries; \uf0a7 Kelderari, who came mainly from Romania at the middle of the 19 th century and whose main profession was boiler making; \uf0a7 Lovari, who came in the same period of Kelderari, mainly from Romania and Hungary and whose main activities were as horse and textile salesmen. These groups are not homogenous although their internal differences are nevertheless not generally picked up by outside observers. Roma in Poland, as in other European countries, have experienced discrimination, racism and forced assimilation during the communist period and economic hardship after the end of it as their traditional skills have not been valued in a market economy. Recently ethnic minorities have been recognised under the Polish Constitution (1997) 856 . Roma constitutes one such minority. Although the Polish census system admits ethnicity as a variable 857 , the fact that the gathered data is based on respondents\u2019 self-assessment does not guarantee the certainty of the information obtained, given that because of fear of discrimination, ethnicity might not be declared. The National Population and Housing Census reports the Roma population being 12 731 individuals 858 , whereas the information provided by the territorial self-government entities, indicates that the Roma population is composed of 20 000 individuals. The Council of Europe estimates a population of 37 500 persons 859 , whereas a further study from the European Parliament (EP) claims that the Roma population might amount to a figure in between 20 000 and 60 000 individuals 860 . Population is almost equally distributed among men and women, with the former prevailing (+3.4 %). The Roma population in the country is very small compared to both the overall population of Poland (about 38.2 million persons), as well as in relation to the size of Roma populations in 856 Article 35 ensures that ethnic minorities are able to practice their own traditions and customs, and to use their own language. In addition the Law on National and Ethnic Minorities and Regional Language, known as the Minorities Law (January 2005) defines ethnic minorities as those minorities who do not have their own country. The law officially recognises nine National Minorities and four Ethnic Minorities. 857 \u2018Nationality \u2014 national or ethnic identity \u2014 is a declared (based on a subjective impression) individual feature of each person expressing his/her emotional or cultural relationship, or the one following from his/her parents\u2019 origin, to a specific nation or ethnic community\u2019.

        "Report on the health status of the Roma population in the EU and monitoring data collection in the area of Roma health in the Member States August, 2014 179 other Member States (i.e. Romania, between 1.2 million and 2.5 million persons; Spain between 600 000 and 800 000 persons 861 ). As a consequence of this minority status, little attention has traditionally been paid to Roma conditions. Only recently \u2014 since the beginning of the current century \u2014 has support for the integration of the Roma minority become a priority. This is due to the implementation of the Governmental programme for the Roma Community in Poland, established by the Council of Ministers on 19 August 2003, and implemented 2004 \u2013 13. Geographical distribution Roma populations tend to live in small communities, mostly in towns and cities. Enforced settlements during the 1960s reduced Roma nomadic groups\u2019 mobility; as a result 40 % of the Roma population has been living in a given locality permanently for at least 30 years 862 . The most recent estimates and analyses on the geographical distribution of the Roma population in Poland are based upon the information delivered by the territorial self-government entities. According to these entities, the population is spread across the country with the highest concentration \u2014 mainly Carpathian Roma \u2014 in the mountainous areas and in the Nowa Huta industrial district of the Southern Malopolskie region (3 500 persons), and in the south-eastern region of Upper Silesia (2 500 persons). Most of the Roma belonging to the three remaining groups live mainly in cities such as Warsaw (1 600), Lodz (1 200) and Poznan (600) and in a number of smaller towns, following the forced settlement policy 863 . Other Information (including highlights of data gaps) Even if statistics are based on ethnicity in Poland, precise quantitative data about Roma health status are not available. The EP study confirms this lack of data on the health situation of Roma in comparison with the national average health status 864 . Several explanations can be put forward for this lack of data. First of all, there are no special provisions for Roma within the general health policy. Second, although the national Programme for the Roma community provides possibilities for special health policies for Roma in coordination with the Ministry of Health, local governments and NGOs, this policy of the Programme \u2014 different from education 865 and employment 866 \u2014 does not have a dedicated department or a specific unit responsible for minority health issues and related monitoring. Third, the Polish health care system has been undergoing a period of reforms, which has not yet been responsive to the needs of vulnerable groups, the Roma health situation included 867 . As a result of this paucity of data, this country report mainly relies upon: 861 Ibid. 862 Soja, M. Zborowski, A.

Roma conditions in Poland have been improving during the last decade as a result of government action. There is a higher level of awareness regarding Roma conditions. However, there is a need for long-term follow-up of the Roma health situation in order to get a clearer picture of the Roma health status. The initiatives put in place (i.e. white days \u2014 please see below) seem not to be sustainable in the long-term, because they rely on local-level capabilities. These locally led initiatives help because actions targeting Roma are more effective when applied at micro level, but a national action plan for health would give direction in order to avoid fragmentation, making health institutions more accessible for Roma and systematise information and data about the variables that affect Roma health condition (e.g. housing and lifestyle). Mortality and Life Expectancy The study team has found no quantifications of this indicator, but anecdotal data and evidence cover the following: \uf0a7 The EP study on Roma situation across Europe 869 \u2014 based on NGOs and government agency opinions \u2014 states that Roma poverty results in higher infant mortality and shorter life expectancy. This is confirmed by the National Roma Integration Strategy (NRIS) 870 , which claims that serious illnesses, combined with economic poor conditions and difficulties in accessing free health services have increased Roma death rates and at the same time made the length of their life shorter compared to the rest of Polish society. Prevalence of Major Infectious Diseases The study team has found no quantifications of this indicator. Anecdotal data and evidence cover the following: \uf0a7 According to the Programme for the Roma community, based on the information passed on by the representatives of the Roma community, the Roma population have been affected by diseases such as hepatitis B or tuberculosis as a consequence of living in socially devastated housing estates and homes. \uf0a7 Some very specific information was produced after a local indigenous outbreak of measles in a Roma community in Pulawy (eastern Poland). From 22 June to 30 August 2009, 32 measles cases were reported, and additionally nine possible cases were actively identified. A mass immunisation campaign was organised to stop measles transmission in that Roma community 871 (see the section on Access and Use of Health Services and Prevention). 868 Consultation with Agnieszka Gajewska, Chief Specialist.

        "Report on the health status of the Roma population in the EU and monitoring data collection in the area of Roma health in the Member States August, 2014 181 Healthy Lifestyles and Related Behaviours There are no specific studies or information about Roma lifestyle and behaviour. The only information retrieved from the NRIS 872 is related to poor diet and living conditions (see the section on Environmental and other Socio-Economic Factors), which both have an impact on Roma health status. Access and Use of Health Services and Prevention Programmes There is a widespread agreement regarding the limited level of access to and use of health services in the Polish Roma community. Both institutional documents and academic literature emphasise this problem. Less clear cut are the justifications for Roma being under-represented as patients in the health and social care systems. Research based on interviews with experts and practitioners from a range of health agencies in Krakow and Warsaw points out that the lack of trust of the Roma population in non-Roma individuals and the tradition of taking care of their problems within their own community limit use of the public health system. In addition, access to social services requires residency registration, which in the case of Roma might represent a deterrent, given their nomadic habits 873 . Moreover, the Polish health system has recently shifted towards a more private approach; and the poor economic conditions faced by the Roma community represent a further obstacle to health care, when services have to be paid for. Indeed, results from health projects funded by the Programme for Roma show a good level of participation when services are free, and also when they are directly implemented on site, tailor-made according to Roma cultural values and supported by family and community leaders. The information collected at project level from the districts\u2019 authorities show that: \uf0a7 There were 33 nurses working specifically with Roma in 2009, 23 in 2010 and 33 in 2011. These nurses provide direct medical help, carry out medical guidance service and also deal with distribution of medicines and personal hygiene products purchased from subsidies; \uf0a7 There were 40 health screening sessions named \u2018white days\u2019 with doctors of different specialisms, giving free medical advices were 18 in 2010 and 23 in 2011; \uf0a7 Immunisation and preventative examinations and vaccinations covered respectively: 1 526 patients in 2009; 2 098 in 2010 and 2 182 in 2011 874 . The necessity of small-scale actions at district level to collect data on Roma and improve health conditions is illustrated by the success of the immunisation campaign launched in Pulawy. This was directed at the Roma residents, between the ages of nine months and 60 years. The invitation \u2014 in the Polish language \u2014 was disseminated to the Roma community leaders, and through primary health units in Pulawy. It was held at a primary health care centre in the proximity of the Roma community. There was a very high level of responsiveness: from approximately 300 Roma registered at the municipality of Pulawy, 195 (102 individuals under the age of 20 years and 93 adults) attended the vaccination point and 138 (55 individuals under the age of 20 years and 83 adults) received a dose of combined measles, mumps and rubella vaccine.

Health Factors Related to the Role of Women in the Roma Community The study team has found no quantifications of this indicator. \uf0a7 According to the NRIS 876 , there is no tradition of the prevention and monitoring of pregnant women in Roma communities. Addressing this lack of pre-natal care could help to cure children\u2019s congenital defects in early stages. \uf0a7 However, an FRA survey has compiled information specifically on the health of Roma women. It noted that Polish Roma women aged 50 and over reported the highest incidence of \u2018bad\u2019 health within the 11 EU Member States covered. 75 % of these Roma women declared themselves to be in \u2018bad\u2019 or \u2018very bad\u2019 health compared to 41 % of non- Roma 877 . Environmental and other Socio-Economic Factors \uf0a7 Housing Anecdotal data and evidence cover the following: \uf0a7 There are no recent official and non-official data on housing conditions of Roma. The last estimation was carried out in 2000 at district level. There is also lack of quantitative research on the impact of housing conditions on education, employment and health 878 . Nevertheless, qualitative studies based on interviews acknowledge that many poor Roma families live in sub-standard housing or in barracks 879 and because of prejudice it is difficult for them to acquire their own houses. This is also confirmed by the NRIS 880 which states that the Roma's health problems appear to be a result of bad, and in many cases catastrophic housing situations \u2014 no water-supply, sewage system, no heating in the homes and poor technical conditions of heating systems. \uf0a7 Education The data reported in the NRIS on Roma are based on a study carried out in 1997. These data are outdated when considering that the Roma programme has, since 2004, been mainly aimed at educational and schooling issues. Indeed, according to the EP study the number of successful Roma pupils and students has apparently increased, despite a situation characterised by high drop-out rates due to episodes of exclusion, language barriers and long-term travelling.

The first written evidence of the presence of \u2018Gypsies\u2019 in Portugal dates from 1521. Four years later, in 1525 they were forbidden to enter the Portuguese kingdom; followed by new laws and subsequent trials leading to convictions and deportation to Africa (Angola was the first Portuguese colony that received Roma) and Brazil. New legislation continued to be introduced against \u2018Gypsies\u2019 until after 1640, when the kingdom was in a state of war and needed men for the army. As many Roma enlisted, the group's presence was tolerated, albeit with the imposition of rules. In the early 18th century measures of gypsy expulsion returned under penalty of arrest. Citizenship for \u2018Gypsies\u2019 was eventually recognised in 1822 and Portugal became one of the favoured destinations for migration following the fall of the former communist regimes. Usually men go first, and then their wives and children. Preferred jobs are in construction, agriculture, trade and services. Generally only a minority of these Roma settle permanently as colonies; a significant proportion prefer to invest earned money in their homelands, in the construction of family houses, in buying land, animals and cars and in developing their own business. 886 The Portuguese Constitution forbids the collection of data based on ethnic origin, including in the census, therefore it is only possible to estimate the number of Roma in the country. The Health in Europe survey estimated that in 2008 there were 33 338 Roma in Portugal 887 ; the RAXEN housing report quoted a range of 40 000 \u2013 50 000 888 ; the National Roma Integration Strategy 889 claimed there were 40 000 \u2013 60 000 Roma; and the Council of Europe estimated that there were 40 000 \u2013 70 000 Roma in Portugal in 2009, accounting for 0.52 % of the population. 890 Overall this results in a range of 30 000 \u2013 70 000. The Roma Communities are characterised by a gender imbalance in favour of the women (52.9 % vs 47.1 %), reflective of the Portuguese population a whole; and are generally young (60 % under the age of 25 years) unlike the general Portuguese population which follows the inverted population pyramid with more people in the older age groups 891 .

Many were also living in Alentejo (especially in the District of Beja) and Tr\u00e1s-os-Montes 892 . Other Information (including highlights of data gaps) The Portuguese health systems consists of: \uf0a7 the National Health Service (NHS) providing universal coverage to all citizens with the payment of a symbolic fee for medical appointments, treatments and surgery; exempting people with low income or on disability pensions; \uf0a7 health sub-systems, accounting for 25 % of the population, where special/social health insurance schemes cover certain professions; \uf0a7 voluntary private health insurance and mutual funds, covering 10 % and 7 % of the population respectively 893 . However, Portugal was part of a comprehensive data collection and analysis of Roma health in Europe 894 , published in 2009 and covering 1 673 Roma of both genders and including adults and children. Portugal therefore is one of the few countries in which relatively recent data is available on the Roma. However, the analysis highlighted the poor quality of the information available on the Roma Communities and the difficulty in defining a representative sample. The report also indicated that, in 2008, the National Policy for Inclusion did not consider the Roma a priority group and that there was a need for a mainstreaming strategy for the Roma Community that defined integrated and overarching policies in a variety of areas including education, health, housing, justice, employment and professional training to effectively facilitate access to basic goods and services and to the exercise of full citizenship. With the objective of promoting multi-culturalism, ACIDI supports, at various levels, the undertaking of initiatives and cultural events that contribute to raising public awareness on integration and welcoming immigrants and the Roma community in Portuguese society including festivals, exhibitions, publications and documentaries. The Office for the Roma Communities \u2014 GACI, was created in 2007 and has developed a set of activities working with responsible organisations in the fields of education, housing, employment/training and health. Its strategic lines of intervention are: \uf0a7 Mobilising and empowering Roma communities; \uf0a7 Promoting social inclusion; \uf0a7 Facilitating the coordination of existing resources; \uf0a7 Promoting active citizenship; \uf0a7 Promoting the dissemination and sharing of information; \uf0a7 Disclosing the history and the cultural heritage; \uf0a7 Promoting coordination with national and international organisations. 895 Mortality and Life Expectancy The study team has found no quantifications of this indicator. 892 Romaninet, (2007), A multi-media Romani course for promoting linguistic diversity and improving social dialogue: Report on Roma people. 893 Health and the Roma Community: analysis of the situation in Europe. 894 Ibid. 895 ACIDI, [Online].

        "Report on the health status of the Roma population in the EU and monitoring data collection in the area of Roma health in the Member States August, 2014 187 Prevalence of Major Infectious Diseases The study team has found no quantifications of this indicator. Healthy Lifestyles and Related Behaviours Tobacco consumption is high in adults with 30.1 % stating that they are smokers. This is highest amongst younger men, unlike in the general population where there are more smokers between the ages of 35 and 44. Alcohol consumption however is low, with only 37 % reporting having consumed alcoholic beverages in the past 12 months. Additional evidence indicates that there is a high prevalence of regular TV viewing amongst children, especially amongst girls in the 10 to 15 age group; and there is very little physical activity amongst the Roma (33 % do not take part in any form of activity though children are more active than the over 16s, possibly because the latter are required to undertake physical activity as part of their schooling). Roma diets are high in breads/cereals (89.8 %) and pasta/rice (84.7 %) but low in vegetables (18.3 %), legumes (12.9 %) and fish (3.4 %). This combination of unhealthy diet and inactivity manifest in a gradual tendency to gain weight after the age of 16. Overall 41.1 % of Roma are overweight and 13.7 % are obese. Anecdotal data and evidence cover the following: A genetic study into mutations that cause the maple syrup urine disease (MSUD), a rare autosomal recessive disorder of branched-chain amino acid metabolism, found that a high proportion of patients are of Gypsy origin and all share the same mutation that causes the neo-natal severe form of MSUD. These results are of medical relevance since carrier tests and pre-natal diagnosis can be offered to families at risk, particularly because the carrier frequency of the mutation was estimated at 1.4 % among the healthy Portuguese Gypsies from the south of the country 896 . Access and Use of Health Services and Prevention Programmes Most of the Roma interviewed in the Health and the Roma report 897 were covered by the NHS. Most Roma consider their health to be good (82 %). This is especially prevalent for the younger age groups, in contrast to the over-65s, many of whom consider their health status to be mediocre (25 %) or poor (13.5 %). The most commonly used medications are for colds/flu, fever and/or pain in both adults and children; and especially use of antibiotics and diarrhoea medication in children. These are mostly self-prescribed (55.8 %) rather than physician-prescribed (44.2 %). 898 Data on the frequency of visits to physicians indicate, in decreasing order of frequency, the most frequent visits were: \uf0a7 More than two weeks but less than a month ago: 43.8 % minors, 48.6 % adults; \uf0a7 Annual: more than one month but less than one year ago: 25.5 % minors, 896 Quental et al (2009), Revisiting MSUD in Portuguese Gypsies: Evidence for a Founder Mutation and for a Mutational Hotspot within the BCKDHA Gene, Annals of Human Genetics, 897 Health and the Roma Community: analysis of the situation in Europe, 898 Ibid, ",

The type of health service provider that Roma visit depends on the reason for the visit \u2014 for check-ups they go to Health Centres with follow-up at hospital out-patients while for other reasons they go to emergency departments at hospitals. Most people seen at hospital did not require any surgery (66 %) and over the past 12 months 73 % of Roma had requested emergency services (at both health centres and hospitals). Repeated use of emergency services within the past 12 months was also common, indicating that medical services are used only in need rather than for routine or on-going care and treatment. Roma men reported having more check-ups than women. Prevalence of Major Chronic Diseases The Health and the Roma Community: analysis of the situation in Europe found that the most prevalent diseases were: \uf0a7 asthma and chronic bronchitis (25 %); \uf0a7 high cholesterol (15 %); \uf0a7 high blood pressure (11 %). Amongst the general population high blood pressure was the most prevalent medical condition; respiratory diseases were not of reported significance. The high prevalence of respiratory diseases in the Roma population is closely related to the poor housing conditions experienced by this group. In a measure of limitations to daily activity, only 10 % of Roma reported having to reduce their main activity in the past two weeks of which incidence was higher amongst minors (10.5 %) mainly due to fever (69.4 %) and colds, pain and sore throats (30.6 %). Temporary incapacity was high amongst women (10.3 %) especially in the over 45 age group. Main reasons for incapacity were headaches (37.5 %); nervousness, depression and difficulty sleeping (33.4 %); bone, spinal cord or joint pain (32.3 %). However more members of the general population report being on temporary leave than the Roma (12 % vs 10 %). A high percentage of Roma reported dental problems, especially the adults (95 %) which could be due to most dental services being private unlike the NHS. Health Factors Related to the Role of Women in the Roma Community Most Roma women had given birth (86 %) especially in the younger age bracket of 16 to 29 years. Though teenage pregnancies were common there were indications of changing practice when it came to early pregnancies but regular gynaecological check- ups remain infrequent: 24 % of Roma women had never had a check-up, especially in the 16 \u2013 29 age group. Women generally visited the gynaecologist during pregnancy but 43 % only went once during the entire pregnancy with only 22 % reporting attending every two months. Roma women also visited the gynaecologist for the following reasons: \uf0a7 counselling family planning: 43.8 % (mainly in the age group 16 \u2013 29); \uf0a7 gynaecological problem: 31.3 %; \uf0a7 periodic check-up: 25 %.

Uptake of preventative screening was low with most women never having had a mammogram ordered by a specialist (76.8 %) or a smear test (87.1 %) 899 . Roma women aged 50 years and over also believe that they are in worse health than non-Roma women of the same age group. This is represented in a survey on self- declared health by FRA which shows that 70 % of Roma women state they are in \u2018bad\u2019 or \u2018very bad\u2019 health compared with 35 % for non-Roma women 900 . Anecdotal data and evidence cover the following: Families and the people one lives with are important to the Roma. The birth of children, especially the first son is of great importance to Roma families \u2014 for men it is a symbol of being a true householder with autonomous authority; for a woman the birth of a son, gives her greater influence and power and removes her to some extent from the control of her mother-in-law 901 . Environmental and other Socio-Economic Factors Housing The right to adequate housing is in the Portuguese Constitution and housing has been targeted by the Portuguese government for a number of years; however Roma were not specifically targeted. The RAXEN report found varying estimates of the housing situation for Roma depending on which study was considered: 31 % of Roma were found to be living in \u2018precarious conditions\u2019 in 2001 according to figures from SOS Racismo; 16 % in 2008 based on data from the Centre for Territorial Studies (CET) and 18 % based on data from National Work on Roma Pastoral 902 . The findings of the interviews conducted for Health and the Roma Community: analysis of the situation in Europe 903 in 2008, report a much higher figure of 52.5 % (out of 367 households interviewed, covering 1 673 people) living in sub-standard housing, and in unsanitary and unhygienic conditions. Whatever the estimate, when compared to national statistics on the general population, the percentage of Roma living in poor housing conditions was always above the national average of approximately 0.8 % 904 . The RAXEN study indicates a shortage of quantitative data in a number of areas relating to housing including numbers of Roma living in unregulated encampments or in segregated settings; household type and setting; access to private and social housing; forced evictions and access to public utilities; or on the housing situation facing Roma from other EU states. Qualitative data and anecdotal evidence however indicate the poor living conditions and continued discrimination faced by the Roma, including lack of access to public utilities such as water; arbitrary and forced evictions; and fabricated legal charges. 905,906 Roma are thought to have benefited from housing 899 Ibid. 900 FRA (2013). \u2018Analysis of FRA Roma survey results by gender\u2019. 901 Romaninet (2007), A multi-media Romani course for promoting linguistic diversity and improving social dialogue: Report on Roma people. 902 Portugal RAXEN National Focal Point Thematic Study Housing Conditions of Roma and Travellers. 903 Health and the Roma Community: analysis of the situation in Europe. 904 Portugal RAXEN National Focal Point Thematic Study Housing Conditions of Roma and Travellers. 905 Ibid.

Education Educational attainment is poor with 52.3 % not having any academic achievements and 36.9 % being totally illiterate. Only 38.3 % of the adult population has completed primary school and only 0.4 % had completed secondary education. However 66 % of children interviewed were currently in the school system 908 . Marked gender differences are found in Roma education with only 55 % of Roma women literate compared with 77 % of Roma men (aged 16 and over). This is the largest gap regarding literacy in Roma populations in the EU. However, literacy rates for Roma aged 16 \u2013 24 years have increased the most in the EU with the gender difference decreasing (88 % among Roma women v 93 % among Roma men) 909 .

Country Profile: Romania Main Characteristics of the Roma in Romania Demography 2011 census: 619 000 persons declared themselves Roma (535 140 in 2002 census), which represents 3.2 % of the total population. The latest representative estimation in 2009 estimated the number of Roma to be around 1 850 000, which represents 8.32 % of the total population. Currently, Roma leaders and Roma NGOs estimate that the unofficial number of Roma people in Romania is approximately 2.5 million. On average, Roma people are more likely to be younger than the national majority population living in their close proximity 912 , with a birth rate evaluated at 1.26 % by the Social Observatory for Roma \u2014 Bucharest University. The average household size is 4.25. If we take the age category 30 \u2013 59 as the comparison unit, we can see that: \u2013 For each Roma household member aged 30\u201359, there are 0.2 elderly members, while for each non-Roma household member aged 30\u201359, there are 0.5 elderly members. \u2013 The situation is reversed when analysing the younger family members: each Roma household member aged 30\u201359 is accompanied by an average of 0.4 pre-school children, 0.8 children aged 7 \u2013 17 and 0.7 young adults aged 18 \u2013 29 913 . Poverty rate: significantly bigger than that of the majority population or that of other ethnicities, even during years with the best economic performances: 31.1 % compared to 5.0 % in 2008 914 . In 2005, around 60 % of Roma communities are poor and that more than 50 % of Roma individuals live in these communities 915 . Amnesty International even considers that 75 % of Roma are living in poverty. Finally, a recent survey showed that 81 % of respondent Roma are living in households at risk of poverty vs 41 % for non-Roma 916 . 912 Masseria, C., P. Mladovsky, C.

        "Report on the health status of the Roma population in the EU and monitoring data collection in the area of Roma health in the Member States August, 2014 192 Geographical distribution According to the 2011 census, the rate of Roma population was about 3.2 %. The persons of Roma origin make up 3.2 % of the total stable population, with a relatively uniform territorial distribution and percentages ranging between 1.1 % in Boto\u015fani County and 8.8 % in Mure\u015f County. There are relatively higher percentages of persons of Roma origin, of over 6.0 % of the stable population, in C\u0103l\u0103ra\u015fi (8.1 %), S\u0103laj (6.9 %) and Bihor (6.1 %). Other Information (including highlights of data gaps) With sample limits, it was still possible to cover almost all types of indicators (missing: F1). As it was observed in some European surveys, Romanian data are sometimes missing or not included in the comparative reports. Consequently, there is some particular information that is not available (i.e. depression or drug use). There are indicators on access/barriers to health care services, vaccination and health assessment, even if based on subjects\u2019 responses, the medical infrastructure serving Roma communities is generally adequate and accessible 917 . 62.8 % of the sample had taken medicines in the two weeks prior to the interview and significant differences were observed in terms of gender and age brackets. Among adults, three out of four women and one out of two men had taken medicines and consumption increases with age 918 . More generally, many surveys cover indicators on access/barriers to health care services but not on specific diseases. Mortality and Life Expectancy Concerning the indicators on life expectancy (A3): \uf0a7 In one source we have 6 years lower for Roma than the EU average 919 but the reference date is unspecified. \uf0a7 According to respectively the Social Observatory for Roma (Bucharest University) and the World Bank, life expectancy is 12 years lower for Roma than the majority (Roma population61 years; majority of the population73 years). \uf0a7 In another source from 2011 (Social Observatory for Roma \u2014 Bucharest University), the mortality rate is with 1.83 % higher than by non-Roma with 1.28 %. As to the infant mortality (A1) indicators for Roma, one source 920 mentions that it is one of the highest in Europe. According to another source from 2011 (Social Observatory for Roma \u2014 Bucharest University), the infant mortality rate is with 2.31 % higher than by non-Roma with 1.36 %. 917 Wamsiedel, M. et al., (2009), Health and Roma community \u2014 analysis of the situation in Romania, Fundacion Secretariado Gitano, Madrid, 2009. 918 Ibid. 919 Report \u2018Roma Inclusion in Romania, \u2018From 2012, conducted by Children\u2032s Early Development Services (IRSDTC), sponsored by the Open Society, Roma Education Fund and UNICEF, [Online].

Prevalence of Major Infectious Diseases Unfortunately, no indicators were found either on hepatitis A, B and C nor on HIV (B3, B4, B5, B6) or syphilis or chlamydia. No official statistics or research findings have been found in Romania about drug use or sex work \u2014 among the principal risk factors associated with HIV transmission in the region \u2014 for different Roma communities 921 . In a 2003 survey, Roma women in Romania were less aware of the means of HIV transmission than non-Roma women. For example, four times as many Roma women did not know that HIV/AIDS can be transmitted by unprotected heterosexual intercourse. Unfortunately, it is very limited in scope (it is a rapid assessment survey) and cannot be generalised to the wider Roma population 922 . The indicators on the rate of tuberculosis (B1) come from 2006 and 2010 923 . \uf0a7 Roma communities are ten times more vulnerable to TB than the Romanian average. The data is unfortunately not specified in its source. \uf0a7 Romania has the highest incidence TB rate in Central and Eastern Europe 924 and the largest number of yearly paediatric TB cases in all Europe 925 . According to the WHO report, the number of TB cases among Roma in Bucharest was estimated to 1 023.7/100 000 inhabitants in 2001 926 . In Osorhei, a Roma community, most children have respiratory problems and anaemia; 90 % have parasites; 60 % have TB and, due to low access to medical care, there have been cases of death by TB 927 . The vaccination (B) rate of children (no age specified) 928 : \uf0a7 45.7 % of the Roma children did not benefit of the mandatory and free-of- charge vaccines included in the National Immunisation Programme and more than 50 % of them did not benefit of any vaccines.

Data from measles outbreak in 2010 reveals overrepresentation of Roma among the diagnosed cases. ECDC data from 2010 reveals that 37.5 % of the laboratory confirmed cases were among Roma patients 930 . Another technical report (2012) from the ECDC pointed out over 8 000 reported outbreaks of measles and rubella that started among unvaccinated members of Roma and Sinti communities and spread to the general population (Romania 2004 \u2013 07). Healthy Lifestyles and Related Behaviours Unfortunately, in one major comparative survey, there was no data on indicators on the use of drug use (C2), alcohol (C3) and tobacco (C4) among the Roma: there are no data for Romania because that question was not on the field work questionnaire. 931 In terms of drug use among Roma, one cannot talk about ethnic identity but drug users. In 2011, according to the annual report of the National Agency against Drugs, the number of injecting drug users who had access in 2010 to syringe exchange services was very high. NGOs have offered assistance in the frame of the project, Prevention and care of HIV/AIDS among injecting drug users in community and prisons in Romania, developed with technical and financial support provided by the United Nations report on Drugs and Crime, Romania as follows 932 : We identified one document making reference to indicator on smoking (C4) among the Roma population 933 : \uf0a7 Roma women had 5.2 times the odds (P < 0.01) of continued smoking vs non- smoking 934 . \uf0a7 A much higher percentage of the smokers were of Roma ethnicity (16 %) compared to the quitters (2 %) and non-smokers (1 %). Another original finding is the very high rate of pre-pregnancy (82 %) and continuous smoking (67 %) among Roma pregnant women 935 . For obesity and overweight (C5) we identified two concordant sources 936 : \uf0a7 One out of every two adults is either overweight or obese. \uf0a7 Overweight = 26.5 % and Obesity = 16.9 %.

As to their nutritional habits (C), Roma people have a relatively varied diet but it is calorifically unbalanced. Bread, cereals and similar products are consumed on a daily basis by 86.9 % of the population; the second category of food products in the ranking is pasta and rice which are consumed daily by 63.3 % of the population. The heavy consumption of cereal-based products accounts for excess weight. The study also showed relatively low consumption of fish, eggs and meat leading to a deficit in animal protein, saturated fatty acids and phosphorous 939 . Access and Use of Health Services and Prevention Programmes An important role for the improvement of access to health to the community is played by the health mediation programme established in 1996 by a Roma NGO \u2014 Romani Criss. The purpose was to enable access by the Roma communities to the health care services through the services provided by the Roma health mediator (RHM), who had to satisfy a set of minimum education requirements, to know the relevant Roma community and to be accepted by that community, to know the Romani language, etc. The Romanian health mediation programme is characterised by strong leadership from Romani Criss and ongoing cooperation between this NGO and the government of Romania. With the exception of one year, the programme has grown steadily with increasing numbers of RHMs trained and employed, and the degree of institutionalisation growing over time. To support the growing number of Roma Health Mediators, in 2006 Romani Criss established a network of regional centres to monitor and provide programmatic assistance to RHMs. Roma health mediation was further institutionalised in Romania when the National Council for the Professional Training of Adults approved occupational standards for health mediation in 2007 940 . Regarding the activities carried out by the health mediators, according to the Impact analysis carried out by Sastipen Association, the overstrain is visible not only by analysing the number of Roma areas they cover, but also by analysing the number of beneficiaries: more than 1 400 Roma on average (according to Order 619/2002 released by the Minister for Health, the health mediator mediates for 500 \u2013 750 people). Also, at national level, according to national reports from the Minister for Health, 788 Roma health mediators were hired before 2007. Although the project of sanitary mediation in the Roma communities was considered a successful project, it is under the risk of dissolution due to the absence of financing and lack of interest from the local public authorities to ensure the access to basic health care services in Roma communities 941 . 937 UNDP/WB/EC regional Roma survey 2011, presented by: de Laat, J., B.

        "Report on the health status of the Roma population in the EU and monitoring data collection in the area of Roma health in the Member States August, 2014 196 Over 40 % of respondents aged 35 to 54 declared living with health problems that limit their daily activities 942 . In one survey, 943 the sample gave a positive assessment of health status (D). 79.8 % of the respondents declared their health to be either good or very good whereas only 4.6 % considered that they were in a bad or very bad state of health. If positive self- assessment of health status is a common trend in quantitative studies focusing on the Roma population \u2014 similar previous research conducted in Romania is consistent in this respect, however qualitative studies, as well as the analysis of objective indicators of health status, contradict these self-assessments and point to a series of structural problems preventing access to quality health services 944 . Access to medical health insurance (D) There are many reasons for the weakness of Roma\u2019s access to health insurance in Romania, which are only very briefly contextualised in the following lines. On the one hand it starts with information and communication difficulties to be aware of such medical protection. On the other hand the financial aspect plays an important role since Roma households are relatively poor and cannot prioritise budgeting for such insurance. Moreover, some attitudes of self-confidence, modesty and mistrust towards State institutions prevent Roma persons from demanding health cover and remain dependent on their own resources and communities instead of looking for help from third parties. Consequently, one important related problem to this limited access is for example the over-reliance on emergency health care, i.e. Roma people who don\u2019t have insurance are using, in extreme situations of sickness, the emergency units of hospitals where staff is already overloaded and not prepared for chronic diseases. \uf0a7 The records of the Ministry of Health showed that in 2002, only 34 % of Roma benefited from health insurance, compared to the national average amounting to 75 % 945 . Only 50 % of respondents aged 18 and above declared having medical insurance, compared to 80 % in national population 946 . 44.3 % of Roma have never accessed dental services and one fifth who needed medical care were denied and have not received a reason 947 . \uf0a7 9 % of Roma and 4.5 % of the majority population in a comparative sample are not registered with a family doctor 948 . implemented by SASTIPEN named \u2018Health Mediation Programme: Opportunity for increasing the employment rate amongst roman women\u2019, www.sastipen.ro 942 FRA Roma pilot survey 2011. 943 Wamsiedel, M. et al., (2009), Health and Roma community \u2014 analysis of the situation in Romania, Fundacion Secretariado Gitano, Madrid. 944 Ibid. 945 Report \u2018Roma Inclusion in Romania \u2018From 2012, conducted by Children\u2032s Early Development Services (IRSDTC), sponsored by the Open Society, Roma Education Fund and UNICEF, [Online].

Environmental and other Socio-Economic Factors There are no longitudinal comparable data on the environmental and the socio- economic status of the Roma in Romania. However, some studies illustrate this issue. \uf0a7 After including socio-economic variables, Roma had a significantly higher probability of reporting chronic conditions. For the probability of feeling threatened by illness because of unhygienic circumstances, being Roma was a main determinant 964 . \uf0a7 Employment With regard to Roma persons presence on the labour market, the recent survey conducted within project EU Inclusive 965 shows a low level of Roma employment by comparison with the national employment rate \u2014 35 % as opposed to 58 % in the group of age of over 15 years old and \u2018a high percentage of unstable jobs, which are not providing continuity and stability\u2019.

With regard to illiteracy, 25 % of Roma individuals of over 16 years old declare that they do not know to read and write, the most affected persons being the adults living in rural environments and in segregated compact communities. The research also shows that the number of illiterate Roma women is 10 % bigger than the number of illiterate Roma men 975 . Pre-school attendance rate of Roma children aged 3 \u2013 6: 36.8 % (vs 77.1 % national average). Roma children are placed mainly in \u2018Romani nursery schools \u2019 where all or almost all of the children are Roma. These facilities tend to be poorly equipped and lack qualified staff. They often do not engage children in cognitive activities and fail to involve Roma communities and parents 976 . Another study concerning children aged 4 to the starting age of compulsory education attending pre-school or nursery school shows similar results with only 45 % of Roma children vs 75 % for non-Roma 977 . Furthermore, only 10 % of household members had at least completed general or vocational upper-secondary education (vs 65 % non-Roma) 978 . Moreover, literacy levels of Roma men and women are in the lowest in European Roma populations, at 76 % and 64 % respectively 979 . This study also states that nearly 20 % and nearly 30 % of Roma men and women respectively never went to school.

Estimations vary from 320 000 to 500 000 Roma people in Slovakia. In official census from 2001 only 89 920 declared to be of Roma origin 984 . However, the estimations were around 380 000 Roma people who were present in Slovakia 985 . In the official Census from 2011 there was an increase in the official number of Roma people in Slovakia, as 105 700 respondents declared themselves to be of Roma origin 986 . Geographical distribution It is estimated that 60 % of Roma people are fully integrated in the majority population and are living in towns or villages. The remaining 40 % of Roma live in municipal concentrations: settlements close to the municipalities or distant from the municipalities, e.g. separated by a natural barrier (river, woods) 987 . Most of the Roma people are located in eastern and south-eastern parts of Slovakia. There are several localities in western Slovakia where Roma are living either in towns, or villages. The majority of Roma live in the regions of Pre\u0161ov, Ko\u0161ice and Bansk\u00e1 Bystrica 988 . Other Information (including highlights of data gaps) Generally, there is lack of any official data on the Roma population in Slovakia. This is due to the fact that State authorities are not allowed to collect data determined by ethnicity and therefore the situation of Roma people in Slovakia is not thoroughly mapped and analysed. However, in the 1990s it was possible to collect such kinds of data. There have been several surveys specifically targeting the Roma population, but they only collected data determined by socio-economic status or the level of social exclusion/marginalisation. Moreover, information on integrated Roma people is even more difficult to collect. Among the four key areas of Roma integration, health status and access to health is the area with least available official statistics. Therefore this report is mostly based on data and information gathered in an informal way and by various NGOs or international organisations.

Mortality and Life Expectancy Compared to the majority population, Roma live shorter and have higher mortality rates. Infant mortality in the Roma population is around 2 % whereas in the majority population it is 0.8 %. It is estimated that Roma people live 10 \u2013 15 years less than the majority population 989 , which is mostly due to their poor living conditions. Life expectancy of Roma in settlements is estimated to be around nine years shorter than in the majority population. Infant mortality rates are 2 \u2013 3 times higher in segregated communities than in the general majority population 990 . Moreover, Roma people have more children. Young people comprise of around 43 % of the overall Roma population, whereas among the majority population their share is lower, namely around 25 %. The average age of Roma men varies from 55 years to 64 years, and in the case of women, from 59 to 71 years 991 . Only 2 % of the Roma population reach age above 65 years compared to 12.2 % of the majority population. The largest gap in life expectancy is present in segregated and secluded areas of Roma settlements with poor living conditions. It is estimated that mortality rates in such settlements is twice or three times higher compared to the integrated Roma people. Also the mortality rates of Roma children and youth are higher compared to the majority population. There are several factors that influence the life expectancy of Roma people and according to research they can be summarised as follows: \uf0a7 Lower education level (around 3 % of the Roma population does not complete any formal education compared to 0 % among the majority; literacy rate is 97 % whereas in case of the majority population it goes up to 100 %; Roma people, especially from segregated areas, complete their compulsory education and fall out of the school system). \uf0a7 Inadequate awareness raising. \uf0a7 Low standard of living, housing, community hygiene, ecologically risky environment etc. \uf0a7 Unhealthy eating habits and low physical activity. \uf0a7 Occurrence of alcohol, tobacco and drug abuse 992 (around 64 % of Roma people above 16 years are users of tobacco compared to 39 % of the majority population; far more men are tobacco users, around 62.4 % compared to women 44.6 %, among the Roma population in Slovakia) Prevalence of Major Infectious Diseases According to the available data and information, Roma have quite low vaccination rates against infectious diseases, such as hepatitis B (the vaccination rate among Roma children is 59.2 % compared to 99 % in the majority), measles (62.2 % among Roma children and 98.4 % among the majority population), rubella (48.3 % among Roma children and 98.4 among children from the majority), tetanus (64,5 % among 989 Regional office of public health survey, (2008). 990 \u0160procha, B., \u00damrtnos\u0165 a zdravotn\u00fd stav r\u00f3mskej popul\u00e1cie na Slovensku, 1.\u010das\u0165\u2018, Slovensk\u00e1 \u0161tatistika a demografia, Vol. 22, No. 2, 2012, pp. 91\u201392. 991 Fundaci\u00f3n Secretariado Gitano (2007), Zdravotn\u00e1 starostlivos\u0165 v soci\u00e1lne vyl\u00fa\u010den\u00fdch r\u00f3mskych komunit\u00e1ch, Madrid, p. 28. 992 Ibid., p. 29.

Around 17 % of Roma minors do not properly follow the child vaccination programmes, mostly due to the fact that their legal representatives had forgotten about it, but also due to the lack of information 993 . A little over half of the Roma people have received some sort of vaccination, whereas the vaccination rates among the majority population reach up to the 99 %. The fact that Roma are far behind the vaccination level of the majority population is a result of the more difficult access to general health services, and thus irregular contact with general practitioners and other health practitioners. Besides this there also lack of awareness on the importance of vaccination and a lack of useful information. In 2007 Slovakia adopted a programme focused on improvement of Roma health that was implemented through assigned health practitioners who visited Roma communities and educated Roma people on health issues, and vaccination 994 . However, this programme is currently on hold due to lack of financial resources. Moreover the general prevalence of typical infectious diseases is present in the separated and marginalised Roma communities due to the lack of adequate housing, overcrowding and lack of adequate sanitation. Occurrence of infectious diseases such as hepatitis B, dysentery, scabies and also tuberculosis are still evidenced among the Roma communities. This is mostly because of the inadequate hygienic conditions in Roma settlements 995 . These infectious diseases are not common among integrated Roma and their health conditions are similar to those of the majority population. Healthy Lifestyles and Related Behaviours According to the available information, Roma are regular smokers of cigarettes, both men and women. The share of smokers among Roma is twice as high as among the majority population. Moreover, young people start smoking at an earlier age. First experiences with alcohol among both Roma and majority population is typically around 16 \u2013 18 years. Nearly one fifth of Roma people (around 16.6 % of Roma adults) are obese and have weight problems. Nearly 20 % of young Roma people (children up to 18 years) are obese. This is mostly due to the unhealthy lifestyle, lack of diverse diet and non-active spending of free time. Around one third of Roma do not exercise or conduct any physical activity. Though young children declare that they are doing sports and physical activities, around 93 % of them are watching television every day 996 . Also there is a prevalence of unhealthy diet among Roma people that can be differentiated in accordance with the socio-economic status of the individual and the family. Sweets seem to be a favourite food category as 53 % of children up to 18 years consume them daily and consumption of fruits and vegetables is much lower than sweets. Besides this, nearly one third of Roma adults (around 30 %) and one fifth of children up to 18 years (17.4 %) are overweight. On the other hand there is also occurrence of malnutrition among Roma people, where around 34 % of them went to bed hungry in 993 Rodriguez, N.S. Derecho, N. R.

        "Report on the health status of the Roma population in the EU and monitoring data collection in the area of Roma health in the Member States August, 2014 206 the past month (at the time of research in 2011). The same problem was also declared by 7 % of the majority population. The only positive categories are sleeping habits and breastfeeding of young children/babies. In these two aspects Roma people seem to have a healthy lifestyle. Breastfeeding is still prevalent and often stays as the major form of feeding until the latter months (around 82.3 % of Roma children between six weeks and three months of life are breastfed compared to 60.6 % among children from the majority population). However, when it comes to other aspects such as smoking, healthy diet, exercising and food composition, Roma lead much unhealthier lifestyle than the majority population 997 . On the other hand Roma people perceive themselves to be quite healthy (around 20 % of Roma people perceive their health in a very positive way, and nearly one third perceives their health to be average), however, this may be due to the lack of information on health risks and diseases, especially in separated Roma localities. Although in Roma and non-Roma women aged 50 years and over more Roma women declare themselves to be in bad or very bad health (41 % Roma v 25 % non- Roma) 998 . Access and Use of Health Services and Prevention Programmes Generally, Roma people face more obstacles in accessing health services and preventative programmes than the non-Roma. In case of integrated Roma population, the access to health services is much easier than in the case of Roma people living in segregated or secluded areas and settlements. Socially excluded people face several barriers with regard to available health care and services. Health care facilities are located far away from the places of residence of Roma people. Despite this, a successful project focusing on access to health services and care for Roma people was implemented, currently it has been suspended for more than a year due to financial issues 999 . Moreover 42.3 % of Roma people identified a lack of financial resources as a barrier in accessing health care services, as it was too expensive for them. Another barrier is the fact that people in Roma localities lack health insurance cards or ID documents. Thus, non-insured Roma have access only to emergency care but cannot use other health services. However, around 94 % of them declare that they have access to health insurance. Roma people perceive themselves to be in good health, which is another reason for the relatively rare visits for check-ups and consultations with doctors. However, the relatively positive health self-assessment may be due to the low level of information about health care, prevention and health treatment. Another common tendency among the Roma is the self-prescription of various available medicines instead of seeing a doctor and asking for prescription 1000 . On the other hand 48 % of Roma people declare that they do not have access to essential drugs whereas in case of the majority it is around 19 %. 997 Ibid, p. 77. 998 FRA (2013). \u2018Analysis of FRA Roma survey results by gender\u2019. 999 Popper, M., Szeghy, P., \u0160arkozy, S.

        "Report on the health status of the Roma population in the EU and monitoring data collection in the area of Roma health in the Member States August, 2014 207 Prevalence of Major Chronic Diseases Around 18.8 % of the Roma population in Slovakia suffers from some sort of disability or chronic disease 1001 . According to the available data, Roma people are affected by hypertension, high cholesterol, depression and also by cardio-vascular diseases. Cardiovascular diseases are often a cause of death both among Roma and the majority population. \uf0b7 Hypertension in the Roma population \u2014 9.8 % of men and 4 % of women; \uf0b7 High cholesterol in the Roma population \u2014 6.8 % of all adults and children; \uf0b7 Depression in the Roma population \u2014 2.9 % of all adults and children; \uf0b7 Cardiovascular diseases in the Roma population \u2014 heart disease 6 % of population; blood circulation problems 8 % of population; \uf0b7 Osteoporosis in the Roma population \u2014 4.3 % of adults; \uf0b7 Reuma/Arthritis in the Roma population \u2014 7.3 % of adults 1002 . Health Factors Related to the Role of Women in the Roma Community When considering indicators such as cigarette and alcohol consumption, it could be concluded that Roma women lead a healthier lifestyle than Roma men. However, consultations with health practitioners, and particularly gynaecologists, are infrequent. Only one quarter of the women regularly visit gynaecologists for check-ups (24.1 %). Consultations about planned parenthood and reproduction are infrequent too (only 12.1 %). Roma women do attend check-ups in the case of mammogram screening, where nearly 75 % received the service. Together with treatment on smear tests, it may be concluded that in some areas Roma women do attend preventative check-ups that are specially focused on the prevention of cancerous diseases. Generally there is very low percentage fn use of contraceptives in Roma women, only around 1.9 %. An FRA gender report (2013) on Roma showed that 24 % of Roma women were in paid work as opposed to only 18 % of Roma men 1003 . Environmental and other Socio-Economic Factors The health status of the Roma is very much related to the overall socio-economic situation of the minority group. An estimated 20 % of the Roma population lives in deplorable conditions with lack of proper and adequate housing (e.g. slums), lack of any sanitation, lack of clean drinking water, electricity supply, etc. An FRA study also reports similar levels of deprivation stating that 61 % of Roma households live without piped water or sewage or electricity compared to 18 % of the non-Roma population 1004 . 1001 Rodriguez, N.S., Derecho, N.R.

        "Report on the health status of the Roma population in the EU and monitoring data collection in the area of Roma health in the Member States August, 2014 208 Moreover, around 32 % of Roma declare that they do not have access to secure housing compared to only 3 % of the majority population with similar problems. Also 44 % of Roma people do not have access to improved sanitation (not having a toilet or bathroom inside their dwelling) whereas in case of the majority population it is 12 %. Furthermore around 38 % of the Roma population does not have access to a good water source (piped water inside their dwelling) compared to 17 % of the majority population. In addition, around 40 % of Roma people are living in segregated, separated, geographically isolated or marginalised areas. These people have limited access to electricity (91 %), connection to sanitation (only 19 %), gas connection (41 %) and water pipe connection (37 %) 1005 . Furthermore, the FRA study of Roma by gender states that 92 % of mixed gender Roma households with children are classified as at-risk-of-poverty 1006 . However, a positive is that Slovakian Roma have the highest level of entitlement to pension benefits of Roma across the 11 Member States reported on in this study. The rest of the Roma population lives fully integrated and thus also copies the health patterns typical for the majority population. In the case of non-fully integrated Roma people there is a prevalence of low income within the families and low education levels due to the fact that Roma are segregated in the special schools system where they cannot reach an adequate level of education. A survey from 2011 shows that the share of four-year-old children from the majority attending pre-school education is at about 60 %, while among the Roma this is less than 30 % 1007 . Moreover only 19 % of Roma young adults have completed general or vocational upper-secondary education, compared to 82 % from the majority population. 1008 Also Roma suffer several forms of discrimination in access to education and employment. The unemployment rate among marginalised Roma people is very high as they often lack the skills and qualifications needed to find regular employment and face numerous barriers in accessing the regular labour market. Around 29 % of Roma adults (20 \u2013 64 years) have paid employment, compared to 62 % of the majority population 1009 . Thus, dependency on social benefits among marginalised communities is high. The dependency on social assistance goes hand in hand with low income, which in turn translates into poor living conditions, lack of proper hygiene facilities and lack of diverse diet \u2014 all factors that negatively affect the health status of the Roma.

        "Report on the health status of the Roma population in the EU and monitoring data collection in the area of Roma health in the Member States August, 2014 210 Country Profile: Slovenia Main Characteristics of the Roma in Slovenia Demography The first mention of Roma in Slovenia dates back to the 15th century. Roma in Slovenia can be mainly grouped according to their initial territorial distribution in the country: \uf0a7 Roma settled in Dolenjska (South East), came from Croatia; \uf0a7 Roma in Pomurje (North East), came from Hungary in the late 14th century; \uf0a7 Roma in Gorenjska (North West) came from the group of Sinta in Austria 1010 . Roma communities in Slovenia are not homogenous, they have different lifestyles, traditions and patterns of contact with non-Roma. Roma socio-economic conditions are worse in the south-eastern part of the country than the northeast, where a longer tradition of establishment (1850) has led to a more beneficial level of integration into the area. Roma have a common heritage of exclusion but in contrast with other groups in Europe, Roma in Slovenia are mainly sedentary. The demographic profile of Slovenian Roma is difficult to define, because even if the national census system considers ethnicity and religion as variables, the fact that this is based on voluntary self-declaration might imply individuals choosing various options to define their ethnic affiliation. As a result the number of 3 246 Roma (1 645 men and 1 601 women) counted by the Census in 2002 does not reflect the reality. Estimations provided by 20 municipalities to the office for National Minorities in 2004 counted 6 448 Roma persons, and this estimate did not include the considerable number of Roma living in Slovenian urban centres. Cities were instead included in a further survey based on local housing authority responsiveness to a questionnaire. The results show that there were more than 8 416 members of Roma community living in Slovenia 1011 . In conclusion it can be estimated that that between 7 000 \u2013 10 000 members of Roma communities live in Slovenia 1012 . This estimation is confirmed by the council of Europe 1013 . Geographical distribution The above section describes the geographical distribution of Roma in Slovenia. The Roma population is mainly scattered across the country\u2019s regions and they mostly reside in isolated settlements or on the outskirts of urban areas, with 39 % living in brick houses and 12 % in apartments. The remaining 49 % live in barracks, containers 1010 Belovi\u0107, B. (2011), \u2018Health-Related Lifestyle of Roma\u2019 in: Belovi\u0107, B. and Krajnc Nikoli\u0107, T.

The Roma live among the majority population only in the region of Prekmurje, although their numbers are small 1014 . Other Information (including highlights of data gaps) There are no structured statistics on Slovenian Roma health. Information to compile this report is mainly collated from international (EU) commissioned studies and small- scale academic studies carried out at district level. These academic studies and district level studies include a comprehensive study on the \u2018Determinants affecting the health of Roma in Pomurje\u2019 and another survey regarding women\u2019s health. These studies constitute the main source (together with another piece of research conducted in Ko\u010devje regarding Roma fever health care beliefs 1015 ) upon which the Fundamental Right Agency (FRA) has drafted its research on the situation of Roma in the EU. Consequently in order to avoid duplications the present report marginally refers to these studies, while it is more focused on further investigations\u2019 findings related to: \uf0a7 Healthy lifestyles and related behaviours; \uf0a7 Housing conditions. As a general remark it must be said that quantitative data on Roma health are fragmented, because data on health are not gathered on the basis of ethnicity and evidence is mainly based on qualitative methods of collection and assessment. Considering the small size of the country and the low mobility of the Roma population there is scope for improvement in data collection. For example, the national vaccination registry, which is also fed in through the school vaccination records might be a good vehicle to improve the level of prophylaxis within the Roma community. Further, local authorities managing housing have good potential to gather data on Roma. Moreover, the model of integration stipulated in Pomurje, should be assumed as a good practice to be extended to the rest of the country. Further research and policies should be shaped on this existing model. Mortality and Life Expectancy The study team has found no quantifications of this indicator. According to the available data, the demographic profile of Roma in Slovenia shows that half of the population is younger than 18 years, whereas the percentage of people older than 65 is lower than the general population. These data confirm that Roma have significantly shorter lives than the rest of the general population in Slovenia 1016 . Prevalence of Major Infectious Diseases 1014 Ibid. 1015 Rotar Pavli\u010d, D. et al (2011) 'Health beliefs and practices among Slovenian Roma and their response to febrile illnesses: A qualitative study', Slovenian journal of public health, Vol. 50, No. 3, pp. 169\u2013174.

        "Report on the health status of the Roma population in the EU and monitoring data collection in the area of Roma health in the Member States August, 2014 212 The study team has found no quantifications of this indicator. (see the section on Access and Use of Health Services and Prevention Programmes) Healthy Lifestyles and Related Behaviours No national reports have been found because national data on health are broken down only by sex and age. A survey, based on 259 randomly selected members of the Roma communities in the Pomurje region between 25 and 65 years, reported that more than half of the respondents assessed the care for their health as good or very good, whereas almost a third of the Roma respondents claimed that their health status was poor or very poor 1017 . The Roma self-assessment of their health status appears to be worse 1018 , when compared with data from the respondents involved in similar national surveys: in fact, in two different surveys from 2004 and 2008, only 9.6 % of the comparable population ranked their health as poor or very poor. A further survey targeting only Roma women (326 Roma women between 15 and 64 years of age in Pomurje) confirms these findings. The share of women assessing their health state as bad or very bad was 25.5 %. Although these two surveys are limited in their scope, they could be taken as a good indication of the general health status of Roma because they analysed a community (Pomurje) where the level of integration of Roma with the environment is good, whereas normally the existing studies \u2014 not only in Slovenia \u2014 focus on the poorest and most segregated communities, with the risk of providing more biased results. With regard to lifestyle habits, smoking appears to be the most common risk factor for Roma health status (two-thirds of the surveyed men and half of the women were smokers) 1019 . In 2005 a qualitative study on the attitudes of Roma towards smoking was carried out. Three men and nine women were invited to two focus groups, to discuss smoking- related issues. The stratified sample selected was representative of the Southern Roma community. The main conclusions reached are: first, that smoking is a strong part of the cultural, ethnic and individual identities of the Roma; second, that Roma have a basic knowledge about the harmful effects of smoking; third, the belief that smoking-related illnesses are caused by old age and fate, rather than the related habit and finally, that attempts and programmes to quit have not been successful 1020 . Access and Use of Health Services and Prevention Programmes Data on the access and use of health service are again provided by the studies carried out in Pomurje 1021 . The surveys reveal that all respondents have basic health insurance. Indeed, in Slovenia insurance is compulsory and when individuals cannot afford it, local authorities are responsible for covering health care expenses.

        "Report on the health status of the Roma population in the EU and monitoring data collection in the area of Roma health in the Member States August, 2014 213 Roma do not always know the procedures and how to administer these rights related to health 1022 . One in 10 Roma women does not have health insurance. The situation is more positive for children. Data show that 98.8 % of Pomurje children and 94.4 % of the children in other parts of the country have a selected doctor 1023 . Participation in prevention programmes is high during the first year of life, but then it declines. This could be due to the low level of school attendance of Roma young people. In absolute terms, the vaccination coverage of pre-school Roma children in Slovenia against poliomyelitis, diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis and MMR was lower than the national vaccination coverage for pre-school-aged Slovenia children. This is because not all Roma mothers give birth in hospital, and some vaccination doses are given at birth. However, pre-school-aged children among Roma show higher vaccination coverage than the school-aged generation (-6 %), this is because vaccination is spread throughout the school years. Since Roma children have a high rate of school drop-out, not all Roma children complete the course of immunisation 1024 . The situation regarding vaccination is nevertheless improving 1025 . In terms of methodology, the study of vaccination coverage involved a pre-school cohort of 436 six-year-old Roma children and a school-aged group comprising 551 Roma children of 16 years. To obtain data on immunisation the team research relies upon: the lists of Roma children living in the region studied, and in other areas. Information on eligible children and their vaccination status was provided by primary health care givers in health services, and by private doctors and social services knowledgeable about the situation. The team then compared two generations of Roma children, who were pre-school and school-aged in the year 2001. For the calculation of vaccination coverage for specific childhood diseases, a formula was used with the denominator representing the total number of vaccination-eligible children, and the numerator indicating the number of children who had received the prescribed doses of vaccine. This methodology for quantification could represent good practice to be applied regularly and extended to the whole country. Prevalence of Major Chronic Diseases Data on diseases are again provided by the studies carried out on Pomurje 1026 .

For example, in Pomurje 70 % of respondents reported back, neck and joint pains during physical activity. Health Factors Related to the Role of Women in the Roma Community The study team has found no quantifications of this indicator. Women are reported to experience stress, loneliness and depression, as a result of their subordinate role in the Roma community 1027 . The study in Pomurje found that 37.7 % of women reported depression and 73.2 % reported taking medication in the previous week. Generally Roma women have a prescribed physician, but they do not have a prescribed gynaecologist and apart from screenings during pregnancy, they do not take part in preventative programmes 1028 . Environmental and other Socio-Economic Factors \uf0a7 Housing Data on Roma housing conditions in Slovenia are mainly based on the, Slovenia RAXEN Thematic Study Housing Conditions of Roma and Travellers, which mainly relies on local housing authorities\u2019 information. The Roma housing condition varies across regions. Roma from Pomurje live with the majority of the population, with only three settlements being built without permits and the remaining 35 supplied regularly by electricity and water. The situation is different when looking at other parts of the country: in 2007 slightly more than 60 % of the Roma settlements were isolated, more than 20 % of settlements were in the vicinity of towns or were part of towns, and less than 20 % of the Roma settlements were in contact with other settlements. In addition some settlements were irregularly built as per the case of Dolenjska, where 39 settlements out of 57 are built without permits, 18 do not have water and 24 are without electricity. In addition, those settlements are very often overcrowded. This is also connected to the fact that willingness to sell the land to Roma is low (20 %). The reason for such illegal settlements might also be explained by limited access to social and private housing especially for those Roma that are not Slovenian citizens 1029 . \uf0a7 Education The studies carried out in Pomurje 1030 established that most children finish the primary level of education, whereas the study carried out in Ko\u010devje points to the opposite with 43 % of people interviewed never having attended primary school and 21 % having completed only the first two years. These contrasting findings are based on the fact that integration of Roma children in the two places has reached different levels, 1027 FRA, (2012), \u2018The situation of Roma in 11 EU Member States\u2019. 1028 Ibid. 1029 Peace Institute, Institute for Contemporary Social and Political Studies.

In general, language is the main obstacle to education, the majority of the Roma children first encounter Slovene when they attend school. Between 2008 and 2011, because of the European Social Funds 31 Roma assistants have been recruited to support the integration of Roma children into school. \uf0a7 Employment The above-mentioned Pomurje and Ko\u010devje studies are more consistent regarding the level of employment in the two regions. In both analyses the level of unemployment among Roma has a structural and permanent character. In Pomurje 90 % of the population has been living on social assistance and child benefits, and in Ko\u010devje the percentage of unemployed persons reaches 83 % of the sample considered (136 respondents between 15 and 65 years of age, 88 women and 48 men).

        "Report on the health status of the Roma population in the EU and monitoring data collection in the area of Roma health in the Member States August, 2014 216 Country Profile: Spain Main Characteristics of the Roma in Spain Demography Roma people have been present in Spain since the 15th century, and, as in the rest of Europe, their history has been marked by persecution, attempts at adaptation and phases of social exclusion. Currently, the Spanish Roma population stands at around 725 000 \u2013 750 000, figures that have been used by European institutions in their estimates on the Roma populations for the whole of Europe. However, certain caution must be observed with respect to these figures as the real size of the population is not accurately known, with estimates of overall figures having been made using a variety of methods (projections from previous studies, in addition to local data being calculated in a number of ways, studies on housing conditions that did not consider Roma people who do not live in densely Roma populated areas, etc.). Therefore, estimates may range from 500 000 up to 1 000,000 people. In spite of the limitations in determining the total scale of the Roma population in Spain. All social demographic studies carried out show that it is a young population, wherein around a third are aged below 16 years, and with birth rates substantially higher than the population average, although in the last decade this disparate rate has begun to reduce. In terms of the social situation, the Roma profile is heterogeneous and diverse; it is a common error to associate a given ethnic group to situations of material deprivation, social exclusion or self-exclusion. Some Roma people enjoy medium socio-economic levels and are fully integrated into society. Moreover, a substantial amount of Roma have seen progress in the last decade, although they still manifest, to varying degrees, social shortcomings and inequalities with respect to the rest of the population. Lastly, a third, minority sector exists, comprising the severely excluded who have seen little progress in terms of their social inclusion. It must be taken into consideration that the current negative economic climate and deterioration of employment in Spain is taking hold throughout the general population, but particularly so for socially vulnerable population groups, as is the case for many Roma people; it is essential that social inclusion processes for these people receive continued support in order to avoid stalling or even regression. Geographical distribution It is accurately known that the Roma people are distributed across the national territory, with a most concentrated presence in Andalusia, where around 40 % of Spanish Roma men and women reside, as well as in Catalonia, Valencia and Madrid. Although their history has been associated to rural life and geographic mobility, the current trend is for prolonged, stable settlement in urban areas, which consolidated in the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s to coincide with the general wave of domestic migration between rural areas and cities.

        "Report on the health status of the Roma population in the EU and monitoring data collection in the area of Roma health in the Member States August, 2014 217 Other Information (including highlights of data gaps) In terms of health, the results of a study comparing results of the Spanish National Health Survey (SNHS) with regard to Roma and the general population in Spain highlight that Roma show poorer results in a variety of indicators compared to both those of social groups in a better socio-economic situation and those in a poorer situation, with differences in terms of health condition, lifestyle and access to certain services. Some of the most pronounced are: perception of own health, the greater prevalence of certain chronic illnesses, and the greater frequency of dental, visual, hearing problems and accidents. Likewise, a higher frequency of unhealthy lifestyles was also detected. In terms of the access and use of the health care system, the low use of preventative gynaecological services by Roma women is worthy of note 1031 . Mortality and Life Expectancy Although there is no complete demographic study for Roma, many experts on health estimate that life expectancy is lower among Roma, and that this difference can exceed seven years. The data provided by Ministry of Health comparing some countries indicates that Spanish Roma follow the same pattern that other countries in EU. Using longevity and old-age indicators, the former focuses on the proportion of the population age 75 and over in comparison with the 65 and over group while the latter takes the proportion of people age 85 and over in comparison, once again, with those over age 64. Thus, the Roma population\u2019s longevity rate is 25.7 % compared to 51 % for the EU-27 while the old-age rate is 4.5 % for the Roma population as opposed to 11.2 % for the EU-27 1032 . Prevalence of Major Infectious Diseases According to the research, Characteristics and outcome of HIV infection in Roma in the Spanish VACH Cohort : \u2018Results: 4 819 (48 %) of 10 032 cases included in the VACH database were eligible: 210 (4.2 %) were Roma and 4 252 (84.8 %) were non-Roma. Differences were observed in age, household, academic, inmate, marital and employment history. Injecting drug use had been the most frequent mechanism of transmission in both groups, but to a greater extent among Roma (72 % versus 50 %; P<0.000). Sex distribution, CD4 cell counts and viral loads at the first visit were similar in the two groups, as was the percentage of patients with previous AIDS, the percentage receiving anti-retrovirals and the percentage subsequently starting anti-retroviral therapy. Up to 1 April 2005, 416 new AIDS cases and 85 deaths were recorded. The percentage of these outcomes did not differ between groups, but log-rank test showed a shorter time to AIDS and disease progression among Roma. 1031 To see the indicators on health of the National Roma Integration Strategy in Spain, 2012\u201320, see http://ec.europa.eu/justice/discrimination/files/roma_spain_strategy_en.pdf, pp. 17 and 18. 1032 FSG Health Area, (2009).

        "Report on the health status of the Roma population in the EU and monitoring data collection in the area of Roma health in the Member States August, 2014 218 The Roma population is the largest ethnic minority among HIV-infected patients registered in the Spanish VACH Cohort. This is consistent with the hypothesis that this group constitutes the largest ethnic minority living in Spain, but could also be an indication that the HIV epidemic has stricken them particularly hard through the high prevalence of IVDU observed in this population in scattered reports. The transmission of HIV through heterosexual contact seems to have reached a level in Roma similar to that seen in non-Roma. However, the association with IVDU, characteristic of Spanish HIV epidemics in the earlier and middle years, seems to have been significantly stronger for Roma. This population seems to have shared in the progressively decreasing percentage of IVDU-related new HIV diagnoses reported in recent years, but to a lesser extent than in non-Roma. Thus, the percentage of Roma within new diagnoses of HIV infection has significantly decreased along the years, as IVDU has become a less predominant mechanism for HIV. In this cohort, HIV disease progressed faster to Aids (and to Aids or death) in Roma than in non-Roma. Differences in a wide array of intermediate variables are often found in relation to race or ethnic origin. Nonetheless, differences in the rates of disease progression have been only exceptionally reported. In the present study, ethnic origin remained associated with an increased risk of progression after adjusting for other prognostic variables. According to the research, Prevalence of the hepatitis A antibody among disadvantaged Roma children in northern Spain, the unfavourable living conditions of the Roma population (e.g. homes with poor sanitary conditions, overcrowding) may explain the high prevalence of HAV infection. These findings underline the need for specific action which targets disadvantaged populations. Among the Roma children of this survey, 82 % had antibodies to HAV compared with 9.3 % of the children in the control group. The unfavourable living conditions of the Roma population (e.g. homes with poor sanitary conditions, overcrowding) may explain the high prevalence of HAV infection. These findings underline the need for specific action which targets disadvantaged populations 1033 . Healthy Lifestyles and Related Behaviours In all studies there is a prevalence of different problems associated with lifestyle. They are often overweight and obese in older and younger; only half of the Roma population has a weight considered as healthy. Food less rich in vegetables and fruit and abundant in sweets and fats, along with lack of exercise (also in children) explains this prevalence, which in turn has implications for other diseases in adulthood. Some noteworthy results (FSG, 2009) 1034 : Smoking Roma men smoke more than their counterparts in the general population (54.9 % as opposed to 31.6 %). 20.7 % of social class I and 36.6 % of social class V of the general population are daily smokers. The gap amongst youngsters is even bigger. 56.2 % of young Roma between the ages of 16 and 24 smoke regularly as opposed to 30.5 % from social class V and 12.4 % of 1033 Characteristics and outcome of HIV infection in Roma in the Spanish VACH Cohort, [Online].

On average, Roma smokers begin at age 14.4 compared to age 17 among the general population. There is a lower percentage of Roma women who claim to smoke on a regular basis in comparison with the general population (14.7 % compared to 21.5 %). On average, Roma women smokers begin at age 16.7. Average tobacco consumption is higher for Roma men who smoke 20.8 cigarettes per day as opposed to 16.4 among general population smokers. Roma women smokers consume the same number of cigarettes as women from the general population (between 13 and 14 per day). Consumption of alcoholic beverages Roma men start drinking at an earlier age than men of the general population (age 16 compared to age 18). Roma women consume fewer alcoholic beverages than women from the general population. Roma men drink less wine on a daily basis than the general population and consumption of beer and other alcoholic beverages is similar. Survey data does not reflect the volume of consumption and therefore no conclusions can be drawn in terms of risk behaviour. Eating habits The percentage of Roma boys and girls who do not eat breakfast (5.5 % and 8.4 % respectively) is higher than for the general population (1 % of the boys and 2.1 % of the girls). Exercise Data gathered on physical activity is insufficient to properly identify frequency and intensity and therefore it is not possible to determine whether exercise levels are suitable although significant levels of inactivity have been observed. Overweight and obesity According to the ENS, 19.2 % of under-18 Roma girls are obese. This percentage is higher than for general population social class V (10.1 %) and four times higher than for social class I (5.2 %). 35 % of Roma men compared to 39.1 % of men from the general population (not a significant difference) are within the recommended body mass index for adults (between 18.5 and 24.9 kg/m2). In contrast, this difference is statistically significant among Roma women (40.4 % as opposed to 52 % of women in the general population). Access and Use of Health Services and Prevention Programmes Here we encounter two different situations (FSG, 2009 1035 ): 1. Universal health care has meant an improvement in Roma population access to general medical services, hospitals, accident and emergency departments and access to medicines. The comparatively worse health status of this sector of the population 1035 FSG Health Area, (2009). \u2018Health and the Roma Community, analysis of the situation in Europe: Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Greece, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia, Spain\u2019, Madrid.

Access of the Roma population is lower in the case of services not covered by the National Health System or prevention (as opposed to direct treatment of ailments): dental health, prevention practices among women, access to hearing aids or spectacles. Access to the health system. General medicine, hospitalisation, accident and emergency departments and medicines . Some noteworthy results: General medicine 26.3 % of Roma men had been to their general practitioner within the previous two weeks compared with 25 % of social class V and 19 % of social class I from the general population. In the case of women these percentages were 33.5 % (Roma population), 39.6 % (social class V) and 26.2 % (social class I). Hospitalisation 11.6 % of the Roma men had been hospitalised during the previous year compared with 10.4 % of the men from social class V and 8.3 % from social class I. For women (with the exception of births): Roma population (12.2 %), 10.9 % (class V) and 5.4 % (class I). For older sectors of the population, hospitalisations of the Roma population are double those of the general population. The percentage of hospitalisations grows very swiftly with age in the case of the Roma population. Accident &Emergency Department Of the Roma population under age 16, 29.8 % of the boys and 40.4 % of the girls had used accident and emergency services during the previous year. Use by Roma boys is lower than that of boys from the general population (38.6 %) Use of medicines The Roma population consumes more medicines than the general population: for example, 28 % of Roma men and 42.9 % of Roma women report having consumed medicines for pain and/or to reduce fever in the previous two weeks (compared to 14.7 % and 24.9 % for men and women respectively of the general population). The Roma population takes more prescription medicines than the general population. Self-mediation is a problem shared by the Roma population and the general population, especially when it comes to medicines for cough, flu, sore throat and bronchitis and those for pain or fever. ",
        "Report on the health status of the Roma population in the EU and monitoring data collection in the area of Roma health in the Member States August, 2014 221 Access to the health system: prevention practices among women, dental health, and access to hearing aids or spectacles. Some noteworthy results: Prevention practices among women 25.3 % of Roma women over the age of 16 have never been to the gynaecologist compared with 17.6 % of the general population (25.2 % class V and 9.2 % class I). A higher proportion of Roma women see the gynaecologist for a specific gynaecological problem. The percentage of women reporting that their last visit to the gynaecologist was due to a specific gynaecological problem is 30 % in the case of Roma women, 20.8 % for class V dropping to 10.2 % for class I. However, a lower percentage of Roma women see their gynaecologist for regular check-ups, this being the reason for the most recent visit to the gynaecologist in 44.2 % of the cases of Roma women, 69 % for class V and 84.2 % in the case of class I. Mammograms are recommended between the ages of 50 and 64. Of Roma women over the age of 55, 59.2 % had had a mammogram compared with 72.1 % of women from the general population. As for pap smears, 47 % of Roma women had undergone the test compared with 52.4 % of the women from social class V and 81.1 % from social class I. Dental health 49.5 % of Roma boys and 51.4 % of Roma girls have never been to the dentist compared with 39 % and 38.4 % respectively among the general population. Dental work such as extractions, fillings, caps, bridges or false teeth are less frequent among the Roma population in the case of women and men and children and adults. For example, 42 % of Roma men report having fillings compared with 43.8 % in class V and 71.6 % in class I. Sight problems, with correction (glasses or contact lenses) if applicable 14.2 % of Roma men report vision impairment compared to 3.7 % of the general population (4.5 % of class V and 2.4 % of class I). The figures for women are 19.7 % (Roma population) compared to 6.6 % (general population). In the general population, the percentage varies from 9.4 % for women from class V to 3.7 % for class I. Hearing impairment, with correction (hearing aid), if applicable 42.8 % of Roma men over the age of 55 reported hearing problems as opposed to 24.4 % of the general population.

New situation due to the economic crisis 2009 \u2013 13: In general there is not a significant deterioration of health of the Roma population, but there are obvious problems associated with certain health cuts: more red tape to get the health card, pharmaceutical co-payment, etc... However, and most worryingly, we can see very direct effects on health-related habits in the most vulnerable families, ",
        "Report on the health status of the Roma population in the EU and monitoring data collection in the area of Roma health in the Member States August, 2014 222 especially children and the elderly and/or disabled, mainly affecting the diet in children and lack of monitoring chronic disease in the latter. There are more cases of the deterioration of the mental health of Roma, especially women, for depression, anxiety, etc... arising from very stressful and desperate economic and social experiences. The Roma of Eastern Europe have been severely restricted in their right to health care, due to the new law on health in 2012: lack of health card, barriers for vaccination, overuse of emergency, confusion in processing rules, etc... This limitation is even affecting children and pregnant women. According to information collected in 54 cities of Spain in 2013 by Fundaci\u00f3n Secretariado Gitano, the report concludes that the economic crisis and cuts measures that are being implemented in Spain are very directly affecting a large part of the Roma community, reducing their income levels and quality of life, and increasing the poverty rate of many Roma families who already had precarious situations in many social and labour aspects, and other families who once had a stable situation. The consequence of the austerity measures is that many Roma families are caught in a complex circle of interactions between the barriers in access to health, employment, education and housing, which ultimately produces greater social exclusion, which means a serious social decline compared to the situation a few years ago in this community. The measures that have been taken recently, tightening the conditions for payment of the basic income and social assistance, are severely affecting many Roma families; there are cases of people who were independent but now have to return to the social protection system. The social protection system is not meeting the basic needs of the most vulnerable and excluded in our society. Moreover, reducing aid dependency affects many Roma families who have disabled people in their care, giving serious situations of poverty and instability in these families, as the costs of health care and daily life are high and the care of people is incompatible with employment. This also has long-term effects on carers because it is limiting their educational and employment promotion. Prevalence of Major Chronic Diseases There is a prevalence of chronic illnesses or disabilities: high blood pressure, diabetes, cholesterol, allergies, respiratory problems among the elderly, and asthma among children. Psychological troubles: depression or chronic pain (particularly bones and head and migraines). According to the 2009 survey, Hacia la Equidad en Salud. Disminuir las Desigualdades en una Generaci\u00f3n en la Comunidad Gitana. Estudio comparativo de las Encuestas Nacionales de Salud a poblaci\u00f3n gitana y poblaci\u00f3n general de Espa\u00f1a. Madrid, regarding the perception of health, only 10.5 % of Roma women over age 55 describe their health as good or very good compared to 38.2 % in the general population. Differences in health problems can also be observed depending on the type of housing or level of education: Roma women who live in sub-standard housing or shanty towns have a greater tendency to describe their health as bad or very bad in comparison with those who live in standard housing. They likewise refer more frequently to problems such as hypertension, asthma, cardiovascular disease, hearing problems, dental problems (loose teeth), accidents and use of tobacco. ",
        "Report on the health status of the Roma population in the EU and monitoring data collection in the area of Roma health in the Member States August, 2014 223 They also show a greater tendency to have had to curtail their main activity or to have used accident and emergency services more frequently. Differences are also observed among Roma men depending on their type of housing. Those living in sub-standard housing or shanty towns report a greater number of hernias, hearing problems, accidents, depression and other mental illnesses. The Roma population with a higher level of academic studies has a better perception of their health status and are less inclined to hypertension, asthma, eye problems and tobacco consumption (the latter only applying to men). In the case of women, higher academic level is also associated with less obesity and fewer cavities and more frequent preventative practices (mammograms and smear tests). Of the wide range of health problems studied in the survey (cholesterol, depression, stomach ulcers, migraine headaches, etc.), Roma over the age of 35 (both men and women) suffer these in greater proportions than the general population. In some cases this is also true of younger age groups as well. Examples: 13.6 % of Roma men report having high cholesterol levels compared to 9.6 % from among the general population. Migraines are more prevalent among Roma women and men (37.1 % and 20.7 % respectively) than among their counterparts in the general population (9 % and 3.9 % respectively). 16.4 % of the Roma women reported allergy problems compared with 10.9 % of the rest of the population. The depression rate for Roma women stands at 17.6 % compared to 7.7 % of women of the general population. The asthma rate for Roma children is 13.3 % compared to 5.4 % in the general population. Health Factors Related to the Role of Women in the Roma Community Roma women develop a key role within their community. The play a role as educators, caregivers of children and the elderly, and are the transmitters of the norms and values of Roma Culture (Garc\u00eda, 2006). Today many women have shifted from exclusively performing household tasks and childcare to working in the labour market or to playing other roles formerly assigned to men. However an FRA study reported that in 2011 71 % of Roma women are still unemployed or full-time home makers 1036 . The impact of education, demographic changes, information technology and urban life has prompted processes of intense and ambivalent cultural transformation, reflected particularly in the younger Roma, but also in women. At the same time, a reducing birth rate means smaller families, a new position for children and the value of education, and a new relationship between the sexes, as many women do not live dedicated to motherhood and their potential increases because they have more time and better health. 1036 FRA, (2012). Analysis of FRA Roma survey results by gender. ",
        "Report on the health status of the Roma population in the EU and monitoring data collection in the area of Roma health in the Member States August, 2014 224 Nevertheless they suffer more health problems in comparison to Roma men and when compared to women of the general population. The data show problems associated with early and late pregnancy, lower gynaecological prevention habits and health problems caused by work overload. It is also important to note, with due suspicion, that regarding self-declared general health Roma women stated less incidents of bad health (19 % for Roma v. 23 % for non-Roma) 1037 . Prevention practices among women: 25.3 % of Roma women over the age of 16 have never been to the gynaecologist compared with 17.6 % of the general population. A higher proportion of Roma women see the gynaecologist for a specific gynaecological problem. The percentage of women reporting that their last visit to the gynaecologist was due to a specific gynaecological problem is 30 % in the case of Roma women, However, a lower percentage of Roma women see their gynaecologist for regular check-ups, this being the reason for the most recent visit to the gynaecologist in 44.2 % of the cases of Roma women. Mammograms are recommended between the ages of 50 and 64. Of Roma women over the age of 55, 59.2 % had had a mammogram compared with 72.1 % of women from the general population. Environmental and other Socio-Economic Factors The main causes of the worst health of Roma are socio-economic and related to habitat, in a physical sense and also symbolic. Being segregated or lesser citizens is in itself a serious health problem. But, as we have seen, the cultural factor in relation to one's health also has a major impact (Ayala Rubio, 2008). Again, we must distinguish traditional elements of the culture of the body with elements of the transition to a consumer society and with the features of a culture in crisis. As for the elements coming from the transition to a consumer society, for example, adopting unhealthy habits like smoking or eating mass-produced cakes is not a traditional activity, but rather an adaptive response to a consumer society whose disciplines must be learned. Comparative studies show that tobacco is a gateway to modern consumption and its patterns: individualistic, compulsive, but also perfectly compatible with the production, is proof of status and social integration. In countries in transition, as was Spain in the 1960s, mainly men of the professional elite used to smoke. The rest of society has incorporated these habits later, even if their harmful effects have been proven. A sedentary lifestyle and the automobile, easy access to cheap and satisfactory goods or the need to be integrated into the consumer society (even in its most popular strata) influences lifestyles and prevalence. In this regard, several studies have found that Roma do little or no physical activity in their free time, especially after age 25 1037 FRA, (2012). Analysis of FRA Roma survey results by gender. ",
        "Report on the health status of the Roma population in the EU and monitoring data collection in the area of Roma health in the Member States August, 2014 225 (Arza Pozas, 2008). There are other aspects in which this transition fails or becomes darker. Consumption can be more compulsive, the sense of loss or failure can lead to increased risk behaviours in adults or youth. In many older women this situation is manifested in depression when facing life problems. More vulnerable people, such as young women and men can become drug addicts. Traditional aspects of Roma Culture related to health Importance is given to health, coupled with the importance of family and the health of others. This fact explains the mutual support between relatives, which in the case of women becomes forgetting one's health and for men to reject weakness and caring. The importance of the elderly and the sense of vulnerability mean that disease and death are very present in Roma culture, even among the young. Health is represented as the absence of disease and disabling illnesses linked to death. The Roma community, as almost all traditional populations, only go to the doctor when they are very sick. When a person (and family) perceives that the disease has appeared, action must be immediate and decisive, given the relationship they feel between illness and death. Fear of disease is linked to the problems of access to health services in some places. So it is logical to use emergency services instead of the regular (or preventative) and there is a tendency to self-medicate and rely upon informal advice from relatives or neighbours. Health and physical illness. The relationship established between health and the absence of physical sickness means that they do not take into account aspects of behaviour related to psychology. The link of the idea of health with morality, making certain diseases, as HIV, a disgrace and a dishonour, so often lived in secret and with a great sense of guilt, greater in women. Invisibility of prevention. The fear of death and denial of illness hinder preventative work, and because Roma, as already mentioned, just go to the doctor when they are very sick. Furthermore, in environments where life is long and with an uncertain future, the idea of planning and care makes little sense, while caring for others and securing the future of the group usually does. For this reason many of the behaviours of the Roma have a cultural sense that does not always coincide with the dominant culture of health. Other distinctive features of the culture that hinder prevention: \uf0a7 Immediate life (daily living), which on one hand encourages the development of guidelines for daily life, but on the other hand is difficult to plan. \uf0a7 The prevalence of the emotional over the rational, where the action is very present and reflection often serves to fix or remedy, but not to anticipate or prevent.

        "Report on the health status of the Roma population in the EU and monitoring data collection in the area of Roma health in the Member States August, 2014 228 Country Profile: Sweden Main Characteristics of the Roma in Sweden Demography According to official government documents 1038 , approximately 50 000 Roma are currently living in Sweden and a similar estimate is provided by the Council of Europe: 35 000-50 000 1039 . Although it is stressed in the government documents that the figures are rough estimates, none of them provide an actual source (e.g. a survey or an expert or stakeholder consultation). The 50 000 estimate may originate from a government inquiry from 1997 in relation to the Swedish ratification of the European Council\u2019s Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities. The 1997 estimate was based on information obtained from various sources including the national minority organisations and state agencies 1040 . According to an interview with a Roma organisation carried out as part of a RAXEN study on Roma housing (2009) the 50 000 estimate was nevertheless still seen as realistic in 2008 1041 1042 . There are five Roma groups in Sweden. The estimated size of the different groups varies only slightly. The following figures are quoted (although not referenced) in a study from the Swedish National Institute of Public Health from 2010 1043 . Where other estimates are identified, these are provided with references. The description of each Roma group is drawn from a government document from 2006 1044 : \uf0a7 Swedish Roma people (2 500) This group came to Sweden from Russia around the turn of the last century. \uf0a7 Finnish Roma people (3 200) The Finnish Roma, or Kale, arrived in Sweden in the 16th century and were deported to what was then the eastern part of the kingdom (Finland). Many Kale Roma moved to Sweden in the 1960s on account of the introduction of Nordic passport exemption in 1954. \uf0a7 Travellers (20 000 \u2013 25 000) 1045 According to certain sources 1046 the Travellers originate from the first Roma migration 1038 Ministry of Employment (2012) A strategy for Roma Inclusion 2012\u201332.

Others think that they originate from German and French soldiers from the wars of the 17th century that the then King brought with him to Sweden. \uf0a7 Roma people from outside Nordic countries (10 000\u201315 000) Many of them belong to the Lovari-speaking Roma who came to Sweden from Poland and other countries in the 1960s and 1970s. \uf0a7 Newly arrived Roma people (5 000).

Other Information (including highlights of data gaps) Pursuant to the Swedish Personal Data Act it is \u2018prohibited to process personal data that reveals race or ethnic origin\u2019 1047 . There are hence no official register statistics available on the health of Roma. The most important recent study mapping the health situation of national minorities in Sweden (2010) was carried out by the Swedish National Institute of Public Health in collaboration with representatives of national minorities and the Swedish National Board of Health and Welfare together with the National Commission of Roma Issues 1048 . The research for this study (carried out in 2008\u201309), however, met strong resistance from Roma groups and organisations who feared a systematic registration of the Roma population. Consequently, the quantitative survey approach was abandoned in favour of individual qualitative interviews combined with focus group meetings 1049 reaching a total 334 individual Roma 1050 . The remainder of this country report is based on this study along with available international publications on the subject.

Healthy Lifestyles and Related Behaviours The study team has found no quantifications of this indicator. In a study from 2010 by the Swedish National Institute of Public Health, it was found that physical inactivity and a high fat diet were more common among Roma than the majority of the population. High alcohol consumption was found to be particularly problematic for young males. Additionally, problems with drug abuse and medical problems were seen to be widespread. Gambling alongside pill and drug abuse was also earmarked as a growing problem in this study 1052 . Access and Use of Health Services and Prevention Programmes The study team has found no quantifications of this indicator. In a recent study by the Fundamental Rights Agency, the Swedish Social Insurance Agency ( F\u00f6rs\u00e4kringskassan ) that administers medical insurance, confirmed that no data were collected in the area. A desk review of studies carried out in the context of the same study showed that in the 2006 \u2013 12 period no reports or studies providing insight into the medical insurance coverage among Roma had been published 1053 . A study by the Swedish National Institute of Public Health found that Roma generally wait long before seeking health care due to distrust of medical personnel in part out of fear of discrimination 1054 .

        "Report on the health status of the Roma population in the EU and monitoring data collection in the area of Roma health in the Member States August, 2014 231 The government has commissioned the Swedish National Institute of Public Health to assess the health of Roma girls and women. The study will be carried out by Prof. Maria Emmelin of Lund University in collaboration with Roma representatives and experts. Conclusions will be presented in March 2014 1057 . A report, Lyssna, f\u00f6rklara och f\u00f6rst\u00e5 (2011), collected data on Roma migrants in the Swedish health care system. This study reported that Roma women generally do not want to be examined by male doctors or use a male interpreter 1058 . Environmental and other Socio-Economic Factors \uf0a7 Housing A main source of data for housing is the 2009 study commissioned by the Fundamental Rights Agency of the EU \u2014 the Raxen National Focal Point for Sweden 1059 . No public data are collected in this area so findings were based on interviews with various stakeholders. The key points are summarised below: \uf0a7 Municipalities are responsible for the housing supply that is regulated in the Housing Supply Act (2000:1383). This act provides a universal right to housing. However, the Act does not give the residents any individual right that can be determined by the courts. \uf0a7 According to the Swedish ombudsman, the dominant type of housing for Roma in Sweden is rental housing. \uf0a7 Roma are, according to an activist, interviewed often in reference to segregated and socially disadvantaged residential areas, and their possibilities of choosing housing based on their own needs are very limited. \uf0a7 Employment In the above-mentioned 2009 Raxen Study, interviews with Roma organisations and the Swedish ombudsman confirm that landlords\u2019 requirements of permanent or lasting employment are difficult for Roma to meet with illiteracy widespread and many unemployed. Landlords do not count social welfare allowance as an income, and Roma who cannot show a clean financial record have difficulties in finding housing 1060 . \uf0a7 Education A key source for education is a Raxen report from 2004 on education of Roma relying mainly on reports from local authorities and to a minor extent interviews with Roma representatives 1061 . The study found that Roma children, despite 30 years of active policies, were still leaving school in large numbers without completing compulsory education. It also found discriminatory mechanisms in Swedish society to be an 1056 Statens Folkh\u00e4lsoinstitut (2010) Hur m\u00e5r Sveriges nationella minoriteter?

        "Report on the health status of the Roma population in the EU and monitoring data collection in the area of Roma health in the Member States August, 2014 233 Country Profile: United Kingdom Main Characteristics of the Roma in United Kingdom Demography No Official Data. Estimated population 300 000; however there are no official records. See discussion below Geographical distribution No official data Other Information (including highlights of data gaps): The Roma population in the UK is diverse and made up of a number of different groups, which whilst categorised under a broad definition have distinct and often quite different cultural identities and lifestyles 1064 . Understanding the health status of Roma in the UK is therefore immediately complicated by the demographic and social complexity of the groups designated by that term. Definitions of Gypsy Roma Travellers (GRT) are the subject of much political debate and are often highly contested. They are underpinned by discussions around what Clark and Greenfields 1065 describe as \u2018self ascriptive\u2019 definitions: Roma Travellers use the term to talk about their own people and communities, and those which are \u2018imposed\u2019 by non-Gypsy Traveller Roma who wish to make laws and policies about people they perceive as such. This report adopts the Council of Europe\u2019s categorisation of Roma which includes UK Gypsies and Travellers as well as Central and Eastern European Roma who have predominantly migrated to the UK since the fall of the Eastern Bloc in 1989 and in greater numbers since the accession of European States from 2004 onwards. UK Gypsies and Travellers Broadly speaking, UK Gypsies and Travellers are defined and define themselves as: English Romany Gypsies (UK Roma) Scottish Gypsy/Travellers, Welsh Gypsies, Irish Travellers and New Travellers. While Irish Travellers are not from the same ethnic group or origin as UK Roma they are often brought together in policy documents due to similarities in experience, particularly with regard to the barriers they confront in accessing health, education, welfare, the discrimination and prejudice they face, as well as their cultural accommodation needs. Central and Eastern European Roma Roma from Central and Eastern Europe living as migrants in the UK also represent a diverse range of communities and identities but predominantly come from Poland, the Czech Republic and Romania, Lithuania, Slovakia and the former Yugoslavia 1066 1067 . 1064 Smolinska-Poffley, G., Ingmire, S.

        "Report on the health status of the Roma population in the EU and monitoring data collection in the area of Roma health in the Member States August, 2014 234 Many came to the UK initially to seek asylum and then as migrants under EU accession from A8 countries in 2004 and A2 countries in 2007. While it can be argued that Central and Eastern European Migrant Roma experience similar forms of social exclusion, prejudice and discrimination to UK Gypsies and Travellers, it is also clear from the available literature that their experiences in the UK differ and that their health status, and their ability to access health care and services is shaped by experiences in their countries of origin, and by their status as migrants in the UK. Given their distinct experiences, and in light of the available literature, UK Gypsies and Travellers (GT) and Central and Eastern European Roma are referred to separately in this report. Population Estimates In contrast to many EU Member States, the UK collects data on the ethnicity of its population. However in spite of this, quantitative data on the number of UK Gypsies and Travellers and Central and Eastern European Roma in the UK is both sparse and unreliable, due in part to the fact that there are almost no official records. Census data for example, did not include UK Gypsies and Travellers as a separate ethnic category until 2011. Other official data collection consists of Gypsy Caravan counts carried out twice-yearly by Local Authorities (LAs) and assessments of accommodation need, known as Gypsy and Traveller Accommodation Assessments (GTAAs). However as Staniewicz 1068 states with regard to caravan counts, there are likely to be significant inaccuracies due to the fact that LAs may not be aware of all sites. Similarly Niner 1069 has noted that the Caravan Count numerates caravans not households or individuals. Furthermore an estimated two thirds of Gypsies and Travellers live at least some (if not all) of the time in \u2018brick-and-mortar\u2019 housing and the count is done without inclusion or verification of the figures from Gypsies and Travellers. Estimates of the Gypsy Traveller population range from 200 000 to 300 000 (0.6 % of the UK population) 1070 . A mapping exercise undertaken by European Dialogue for the Department for Children, Schools and Families in 2009 estimated the minimum number of Central and Eastern European Migrant Roma in the UK to be 50 000. Community estimates range however from 400 000 to 1 million 1071 . The University of Salford is currently undertaking a survey of Local Authorities which aims to provide the most comprehensive and up-to-date information about the population of Central and Eastern European Roma in the UK. Anecdotal information is currently putting the population of Central and Eastern European Roma in the UK at around 200 000 as of 2012. There are strong suggestions from practitioners working with Central and Eastern European Roma that this figure is increasing. Health Data Similarly, both quantitative and qualitative data on the health status of GRT are largely unavailable. There are no official health records which focus on GRT as an ethnic group and a recent report by the Irish Traveller Movement in Britain (2012), Inclusion and Ethnic Monitoring of Gypsies and Travellers in the National Health Service, highlights that despite a commitment from the Department of Health and the National Health Service (NHS) to address health inequalities, there is a lack of ethnic data collection and commitment to such a process at the local level. Given the lack of official and systematic data collection on Roma health, this report draws on academic research, local, qualitative studies, project evaluations, grey 1068 Staniewicz, T (2009), Housing Conditions of Travellers and Roma, FRA, UK. 1069 Niner, P.

Data has been assessed under the following categories: Mortality and life expectancy, prevalence of major infectious diseases, healthy lifestyles and behaviours, access and use of health services and prevention programmes, prevalence of major chronic diseases, health factors related to the role of women and environmental and socio-economic factors. When combined, they aim to sketch a picture of Roma health in the UK as it is currently understood. Existing research, both qualitative and quantitative, is consistent in drawing attention to the striking health inequalities between GRT and the rest of the UK population. Parry et al\u2019s (2007) 1072 study, Health Status of Gypsies and Travellers in England, for example was the first epidemiological study of its kind to attempt to produce reliable data on the health status of this group. It highlights the significant health inequalities that exist between Gypsies and Travellers (excluding Central and Eastern European Roma) and non-Gypsies, even when compared with other socially excluded and deprived groups. Other research identified in this report reinforces the link between health status and wider social determinants such as social exclusion, discrimination, access to suitable accommodation and welfare as well as cultural practices and understandings of health as being significant factors in the health of both UK Gypsies and Travellers and Central and Eastern European Roma. Conclusion Research which uses appropriate methodologies that combine qualitative and quantitative approaches and which pay close attention to specific indices of health is needed in order to begin to paint a more detailed picture of Roma health in the UK. In addition to this there is a need to further investigate the impact of social exclusion, discrimination and low socio-economic status on the impact of health status and to explore Roma experiences as compared to other socially disadvantaged groups. The diversity of Roma in the UK, the differing experiences of UK Gypsies and Travellers as compared to Central and Eastern European Roma and the diversity within these two categories suggests that there is also scope to explore differing experiences within the category of Roma as well as how cultural factors influence health. A greater commitment to more effective data gathering, for example ethnic data at the local NHS level, could also contribute to a broader understanding of the health issues at stake for this group. More detailed and effective data on health status and health barriers for UK Gypsies and Travellers also needs to be met with policy change and a commitment to address health inequalities through innovative practice. There is also some evidence of commitment from the NHS and the Department of Health to tackle health inequalities at a community level through initiatives such as the Pacesetters Programme. This has had some positive effects, at least on a local level. Cleemput (2010) et al's evaluation of the Health Ambassadors project in the Midlands, for example, suggests that attempts to create dialogue between Gypsies and Travellers and health professionals has facilitated enhanced cultural awareness on the part of health professionals and a better understanding of the health system and approaches to health care for Gypsies and Travellers. However, the report suggests that deeply embedded negative assumptions of Gypsy Traveller, culture, values and lifestyle means that there is still a long way to go. 1072 Parry, G. Van Cleemput, P. Peters, J. Walters, S. Thomas, K. Cooper, C. (2007), Health status of Gypsies and Travellers in England, Journal of Epidemiologic Community Health, 2007; 61: 198\u2013204. ",
        "Report on the health status of the Roma population in the EU and monitoring data collection in the area of Roma health in the Member States August, 2014 236 Mortality and Life Expectancy Research into life expectancy and cause of death amongst UK Gypsy and Traveller populations is extremely limited and appears to be non-existent for Central and Eastern European Roma migrants in the UK. However, small-scale, localised studies consistently state that the life expectancy of Gypsy and Traveller and Central and Eastern European Roma is lower than the general population 1073 . Clark and Greenfield 1074 for example report that a study from Ireland demonstrates that Irish Traveller women and men are estimated to live 12 years less and 10 years less respectively, on average, than the sedentary population. In the UK an example is the average life expectancy in Leeds. An overall average life expectancy of 78 years was reported yet only 3 % of Gypsies and Travellers were over 60 years of age 1075 . Data on infant mortality rates also show higher rates of infant mortality amongst UK Gypsies and Travellers as compared with the non-Gypsy Traveller population. For example, in Parry et al\u2019s 1076 study 26 Gypsy Traveller women out of 172 interviewed had lost a child (excluding miscarriages) as compared to no women from the non-Gypsy Traveller control group. Higher levels of infant mortality amongst Gypsy Traveller populations are also emphasised by a study carried out by Pahl and Vaile (1988), Health and Health Care Among Travellers 1077 . This study focused on Traveller mothers and their children under five living in Kent. Data was collected by health visitors among all known Traveller sites in the area. The study found that infant mortality amongst Traveller communities in Kent stood at 17.5 deaths per 1 000 births, whereas the figure for the non-Gypsy and Traveller population across England and Wales was 11.9 deaths per 1 000 births. Clark and Greenfield 1078 highlight further disparities between Gypsy Traveller populations and the general population by drawing on findings from, Confidential enquiries into maternal deaths in the UK 1997 \u2013 99. This report specifically asserts that Traveller women from \u2018traditional communities\u2019 (rather than New Travellers who are also at increased risk), are statistically at greater risk of maternal mortality than any other community in the UK. Prevalence of Major Infectious Diseases There are no data regarding the prevalence of major infectious diseases amongst UK Gypsies and Travellers and Central and Eastern European Roma in the UK. Lower levels of childhood immunisation amongst UK Gypsies and Travellers are however highlighted in two studies by Feder (1993) and Pahl and Vaile (1988). Feder\u2019s (1993) 1079 research, Traveller Gypsies and Childhood Immunisation: a study in East London, focused on the immunisation status of Gypsy Traveller children recorded at 1073 Clark, C., Greenfields, M (2006) Here to Stay.

A study of records for 72 Gypsy Traveller children and 106 control children aged between 10 months and 6 years was also conducted. The study found that Gypsy Traveller children had a significantly lower completion rate of vaccines for pertussis, measles, diphtheria, tetanus and polio compared to the control group. Only 20 % of Gypsy Traveller children had had their MMR vaccine, as compared with 71 % of the control group. Similarly, Pahl and Vaile (1988) found from their study of Traveller sites in Kent that 14 % of Traveller children had had their MMR vaccination, as compared to 55 % of the children from the general population. Health needs assessments were also carried out by Cumbria National Health Service (2009), NHS West Sussex (2010), Cambridge PCT (2010), Surrey NHS (2011) and NHS Luton (2009). These studies also reported lower levels of immunisation amongst Gypsy and Traveller children (e.g. 42 % as opposed to 95 % in Cumbria) 1080 . These studies are both small-scale and local in their focus and therefore cannot necessarily claim to be representative of the Gypsy Traveller population as a whole. However Feder (1993) argues that the low levels of immunisation amongst Gypsy Traveller children are indicative of a range of factors shaped by their culture and lifestyle. Key factors are: Involuntary mobility as a result of eviction from sites, difficulties in registering and accessing GPs and a lack of information regarding community health. Parental choice is the main reason for non-completion of childhood vaccinations for the non-Gypsy Traveller population. Hepatitis B has been found in endemic levels within the Romanian Roma community and particular Roma communities show higher rates of contagious diseases. These include tuberculosis, hepatitis, scabies and paediculosis 1081 . Healthy Lifestyles and Related Behaviours Local studies as well as anecdotal evidence from Gypsy Traveller communities, point to high levels of cardiovascular disease, cancer, asthma diabetes, arthritis, chronic renal and urinary tract infections as well as smoking-related diseases such as respiratory tract infections and emphysema. These conditions are, strongly linked to lifestyle, low socio- economic status and poor environmental conditions 1082 . Smoking Parry et al\u2019s (2007) 1083 research shows higher rates of smoking amongst Gypsy Traveller populations as compared to the control group. From a sample of 260, 64 % of 16 \u2013 35- year-old Gypsy Travellers are current smokers as compared to 26 % of the control group. Tobi et al (2010) also stated that smoking rates were highest among the Roma (74 %) when assessing the health and social care needs of Eastern Europeans living in Barking and Dagenham 1084 .

Moore\u2019s (2010) 1085 study of Slovak Roma in Tinsley, Sheffield is small-scale and local in its focus. It highlights a range of cultural factors within this community which contribute to ill health and which have shown to be resistant to change through health education, due in part to a distrust of health professionals. These include bottle feeding babies with sugary tea and consuming foods with particularly high fat content. Moore 1086 also highlights an overall poor awareness of how to maintain a healthy lifestyle amongst Slovak Roma, while Mahoney (2006) 1087 attributes poor diet amongst Central and Eastern European Roma in Leeds to poverty and a lack of money to buy fresh fruit and vegetables. Anecdotal evidence from a project working with Central and Eastern European Roma at the Black Health Agency in Manchester also points to high levels of dental decay amongst Central and Eastern European Roma children due to lack of awareness of the food and drinks which contribute to decay, as well as lack of access to dentists. Drugs A six-month piece of research carried out by Tower Hamlets (London) Substance Misuse Service and the Roma Support Group 1088 draws attention to the rising numbers of Central and Eastern European Roma young men who require intervention for heroin and cocaine dependency. Indeed, 10 % of referrals to the specialist drug treatment centre for heroin dependency in the past two years have been young people from the Roma community and non-Roma from Eastern European Countries. The report discusses some of the cultural factors which underpin how Roma tend to deal with the issue of drugs within the community, stating that a lack of understanding and awareness of drugs and the harm they can do, has led some young people to using in the first place but that this lack of awareness also impinges on the abilities of young people to discuss drugs with their older relatives. This is further compounded by the taboo that surrounds drug use, particularly for young women, and a lack of access to drugs education reinforced by low levels of school attendance. Access and Use of Health Services and Prevention Programmes Language and literacy barriers profoundly affect the ability of Central and Eastern European Migrant Roma to access health services in the UK. Reports 1089 highlight difficulties in accessing appropriate interpreters for GP and hospital appointments and a lack of simply written and translated materials regarding health services. In addition Central and Eastern European Roma, particularly those who have recently arrived in the UK, have very little knowledge of how the health system works and the services available to them. 1085 Lizzie Moore (2010).

        "Report on the health status of the Roma population in the EU and monitoring data collection in the area of Roma health in the Member States August, 2014 239 Such barriers are further cemented by distrust of health professionals 1090 and a lack of culturally appropriate services (Toby and Sheridan 2010). A health and social care needs assessment of Eastern Europeans in Barking and Dagenham notes that taboos within Roma culture around issues such as sexual health, drug and alcohol abuse, disability and mental health mean that such issues may not be brought to health professionals or conversely that discussion of the issues in a culturally inappropriate way can deter Roma from seeking help in the future 1091 . This study noted that only 57 % of Roma had registered with a GP citing various reasons; ignorance of the process, never tried/bothered and language barriers. Moore 1092 and others also draw attention to the lack of social networks, representation and advocacy available to support Central and Eastern European Roma in accessing health services. Health professionals also lack knowledge about organisations such as the Roma Support Group who advocate for the community, therefore overlooking the opportunity to increase the reach of their services. The Roma Support Group\u2019s evaluation of its three-year Mental Health Advocacy Project (2012) 1093 with the Central and Eastern European Roma Community in London highlights some recurring themes with regards to barriers to mental health services: \uf0a7 A lack of trust in mental health professionals; \uf0a7 Lack of knowledge of the existence of mental health services; \uf0a7 Communication, language and literacy barriers; \uf0a7 Stigma of mental health issues. More has been written about the barriers that UK Gypsy Traveller communities face in accessing health services. Similar to Central and Eastern European Migrant Roma, barriers to health care are rooted in experiences of racism and discrimination as well as a lack of understanding of Gypsy Traveller culture on the part of many health professionals. Gypsy and Traveller cultural understandings of ill health are also significant. In her analysis of Gypsy and Traveller Social exclusion and its impact on health status, Cleemput (2010) highlights the following points with regard to the reticence of Gypsies and Travellers to access health care: \uf0a7 A sense of fatalism regarding ill health particularly in relation to cancer; \uf0a7 A need to identify and present as \u2018strong, tough and healthy\u2019 as a way of maintaining control in the face of exclusion and discrimination; \uf0a7 A lack of trust in health professionals diagnoses; \uf0a7 Anticipated discrimination and lack of confidence in being taken seriously; \uf0a7 A lack of knowledge about the body, medical conditions and prevention. Research by Feder (1989) highlights the discrimination faced by Gypsies and Travellers when attempting to access primary care. This study shows that 10 per cent of GPs in East London refused to accept Travellers on their list. There is also further anecdotal evidence of Travellers being refused GP registration 1094 . 1090 Ibid. 1091 Tobi, P., Kevin, S., (2010), Health and social care needs assessment of Eastern European Individuals (including Roma) living in Barking and Dagenham, Institute for Health and Human Development. 1092 Moore, L.

        "Report on the health status of the Roma population in the EU and monitoring data collection in the area of Roma health in the Member States August, 2014 240 Barriers to health care are also linked to the practicalities of a way of life which is, at least some of the time, mobile. Issues such as lack of a postal address, having to travel long distances to visit their GP and evictions due to a lack of authorised sites are all relevant 1095 . Prevalence of Major Chronic Diseases Data on the prevalence of major chronic diseases are limited to small-scale, local, qualitative research and anecdotal evidence. Studies have pointed to the following issues: \uf0a7 Moore 1096 highlights that a nurse working closely with Slovak Roma in Sheffield has observed high rates of type two diabetes, mellitus, cardiovascular disease, premature myocardial infarction, obesity and asthma and that Roma presenting with undiagnosed health conditions is also common. \uf0a7 Nearly half of Roma respondents in Leeds reported that someone in their house was suffering from a long-term health condition (Mahoney 2006, p. 19). Mental Health Very little research has been done into GRT and mental health. However, small studies and anecdotal evidence suggests that Gypsies and Travellers suffer from high levels of mental illness 1097 . This section of the report draws primarily on grey literature. Central and Eastern European Roma Data gathered from reports and the Roma Support Group\u2019s own statistics demonstrate poor mental health amongst high numbers of service users accessing their health project. For example 50 % of 300 clients suffered from mental health problems ranging from depression, personality disorders, dementia, learning disabilities, suicidal tendencies, self-abuse and drug abuse 1098 . These findings are reinforced by the report from Tobi and Sheridan 1099 which highlights high levels of stress, anxiety and depression amongst Roma which is influenced by the impact of migration, traumatic experiences in their country of origin and the challenges of negotiating and adapting to a new culture. Moreover the impact of consistently experiencing, racism, discrimination and social exclusion should not be underestimated. UK Gypsies and Travellers Yin Har Lau and Ridge 1100 also highlight social exclusion and experiences of racism and discrimination as significant factors contributing to mental health problems in Gypsy and Traveller communities. They also cite a report undertaken by Cemlyn et al (2009) for the Equalities and Human Rights Commission which found strong evidence to suggest that a high proportion of Gypsy Traveller families are affected by suicide and that this is 1095 Clark, C., Greenfields, M (2006), Here to Stay.

Yin Har Lau and Ridge (2011) 1102 also suggest strong links between the lack of site provision and culturally sensitive accommodation and mental health issues amongst UK Gypsies and Travellers, underlining a 'psychological aversion to housing' (p. 130) Health Factors Related to the Role of Women in the Roma Community Yin Har Lau and Ridge 1103 make the general statement that there is significant pressure within GRT communities to conform to traditional gender roles, that domestic violence is relatively common and that this has obvious effects on mental health such as low self- esteem and depression. Findings from a 2007 1104 report on the health of Gypsies and Travellers in Wrexham are consistent with this statement. It reports that 61 % of married English Gypsy women and 81 % of married Irish Traveller women interviewed for the study had experienced direct domestic abuse. However as Yin Har Lau and Ridge point out, there is no further information regarding how the sample was obtained and how this might influence the findings, nor do they underline any concrete evidence of the health impacts of domestic violence. Parry et al (2004) also noted that anxiety was twice as prevalent in women as men in the Roma community 1105 . Staniewicz's 1106 assessment of Gypsy and Traveller housing and accommodation also suggests that gender roles within these communities have an impact on health, stating that Gypsy and Traveller women accommodated in 'brick-and-mortar' experience intense isolation due to the fact that they often become disconnected from their communities and are less likely to go out to work than men. Pahl and Vaile's (1988) study of Traveller women and their children under five living on sites in Kent, suggests that poor conditions on sites have a disproportionate effect on women and children due to the fact that they spend more time there. Mahoney\u2019s study 1107 of Central and Eastern European Roma in Leeds raises concerns regarding women's knowledge of health services suggesting that women may be unaware of their entitlement to maternity services and to free contraception. Discussions with the Black Health Agency in Manchester have also highlighted strict moral codes for Central and Eastern European Roma women regarding contraception. However due to the limits of this report we have been unable to explore this further. Environmental and other Socio-Economic Factors The impact of housing, accommodation and related environmental factors on the health status of GRT is discussed in a number of different studies.

While the preference amongst Gypsies and Travellers is to live on caravan sites \u2014 by contrast Central and Eastern European Roma who have been sedentary for generations 1108 live predominantly in overcrowded, privately rented housing in the UK. UK Gypsies and Travellers The 2004 Housing Act requires Local Authorities to carry out needs assessments for Gypsy and Traveller accommodation. However a lack of political will on the part of local government, substantial opposition to site development from the local population, underpinned by racial prejudice and a perceived lack of land have all contributed to dwindling numbers of sites and inadequate provision for Gypsy and Traveller communities 1109 . As a result, Gypsies and Travellers increasingly live in Local Authority or private housing as well as Local Authority and private sites, even when their preference is to maintain a more nomadic way of life 1110 . The occupation of 'brick-and-mortar' housing by Gypsies and Travellers has been linked to mental health problems 1111 . A number of health issues connected to living on sites have also been raised. Insufficient site provision means that sites are often located in unhygienic and unsafe places. Many lack basic amenities such as running water and toilets and are often located near rubbish dumps, sewage works and busy roads (Felder and Hussy 1990, Pahl and Vaile 1988). Central and Eastern European Roma Roma access to accommodation in the UK is shaped by their status as EU migrants and their access to employment but is also mediated through their experiences as a socially excluded ethnic minority 1112 . Since EU accession in 2004, Roma have entered the UK as economic migrants. Studies of Roma in Leeds 1113 , Glasgow (Poole and Adamson 2008) and Thameside, Greater Manchester 1114 , show that housing for Roma is varied but that the majority live in privately rented, overcrowded accommodation which is often in very poor condition and with high rents 1115 . There are two key reasons for this: first, Roma people are often badly paid and in insecure work, a situation which is exacerbated by poor English language skills and low levels of literacy, education and qualifications. They therefore rely on extended family networks to live together and contribute to the rent (Poole and Adamson 2008). Second, up until 2011 for A8 migrants, and January 2013 for A2 migrants, people could not access Local Authority housing or benefits unless they had registered with the Worker Registration Scheme (WRS), and had been in continuous employment for 12 months (SN/SP/5972, 2011). The WRS no longer applies, though migrants must still pass the Habitual Residency Test in order to access benefits. Poverty and in some cases destitution is therefore a persistent problem for Central and 1108 Har Lau, Y.

Moore\u2019s (2010) study of Slovak Roma in Sheffield notes how a lack of resources impacts on families' abilities to access healthy food and exercise and that the stress associated with poverty often means that health is not prioritised. Health workers in Leeds have identified lack of clothing and fresh food, and lack of money to buy milk formula amongst Central and Eastern European Roma 1116 . All the evidence suggests that socio-economic factors fundamentally impact on health.

Breast screening project in Vienna (for socially disadvantaged/migrants) Yes (funds allocation is not specified) Yes (not specifically addressing Roma health issues) Although the Austrian strategy document recognises the Roma community as a separate and heterogeneous group, the welfare and social inclusion policy is not Roma-specific. Austria has prepared a set of integrated measures targeting Roma issues within the context of a broader social inclusion policy, whose objectives more generally include increasing inclusion and reducing language barriers in the health service. In the past this has included the introduction of mother-tongue experts, seminars on intercultural skills, intercultural training courses and foreign language brochures aimed at patients. In the health care system itself Austria provides services regardless of demographics and does not take special account of the Roma community. The only current project which provides some information on Roma health (indirectly) is a general screening project ",

There is also reference to access to European funds, but no mention of specific projects or precise budgetary values.

The right to access to health care is universal, regardless of individual characteristics, ethnicity, religion, socio-economic status or any other differentiating factor in various social groups.

Questionnaire for monitoring health and implementing NRIS Data collection issues for monitoring Roma health status and progresses in the implementation of National Roma Integration Strategies The present survey is an important part of the study \u2018Reports on health status of the Roma population in the EU and the monitoring of the data collection in the area of Roma health in Member States\u2019. This is a project which is currently being carried out by Matrix Knowledge on behalf of the European Executive Agency for Health and Consumers. Its aim is to highlight relevant indicators and reliable data on Roma health in order to (i) assess the health status of Roma at local level (ii) identify priority areas and how to best implement these and (iii) inform the allocation of resources. However it is also apparent that such indicators and data are not available in a significant number of Member States and the systematic collation and assessment of such data appears to be limited and fragmented across Europe. The European Fundamental Rights Agency (FRA) is also currently investigating the situation of Roma in the European Union (EU) and has distributed a questionnaire to the National Roma Contact Points able to provide information on Roma conditions in different areas: housing, health, education and employment. This survey has been designed to complement that of FRA, as it has a specific focus on Roma health status. For this reason the targets of the survey are: public health authorities, health professionals and non-governmental organisations (NGOs) operating at EU, national and regional as well as grassroots (local) level. The respondents are asked: (i) to evaluate the overall strengths and weaknesses of current data collection on Roma health status, (ii) to assess the use that they made of the existing data and (iii) to consider how the situation could be improved. Data collection is essential to verify the achievements in health of the National Roma Integration Strategy (NRIS). The NRIS aims to promote and achieve the inclusion of Roma. They have been developed by the Member States and presented to the European Commission as a concrete response to the European Framework for National Roma Integration Strategy by 2020. The goals of the present survey are therefore: 1. To map existing official quantitative and statistical data set currently used (data availability); 2. To identify the main good practices and challenges of the current health data collection and its related use in the context of the National Roma Integration Strategy (NRIS); 3. To propose potential solutions and policy options for improvement. This survey does collect personal data to allow the research team to contact a respondent to follow up on their experience in the context of the study. Anonymity will ",
