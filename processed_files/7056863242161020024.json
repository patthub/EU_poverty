        "ANNEX I Work plan 2012 for the second programme of Community action in the field of health (2008-2013) 1. GENERAL CONTEXT 1.1. Policy and legal context Article 168 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) and resulting legal obligations and other commitments are the basis for action presented in this work plan. The Treaty states that EU action in the area of public health is designed to improve public health, prevent physical and mental illness and diseases, and obviate sources of danger to physical and mental health. This is to be done in cooperation with the Member States. The EU Health Strategy set out in Commission White Paper Together for health: A strategic approach for the EU 2008-2013 (COM(2007) 630 final) ( 1 ) provides an overarching framework for all action under this work plan. The second programme of Community action in the field of health (2008-2013) (hereinafter referred to as the \u2018second health programme\u2019 or \u2018programme\u2019) established by Decision No 1350/2007/EC (hereinafter referred to as the \u2018Programme Decision\u2019) supports this strategy. The mission of the health programme is to complement, support and add value to the policies of the Member States. It seeks to contribute to increased solidarity and prosperity in the EU by protecting and promoting human health and safety and by improving public health. The programme pursues the following objectives set out in Article 2(2) of the Programme Decision: 1. improving citizens health security; 2. promoting health, including the reduction of health inequalities; 3. generating and disseminating health information and knowledge. Article 8(1) of the Programme Decision states that the Commission shall adopt: (a) an annual work plan for the implementation of the programme, setting out: (i) priorities and actions to be undertaken, including the allocation of financial resources; (ii) criteria for the percentage of EU financial contribution, including criteria on exceptional utility; (iii) arrangements for implementing the joint strategies and actions referred to in Article 9; (b) selection, award and other criteria for financial contributions to the actions of the programme in accordance with Article 4. According to Article 75 of Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 1605/2002 (hereinafter referred to as the \u2018Financial Regulation\u2019), the commitment of expenditure should be preceded by a financing decision adopted by the institution or the authorities to which powers have been delegated by the institution. According to Article 90 (hereinafter referred to as the \u2018Imple\u00ad menting Rules\u2019), the decision adopting the annual work programme referred to in Article 110 of the Financial Regulation may be considered to be the financing decision provided that this constitutes a sufficiently detailed framework. This document aims to fulfil those obligations and present the actions for 2012. In addition to the Member States of the European Union, the health programme is open to participation by third countries. EFTA/EEA countries: Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway participate in the programme under the conditions specified in the EEA Agreement. Other third countries, in particular European neighbourhood policy countries, countries applying for, countries that are candidates for, or are acceding to membership of the EU and the western Balkan countries included in the stabilisation and association process, may participate in the programme provided that the necessary agreements are in place. Of these countries Croatia has concluded these arrangements and participates in the programme.

        "1.2. Resources The Programme Decision sets a total budget of EUR 321 500 000 for the period 1 January 2008-31 December 2013. The budget for 2012 is EUR 49 700 000 subject to the budgetary authority's approval of the budget: \u2014 EUR 48 300 000 for budget line 17 03 06 \u2018EU action in the field of health\u2019 (operational budget), \u2014 EUR 1 400 000 for budget line 17 01 04 02 \u2018Expenditure on administrative management\u2019 (administrative budget). Additional contributions from the EFTA/EEA countries and Croatia are estimated at EUR 1 292 200 from the EFTA/EEA countries and EUR 138 000 from Croatia. This brings up the total for budget line 17 03 06 to EUR 49 688 800 and the total for budget line 17 01 04 02 to EUR 1 441 400. The amounts given in the following chapters are indicative. In accordance with Article 90(4) of the Implementing Rules, non-substantial variations are possible for the amount allocated to each financing mechanism. Budget line 17 01 04 02 \u2014 \u2018Expenditure on administrative management\u2019 is intended to cover expenditure on studies, meetings of experts, information, publications and technical and administrative assistance for IT systems. These are directly linked to achieving the objectives of the programme or measures taken for this activity. The Executive Agency for Health and Consumers (EAHC) assists the Commission in implementing this work plan according to Commission Decision C(2008) 4943 of 9 September 2008. The budget line for administrative appro\u00ad priations related to EAHC is 17 01 04 30. A total budget of EUR 200 000, subject to the approval of the budget by the budgetary authority, is foreseen for the EU payment to the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control under budget line 17 03 05 \u2018International agreements and membership of international organisations in the field of public health and tobacco control\u2019. 2. FINANCING MECHANISMS Appropriations available under budget line 17 03 06 \u2018EU action in the field of health\u2019 will be used to award project grants, operating grants, grants for joint actions, conference grants and direct grants to international organisations as well as to cover procurement and other actions. All grants are covered by written agreement. In accordance with recital 33 of the Programme Decision, collaboration should be facilitated with third countries not participating in the programme. This should not involve funding from the programme. Nevertheless, travel and subsistence expenses for experts invited from or travelling to such countries can be considered eligible costs in duly justified, exceptional cases, where this directly contributes to the objectives of the programme. 2.1. Project grants The total indicative amount for project grants is estimated at EUR 13 171 820. Project grants are calculated on the basis of eligible costs incurred. The maximum rate for EU co-financing is 60 %. However, this may go up to 80 % if a proposal meets the criteria for exceptional utility. Annex II contains the exclusion, eligibility, selection and award criteria for project grants. Annex VII contains the criteria for exceptional utility. Only proposals that directly correspond to the topic and description as set out in this work plan and where \u2018project grants\u2019 is indicated as the financing mechanism will be considered for funding. Proposals which only address the wider subject area without matching the specific description of a given action will not be considered for funding. The indicative timetable for publishing the call for proposals for project grants in the Official Journal is the fourth quarter of 2011. EN C 358/12 Official Journal of the European Union 8.12.2011 ",
        "2.2. Operating grants The total indicative amount for operating grants is estimated at EUR 4 400 000. They are calculated on the basis of eligible costs incurred. The maximum rate for EU co-financing is 60 %. However, this may go up to 80 % if a proposal meets the criteria for exceptional utility. Operating grants may be awarded to renew operating grants awarded to non-governmental bodies and specialised networks under the work plan for 2011. New operating grants may be awarded to non-governmental bodies and specialised networks active in areas corresponding to the three objectives of the health programme. Work under operating grants should directly contribute to reaching the priorities of the European Union as set out in Commission Communication COM(2010) 2020 of 3 March 2010 Europe 2020 \u2014 A strategy for smart, sustainable and inclusive growth ( 1 ). Issues that are particularly relevant include active and healthy ageing, including health promotion and prevention of diseases; prevention of health inequalities, including ensuring better access to health care for all, and questions relating to the health workforce. As laid down in Article 4(2) of the Programme Decision, the renewal of financial contributions set out in paragraph 1(b) to non-governmental bodies and specialised networks may be exempted from the principle of gradual decrease. As a general rule, this exemption will apply to applicant organisations not receiving any of their funding from the private sector ( 2 ) or other conflicting interest for their functioning (core funding). For all other renewed operating grants, a decrease of one percentage point as compared to the EU co-financing percentage agreed in the grant agreement following the call for proposals 2011 will be applied. In any case, the amount of EU co-financing cannot be higher than the amount granted in 2011. Annex III contains the exclusion, eligibility, selection and award criteria for operating grants. Annex VII contains the criteria for exceptional utility. The indicative timetable for publishing the call for proposals for operating grants in the Official Journal is the fourth quarter of 2011. 2.3. Grants for joint actions The total indicative amount for joint actions is estimated at EUR 8 950 000. Joint actions allow the competent authorities of the Member States/other countries participating in the health programme and the European Commission to take forward work on jointly identified issues. Public bodies or non-governmental bodies based in a Member State/another country participating in the programme which participates in a joint action may participate in the joint action. However, they have to be expressly mandated to do so by the authorities of the Member State/other participating country concerned. Grants for joint actions are calculated on the basis of eligible costs incurred. The maximum rate of EU co-financing is 50 %. However, this may go up to 70 % in cases of exceptional utility. Exceptional utility co-financing of 70 % is envisaged for the joint action \u2018Facilitating collaboration on organ donation between national authorities in the EU\u2019 (see point 3.1.4.2) because of its contribution to the effective implementation of EU legislation in this field. In other cases, the criteria for exceptional utility in Annex VII apply. Annex IV contains the exclusion, eligibility, selection, and award criteria for joint actions. Member States/other countries participating in the health programme which intend to participate in one or more joint actions must declare their intention to the Commission prior to the expiry of the deadline for the submission of proposals. With the exception of NGOs operating at EU level, only organisations established in Member States/other countries participating in the programme which have made this declaration may apply to participate in joint actions. The indicative timetable for publishing the call for proposals for joint actions in the Official Journal is the fourth quarter of 2011. 2.4. Conference grants The total indicative amount for conferences is EUR 800 000: EUR 200 000 for Presidency conferences, and EUR 600 000 for other conferences. For administrative reasons, conferences eligible for co-funding, apart from Presidency conferences, must take place in 2013. 2.4.1. Presidency conferences \u2014 De jure monopoly According to Article 168(1)(c) of the Implementing Rules, grants can be allocated without a call for proposals to organisations in a de jure or de facto monopoly situation, duly substantiated in the award decision. EN 8.12.2011 Official Journal of the European Union C 358/13 ( 1 ) http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=COM:2010:2020:FIN:EN:PDF ( 2 ) The term \u2018private sector\u2019 covers \u2018for-profit\u2019 companies/enterprises/corporations, business organisations or other entities irrespective of their legal nature (registered/not registered), ownership (wholly or partially privately owned/State-owned) or size (large/small), if they are not controlled by the public. ",
        "Presidency conferences which are highly political in nature and which involve representation at the highest level both from national authorities and European representatives are to be organised exclusively by the Member State holding the Presidency of the EU. Given the unique role of the Presidency in the framework of EU activities, the Member State responsible for the organisation of the event is considered as having a de jure monopoly. Two conferences organised by the Presidencies of the European Union, one for the Presidency in the second half of 2012 and the other for the Presidency in the first half of 2013, may receive up to EUR 100 000 each. The maximum rate of EU co-financing is 50 % of eligible costs incurred. The Presidency shall submit to EAHC a request for a grant for the conference concerned, via the Permanent Represen\u00ad tation, using a form provided by EAHC. This has to be done at least four months before the event. The Presidency conference to be financed under this work plan is \u2018First Steps Towards a Healthy Ageing Process\u2019 planned for September 2012 under the Cypriot Presidency. 2.4.2. Other conferences Conference grants may be awarded for the organisation of conferences that correspond to the three objectives of the health programme. To be awarded funding, conferences should directly promote the priorities of the European Union as set out in Commission Communication COM(2010) 2020 of 3 March 2010 Europe 2020 \u2014 A strategy for smart, sustainable and inclusive growth . Issues that are particularly relevant include active and healthy ageing, including health promotion and prevention of diseases; prevention of health inequalities, including ensuring better access to health care for all, and questions relating to the health workforce. Conferences must have a broad European dimension. They have to be organised by a public or non-profit making body established in a country participating in the health programme and which has relevant experience of cooperation at EU level. Conferences may receive up to EUR 100 000 (maximum 50 % of the total budget). Annex V contains the exclusion, eligibility, selection and award criteria for conferences other than Presidency conferences. The indicative timetable for publishing the call for proposals for conferences in the Official Journal is the fourth quarter of 2011. 2.5. Direct grant agreements with international organisations The total indicative amount for direct grants is estimated at EUR 2 633 000. Direct grants will be based on effective collaboration with the Commission. According to Article 168(1)(f) of the Implementing Rules, funding for actions with international organisations will be allocated through grant agreements without a call for proposals on topics specifically identified in this work plan. International organisations and their national or regional offices are not eligible for funding as main or associated beneficiaries under any calls for proposals. The maximum rate for EU co-financing is 60 % of the eligible costs actually incurred. In accordance with recital 33 of the Programme Decision, activities involving third countries not participating in the programme shall not be considered eligible costs. However, travel and subsistence expenses for experts invited from or travelling to such countries can be considered eligible costs in duly justified, exceptional cases, where this directly contributes to the objectives of the programme. Funding through direct grants will be awarded to the following international organisations under this financing Decision because of their specific competence and high degree of specialisation in the areas covered by the direct grants set out in Sections 3.1, 3.2 and 3.3: \u2014 Council of Europe (CoE), \u2014 International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC), \u2014 International Organisation for Migration (IOM), \u2014 Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD).

        "2.6. Procurement The total indicative amount for procurement is estimated at EUR 14 463 980. Procurement covers activities such as the evaluation and monitoring of actions and policies; studies; provision of advice, data and information on health; scientific and technical assistance; communication and awareness-raising activities and information technology applications in support of policies. Calls for tenders are expected to be published in the first semester of 2012 in the Official Journal. Framework contracts and new service contracts will be used as indicated in this work plan. 2.7. Other actions The total indicative amount for other actions is estimated at EUR 5 270 000. This relates to contributions paid by the EU as subscriptions to bodies of which it is member in the meaning of Article 108(2)(d) of the Financial Regulation, administrative agreements with the Joint Research Centre (JRC) and special indemnities paid to experts for participating in meetings and work on scientific opinions under point 3.1.3.1 and advice on health systems under point 3.3.2.1. 2.8. EU payment to the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control The European Union is a full party to the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (FCTC). Payment of the 2012 EU contribution to the FCTC will be made under budget line 17 03 05 \u2018International agreements and membership of international organisations in the field of public health and tobacco control\u2019, and not from the health programme. The amount of this payment is based on the decision on the work plan and budget for the financial period 2012-2013 taken by the Fourth Conference of the Parties to the Convention in November 2010 (FCTC/COP/4/20). The EU contribution is set at USD 145 225 for 2012. To cover for fluctuations of the exchange rate, the maximum amount is set at EUR 200 000 for 2012. The FCTC Secretariat will manage the funds according to WHO financial rules. 3. PRIORITIES FOR 2012 Actions under this work plan are broadly geared towards supporting the delivery of EU priorities set out in the Europe 2020 Strategy and responding to legislative obligations and policy commitments. The Smart growth and Inclusive growth priorities under the Europe 2020 Strategy are of particular relevance for this work plan. The objectives of the Europe 2020 Strategy match those of the EU Health Strategy , which maintains that investing in health can boost innovation, create new skills and jobs and reduce inequalities in health. In 2012 the health programme will contribute to the objectives of the following flagships under the Europe 2020 Strategy : The Pilot Innovation Partnership on active and healthy ageing under the Flagship Initiative Innovation Union ( 1 ) has inspired action under this work plan to enable European citizens to lead active, healthy and independent lives for as long as possible. This action will promote physical and mental health, including promoting better nutrition and physical activity, and preventing behaviour that is harmful to health. Ways will be sought to prevent the onset of major and chronic diseases through action such as cancer screening. The provision of relevant advice and information will support Member States in their efforts to arrive at and maintain sustainable and efficient health care systems. Action will also be taken to explore ways to develop innovative products and services that respond to the ageing challenge. All action ultimately seek to contribute to the overall aim of the partnership to add an average of two years of healthy life for everyone in Europe. The European platform against poverty and social exclusion ( 2 ) of the Europe 2020 Strategy has inspired actions related to inequalities. These actions seek to improve access of vulnerable populations to healthcare, support their social inclusion and combat the discrimination they face. They contribute to reaching the EU target of reducing poverty and social exclusion by at least 20 million by 2020. The Agenda for new skills and jobs ( 3 ) provides the framework for work on the health workforce. This work seeks to contribute to reaching the Europe 2020 Strategy's employment target for 2020 of 75 % of the working-age population at work. It supports especially the aims under priority 2 of the Agenda, namely equipping people with the right skills for employment.

        "Furthermore, this work plan responds to additional challenges where action can provide real EU value-added. A safe and secure society is a prerequisite for economic growth and the well-being of citizens. A number of cross-border health threats in the past few years have clearly demonstrated the need and value-added of coherent and effective action at EU level. Actions envisaged under this work plan focus on exploring and setting up efficient mechanisms for detecting and preventing the spread of various cross-border health threats, or minimising their impact. This work plan also envisages support for safe and secure systems and mechanisms in support of EU legislation on the safety and quality of organs and substances of human origin, blood, and blood derivatives . Activities seek to obtain and maintain the trust and confidence of EU citizens in this area. In the same way, legislation in the area of cross-border healthcare will be supported by targeted action. Keeping people healthy and active for longer has a positive impact on productivity and competitiveness. Complementary action is therefore planned on the main risk factors for health such as nutrition, alcohol abuse and smoking as well as in the area of major, chronic and rare diseases . Finally, several activities are envisaged to comply with the programme's third objective \u2018Generate and disseminate health information and knowledge\u2019. Partly in cooperation with external partner organisations, a series of activities are planned to collect data, to produce scientific evidence and to effectively process information to citizens, stakeholders and policy makers. 3.1.

Protect citizens against health threats \u2014 Develop risk management capacity and procedures, improve preparedness and planning for health emergencies (point 1.1.3 in Annex to Programme Decision) 3.1.1.1. P u b l i c h e a l t h p r e p a r e d n e s s a n d r e s p o n s e t r a i n i n g a n d e x e r c i s e s The objective of this action is to improve and reinforce the EU's preparedness to respond to potential risks. National and EU evaluations of the 2009 pandemic clearly demonstrate the need to reinforce preparedness by sharing best practices and further developing common tools at EU level. This action seeks to increase Member State officials\u2019 knowledge of cross-border risks and management of the public health response to these, and the effective use of related IT tools. This action is composed of three work packages. The first should deliver two sessions of training and exercises for Member State officials on preparedness for, and response to, serious cross-border health threats. The training and exercises will cover the responsibilities and roles of different stakeholders; preparedness; crisis communication and the use of IT tools. The second work package will continue the exchange of experts started in 2011 aiming to share best practice and experience on crisis management between officials/stakeholders from the EU Member States. The third work package consists of developing a new e-learning module for the Health Emergency & Diseases Information System (Hedis) application and a description of the different roles and functions to complement those developed in 2010. [Framework contract and call for tenders] 3.1.2. Protect citizens against health threats \u2014 Develop strategies and mechanisms for preventing, exchanging information on and responding to health threats from communicable and non-communicable diseases and health threats from physical, chemical or biological sources, including deliberate release acts (point 1.1.1 in Annex to Programme Decision) 3.1.2.1. P u b l i c h e a l t h r e s p o n s e c o o r d i n a t i o n i n t h e f a c e o f c h e m i c a l e v e n t s The objective of this action is to ensure an efficient response to serious cross-border events caused by chemical agents through the setting up of an EU-level pilot network while ensuring complementarities with the work of other sectors, such as the EU civil protection mechanism (CPM). Such a network will ensure that experiences of and best practices adopted by one Member State following an incident benefit all Member States. It will enable an efficient and coherent EU- level response to potentially devastating cross-border events. This is of particular value for Member States with less capacity and expertise to respond to chemical events. No formal arrangements exist in the field of public health at EU level to coordinate responses to such events. The ad hoc arrangements used so far have clearly demonstrated the need and value-added of putting in place a structured mechanism to trigger risk assessment and coordination of public health measures at EU level. This action will support Member States in implementing the new International Health Regulations . This action should closely consider the experiences gained from the network for surveillance and control of communicable diseases created by Decision No 2119/98/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of EN C 358/16 Official Journal of the European Union 8.12.2011 ",

No formal arrangements exist at EU level to coordinate response to such threats. The ad hoc arrangements used so far have clearly demonstrated the need and value-added of putting in place a structured mechanism to trigger risk assessment and coordination of measures at EU level. This action will support Member States in implementing the new International Health Regulations . This action should build on the results and experiences gained in the framework of projects financed by the health programme in the area of maritime transport, in particular \u2018Assessing the usefulness of an EU ship sanitation programme and coordinated action for the control of communicable diseases in cruise ships and ferries\u2019 (SHIPSAN) and \u2018EU Ship Sanitation Training Network\u2019 (SHIPSAN TRAINET) ( 3 ). This action should cover at least the main international airports in the EU Member States, with the involvement and collaboration of main airlines and airport authorities. This action should: (a) define the scope and standard operating procedures (SOPs), in particular the role of the different authorities involved and a satisfactory coordination mechanism; (b) identify contact points for a network of public health authorities for the surveillance of and response to health threats due to communicable diseases and other threats which could impact on international conveyance areas at designated airports; (c) assist Member States and their airport authorities to develop core capacities and to implement the new International Health Regulations , with a particular focus on the implementation of core capacity requirements for the surveillance of and response to health threats due to communicable diseases and other cross-border threats which could impact on international conveyance areas at designated airports; (d) explore the impact on additional requirements for airport infrastructure, both in terms of personnel and equipment; and (e) based on experience in the maritime transport sector, create a network of public health authorities responsible for civil air transportation, with authority over at least the main international airports in the Member States, with the involvement and collaboration of airlines. Consistency with similar measures adopted by the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) and European Civil Aviation Conference (ECAC) has to be ensured in order to avoid duplication. In the first phase a network should be created covering at least the main hub airports in the EU Member States (minimum 8 Member States and around 10 airports) with the involvement and collaboration of major European airlines (minimum 8 airlines with a total number of around 300 vectors). In the second phase, a set of SOPs and procedures for consultation EN 8.12.2011 Official Journal of the European Union C 358/17 ( 1 ) OJ L 268, 3.10.1998, p. 1.

Control of and response to serious cross-border health threats through maritime transport, such as communicable diseases or threats from chemical, biological and radiological agents, is a cross-border issue that needs to be addressed at EU level. Incoming migration through the sea borders also makes improving communicable disease surveillance and monitoring of maritime transport essential. This action will support the implementation of Decision No 2119/98/EC and its implementation measures, such as Commission Decision 2000/57/EC of 22 December 1999 on the early warning and response system for the prevention and control of communicable diseases under Decision No 2119/98/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council ( 1 ), Directive 2010/65/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 20 October 2010 on reporting formalities for ships arriving in and/or departing from ports of the Member States and repealing Directive 2002/6/EC ( 2 ), and the new International Health Regulations . It also supports the enforcement of Council Directive 2009/13/EC of 16 February 2009 implementing the Agreement concluded by the European Community Shipowners\u2019 Associations (ECSA) and the European Transport Workers\u2019 Federation (ETF) on the Maritime Labour Convention, 2006, and amending Directive 1999/63/EC ( 3 ). This action should build on the results and experiences gained in the framework of projects financed by the health programme in the area of maritime transport, in particular \u2018Assessing the usefulness of a EU ship sanitation programme and coordinated action for the control of communicable diseases in cruise ships and ferries\u2019 (SHIPSAN) and \u2018EU Ship Sanitation Training Network\u2019 (SHIPSAN TRAINET). This action should focus on: (a) operational functioning of the communication platform developed by the SHIPSAN project for coordinating responses to real events on board cruise ships; (b) extension to cargo ships of a suitable and sustainable mechanism for guidance, updating of technical guidelines, training packages, exercise programmes and assessment guidance under the ship sanitation control certificates developed by the SHIPSAN project. This will include a permanent link to the existing mechanisms for communicable disease control in ships under Decision No 2119/98/EC and its implementing measures; (c) training for staff on board cargo ships, public health staff in ports, and officials responsible for maintaining the link between ships, port authorities and public health authorities responsible for notifying other Member States, the Commission and the European Centre for Disease Control; (d) a mechanism enabling risk assessment and support for risk management activities; and (e) examining the feasibility of using the SHIPSAN project to implement the Maritime Declaration of Health in an electronic format as set out in Directive 2010/65/EU.

More effective prevention programmes will help reduce the number of new HIV infections in Europe. They will also contribute to the fight against discrimination and social exclusion, which people affected with HIV often experience. This joint action supports the implementation of Commission Communication COM(2009) 569 final of 26 October 2009 Combating HIV/AIDS in the European Union and neighbouring countries, 2009-2013 ( 4 ). This Communication provides the framework for supporting national strategy development and steers HIV policy coordination between the Member States. It specifically focuses on more effective prevention to tackle HIV transmission. This action, together with other projects related to HIV prevention, translates into action the prevention targets defined in the HIV action plan for 2009- 2013 ( 5 ). This joint action will contribute to overcoming discrimination and increasing the integration of people with disabilities, ethnic minorities and immigrants, men having sex with men and other vulnerable groups. People most at risk of HIV often belong to these groups. EN C 358/18 Official Journal of the European Union 8.12.2011 ( 1 ) OJ L 21, 26.1.2000, p. 32. ( 2 ) OJ L 283, 29.10.2010, p. 1.

This helps to ensure a robust scientific basis for EU policies and measures in line with better regulation principles. Such advice is provided by the Scientific Committees in accordance with Commission Decision 2008/721/EC of 5 August 2008 setting up an advisory structure of Scientific Committees and experts on consumer safety, public health and the environment and repealing Decision 2004/210/EC ( 1 ). This action contributes to increasing the role of science in EU policy debate and it helps to inform citizens of risks. It also enables stakeholders and the general public to better understand EU policies and related proposals. This action has two components: firstly, special indemnities paid to experts for their work on scientific opinions, and secondly, scientific and technical assistance for the functioning of the Scientific Committees and risk communication. Special indemnities are paid to experts for their work on scientific opinions as provided for in Decision 2008/721/EC. [Other actions] Indicative amount: EUR 270 000 Scientific and technical assistance for the functioning of the Scientific Committees and risk communication includes: (a) search, analysis and synthesis of scientific literature; (b) preparation of layman versions of scientific opinions; (c) prep\u00ad aration of summaries; (d) data search; (e) establishment of the bibliography of topics addressed by the Committees; and (f) revision of texts. This support is necessary, as members of the Committees do not benefit from any support from their organisations. It also covers the organisation of scientific hearings, working meetings and thematic workshops. [Calls for tenders] 3.1.4.

The relevant pieces of legislation are: (a) Directive 2002/98/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 January 2003 setting standards of quality and safety for the collection, testing, processing, storage and distribution of human blood and blood components and EN 8.12.2011 Official Journal of the European Union C 358/19 ( 1 ) OJ L 241, 10.9.2008, p. 21. ",
        "amending Directive 2001/83/EC ( 1 ) and related implementing measures ( 2 ); and (b) Directive 2004/23/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 31 March 2004 on setting standards of quality and safety for the donation, procurement, testing, processing, preservation, storage and distribution of human tissues and cells ( 3 ) and related imple\u00ad menting Directives ( 4 ). The collection and supply of blood and blood components is a high-value activity for the Member States\u2019 public health systems, offering and supporting many treatment options. These activities also contribute to developments in the phar\u00ad maceutical sector. The risk of transmitting diseases is inherent to the use of blood and blood components and can lead to potential safety and quality risks. Directive 2002/98/EC and related implementing measures seek to respond to these concerns. The tissues and cells sector is growing fast, providing an increasing number of treatments. It will contribute to economic growth as well as to the development of the pharmaceutical sector. This will only be possible if the safety and quality of collected substances of human origin can be guaranteed. Directive 2004/23/EC and related implementing Directives seek to respond to these concerns. This action will deliver two reports containing an assessment of key points for all Member States. The resulting reports will contribute to (a) reports on Member States\u2019 experiences in implementing Directive 2004/23/EC, as required by Article 26(2), and Directive 2002/98/EC, as required by Article 26(2); (b) identifying Member States with successful implementation and supporting Member States which have encountered problems; (c) helping enforce the implementation of this legislation; and (d) identifying systemic problems which may require changes in legislation. The estimated time for delivery of the reports is end-2013. [Call for tenders] 3.1.4.2.

This action will help implement Commission Communication COM(2008) 819/3 of 8 December 2008 Action Plan on Organ Donation and Transplantation (2009-2015): Strengthened Cooperation between Member States ( 5 ). This action seeks to set up an EU-level IT platform for the multilateral exchange of organs. Most Member States have national allocation bodies to match available organs with potential recipients and ensure the optimal allocation and use of every organ. Some Member States have joined efforts within a multi-country exchange organisation, such as Eurotransplant and Scandiatransplant . However, not all organs can be matched, allocated and used within these countries or multi-country zones. This is particularly true for highly immunised patients, children and rare organs. An EU-level platform that connects the existing organ allocation bodies in Europe will enable this. This action covers the development of protocols and agreed formats for easy and fast data exchange. Preparatory work has already been undertaken within the \u2018Coordinating a European initiative among national organisations for organ transplantation\u2019 (COORENOR) project funded by the health programme. This will be developed further, a concrete platform will be set up and the number of Member States involved will be increased. Careful legal, financial and operational preparation leading to concrete agreements between Member States will contribute to the sustainability of the platform. This action will also help national authorities to establish bilateral agreements to exchange organs between Member States. Not all Member States have transplant programmes for every type of organ. Establishing organ-specific bilateral agreements between Member States gives EU citizens\u2019 access to care in a transplant centre in another Member State that is specialised in the organ of their need. These organs can also be procured in one Member State and sent to another. Existing agreements have increased the mobility of patients and utilisation of organs in Europe. This action will explore existing practices, identify opportunities for bilateral agreements, help Member States develop bilateral agreements and establish an operational set-up. Work undertaken within the COORENOR project will contribute to this. EN C 358/20 Official Journal of the European Union 8.12.2011 ( 1 ) OJ L 33, 8.2.2003, p. 30.

This action derives from several projects funded by the health programme and the work done by various working groups to identify and develop best practices in the EU. These cover in particular: (a) public awareness campaigns; (b) donor identification, recruitment and management; (c) living donation of organs; (d) quality practices in blood and tissue establishments, in particular on collection, testing, processing, storage and distribution; (e) monitoring the safety of human substances; (f) collaboration with intensive care units; and (g) follow-up of post-donation and post-transplant/transfusion. Owing to its outreach and structure, CoE can significantly contribute to the dissemination of best practice and reach out to additional audiences. These include health professionals and establishments, represented in many of the expert groups managed by CoE, and representatives of competent authorities in its expert groups. These competent authorities are responsible for organising donation, transplantation and transfusion activities in the Member States. To leverage this outreach and make sure that additional groups are able to benefit from the knowledge developed with the help of EU funding, CoE will develop and implement a dissemination plan for different target groups and geographic coverage. Concrete activities may include conferences, platform building, awareness campaigns, distribution of references through emailing/websites, publication of leaflets/guidance materials and training. These activities will contribute to a better implementation of the safety and quality requirements as laid down in Directive 2010/53/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 7 July 2010 on standards of quality and safety of human organs intended for transplantation ( 1 ); Directive 2002/98/EC and its implementing legislation, and Directive 2004/23/EC and its implementing legislation.

It will also analyse the impact of the interventions taken by the EU, Member States and third countries to reduce tobacco-related inequalities. These measures target in particular lower educational, occupational and income groups, different gender and age groups and specific socially disadvantaged groups, such as disabled persons, homeless people, young people with special needs and migrants. This action will provide a comprehensive picture of the challenges posed by tobacco-related inequalities throughout the EU, providing an evidence base and contribute to the sharing of best practices. Given that certain marginal groups are difficult to reach, it is useful for the Member States to learn from each other\u2019s experience and avoid using resources on measures that have proved ineffective. This action will deliver a study presenting a comprehensive analysis of current and future tobacco-related inequalities and an overview of the most cost-effective measures to address these. It will contain recommendations on integrating health equity considerations into tobacco-control policies and legislation at Member States\u2019 and EU level.

This action was announced in Commission Communication COM(2010) 0682 final of 23 November 2010 An Agenda for new skills and jobs: A European contribution towards full employment ( 1 ). It will directly contribute to reaching the aims of priority 2 Equipping people with the right skills for employment set out in the Communi\u00ad cation. Member States also requested the setting up of such a platform in the Council conclusions on investing in Europe's health workforce of tomorrow: Scope for innovation and collaboration adopted on 7 December 2010 ( 2 ). Comprehensive and integrated forecasting mechanisms and strategies would help Member States to assess the number and kind of health workforce their health systems require. Adequate forecasting and planning contributes to ensuring the sustainability of health systems and meeting current and future challenges. These include an ageing workforce and ageing patients; increased services to manage chronic conditions, mental health, long-term care and social care; new patterns of health workforce and the growing migration of health workers across countries. Action at EU level can also add value in mapping the skills and competences needed for the future and helping to equip health workers with the necessary education, as well as determining crucial factors for a satisfactory working environment. This action aims to: (a) provide information and exchange best practices about planning methodologies in use. It will provide analyses on the factors determining their success, including the local context, culture and workforce structure. A database of best practices and guidelines for improved modelling will be developed (2013-2014) and an EU-level permanent platform will be created (2015); (b) estimate future needs in terms of skills and competences of the health workforce and their distribution. A report on the different methodologies used in the EU will be produced, together with user's guidelines on how to estimate future needs (2013); (c) advise on how workforce-planning capacities can be built up in Member States (2014). This action will identify experts on workforce planning in Member States that can assist competent authorities in other Member States to build up workforce planning capacities; (d) develop EU guidance on how donor and receiving countries can cooperate in order to find a mutually beneficial solution in terms of training capacities and circular mobility (2014-2015); and (e) provide information on mobility trends of health professionals in Member States (2013-2015). Such collaboration has been initiated within different research and innovation projects, like \u2018HEALTH PROfessional Mobility in THe European Union Study\u2019 (PROMeTHEUS) ( 3 ) or \u2018Nurse Forecasting: Human Resources Planning in Nursing\u2019 (RN4CAST) ( 4 ), but it needs to be further supported. The EU platform will also have this function. This joint action should capitalise on PROMETHEUS, RN4CAST and the \u2018Mobility for Health Professionals\u2019 (MoHProf) ( 5 ) projects and make use of their results and outcomes. This action will contribute to the implementation of the \u2018WHO Global Code of Practice on the International Recruitment of Health Personnel\u2019 which serves as an ethical framework to guide Member States in the recruitment of health workers, especially those from the developing countries facing critical shortage of health workers, by helping EU Member States to take effective measures to educate, retain and sustain an appropriate health workforce built on an evidence-based health workforce plan (point 5.4 of the Code).

This action directly contributes to reaching the aims of the European Innovation Partnership in the field of active and healthy ageing . Given the limited resources and expertise available nationally, action at EU level creates significant economies of scale. This action responds to the need for accurate and comparable data on cancer incidence, prevalence, cure, survival and mortality in the EU as advocated in Commission Communication COM(2009) 291 final of 24 June 2009 on Action Against Cancer: European Partnership ( 1 ). These data will provide a basis for framing an effective cancer policy. It also responds to the need to update cancer screening guidelines as set out in the Council Recommendation 2003/878/EC of 2 December 2003 on cancer screening ( 2 ). The aim is to provide a new edition of the European Guidelines for quality assurance in breast cancer screening and diagnosis reflecting the latest scientific developments. The estimated timeline for delivery is three years. It also seeks to develop the Voluntary European Accreditation Scheme for Breast Cancer Service. This is in response to the Council conclusions of 10 June 2008 on reducing the burden of cancer ( 3 ) and European Parliament requests such as the European Parliament Written Declaration of 14 December 2009 on the fight against breast cancer in the European Union (0071/2009).

P r e v e n t i n g c h r o n i c d i s e a s e s The objective of this action is to help the Member States to develop and implement more cost-effective policies on chronic disease prevention. This action seeks to support projects that examine the cost-effectiveness of integrated approaches to chronic disease prevention with a particular focus on diabetes, cardiovascular diseases or respiratory diseases. This will include the cost- effectiveness of various interventions to prevent, screen and treat chronic diseases. Projects will also consider an emphasis on reducing health inequalities and the effect on populations with the highest rates of premature death. Work will be focused on economic evaluation, in particular cost-effectiveness analysis, and estimates for scaling up to national and international levels. By contributing to reductions in premature mortality and morbidity, including in vulnerable groups, this action will contribute to the objectives of Commission Communication COM(2009) 567 of 20 October 2009 Solidarity in health: reducing health inequalities in the EU . It also responds to the Council conclusions: \u2018Innovative approaches for chronic diseases in public health and healthcare systems\u2019 adopted on 7 December 2010 ( 2 ).

This action contributes to the implementation of Commission Communication COM(2008) 679 final of 11 November 2008 on Rare diseases: Europe\u2019s challenges ( 3 ) and Council Recommendation of 8 June 2009 on an action in the field of rare diseases (2009/C 151/02) ( 4 ). Rare disease registries and information networks are key instruments for increasing knowledge about rare diseases and developing clinical research. They are the only way to pool data in order to achieve a sufficient sample size for epidemiological research and/or clinical research. Owing to the small size of samples at national level, these registers and information networks can only be created at EU level. Collaborative efforts to establish data collection and maintain them will be considered, provided that these resources are open and accessible. Registration of patients is a key to any further action to improve their quality of life. It is necessary for the designation of orphan drugs, for establishing research priorities and for the designation and accreditation of European Reference Networks (ERN) for rare diseases. This action will also contribute to the reflection on criteria for designating ERN in the framework established by Directive 2011/24/EU. Priority areas for this action are rare tumours, rare anaemias, cerebral palsies, neuromuscular diseases, cystic fibrosis, rare neurological disorders and rare syndromes associated with autism. Other rare diseases may also be considered. This action seeks to co-finance at least five networks.

The European Community Health Indicators (ECHI) are the main component of the European health monitoring system, which enables the Commission and Member States to identify and exchange best practices as set out in Article 168 of the TFEU, and to assess the performance and sustainability of their health systems as set out in the Europe 2020 Strategy . This action seeks to assess the extent to which these indicators are used in decision-making in the Member States and at EU level. It will analyse how Member States use ECHI indicators in monitoring and evaluating their health policies and in assessing the performance of their health systems, with a particular focus on sustainability.

This relates to: (a) information for the European Innovation Partnership in the field of active and healthy ageing that will pilot innovative approaches to health and social care delivery for an ageing population; (b) responding to the Member States\u2019 demand for support and advice on the sustainability of national health systems by investigating the cost-effectiveness of prevention measures and the effectiveness, efficiency and impact of health interventions; and (c) developing and promoting key indicators in health care and health care systems. This action has two work packages. The first work package focuses on assessing the cost-effectiveness of chronic disease prevention activities and the overall economic implications of chronic diseases comparing alternative policy/intervention scenarios for future chronic disease prevention policies. It should include interventions relating to the principle risk factors for major chronic diseases (smoking, nutrition, physical activity and harmful alcohol consumption) as well as chronic disease prevention/management programmes for cancer, cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, mental disorders and chronic respiratory diseases. It will develop a typology of the breadth and depth of health promotion and prevention interventions with a particular focus on alcohol abuse, smoking, nutrition and physical activity. It will include evaluating the performance of these interventions in the light of the OECD Health Data on non-medical determinants of health \u2014 nutrition, alcohol abuse and smoking \u2014 under the aspect of how this could influence chronic diseases and their economic impact. It will gauge the quality of primary care systems for meeting the needs of people with chronic health conditions by considering their performance in the light of selected population-based quality measures. It will also review the role and potential impact of disease management programmes and pay-for-performance and other incentive schemes. The second work package will take further work on patient safety indicators undertaken by the Commission and the OECD in the OECD \u2018Health Care Quality Indicators\u2019 project ( 1 ) which was launched in 2010. The Commission has co- funded the project in 2006-2007 through project 2005 151 \u2018Indicators of quality of health care\u2019 and in 2009-2011 through project 2009 53 02 \u2018European edition of Health at a Glance and Health Care Quality Indicators: moving to the next level \u2014 HealthData\u2019. This action responds to the Council Recommendation of 9 June 2009 on patient safety, including the prevention and control of healthcare associated infections (2009/C 151/01) ( 2 ), which recommends developing a set of reliable and comparable indicators in order to facilitate mutual learning, taking account of the work being done by international organisations. This action also contributes to the implementation of Directive 2011/24/EU. This work will include (a) enlarging the number of potential indicators; (b) collecting data in Member States that do not yet contribute to data collection; and (c) developing indicators that can be used at hospital/facility level.

The Council conclusions of 6 June 2011 Towards modern, responsive and sustainable health systems call for the Commission to set up a mechanism to this end. This will be accomplished by creating a multi-disciplinary facility consisting of highly qualified experts in relevant fields including public health, health system management, epidemiology, social security, health economics and public finance. Experts should come from academia, industry and civil society. The Commission will manage the facility. This will include, where necessary, preparing background material to be attached to questions and liaising with the experts. The opinions endorsed by the experts must be tailored to the specific needs and the specific situation of the Member State submitting the request. This facility may also provide health expertise to the Commission in connection with the Annual Growth Survey and the national reform plans.

This action also seeks to promote EU health- related actions linked to new priorities, including the Europe 2020 Strategy . This action has three components. The first of these is the promotion of Directive 2011/24/EU. The Directive provides for a new and innovative approach to addressing reimbursement of cross-border healthcare, facilitates the recognition of prescriptions from other Member States, helps patients requiring specialised treatment, and facilitates the exchange of information on the quality and safety standards of healthcare. The success of its implementation depends on how well informed stakeholders and the general public are of its provisions. Clear and targeted measures under this action seek to ensure this. Measures include leaflets, disseminating information on the web, and participation in conferences with stakeholders. The second component is organising the Fourth EU Journalist Prize. This action seeks to further expand and maintain an informal network of journalists in Member States focusing on health. This will contribute to a better EU health news coverage in Member States and thereby increasing awareness of EU action on health, healthcare and patients\u2019 rights. The third component covers the preparation and dissemination of information and communication material to explain EU health activities and initiatives. In addition to activities relating to on-going health initiatives and promoting health programmes\u2019 results, activities focus in particular on explaining the Tobacco Products\u2019 Initiative and the Health Security Initiative to stakeholders and citizens. Activities include preparing and disseminating audiovisual material and publications in electronic format and on paper, organising and participating in workshops and expert meetings, and providing information stands and other communication/PR material.

Contributions in kind from third parties may be considered as co-financing if considered necessary or appropriate (Article 113 of the Financial Regulation and Article 172 of the Implementing Rules). \u2014 No-profit rule: the grant may not have the purpose or effect of producing a profit for the beneficiary (Article 109(2) of the Financial Regulation and Article 165 of the Implementing Rules). \u2014 No-retroactivity rule: expenditure eligible for financing must be incurred after the agreement is signed. In exceptional cases, it may be acceptable to consider expenditure that was incurred from the date of submission of the grant application, but not earlier (Article 112 of the Financial Regulation). \u2014 No-cumulation rule: only one operating grant may be awarded to a given beneficiary per financial year (Article 111 of the Financial Regulation) ( 1 ). 3.

The criterion \u2018independent from industry, commercial and business or other conflicting interest\u2019 refers to three requirements, all of which the applicant organisation has to meet: 1. LEGAL INDEPENDENCE To be eligible for funding, an NGO has to be independent from other entities representing industry, commercial and business or other conflicting interests. Two legal entities shall be regarded as independent of each other when neither is under the direct or indirect control of the other or under the same direct or indirect control of a third entity as the other. Control may in particular take one of the following forms: (a) the direct or indirect holding of more than 50 % of the nominal value of the issued share capital in the legal entity concerned, or of a majority of the voting rights of the shareholders or associates of that entity; (b) the direct or indirect holding of decision-making powers, in fact or in law, in the legal entity concerned. However, the following relationships between legal entities shall not in themselves be deemed to constitute controlling relationships: (c) the direct or indirect holding of more than 50 % of the nominal value of the issued share capital of the applicant organisation or a majority of voting rights of the shareholders or associates of the legal entities is held by the same public body; (d) the legal entities concerned are owned or supervised by the same public body. 2. FINANCIAL INDEPENDENCE In order to be considered independent, applicant organisations must unilaterally commit not to receive more than 20 % of their core funding from private sector organisations ( 1 ) representing a conflicting interest, or from other sources representing a conflicting interest during the financial years covered by the grant. Core funding shall mean financing required for the basic structure of an organisation, including salaries of full-time staff, facilities, equipment, communications, and the direct expenses of day-to-day work. Core funding also includes financing of all permanent or regularly repeated activities. Core funding requirements are often budgeted separately from other costs, such as specific actions or projects. 3. TRANSPARENCY OF THE APPLICANT'S ACTIVITIES AND FUNDING All activities should be published in the applicant's annual report ( 2 ). All information on funding is to be made available to the public via the applicant's website, broken down by type (core and project funding, contribution in kind) and by funding entity. Applicant's existing position statements regarding their requirement on transparency are to be publicly available. 4. ASSESSMENT OF INDEPENDENCE Legal independence and transparency is assessed based on the latest available information provided by the applicant together with the application.
