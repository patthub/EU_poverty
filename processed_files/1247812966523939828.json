        "2 Abstract In 2015, the United Nations adopted the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development with 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and 169 associated targets. All 193 United Nations member states have committed to achieve sustainable development across its three dimensions \u2013 economic, social, and environmental \u2013 in a balanced and integrated manner. In order to assist countries in measuring their progress towards the achievement of the SDGs, Bertelsmann Stiftung and the United Nations Sustainable Development Solutions Network (SDSN) developed the Sustainable Development Goals Index and Dashboards (SDG Index) in 2016. Since then, the SDG Index has been annually updated and presently covers 162 countries. The European Commission\u2019s Competence Centre on Composite Indicators and Scoreboards (COIN) at the Joint Research Centre (JRC) was invited by the SDSN to audit the 2019 edition of the SDG Index which will be launched on the sidelines of the 2019 United Nations High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development. The audit presented herein aims to contribute to ensuring the transparency of the SDG Index methodology and the reliability of the results. The report touches upon data quality issues, the conceptual and statistical coherence of the framework and the impact of modelling assumptions on the results. The fact that the SDGs are universal and highly diverse in nature makes the work of aggregating into a single number quite challenging from a statistical point of view. Nevertheless, the SDG Index is a remarkable effort of synthetizing the 17 SDGs into a single measure. The index ranks are robust enough, allowing meaningful conclusions to be drawn from the index. ",
        "3 1 Introduction The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and its 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) was adopted by all 193 United Nations (UN) member states in 2015. The implementation and success of this universal agenda will rely on all countries and will require national sustainable development policies and multi-stakeholder partnerships. Sound metrics are critical for turning the SDGs into practical tools for problem solving by mobilising governments, academia, civil society and business; providing a report card to track progress and ensure accountability; and serving as a management tool for the transformations needed to achieve the SDGs by 2030. Countries are expected to voluntarily establish national frameworks for monitoring progress made on the 17 SDGs. The UN High- Level Political Forum plays a central role in following up and reviewing progress at the global level. In order to assist countries in the annual stocktaking of SDGs progress, Bertelsmann Stiftung and the Sustainable Development Solutions Network (SDSN) launched in 2016 the first edition of the Sustainable Development Goals Index and Dashboards (SDG Index). The SDG Index is a composite measure of progress covering 85 indicators across all 17 goals. Now in its 2019 edition, the SDG Index includes 162 countries, while the dashboards present data for all 193 UN member states. Additional metrics are also provided on the dashboards and country profiles of members of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). The European Commission\u2019s Competence Centre on Composite Indicators and Scoreboards (COIN) at the Joint Research Centre (JRC) was invited by the SDSN to audit the 2019 edition of the SDG Index which will be launched on the sidelines of the 2019 United Nations High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development in July in New York. The results of the audit presented herein aim at shedding light on the transparency and reliability of the SDG Index. It is expected to contribute to enable policymakers and advocates to derive more accurate and meaningful conclusions and to potentially guide choices on priority setting and policy formulation. The JRC statistical audit 1 of the SDG Index focuses on two main issues: the statistical coherence of the structure of indicators (Section 2) and the impact of key modelling assumptions on the SDG Index ranking (Section 3). The audit follows three main steps: the first focuses on the main descriptive statistics of the data and on a data analysis to detect missing values and potential outliers; the second on the analysis of the statistical coherence through a multilevel analysis of the correlations of the indicators and pillars, and; the third, on the robustness analysis of the index and the testing of the impact of key modelling assumptions. The results are supported by a spreadsheet in Excel format [1]. The JRC analysis also complements the reported country rankings for the SDG index with confidence intervals in order to better appreciate the robustness of these ranks to the computation methodology (in particular the exclusion of potentially problematic indicators, weights and aggregation formula at the goals level). An initial assessment on the 2018 edition of the SDG Index [2] [3] was undertaken by the JRC in February 2019 [4]. The latest 2019 edition provided by the developers incorporated many of the JRC suggestions and for some of the identified issues the developers provided strong arguments for using a different approach. 1 The JRC statistical audit is based on the recommendations of the OECD & JRC (2008) Handbook on Composite Indicators and on more recent research from the JRC. JRC audits of composite indicators are conducted upon request of their developers. For more information see: https://composite-indicators.jrc.ec.europa.eu ",
        "4 2 Conceptual and statistical coherence 2.1 Relevance to the SDG Index framework The conceptual framework of the SDG Index mirrors the 17 SDGs agreed by all UN member states (Table 1). It includes 85 indicators (listed in Annex I) grouped into 17 goals, which are subsequently aggregated into the SDG Index. The overall index is calculated as the simple arithmetic average of the 17 goals. While another structure could have been adopted, such as the triple bottom line framework \u2013 Environmental, Social and Economic, or the 5Ps framework \u2013 People, Planet, Prosperity, Peace and Partnership, the authors of the SDG Index decided to maintain the alignment with the global SDGs framework and in this way assist countries to measure their baselines and progress in each of the 17 SDGs. The choice of aggregating indicators in the 17 goals to link to the 2030 global policy agenda [5] is conceptually well justified and responds to a political need of tracking progress at goal level. The indicators were selected based on five criteria: relevance to monitoring the achievement of the SDGs; statistical adequacy; timeliness; data quality and coverage. Expert consultation was used in the process of selecting the indicators. The conceptual relevance of the indicators underpinning the SDG index framework is not discussed in this report. One remark though, is that their number across SDGs is uneven, ranging from SDG10 with only one indicator to SDG3 with 14 indicators. As acknowledged by the authors, this means that those 14 indicators in SDG3 weight individually less than the single indicator in SDG10. Table 1. Conceptual framework of the SDG Index.

        "5 2.2 Data availability The 2019 SDG index was calculated for 162 countries. This coverage implies five additional countries in comparison with the last edition (Maldives, Fiji, Sao Tome and Principe, Vanuatu and Comoros). Additionally, the index is based on reliable and publicly available data published by official international data providers (e.g. World Bank, WHO, ILO, among others) and other international organisations including research centres and non- governmental organisations. This is an important point given that the quality and adequacy of the index lies not only on the index development, but also on obtaining reliable data. Table 2 offers summary statistics for the indicators included in the SDG Index using the raw data and highlights the cases in which specific issues were found in terms of data coverage and presence of outliers. In the table some preliminary imputations made by the developers\u2019 team are included. Moreover, for each indicator, sustainability \u201ctargets\u201d were determined either based on explicit/implicit SDGs targets, science-based targets or average performance of the best performers [3]. At the same time, to remove the effect of extreme values, the developers capped the data at the bottom 2.5th percentile as the minimum value for the normalisation. These upper and lower bounds remain the same over the annual editions of the index and are included in Table 2. The JRC recommended approach would be to only treat data in specific cases where it is needed, however the developers argue that this approach is adopted in order to facilitate comparability of the results.

        "8 In general, the data coverage for the indicators included in the index is good, covering at least 80% both at indicator and country level. Countries are included if data availability is at least 80% at index level, however this is not the case at goal level where in some SDGs there are countries which have no indicator data at all. In these cases, the developers impute the missing value using the regional average score in the specific goal. For example, Afghanistan misses both indicators in SDG1 (No poverty) so the SDG1 score that it gets is the regional score for East Europe & Central Asia. This implies primarily to SDG10, but also to SDG1, SDG4, SDG14, SDG15 and SDG17. SDG14 is a particular case since the countries that miss data are the landlocked countries. The countries that miss more than 55% of indicators on a specific goal (excluding SDG14) are listed in Table 3. This is a fact that needs to be highlighted so that conclusions are carefully drawn for these countries, since the results can be reflecting more a regional average than the particular situation of the country. Therefore, the JRC recommends for the following editions of the index to increase the number of indicators in these SDGs and/or focus specifically on aforementioned countries trying to find alternative data sources. Table 3. Countries missing more than 55% of indicators at goal level in the SDG Index. Source: European Commission\u2019s Joint Research Centre, 2019. Besides the use of regional average values for imputing data for the cases above, there are also around eight indicators with poor data coverage for which data is imputed on a case-by-case basis [3]. The approaches used to impute the missing data are described on the SDG Index detailed methodological paper, while the imputed data can be clearly identified in the SDG Index dataset. These are important aspects contributing to increase the transparency of the SDG Index.

        "9 2.3 Identification and treatment of outliers Potentially problematic indicators that could bias the overall index results were identified on the basis of two measures related to the shape of the distributions: the skewness and kurtosis. A practical rule used by the JRC [6] is that an indicator should be considered for treatment if it has an absolute skewness greater than 2.0 and kurtosis greater than 3.5. Based on this rule, Table 2 shows that initially there are 18 potentially problematic indicators in the raw dataset which would require greater attention because of their skewed distributions. After the lower and upper bound setting by the developers this number was reduced. However, there are nine indicators which remain very skewed: HIV infections (3e), Imported groundwater depletion (6d), CO 2 emissions from fuel combustion (7c), Fatal Accidents embodied in imports (8e), People affected by climate-related disasters (13c), CO 2 emissions embodied in fossil fuel exports (13d), Commodity-drive deforestation (15d), Homicides (16a), Weapons exports (16h) and Tax Haven Score (17c). As suggested by the JRC, the index developers applied different techniques to improve the distributions, such as logarithmic transformations, but no major improvements were observed. Due to the policy relevance of these indicators identified by the developers, they have decided to keep them in the framework, however for completeness; the effect of removing these indicators is investigated in the uncertainty analysis in Section 3. 2.4 Normalisation As mentioned on section 2.2, the developers used boundaries on the lower and upper bounds of the scale. The indicators\u2019 values are normalised using the min-max normalisation method on a scale of 0 to 100 using as minimum and maximum values the pre-set bounds. The rescaling equation ensured that all rescaled variables were expressed as ascending variables (i.e. higher values denoted better performance). In this way, the rescaled data became easy to communicate to a wider public and to compare across all indicators. 2.5 Weighting and aggregation The SDG Index is calculated using equal weighting for the underlying components. At goal level, this is justified by the fact that all SDGs are considered as having equal importance as part of the 2030 Agenda. At the indicator level, equal weighting was retained because all alternatives were considered as being less satisfactory. However, assigning equal weights to the indicators and goals do not necessarily guarantee an equal contribution of the indicators or goals to the SDG Index [6] [7]. For example, considering that goals are measured using an uneven number of indicators, the 14 global indicators under SDG3 are effectively weighted less in the overall aggregation than the single indicator used to measure SDG 10. Regarding the aggregation formula, the arithmetic average is used at all levels to build the SDG Index; at the first aggregation level (from indicators to goals) and at the second and last aggregation level (from goals to the overall index). This means that the overall index is calculated as the arithmetic average over the 17 SDGs. While arithmetic averages are easy to interpret, they also allow perfect compensability between the variables, whereby a high score on one variable can fully offset low scores in other variables. This may not necessarily fit with the concept of sustainable development where having a high social sustainability should not come at the cost of low environmental sustainability, although this is often observed in practice - see the following section. The geometric average is an alternative aggregation method which is non-compensatory and fits with the view that scores in different dimensions of sustainability should not compensate one another. The ",
        "10 impacts of the aggregation formula as well as of the weighting scheme in the index results will be discussed thoroughly in section 3. 2.6 Cross-correlation analysis The statistical coherence of the SDG Index should be considered a necessary, though not necessarily sufficient, condition for a sound index. Given that the present statistical analysis is mostly based on correlations, the correspondence of the SDG Index to a real world phenomenon needs to be critically addressed because \u201ccorrelations do not necessarily represent the real influence of the individual indicators on the phenomenon being measured\u201d [6]. This relies on the combination of statistical and conceptual soundness. The cross-correlation analysis is used to address to what extent the data support the conceptual framework. The 1% significance level is used to determine whether the correlation between two variables is statistically significant. In the ideal case, there should be positive significant correlations within every level of the index, i.e. each indicator positively correlated with its goal and the index as well as each goal correlated with the index. This effectively ensures that the overall index scores adequately reflect the underlying indicator values. Redundancy should be avoided in the framework because if two indicators are collinear, this amounts to double-counting (and therefore over-weighting) the same phenomenon. It also increases the complexity, which is contrary to good practices of data modelling, in which the simplest model that explains the data (or phenomenon) is preferable (Occam\u2019s Razor). A detailed analysis of the correlation within and across goals confirms that most of the indicators are more correlated to their own goal than to any other goal. A few exceptions were found, but as the SDG Index conceptual framework is limited by the fixed structure of the UN SDG official framework [8], those indicators cannot be simply transferred from one goal to another, as acknowledged by the index developers. Overall, correlations within each goal are significant and positive, but there are a few indicators which would require greater attention due to their negative correlation with other indicators and with the goal. Table 4 shows the correlation between indicators, their respective goal and the overall index. Some indicators are negatively correlated with their respective goal and/or with the index (highlighted in red), typically as a result of negative correlations with other indicators. Other indicators are highly collinear (i.e. Pearson correlation coefficients greater than 0.92) with their respective goal (highlighted in blue). ",
        "11 Table 4. Correlations between the indicators, their respective goal and the overall index. Notes: Numbers represent the Pearson correlation coefficients between each indicator and the corresponding goal as well as between each indicator and the overall index. Correlations that are not significant at the significance level of \u03b1 = 0.01 are highlighted in grey (critical value of 0.202). Very high correlations (i.e. Pearson correlation coefficients greater than 0.92) are highlighted in blue and negative correlations in red. Source: European Commission\u2019s Joint Research Centre, 2019. Table 5summarises the correlation coefficients between goals as well as between each goal and the overall index. Values greater than 0.70 are desirable as they imply that the index captures at least 50% (\u2248 0.70 \u00d7 0.70) of the variation in the underlying goals and vice- versa. This is the case for 11 out of 17 SDGs: from SDG1 to SDG9, SDG11 and SDG16. SDG3 shows a very high correlation (Pearson correlation coefficient 0.93) which may suggest redundancy. SDG10 and SDG17 have lower correlation coefficients but still significant, suggesting that their importance is lower that this of the other goals. With respect to the remaining goals, SDG14 and SDG15 show no significant correlation with the overall index, while SDG12 and SDG13 present a negative relationship with the index. In practice, this means that the highest scoring countries on the SDG Index are having some of the lowest scores in SDG12 and SDG13, and vice versa, which can give the impression I n d i c a t o r i d R e s p e c t i v e S D G I n d e x I n d i c a t o r i d R e s p e c t i v e S D G I n d e x I n d i c a t o r i d R e s p e c t i v e S D G I n d e x 1 a 0 . 9 5 0 . 7 9 5 d 0 . 6 5 0 . 3 3 1 2 f 0 . 7 7 - 0 . 3 5 1 b 0 . 9 8 0 . 8 9 6 a 0 . 7 9 0 . 8 3 1 3 a 0 . 7 0 - 0 . 4 7 2 a 0 . 6 6 0 . 7 8 6 b 0 . 7 6 0 . 8 6 1 3 b 0 . 5 6 - 0 . 1 6 2 b 0 . 7 1 0 . 8 5 6 c 0 . 2 5 - 0 . 0 6 1 3 c 0 . 4 6 0 . 2 5 2 c 0 . 6 9 0 . 6 4 6 d 0 . 1 6 - 0 . 0 6 1 3 d 0 . 6 9 - 0 . 0 8 2 d - 0 . 2 4 - 0 . 5 4 6 e 0 . 7 0 0 . 6 9 1 4 a 0 . 5 5 0 . 3 4 2 e 0 . 6 8 0 . 6 8 7 a 0 . 9 5 0 . 8 3 1 4 b 0 . 3 7 0 . 3 6 2 f 0 . 5 5 0 . 4 1 7 b 0 . 9 4 0 . 8 4 1 4 c 0 . 5 0 - 0 . 2 6 2 g - 0 . 3 2 - 0 . 7 4 7 c 0 . 5 1 0 . 3 5 1 4 d 0 . 5 0 - 0 . 4 8 3 a 0 . 8 9 0 . 8 4 8 a 0 . 7 1 0 . 6 5 1 5 a 0 . 7 8 0 . 2 5 3 b 0 . 9 3 0 . 8 8 8 b 0 . 6 4 0 . 5 8 1 5 b 0 . 8 1 0 . 2 2 3 c 0 . 9 4 0 . 8 9 8 c 0 . 7 4 0 . 7 7 1 5 c 0 . 5 2 0 . 1 0 3 d 0 . 7 0 0 . 5 9 8 d 0 . 4 4 0 . 0 8 1 5 d 0 . 3 6 0 . 3 5 3 e 0 . 4 7 0 . 3 8 8 e - 0 . 1 4 - 0 . 3 4 1 5 e 0 . 2 2 - 0 . 4 6 3 f 0 . 6 4 0 . 5 7 9 a 0 . 8 8 0 . 8 6 1 6 a 0 . 4 9 0 . 3 1 3 g 0 . 8 9 0 . 8 4 9 b 0 . 8 4 0 . 7 9 1 6 b 0 . 6 1 0 . 4 6 3 h 0 . 7 9 0 . 7 7 9 c 0 . 9 2 0 . 7 0 1 6 c 0 . 7 2 0 . 5 0 3 i 0 . 9 7 0 . 9 1 9 d 0 . 8 9 0 . 6 3 1 6 d 0 . 7 6 0 . 5 8 3 j 0 . 8 3 0 . 7 6 9 e 0 . 8 9 0 . 6 8 1 6 e 0 . 6 8 0 . 7 3 3 k 0 . 7 9 0 . 7 6 9 f 0 . 8 8 0 . 6 6 1 6 f 0 . 8 3 0 . 6 9 3 l 0 . 6 2 0 . 5 9 1 0 a 1 . 0 0 0 . 4 1 1 6 g 0 . 7 5 0 . 8 0 3 m 0 . 9 4 0 . 9 1 1 1 a 0 . 7 3 0 . 5 1 1 6 h - 0 . 3 2 - 0 . 4 3 3 n 0 . 7 9 0 . 7 7 1 1 b 0 . 7 8 0 . 6 8 1 6 i 0 . 4 0 0 . 3 4 4 a 0 . 8 4 0 . 7 0 1 1 c 0 . 6 0 0 . 4 5 1 7 a 0 . 5 8 0 . 6 2 4 c 0 . 9 2 0 . 8 3 1 2 a 0 . 7 3 - 0 . 4 8 1 7 b 1 0 . 6 9 0 . 3 0 4 b 0 . 9 2 0 . 8 0 1 2 b 0 . 9 2 - 0 . 7 9 1 7 b 2 0 . 9 1 0 . 4 8 5 a 0 . 7 4 0 . 6 3 1 2 c 0 . 5 1 - 0 . 3 4 1 7 c 0 . 3 4 - 0 . 2 3 5 b 0 . 7 1 0 . 7 1 1 2 d 0 . 7 3 - 0 . 5 2 5 c 0 . 4 5 - 0 . 0 1 1 2 e 0 . 8 5 - 0 . 5 3 ",
        "12 that high-scoring countries score highly in all goals. This seems to be an unavoidable reality in which environmental sustainability goes somewhat contrary to social sustainability, and motivates the possibility of using a non-compensatory geometric mean, as discussed earlier. In order to address this issue, a possible revision of the indicators which are not significantly correlated or negatively correlated under each of these four goals could be considered by the developers, particularly in the case where official SDGs indicators are not adopted. In any case, the important is that this disparity between the SDG Index scores and SDG12 and SDG13 should be made clear in the conclusions of the SDG Index, possibly by presenting index scores additionally with these two goals. These issues are further discussed in Section 4. Table 5. Correlations between the goals and SDG Index.

Correlations that are not significant at the significance level of \u03b1 = 0.01 are highlighted in grey (critical value of 0.202).

        "13 2.7 Principal components analysis Principal components analysis (PCA) [9] [10] explores the correlation of all the indicators simultaneously, highlighting, if present, some common trends that describe a common concept among the indicators. It is here used to assess to what extent the conceptual framework of the SDG Index is confirmed by statistical approaches. The results of the PCA performed to the total group of 85 indicators show that there are 17 principal components with eigenvalues greater than 1 that explain almost 80% of the total variance (Table 6). That suggests the presence of several drivers among the indicators and is correctly accommodated by the use of the 17 goals as an intermediate step towards the creation of the overall score. Table 6 - Results of the Principal Components Analysis on the 85 indicators. Results shown for the first 20 out of 85 principal components (PC). Source: European Commission\u2019s Joint Research Centre, 2019. At a second step, PCA is performed to the 17 goals that, after aggregation, form the overall SDG Index score. Ideally, it is expected to have one principal component (PC) explaining at least 70%-80% of the total variance in order to claim that there is a single latent phenomenon behind the data. This is not the case in the SDG Index, as the results show that there are four principal components that explain around 70% of the variance. From the Table 7, the presence of a major driver is evident; the first component explains 50% of the variance, although, still, there are three other components that are explaining enough amount (eigenvalues >=1). e i g e n v a l u e % o f v a r i a n c e c u m u l a t i v e % o f v a r i a n c e P C 1 33 . 38 39 . 27 39 . 27 P C 2 6 . 39 7 . 51 46 . 78 P C 3 4 . 57 5 . 38 52 . 16 P C 4 3 . 3 7 3 . 9 6 5 6 . 12 P C 5 2 . 54 2 . 99 59 . 11 P C 6 2 . 18 2 . 56 61 . 68 P C 7 1 . 99 2 . 34 64 . 02 P C 8 1 . 82 2 . 14 66 . 16 P C 9 1 . 70 2 . 00 68 . 16 P C 10 1 . 51 1 . 78 69 . 94 P C 11 1 . 44 1 . 69 71 . 63 P C 12 1 . 26 1 . 48 73 . 11 P C 13 1 . 16 1 . 37 74 . 48 P C 14 1 . 13 1 . 33 75 . 82 P C 15 1 . 05 1 . 23 77 . 05 P C 16 1 . 04 1 . 22 78 . 27 P C 17 0 . 96 1 . 13 79 . 39 P C 18 0 . 87 1 . 02 80 . 41 P C 19 0 . 86 1 . 01 81 . 42 P C 20 0 . 81 0 . 95 82 . 37 ",

        "16 3 Impact of modelling assumptions on the SDG Index results The development of a composite indicator, like any model, involves assumptions and subjective decisions. This section aims to test the impact of varying some of these assumptions within a range of plausible alternatives in an uncertainty analysis . The objective is therefore to try to quantify the uncertainty in the ranks of the SDG Index, which can demonstrate the extent to which countries can be differentiated by their SDG Index scores. Although many assumptions made in the development of the SDG Index could be examined, three particular assumptions were examined in this uncertainty analysis (see Table 8). These were chosen as plausible alternative pathways in the construction of the SDG Index, which can be relatively easily investigated. Table 8. Conceptual framework of the SDG Index. Assumption Alternatives 1. Indicator set Full set Reduced set 2. Aggregation method (pillar level) Arithmetic average Geometric average 3. Weights (pillar level) Randomly varied +/-25% from nominal values The first is the inclusion of indicators: in the present audit, a number of statistically \u201cproblematic\u201d indicators were identified, which have issues in terms of skewness and correlation (see section 2.3). For conceptual and communication reasons, these indicators were retained in the final index, but the effect is tested here of removing all of these indicators simultaneously, resulting in a \u201creduced set\u201d of indicators which can be viewed as an alternative approach to building the index. The second assumption which is varied is the aggregation method. In the SDG Index, the goal scores are aggregated into a single score using an arithmetic average. An alternative approach would be to use the geometric average, which is non-compensatory , and represents the idea that high scores in one goal should not compensate low scores in another, which is an alternative way to look at sustainable development. Finally, nominal weights assigned at the goal level are all equal. The effect of randomly varying these weights by +/-25% is investigated, to check modest variations in the importance of individual goals. To investigate the impact of varying these assumptions, a Monte Carlo experiment was performed, which involved re-building the SDG Index 4000 times, each time with a randomly-selected combination of assumptions 1-3. The overall results are shown in Figure 2. The uncertainty in the rankings, given the assumptions tested, is mostly quite modest, but some countries show particular sensitivity to changes. About 40% of countries have 90% confidence intervals 2 of ten places or less, with 10% having confidence intervals of five places or fewer. The average confidence interval size is about 13 rank places, however, this is over 162 countries in total, so does not represent a very large uncertainty in this context. A small number of countries have wider confidence intervals (14% have intervals wider than 20 places), with Singapore in particular having an interval of 57 places. The ranking of Bosnia and Herzegovina is also more uncertain, with a confidence interval of 49 places. These stand-out cases are likely due to particularly uneven scores across indicators 2 A 90% confidence interval means that, given the uncertainties tested, the rank falls within this interval with 90% probability.

        "18 The overall picture is that the ranks of the SDG Index are fairly robust, and country ranks can be stated to within around 13 places of precision, although some countries are especially sensitive to the assumptions made. This information should be used to guide the kind of conclusions that can be drawn from the index. For example, differences of two or three places between countries cannot be taken as \u201csignificant\u201d, whereas differences of 10 places upwards can show a meaningful difference. One can also observe from Figure 2 that the confidence intervals are generally wider for mid-ranking countries, and narrower for top and bottom-ranking countries. The Monte Carlo results can also give an idea of sensitivity to the various assumptions. Figure 3 shows the median ranks of the SDG Index for simulations with the full set of indicators against those with the reduced set, and arithmetic against geometric mean. This gives an idea of sensitivity of the rankings to these assumptions. Both plots show a noticeable but fairly limited scatter, which implies that the assumptions are both contributing fairly equally to the uncertainty, although the alternative geometric mean assumption causes greater extreme rank shifts. Figure 3 \u2013 Median ranks of SDG Index with full set of indicators against reduced set (left), and arithmetic mean against geometric mean (right). Source: European Commission\u2019s Joint Research Centre, 2019. To delve slightly further into the possibility of using a geometric average, Figure 4 shows the nominal ranks of the SDG Index (i.e. the default modelling assumptions used by the developers and featured in the final index) plotted against the nominal ranks with a geometric mean applied at the goal level. This is different from Figure 3 in that the uncertainty in the other assumptions is not considered. The results show that the impact of changing to a geometric mean is fairly limited for many countries, with an average rank shift of around four places. However, some countries do shift by a significant amount, including Bosnia (-27), Singapore (-26), and Cuba (-18). The JRC recommends to weigh up the possibility of using a geometric average: it may better reflect the non-compensatory nature of sustainable development, but is more difficult to communicate to stakeholders and comes with a fairly small change in rankings for most countries. This possibility might be reflected on by the developers in future versions of the SDG Index. 0 2 0 4 0 6 0 8 0 1 0 0 1 2 0 1 4 0 1 6 0 0 5 0 1 0 0 1 5 0 M e d i a n r a n k ( r e d u c e d s e t ) M e d i a n r a n k ( f u ll s e t ) 0 20 40 60 80 100 120 140 160 0 50 100 150 M e d i a n r a n k ( g e o m e r t i c ) M e d i a n r a n k ( a r i t h m e t i c ) ",

The overall implications of the uncertainty analysis are that the uncertainty in the rankings is manageable, and allows meaningful conclusions to be drawn from the index, although both the aggregation method and the set of indicators do cause a modest contribution to the uncertainty.

        "20 4 Communication on the SDG Index results It is important to note that the SDG Index can be used as an overall aggregate score, but should also serve as an access point to the underlying goals and indicators. The JRC recommends the developers to derive more policy narratives and conclusions by delving into the individual goals (i.e. first level of aggregation), rather than focusing exclusively on the SDG Index score. The index score can indeed reveal patterns which do not directly emerge by looking at the 17 goals separately, but an analysis at goal level can provide more additional insights. In fact, a detailed analysis of the countries\u2019 ranking positions at SDG Index level and at each goal level (Table 9) reveals that for 56% or more of the 162 countries included, the SDG Index ranking and any of the 17 goals rankings differ by 10 positions or more. The results suggest that the SDG Index ranking highlights aspects of countries\u2019 efforts towards sustainable development that do not emerge by looking into each one of the goals separately. But at the same time, this result points to the value of examining individual goals on their own merit in order to identify which goals are driving a country\u2019s performance, having into account that the overall index score allows full compensability. In particular, SDG10, SDG12, SDG13, SDG14, SDG15 and SDG17 have more than 80% of countries that differ by more than 10 positions from the overall SDG Index ranking. On the other hand, SDG3 which presents the highest correlation with the overall index has the lower number of countries with a shift of more than 10 positions (56%). Table 9 \u2013 Distribution of differences between goals and SDG Index rankings. Source: European Commission\u2019s Joint Research Centre, 2019. Countries ranking first on the aggregated SDG Index can have significantly lower positions on individual goals. This happens due to the presence of significant negative correlations between SDG12 and SDG13 with any of the other goals in the SDG Index framework (see section 2.6). While there is a clear positive association between the SDG Index and most of the underlying goals, the same does not held true for SDG12 and SDG13. From a statistical point, the negative relationship between goals is a sign of trade-off, whereby some countries that have poor performance on SDG12 and SDG13 have good performance on all the other goals and vice-versa.

In addition to the SDG Dashboards where one perceives at a glance in which goals a country is scoring better or worse as well as which goals present the greatest challenges, the JRC would recommend to further explore how the statistical associations between goals could be used to inform SDGs policies at global and national levels. For instance, if the 17 SDGs are grouped into two groups: the environmental group on one side (SDG12, SDG13, SDG14, SDG15) and all the other goals on the other side (SDG1, SDG2, SDG3, SDG4, SDG5, SDG6, SDG7, SDG10, SDG11, SDG16, SDG17), one could look at the countries located on the top right quadrant as the ones which have more balanced profiles in terms of achieving both highest environmental and socio-economic performance (Figure 6). This would be a complementary view to the index rankings. ",

        "23 5 Conclusions The JRC statistical audit delves into the extensive work carried out by the developers of the SDG Index with the aim of suggesting improvements in terms of data characteristics, structure and methods used. The analysis aims to ensure the transparency of the SDG Index methodology and the reliability of the results. The present audit was preceded by a JRC assessment on the 2018 edition, from which some suggestions related to data quality issues were taken into account by the developers in the 2019 edition. This report focused first on the assessment of the statistical coherence of the SDG Index by carrying out a multilevel analysis of the correlations within and across the indicators and goals. It was then followed by an assessment of the impact of key modelling assumption on the SDG index ranking. The methodology to calculate the SDG Index adopted by the developers included data checking for outliers; normalisation using the min-max method in 1-100 scale (100 the best score) including lower and upper bound setting, and; aggregation at all levels (i.e. from indicators to goals and from goals to the overall index) by simple arithmetic average and equal weighting. The main challenge on the construction of the SDG Index lays on the inverted relationship between socio-economic goals and environmental ones, in particular SDG12 (responsible consumption and production) and SDG13 (climate action). Also, SDG 14 (life below water) and SDG 15 (life on land) show no significant association with the SDG Index. The negative relationship between goals is a sign of trade-off, whereby some countries that have poor performance on SDG12 and SDG13 have good performance on all the other goals and vice- versa. Upon these considerations, the JRC recommendation would be to focus on a complementary analysis on the relationships between goals and to consider the option of using the geometric average instead of the arithmetic average. The geometric average could serve as an alternative aggregation method that is non-compensatory and fits with the view that scores in different dimensions of sustainable development should not compensate one another. The uncertainty and sensitivity analyses carried out confirm that the uncertainty is manageable and allows meaningful conclusions to be drawn from the SDG Index. Nevertheless, both the aggregation method and the set of indicators do cause a modest contribution to the uncertainty. A suggestion would be to guide the conclusions that can be drawn from the SDG Index using the following information: differences of two or three places between countries cannot be taken as \u201csignificant\u201d, whereas differences of 10 places can show a meaningful difference. All things considered, the SDG Index is a noteworthy effort of synthetizing the 17 adopted SDGs into a single figure. Overall, the ranks of the SDG Index are fairly robust. The index is anchored on the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development adopted by all UN member states and rigorously follows the same structure of 17 goals. The fact that the goals are universal and highly diverse in nature makes the work of aggregating into a single number quite challenging from a statistical point of view. The index is also complemented by dashboards, which are a very communicative and neat way to show the performance of countries at individual goal level. The SDG Index proposes a first-of-its-kind composite measure to track progress on SDGs at national and global level, but it is fundamental that communication of its results is accompanied by a deep understanding of its underlying components and the relationships between them.
