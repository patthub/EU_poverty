Trade is all around you, and it has been a central driver of European integration from the beginning. And while some of the more over-heated excitement about the BRICs (Brazil, Russia, India, China) has cooled recently in the chill winds of reality, there are still those who underestimate what a global trading powerhouse the EU remains. Did you know, for example, that ex- ports by US affiliates from China are only one-quarter of exports by US affiliates from\u2026 Ireland? Keeping the EU at the centre of global trading networks, with all the benefits that flow from that in terms of growth and jobs, is the task of colleagues in DG TRADE. And with trade rarely out of the news in recent months \u2013 particularly negotiations on a new trade and investment partnership with the US \u2013 this edition\u2019s dossier showcases their hard work.

The EU, which was actively involved in the two-year preparations for the event, was represented by Vice-Pres- ident Kristalina Georgieva and Commissioners Chris- tos Stylianides and Neven Mimica. They committed to strengthening prevention and preparedness, improving the international response and helping to find solutions to support an overstrained humanitarian system (see also page 15). The event saw the launch of the \u2018Grand Bargain\u2019, which will redirect at least \u20ac900 million over the next five years to the frontline of humanitarian action.

        "# J u i n 2 0 1 6 9 Spring forecast: modest growth and recovery E conomic growth in Europe is expected to remain modest as key trading partners\u2019 per- formance slows and some of the so far supportive factors start to wane. As a result, GDP in the euro area is forecast to continue growing at modest rates over the 2015-17 period. According to its spring forecast, presented in May, the Commission expects euro area GDP of 1.6% in 2016 and 1.8% in 2017, after 1.7% in 2015. GDP growth in the EU as a whole is expected to be moderate, from 2% last year to 1.8% in 2016, before reaching 1.9% in 2017. Valdis Dombrovskis, Vice-President for the Euro and Social Dialogue, said: \u201cThe economic recovery in Europe continues, but the global context is less conducive than it was. Future growth will increasingly depend on the opportunities we create for ourselves.\u201d Pierre Moscovici, Commissioner for Economic and Financial Affairs, Taxation and Customs, added: \u201cThe recovery in the euro area remains uneven, both between Member States and between the weakest and the strongest in society.

        "10 EUROPE & BEYOND MAYORS ON THE FRONT LINE INTEGRATING MIGRANTS IN EUROPE\u2019S CITIES by Tony Lockett , DG REGIO Cities are on the front line of Europe\u2019s migration crisis, acting as first points of arrival, transit hubs and final destinations. Athens alone has seen more than half a million asylum seekers passing through the city in 2014 and 2015. Corina Cre\u0163u, Commissioner for Regional Policy, explains how the EU is working with cities to tackle both short and longer term needs. What are the main challenges faced by European cities? Like many colleagues in the Commission, I have been personally affected by the stories and images of people crossing Europe\u2019s borders, often in extremely dangerous conditions, to escape violence and conflict. This is one of the biggest challenges we have ever had to deal with as a Union. In the words of President Juncker, \u201cif ever European solidarity needed to manifest itself, it is on the question of the refugee crisis\u201d . Often, it is city administrations across Europe that have to deal with the immediate challenges presented by the arrival of refugees and asylum seekers, including shelter and access to health care. In the longer term, the successful integration of newcomers will require action at local level in a wide range of areas. These include access to education, language training, housing and employment. I felt that it was important to launch a direct dia- logue with European cities in order to listen to their experiences, concerns and recommendations. A first roundtable took place on 5 April with Commissioner Dimitris Avramopoulos, and the Mayors and Vice-May- ors of Amsterdam, Athens, Barcelona, Berlin, Ghent, Leipzig and Paris. I was struck by their determination to turn the migration challenge into an opportunity, by ensuring that recently-arrived migrants are successfully integrated. How can EU funding help? Cohesion Policy is ready to support urban areas in pro- moting integration, by financing projects in social and education infrastructure, housing, childcare, health, but also business start-ups, language courses or profes- sional training. Significant funding is already available: over 2014- 20, half of the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) envelope will be invested in urban areas, with, for the first time, a part now directly managed by urban authorities. Cohesion Policy funds may also support \u2013 in excep- tional circumstances and on a case-by-case basis \u2013 emer- gency measures in the field of the reception system of migrants and asylum seekers, complementing the sup- port from the Asylum, Migration and Integration Fund. This includes building or extending open reception centres, shelters or actions to reinforce the capacities of the reception services, infrastructural development (cid:2) Commissioner Cre\u0163u visits the \u2018Neighbourhood Management Berlin\u2019 team. \u00a9 A l l r i g h t s r e s e r v e d ",

Because tackling the refugee crisis is our priority, I wrote to all 28 EU Member States to tell them that we were ready to be flexible, and modify Cohesion Policy programmes to adapt to new migration-related chal- lenges. Discussions are currently ongoing with several Member States. Can you give an example? During a recent mission to Germany, I was very im- pressed by the \u2018Neighbourhood Management Berlin\u2019 project (see link below), which has been working with ERDF funding since 2000. The project was first created to tackle social segregation and social issues in certain areas of Berlin, following the reunification of the city. The integration of migrant groups, which make up more than 75% of the population in some areas of the city, is an important part of the project. The most popu- lar initiatives undertaken include support for schools, refurbishment of public housing and cultural activities. Closer to home, for those of us living in Brussels, are the numerous examples of ERDF funding in the canal zone of the city. In Molenbeek, support has been provided for a day nursery, an SME hub and advice centre, a cultural centre and a co-working space. My services are working with the Brussels Capital Region to see how our funds can be used in the future to ad- dress migration-related challenges. The recent attacks in Brussels demonstrate the importance of investing in effective integration in order to underpin the social cohesion and security of our cities. What else is the EU doing to promote cooperation and exchanges between cities? The EU Urban Agenda, which is a priority of the Dutch Presidency, will offer new opportunities for cities to work together, with a stronger involvement of all stake- holders in urban policies. Under the Urban Agenda, partnerships will bring together cities and other actors that have a stake in a number of key issues. I am pleased that the Mayor of Amsterdam, Eberhard Van der Laan, has already accepted to lead a partnership on the integration of migrants. We have also recently launched a call for \u2018Urban Innovative Actions\u2019 in several important areas. I am pleased that 50 proposals have been submitted on the integration of migrants and refugees. Finally, I would like to stress that the EU\u2019s response to this complex and multi-dimensional challenge requires strong cooperation between many Commissioners and Commission services. I want to take this opportunity to express my gratitude to all of the colleagues who are working hard on this issue for their professionalism and personal commitment!

        "12 EUROPE & BEYOND Data has become omnipresent. It pervades all parts of our lives, with tremendous implications for the economy and society at large. When it comes to research data, the Commission is championing a move towards more openness as a step towards \u2018open science\u2019. R esearch data sharing contributes to the common effort to make the EU more competitive and to maintain excellence in science. A specific example of the economic impact of opening up data is the Co- pernicus earth observation satellites. Their data will be freely available and could generate up to \u20ac30 billion and 50,000 new jobs by 2050. Scientifically, wider accessibility of results can help increase the reproducibility of research, which can be as low as 10-30% in key areas, such as cancer research. Open access information also makes interdisciplinary research easier, which is essential for addressing the grand challenges of our time. Stakeholders and the public seem to agree with us. A recent public consultation on \u2018platforms, data and cloud\u2018, conducted by the Commission in the context of the Digital Single Market Strategy, shows that a large majority of respondents fully support a move towards more openness of research data. These results strongly back our resolve to further open up publicly-funded research data. The Commission has ambitious plans in this regard. First, the Horizon 2020 research funding pro- gramme already provides an incentive for kick-starting data sharing and data management activities through a flexible Open Research Data (ORD) pilot. We will now extend this pilot action. We are aware that this raises important concerns: an ORD policy must not lead to loss of intellectual property rights, loss of privacy of people\u2019s personal data or threats to national security. This is why our current policy in Horizon 2020 contains robust opt-out options for any of these reasons, and we will retain these options in the future. Second, it is important that scientists and innovators receiving Horizon 2020 funding think carefully about what to do with the data generated, how to preserve it and which datasets to make open and which to keep closed via Data Management Plans (DMPs). This should be standard practice of any research project and research funders should support them, to ensure that European taxpayers\u2019 money is not wasted. We therefore aim for DMPs to become obligatory for all projects receiving Horizon 2020 funding. Third, developing the necessary infrastructure for research data sharing is another very important step. A sustainable and integrated infrastructure for research data is still missing in Europe. We are therefore plan- ning to set up a European Open Science Cloud as part THE FUTURE IS OPEN RESEARCH DATA SHARING FOR OPEN SCIENCE by Jean-Claude Burgelman, Daniel Spichtinger and Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Dechamp , DG RTD \u00a9 F o t o l i a ",

Stakeholders strongly support us on this subject and the Commis- sion recently adopted a Communication setting out the way forward: \u2018European Cloud Initiative \u2013 Building a competitive data and knowledge economy in Europe\u2019 (see link below). We are glad that the Dutch Presidency has made Open Science a priority of their mandate and that they consider open research data a vital component. We will also follow up with a Commission expert group, which will work on the policy actions needed to make data findable, accessible, interoperable and reusable (FAIR). Furthermore, it is very clear that research data knows no borders and we therefore need to cooperate with our partners all across the globe in making research data interoperable. This is why we are supporting important community-driven activities towards data interoperabili- ty, most notably the Research Data Alliance, but also co- operating with thematic initiatives such as the Belmont forum and like-minded funders \u2013 including the Bill and Melinda Gates foundation \u2013 as well as the G7. Our vision is simple: we need to change the sci- entific system from the current status quo , where data is shared as an exception, to one where data sharing becomes the default on a global level as well as within and across disciplines. We are committed to working towards this goal!

Increasingly legal data is, too. Rudolf Strohmeier, the new Director-General of the Publications Offi ce (OP), explains why. Legal data has a very special status in the business of governments all over the world. It is signifi cant for many reasons, but mostly due to its direct impact on citizens, businesses and civil society. This is why ensuring easy and comprehensive access to legal data and making it as open as possible has always been a crucial task for all public administrations, including at EU level. However, in today\u2019s world this is not suffi cient. What is becoming equally important is the active promotion of the reuse of this data, which can serve as the basis for new products, applications and services, and thus contribute to the development of the digital economy and spur economic growth. Moreover, in a world where easy exchange and automatic analysis of legal information has become a key requirement, it is also essential to develop ways of linking legal data from diff erent systems. At EU level, rapid progress in all these areas is ensured by OP. With EUR-Lex, reuse services based on Linked Open Data, and the various tools to facilitate intelligent exchange of information, OP ensures that EU legal data is easily accessible and available for reuse both by humans and by machines. To fi nd out more about what OP is doing to remain at the forefront in this fi eld, go to our website below, where you can fi nd plenty of material from a recent conference we organised on access to, and reuse of, EU legal information.

        "14 You probably have a smartphone that allows you to access the internet anywhere, anytime. Maybe you use online maps, dictionaries, social media or shopping services? Europe has a strong interest in online issues, but there are stakeholders in other parts of the world with different or even clashing interests. So the question is: just who governs the internet? T his month, a major conference in Brussels will debate hot issues around how the internet works, how it is governed and who runs it. Called the European Dialogue on Internet Governance (EuroDIG \u2013 see link below), it will be hosted by the European Commission and EURid, the non-profit organisation that manages the .eu domain. The internet emerged from US government research in the 1970s and has grown into a global network of networks. There has also been a dramatic growth of people using the internet around the world, making US users only a small minority of the total. This has led to many more countries and players wanting to take part in discussions about control of the internet. In addi- tion, conflicts between those arguing for greater power for governments, and those arguing that state control of the internet would not leave space for the range of players currently involved, have raised questions about internet governance. This has led to the current model where the internet is managed by an international coa- lition of governments, industry, technical experts, and civil society, where the European Commission plays an important role. The Commission\u2019s overarching aim is to keep the internet a single, open, free, unfragmented network of networks, subject to the same laws and norms that apply in other areas of our day-to-day lives. The 2014 Communication on Internet Policy and Governance (see link below) identifies the actions the Commission will take over the coming years to support internet governance. One action is to ensure that ICANN \u2013 the US-based organisation that coordinates the Domain Name System and is often referred to as \u2018the phone book of the internet\u2019 \u2013 becomes a global body. The EuroDIG conference will bring together Euro- pean policy makers, civil society, the technical com- munity, business and individuals who are interested in shaping the way the internet is governed. Discussions will focus on questions such as: how will we keep the internet an open and free platform for communication, information and innovation? who will lead in protect- ing fundamental rights on line? how will cybercrime and security threats be minimised? what are Europe\u2019s interests in the overall scheme? The outcomes of the conference will feed into the global Internet Governance Forum (IGF), which was established as an outcome of the World Summit on Information Society \u2013 under the auspices of the United Nations \u2013 10 years ago, to discuss public policy issues related to the internet.

        "# J u i n 2 0 1 6 15 Resilience can save lives in many countries. This is not new. It has been a topic of discussion among international development and humanitarian actors for years, as a way to address under-nutrition and poverty. RESILIENCE (cid:4) THE KEY TO SAVING LIVES by Esther Huerta Garc\u00eda, DG ECHO A lthough we Europeans usually don\u2019t have to face the extreme challenges of living in the Sa- hel region, we do experience resilience in our lives. This term, originally a physics concept, means the ability to overcome a crisis and adapt to it. The more crises you go through, the more you are able to face a new one. If you take an elastic band and stretch it in all directions, it will come back to its original position, even though it won\u2019t be as perfect as it was. Our lives follow the same pattern. When we face a crisis, we need time to adapt to the situation, but eventually we return to normality, strengthened for the next crisis. We can accelerate this process by reinforcing our natural resilience. The only way to survive In the Sahel region, 32 million people currently suf- fer from food insecurity and under-nutrition. Other factors such as the El Ni\u00f1o climate phenomenon (see CEND# 27, page 20) and political conflict are worsening the situation. People face hunger, floods, droughts and conflict, meaning resilience here \u2013 as in many parts of the world \u2013 is the only way to survive. This is why the Commission chose resilience as a major objective of development and humanitarian assistance. The Commission remains committed to regional resilience programmes in Africa: AGIR (the Global Al- liance for Resilience Initiative) and SHARE (Supporting the Horn of Africa\u2019s Resilience). The aim of these initia- tives is to support the resilience priorities identified by national governments of the region. The Commission also set resilience as a main priority for its work with partners in the field. In 2015, 16% of humanitarian funding \u2013 more than \u20ac107 million \u2013 went to Disaster Risk Reduction activities. A resilience-marker was in- troduced in each project to include the reduction of future risks and strengthen coping capacities to avoid future humanitarian needs. Last month, the Commissioner for Humanitarian Aid and Crisis Management, Christos Stylianides, chose resilience as one of his priorities for the World Humani- tarian Summit in Turkey. Resilience is part of the debate among development and humanitarian experts, and finding a comprehensive approach between both in the field is essential for making sure there is no gap be- tween these two areas of intervention. In other words, investing in resilience is the solution to avoid the loss of lives. For this reason, it will also be a key aspect of debates among experts during the European Develop- ment Days this year \u2013 the leading forum in Europe for the international development community.

        "# J u i n 2 0 1 6 21 Why do we have this award ceremony? This is an important annual opportunity to shine a spotlight on the best internal communication actions across the Commission. There is some really creative stuff being done at DG level that deserves a wider audi- ence, and of course this is also an engaging way of shar- ing best practice. If it introduces a bit of good-natured competition between DGs, then that\u2019s even better! But it\u2019s not just about the awards. Like every year, we have organised a full-day programme for all staff working in the field of internal communication, to inspire and inform them. Are there any novelties in the programme this year? While we have had guests from external organisations share their experiences in the past, this time we have in- vited specialist communication consultants to provide specific training. Another change this year is that we are highlighting the important role management must play in internal communication. We have dedicated sessions for managers who want to attend, to let them know how they can contribute to a successful internal communi- cation and staff engagement strategy. Finally, we have re-shaped the award categories, notably adding a new one \u2013 \u2018Breaking the Silos\u2019 \u2013 which reflects the necessity to maximise synergies and efficiency gains across the Commission, by working better together. What sort of response have you had to the call for nominations? It has been amazing. We received 79 entries for this year\u2019s five categories, from 30 DGs and Executive Agen- cies. It\u2019s a very diverse selection, and I must say that once again, I\u2019ve been impressed by the quality and the hard work that went into these projects. But don\u2019t take my word for it \u2013 take a look at all the nominations on the website (see link below). An independent jury from other EU Institutions is now examining them all to select the winners. Can any member of staff come to the event? The event is in the Charlemagne building in Brussels, and unfortunately there isn\u2019t enough space to wid- en the invitation list. But we absolutely want staff to get involved in other ways. Many have already nom- inated their choice for the special Staff Voice Award, through Yammer. If anyone didn\u2019t get the chance to do this before the deadline, they needn\u2019t worry. There is still time for them to vote for their favourite Staff Voice Award nomination \u2013 just keep an eye on My IntraComm, where details will appear as soon as they become available.

        "22 I magine a future where all the great advances achieved in the medical field over the last one hundred years are thrown out of the window. Where a routine surgical operation could end up being a death sentence. Where babies born prematurely have very lit- tle chance of survival and where organ transplants and chemotherapy are no longer available in our arsenal to fight misery and sickness anymore. What has just been described is not a vision from some dystopian science fiction novel. It is already hap- pening. Modern medicine is reliant on antibiotics, but the overuse and misuse of antibiotics has accelerated the naturally occurring phenomenon that is antibiotic resistance in bacteria. We have already allowed some bacteria to develop resistance against nearly all anti- biotics. Today in Europe alone 25,000 people die due to antibiotic resistance, and our already overburdened healthcare systems are incurring an extra \u20ac1.5 billion in costs due to antimicrobial resistance. Worldwide it is estimated that 700,000 people may die each year. If current trends continue, in a few years antibiotic-resis- tant bacteria will overtake cancer as the number one cause of death. The case for more EU action Europe has been at the forefront in the fight against antibiotic resistance for the past 15 years. Over the last five years we have launched and acted on an Action Plan against AMR (see link below), the first of its kind in the world, covering both the human and the vet- erinary aspects of the problem. This \u2018one health\u2019 ap- proach, strengthening the prevention and control of AMR across all sectors, particularly human and animal health, is the cornerstone of our EU policy. After all, bacteria don\u2019t draw a distinction between animals and humans; neither should we. The Action Plan is clear proof of the political com- mitment to tackling AMR in the EU. This commitment has been acknowledged and strengthened even further in the European Commission\u2019s 2016 work programme, which states that \u201ca sustainable future also means fore- seeing and mitigating threats to a healthy environment. The Commission will continue its work to help Member States address the challenge of antimicrobial resistance and contribute to global efforts to tackle this threat\u201d. We are currently evaluating the work done in the past five years, and any additional Commission ini- tiatives on AMR in the future will build on the les- sons learnt from the current Action Plan, and focus on those areas where there is a clear added value at EU level. Three main areas of focus One such area of clear value is the creation of a real \u2018One-Health AMR network\u2019 bringing together Mem- ber State experts from both the veterinary and human health domains to make the EU a best practice region regarding AMR. This forum should be a priority in order that governments can discuss, develop and coordinate their strategies on AMR, exchange best practices and share their approaches and experiences for evaluating the progress and successes of their national action plans on AMR. Based on the discussions held in this forum, EU harmonised guidelines on the prudent use of an- timicrobials in human medicine should be developed by the Commission in cooperation with its Agencies in order to follow up the Council Recommendation in this area and complement the EU guidelines on the prudent use of antimicrobials in the veterinary sector published in September 2015.

        "# J u i n 2 0 1 6 23 tives to antimicrobials should also be a priority for the Commission. To create a long-term solution to AMR we also need to reflect on how to shift incentives for pharmaceutical companies and how to develop better rapid diagnostics that will reduce unnecessary or inap- propriate use of antibiotics. AMR is not just a European problem but a global one, and global problems require global solutions. Eu- rope\u2019s action has cemented its credibility in this field through the various measures taken over the past years, such as the ban on the use of antibiotics to promote growth in food-producing animals. We must now take the next steps and reinforce our engagement with the rest of the world. The EU should be one of the driving forces in ensuring that the Global Action Plan launched by the World Health Organisation is a success. We must enhance our collaboration with the Organisa- tion for Economic Cooperation and Development to better understand the economic and societal burden of AMR, and convince our international partners that this problem is serious and needs to be urgently addressed. AMR should be high on our agenda when negotiating Working together: the AMC Task Force An AMR Task Force has been created in DG SANTE working across all the relevant units, with the input of other DGs and EU agencies when needed. In particular, it works on the development and implementation of future EU/Commission strategy and policy on AMR and coordinates the Commission\u2019s input into global AMR processes. The task force works closely together with other DGs including RTD, AGRI, GROW, TRADE, DEVCO, ENV, MARE and the SG. bilateral cooperation and trade agreements, and in our dialogue with neighbours who are seeking enlargement or are part of our neighbourhood policy. AMR is a challenge and we cannot be found want- ing. We know what is required from us and the political will to act is there. The fight against AMR is a fight we simply cannot afford to lose.

        "24 OUR STORIES KEEPING IT SAFE CIVIL USE OF EXPLOSIVES by Michael Scheerer, CEND I n the current climate, no one needs reminding of the dangers of explosives. But civil explosives have an important role to play, particularly in mining and demolition, and their production and trade are safer than ever in the EU. Federico Musso, DG GROW\u2019s explosive expert, says proudly: \u201cThe EU legislation on traceability of civil explosives is a worldwide benchmark.\u201d His colleague Johanna Bernsel, responsible for all legal aspects of the explosives legislation, adds: \u201cDirective 2008/43/EC has set up an elaborate system for the identifi- cation and traceability of explosives. No other region in the world has created such a system, which is a revolutionary step forward in this field\u201d (see link below). The directive, adopted in 2008 as a part of the EU Action Plan on Enhancing the Security of Explosives, created EU provisions for a harmonised system for unique identification and traceability of explosives, applicable in all Member States, which guarantees that every stick of dynamite is fitted with a bar-code which makes it unique among the one billion units produced in the EU per year. A long transition period gave all in- dustry stakeholders and Member States time to build up the necessary requirements to identify and trace back the explosives. \u201cYes, the system has some administrative burden, but all stakeholders are willing to cooperate, as they know that in the long run compliance with the explosives traceability directive is an advantage for their business,\u201d Federico Musso states. \u201cAnd for the enforcement authori- ties the advantage is evident as well. They can easily trace the origins of lost or stolen explosives.\u201d This benchmark legislation did not come out of the blue. During the 1980s and 90s, the IRA and ETA had notoriously robbed explosive materials for mali- cious misuse in terror attacks. After the Madrid train bombings in 2004 and the terrorist attacks in London in 2005 the Commission called for action in order to make the civil use of explosives more secure. \u201cNow that it is in force, some challenges remain to be solved,\u201d Federico Musso explains. \u201cWe are getting worrying signals that the levels of compliance and enforcement vary between Member States. Technical challenges also have to be tackled. SMEs in particular need help to properly comply with the new procedures.\u201d But obviously the hard work is worth it. \u201cThe US explosives manufacturers have contacted us as they are eager to implement similar rules,\u201d Johanna Bernsel says. \u201cThey have asked for our support to convince other regions in the world, via the UN, to set up the same system.\u201d (cid:2) Directive 2008/43/EC on explosives for civil use (cid:2) http://europa.eu/!pC88dg The EU\u2019s explosives traceability directive ensures the safe and secure circulation of explosives on the community market.

        "# J u i n 2 0 1 6 27 The current refugee crisis is unprecedented in Europe\u2019s post-war history. Already, in Greece, refugee camps are heavily dependent on volunteers for their day-to-day operations. Over 50,000 refugees are currently installed in camps throughout the country, causing serious health and humanitarian concerns. G iven the grave humanitarian crisis in refugee camps across Greece, there is an urgent need for volunteers to help alleviate the situation. And one Commission staff member did not hesitate to step up to the plate. \u201cI felt the need to help and mobilise volunteers among EU staff, and had the simple idea to call for a pan-Eu- ropean action among all staff working for the EU Institutions\u201d , said Michail Papagiannis, Head of Administration in the Commission Representation in Athens. \u201cThe aim was to gather assistance (clothes, sleeping bags and other basic ne- cessities) in order to respond to this extraordinary situation. In partnership with the Hellenic Red Cross and the Municipality of Athens, we initially launched an action addressed to all DG COMM staff in the 35 Commission Representations and EU Houses around European capitals.\u201d But news quickly spread, and the idea caught the imagination of staff across the Commission and other EU Institutions, and the collection was extended to Brussels and Luxembourg as well. The initiative received support from Vice-Presidents Kristalina Georgieva and Federica Mogherini, as well as Commissioners Dimi- tris Avramopoulos and Christos Stylianidis. The par- cel collection was limited to one week in Brussels and Luxembourg due to security concerns. Staff responded without hesitation. \u201cI have never seen such a mobilisation in my entire ca- reer in the Commission,\u201d said Jimmy Jamar, Head of the Commission Representation in Belgium. \u201cWith the help of OIB, DG HR and the Central Staff Committee, we were able not only to get logistics in place for collecting material daily from over 40 buildings, including the EEAS, but also to sort and ship more than 40 pallets in just three days. The same was done in Luxembourg.\u201d The first delivery of donations took place on 26 April at the camp of Skaramanga, just outside Athens, in partnership with the Municipality of Athens, and the second one on 5 May in the camp of Diavata, South of Idomeni, in partnership with the Hellenic Red Cross.For logistical reasons, not all sites participated in the box collection. So all staff in all locations and Institutions were invited to donate to an appeal for funds launched in parallel, with the support of Give Eur-Hope. Staff donated a staggering total of \u20ac230,000 by the time the appeal ended on 30 April. In view of continuing security concerns, such pan-European box collections by Commission staff across Europe will not be possible in future. But as an example of solidarity in action by EU staff, it\u2019s an achievement that few will ever forget!

        "28 OUR STORIES Tell us something about yourself and Maxime... I have worked in DG AGRI since 2013, and I have three children. My daughter goes to the same school as Max- ime\u2019s younger brother, so we know his family very well. When Maxime was hospitalised after a bad fall during a physical education lesson last June, we were deeply af- fected. This accident made him paraplegic and changed his life overnight. Maxime stayed in the hospital almost one year be- fore recovering partial movement in his upper limbs. When I met him I was glad to see he had preserved his usual optimism and great ambitions, despite his handi- cap. Before this accident Maxime was an excellent ath- lete. He told me he wanted to continue practising sport so as to compete in the next Paralympic Games. How did the initiative to collect bottle tops get started? I was wondering how to support Maxime and give a hand to his family when I found out that Val\u00e9rie, his mother, had started collecting plastic bottle tops. She wanted to sell them to raise sufficient money for a spe- cial wheelchair which would allow Maxime to train for the Games. The day after, I promptly placed a box in my of- fice to collect bottle caps at work. Soon my colleagues discovered my initiative and joined me. We collected so many bottle caps that we put a bigger box in the DG AGRI cafeteria. A few days later, a colleague from DG AGRI\u2019s Communication Unit contacted me and proposed to design a poster with the slogan \u2018Bouchons pour Maxime\u2018. We also published an article in our DG\u2019s magazine and the initiative soon extended to the rest of the Commission. With the support of OIB and EMAS (see box), boxes to collect plastic bottle tops for Maxime were installed in every building of the Commission in Brussels and we received significant help from all the DGs. How did you and your colleagues combine your work with this initiative? It was natural and it did not take us too much time and effort. Colleagues spontaneously got involved. Going to the cafeteria to collect the boxes became a habit for us. There have also been some funny moments. Val\u00e9rie would come to our DG to pick up the bottle tops and bring them home, so we would create human chains to pass the boxes from hand to hand to her van. These moments really helped us to become closer. For the past year, Anna Barile (DG AGRI) has persuaded hundreds of colleagues to collect plastic bottle tops in support of \u2018Bouchons pour Maxime\u2019. She tells Commission en direct how this initiative has helped support a 20-year-old paraplegic\u2019s dream to compete in the Paralympic Games. \u2018BOUCHONS POUR MAXIME\u2019 FROM WASTE TO WHEELCHAIR by Nilde Marchitto, CEND \u00a9 A l l r i g h t r e s e r v e d . ",
        "# J u i n 2 0 1 6 29 How did the initiative conclude and how are Maxime and his family? At the end of March, we reached our objective to gather almost 40 tonnes of plastic bottle tops. Thanks to our action we have really contributed to making a differ- ence in Maxime\u2019s life, helping him to regain his au- tonomy. Maxime recently got his driving licence and currently works for the Brussels Fire Service. After a year of great efforts, Val\u00e9rie and the rest of the family are tired but happy. They were impressed by the wave of solidarity they received from Commission staff and are confident of a better future for their son. What have you learned from this experience? This experience really brought us all together. Before, I only knew some of my colleagues from a professional point of view; now our relationships are much closer. I was particularly impressed to see that a small initiative, started within the four walls of my office, immediate- ly received support by my colleagues. Now I consider DG AGRI as a big family and I have realised that there is great potential in terms of cooperation and collabora- tion among us across the Commission. (cid:2) EMAS \u2013 Small actions, big changes! The Commission wants to lead by example towards a greener and more sustainable Europe. While doing so, it also aims to address social corporate responsibility issues. As Maxime\u2019s story shows, waste is a valuable resource. Did you know that the energy saved from recycling one plastic bottle could power a 60-watt light bulb for three hours? Hence the importance of sorting waste by using the appropriate containers placed in our offices, corridors and cafeterias. Since 2001, the Commission has implemented the environmental management and audit scheme (EMAS), currently covering all Commission sites in Brussels, Luxembourg, JRC-sites and DG SANTE-Grange. Through numerous initiatives, the EMAS teams aim to integrate environmental considerations into our daily activities and everyday work, and demonstrate responsibility both for the environment and the local community. We can all support such local projects while doing a good deed. Another example over the past few years, in the Secretariat-General and DG RTD, is the collection of plastic bottle tops to support the Groupe d\u2019Entraide pour H\u00e9mipl\u00e9giques (G.E.H.). This Belgian non-profit organisation raises funds to help those suffering from hemiplegia (paralysis on one side of the body) in their everyday lives. G.E.H. finances the training of aid dogs, rents special buses to enable wheelchair-bound people to go on excursions and provides talented disabled sportsmen with special wheelchairs. At a corporate level, the Commission practises the reuse and recycling of obsolete ICT equipment so as to reduce its carbon footprint and actively work towards greener ICT. DIGIT is playing a powerful role in enabling all DGs to become more resource efficient. By working closely with the charity Oxfam- Solidarit\u00e9, DIGIT has tried to make sure that when our devices reach the end of their economic life they can still be used by less demanding users through discounted resale or charitable donation. These are just some of the actions through which we can contribute to great projects with our simple gestures and live up to the EMAS motto \u2018Small actions, big changes\u2019.

        "The EU is still the world\u2019s biggest exporter and importer. But times are changing fast. In the next 5 years, 90% of the world\u2019s growth will take place outside Europe. EU trade policy \u2013 including the current negotiations with the US on TTIP \u2013 can tap into this growth to create jobs at home, and maintain our infl uence abroad. Commission en direct fi nds out what is being done to keep Europe competing with the best in the 21st century. DOSSIER TRADE POLICY A motor for growth and jobs in Europe ",
        "32 DOSSIER FACTS, NOT FABLES EU TRADE POLICY TODAY\u2026 AND TOMORROW by Antony Gravili, CEND Trade is key to growth and jobs. But trade policy is evolving. Cecilia Malmstr\u00f6m, Commissioner for Trade, tells Commission en direct why. Why do trade and EU trade policy matter? Trade has long been key to generating growth and jobs. Today, the EU\u2019s exports to countries outside Europe sup- port over 31 million jobs across the 28 Member States \u2013 and over 19 million jobs in countries outside Europe (see pages 36-37). And in the coming years, some 90% of world growth is forecast to be outside the EU. If we want to tap into that growth, we need to be able to continue accessing those markets. So the EU is busy negotiating trade deals with countries from Japan to Tunisia. And, of course, a future TTIP deal with the US would cover a third of world trade and 40% of global output. Being open to trade also helps us stay competitive, by giving EU firms access to the widest range of inputs at the best price. And consumers gain too: trade brings us lower prices in the shops, and a wider range of qual- ity products and services. What impact has EU trade policy had in recent years? The EU\u2019s trade policy has notched up solid successes in recent years. Our trade agreement with South Korea, for example, will soon mark its fifth anniversary. Since it came into force, EU exports of goods to South Korea have risen by 55% and services by over 40%. It scrapped customs duties on nearly all goods, but as the first of a new generation of EU trade deals, it also went much further. It tackled other kinds of barrier to trade, such as red tape. It opened up markets in ser- vices and investment. And it included other measures, from promoting competition to fostering sustainable development. Another example is our agreements with Georgia, Moldova and Ukraine. On top of removing barriers to trade, they seek to align the partner country\u2019s regu- lations with EU rules. The aim is to promote higher quality standards for products and increase consumer and environmental protection. What are the main challenges facing EU trade policy? Today, global value chains mean goods comprise raw materials and parts from around the world. Access to these at competitive prices is just as important for EU industry as access to export markets. What\u2019s more, services, intellectual property, and in- vestment also add value to finished goods. And services themselves \u2013 be they in finance, tourism or insurance \u2013 also constitute exports. So trade policy needs to cover these areas too. The EU still believes the best approach is multilateral \u2013 in other words, in the WTO. But the WTO works on the basis of unanimity. Getting its 162 members to agree is a challenge. And the changing economic balance in the world affects where the weight of interests lies. So alongside our work in the WTO, we\u2019ve been ne- gotiating agreements with groups of countries \u2013 such as the Trade in Services Agreement \u2013 which in future could become WTO agreements. Trade policy is increasingly the subject of criticism. Why do you think this is? 20 years ago trade policy was largely the preserve of policy wonks. But the WTO Ministerial in Seattle in 1999 saw a sudden surge in public interest about further trade liberalisation. No longer confined to tariffs and quotas, trade policy was now inextricably linked to a nation\u2019s social and environmental policies, as well as countries\u2019 overall development strategies. ",
        "# J u i n 2 0 1 6 33 That may be true, but there is no reason why trade policy should interfere with other areas of public policy. Indeed, the EU is committed to ensuring its trade agree- ments leave the EU and its Member States entirely free to legislate in the public interest. There are a lot of genuinely held concerns among the public, and it is great that we have a living, far- reaching debate on trade matters in Europe. However, there is also a lot of scaremongering, in particular about TTIP. People need to have the facts \u2013 not just the fables (see pages 40-41). Why the new Trade for All strategy? What do you want to achieve? The new strategy aims to make EU trade policy bet- ter at generating the export opportunities that in turn create jobs for people across Europe. It addresses not just interests, but values too. And it sets down a clear roadmap for future negotiations. It also seeks to make trade policy-making more transparent, by opening up negotiations to more public scrutiny. In fact, the new strategy is a direct response to the intense public debate on trade in the EU. Transpar- ency is central to that trade debate, so when prepar- ing its strategy the Commission consulted hundreds of civil society groups and government representatives. As such it reflects the Juncker Commission\u2019s pledge to listen and respond to EU citizens\u2019 concerns (see page 42-43). What changes will Trade for All mean in practical terms? The new strategy has four parts: effectiveness, transpar- ency, values, and negotiations. I\u2019ll just mention a few key points. To ensure greater effectiveness, we will update our policy to reflect new realities like the rise of global value chains, the digital economy, and trade in services. We want a closer partnership with Member States, the Eu- ropean Parliament and stakeholders. And we want to particularly help small and medium-sized businesses in all future trade deals (see page 38). On transparency, we are extending our measures in the TTIP talks to all the EU\u2019s trade negotiations. When it comes to values, we\u2019ve pledged to safeguard the right of the EU and its Member States to regulate in the public interest. And future agreements will cover areas like sustainable development and fair and ethi- cal trade. As for negotiations, our roadmap includes re-ener- gising talks at the WTO, launching new negotiations with Australia and New Zealand, and ensuring our agreements with African and Caribbean countries are implemented effectively.

        "DOSSIER A common commercial policy has been at the heart of European integration ever since the Treaty of Rome came into force nearly 60 years ago. Today, as the biggest exporter and importer in the world, the EU sits at the centre of a complex, worldwide network of trade agreements, helping to make commerce a key generator of growth and jobs in Europe. Over the next two pages, Commission en direct takes a look at that network, and some of the key milestones in European trade policy.

        "36 14,000 new jobs \u20ac1 billion in EU exports creates Each additional ates The figures leave no doubt: the benefits of trade and investment are huge. This makes the EU\u2019s free trade policy an important source of growth and jobs in Europe. That\u2019s why the Commission is working hard to connect Europe even better to the global economy. T he EU is the largest economy in the world, the biggest exporter and importer, and the leading investor and recipient of foreign investment. With just 7% of the world\u2019s population, it accounts for over one quarter of the world\u2019s wealth as measured by gross do- mestic product (GDP) \u2013 the total value of goods and services produced. And trade contributes a great deal to this wealth. European external trade in goods and services accounts for 35% of EU GDP \u2013 five percentage points above the US. Already today, 31 million people in the EU, one seventh of the labour force, depend on exports for their livelihood. And that\u2019s only going to increase in the future. Speaking with a single voice The single market with the free movement of goods, services, people and capital within the EU\u2019s borders is a cornerstone of the Union\u2019s ability to create jobs by trading with other countries and regions. The EU, not national governments, is responsible for this market. It also manages trade relations with the wider world. Speaking with a single voice, the EU carries considerably more weight in international trade negotiations than any of its individual members would. It is an active economic and political player with growing regional and global interests and responsibilities. The benefits of such a strong common approach are easy to see. More trade means more economic growth in the Member States which can help us overcome the eco- nomic crisis. External trade has been playing a dynamic role in boosting economic growth for many decades. Trade with the rest of the world doubled from 1999 to 2010, and currently almost three-quarters of imports into the EU pay no, or reduced, duties. The EU is the EU TRADE DEALS WHY WE ALL BENEFIT by Michael Scheerer, CEND ",
        "# J u i n 2 0 1 6 37 biggest trading partner for 59 countries. In comparison, the figure for China is 36 and for the US just 24. It\u2019s about competitiveness Two-thirds of EU imports are raw materials, intermedi- ary goods and components needed by EU manufactur- ers. Europe\u2019s market must remain open to these sup- plies. Restricting their flow or raising the cost of imports would backfire by increasing the costs and reducing the competitiveness of European companies both at home and abroad. Once current negotiations are successfully com- pleted, trade policy will add around \u20ac150 billion to our economy. Trade means growth and leads to higher salaries, both in Europe and elsewhere. The OECD esti- mates that if the world\u2019s 20 leading economies slashed trade barriers by 50% they could boost jobs by up to 4%, raise people\u2019s wages by up to 8% and increase exports by up to 20%. Increased trade also offers a greater variety of goods, at lower prices, to consumers. The gains for the average consumer are in the range of \u20ac600 per year. Trade helps reduce poverty. A World Bank study, which used data from 80 countries over four decades, confirms that open trade boosts economic growth and that the incomes of the poor rise one-for-one with overall growth. Competition as a challenge According to the International Monetary Fund, 90% of future economic growth will be generated outside Europe (one third of it in China alone). But the growth of other economic powerhouses, such as China, India and Brazil, also intensifies competition in terms of the price and quality of goods they produce, and, perhaps more importantly, for access to energy and raw materi- als. That said, by opening their economies and creating new groups of affluent consumers, these countries are providing important new opportunities for European exporters. Chinese import tariffs fell from 19.8% in 1996 to 4.7% in 2012. Over the same period, Indian tariffs fell from 20.1% to 7% and Brazilian tariffs from 13.8% to 10% \u2013 although other, less visible, barriers to EU exports remain. EU-South Korea Free Trade Agreement In 2010, the EU and South Korea signed a free trade deal. Four years later, made-in-Europe exports to Korea rose dramatically \u2013 by 55% for goods, and more than 40% for services. One small EU business that has made the most of the deal is Col d\u2019Orcia, one of the oldest wine producers in Montalcino, a hill town in Tuscany. They use grapes grown on the estate and surrounding farms. Like most Italian wineries, Col d\u2019Orcia is a small fi rm. In its free trade agreement (FTA) with the EU, South Korea scrapped customs duties on EU wine and cut the paperwork involved.

Col d'Orcia (cid:2) www.coldorcia.it/ EU-South Korea Free Trade Agreement (cid:2) http://europa.eu/!Dp33kV Free commerce also allows countries to procure the best products and services for their citizens internation- ally. This means government and local authorities can save taxpayers\u2019 money on the products and services they purchase. Trade and investment flows spread new ideas and innovation, new technologies and the best research, leading to improvements in the products and services that people use. Trade also brings people together. It develops and secures economic ties between nations and contributes to political stability. Trade in the 1950s was one of the initial drivers which helped create the peaceful Europe we have today. What it did for Europe then, it can do for the world today.

        "38 Some 99% of EU firms are small and medium-sized businesses. Many provide goods, components and services to other companies that export. Countless others sell to overseas customers directly. T ariffs, it could be argued, affect all firms equally. So if tariffs fall, smaller firms should also benefit. But when it comes to selling goods and services outside the EU, smaller firms actually find it more difficult to overcome barriers to trade than do bigger companies. This is because some of the greatest hurdles to trade are \u2018behind the border\u2019 barriers such as red tape, customs procedures, labelling requirements, and recognition of professional qualifications. These hit smaller firms hardest because they do not have the staff to deal with them \u2013 or the lawyers to handle them on their behalf. Trade agreements can break down such barriers, and open up new markets for small businesses. Smaller firms also find it harder to find information about potential export markets. Again, trade deals can help by getting governments to set up online one-stop shops with information about their country\u2019s rules and regulations. Under the new Trade for All strategy, the EU aims to ask its trading partners to do just that. The Commission also plans to coordinate its work with Member States\u2019 trade promotion policies. It will carry out surveys on barriers smaller firms face in spe- cific markets, and work more closely with their business associations to understand their needs better.

        "# J u i n 2 0 1 6 39 DOSSIER TRADE MEANS JOBS THE EFFECTS OF TRADE ON JOBS AND INCOME by Alexander Walford, DG TRADE The link between trade and jobs is clear. EU companies export nearly as much as China to the rest of the world and more than firms in the US or any other country. And those exports to the rest of the world provide jobs for 31 million Europeans. In other words, 1 in 7 of all jobs in the EU depends on exports. T rade encourages firms to restructure and inno- vate, enabling them and individual citizens to tap into the opportunities offered by an ever-changing global market place. But trade and investment networks are becoming more complicated. Goods are no longer made in one country alone. They are often assembled using raw materials and components from around the world. Intellectual property (such as patents), services and in- vestment also add value to the end product. Such global value chains are becoming increasing- ly important. This complexity makes it harder to measure the relation- ship between openness to trade and labour markets. We can no longer calculate how many jobs are supported by exporting ac- tivities in a given country just by looking at exporting firms them- selves. We also need to take into account the jobs in firms supply- ing inputs, such as raw materials, components and ser- vices. Increasingly, these activities span borders. And the competitiveness of European firms also de- pends on their ability to access inputs from outside the EU at competitive prices. Indeed, when it comes to jobs, trade is not just about exports \u2013 it works both ways. The effects of trade on jobs and income In 2015 DG TRADE and the Joint Research Centre car- ried out a study into the effects of trade on jobs and income (see link below). The study found that exports create opportunities for everyone, both higher and less skilled workers. Indeed, it revealed that on average export-related jobs pay better than jobs in the rest of the economy. The study also showed that EU exports support a significant share of jobs in almost all countries across the EU. Joining forces benefits all of us. More than 16% of Europeans who are in export-related jobs live in a different EU country from the country from which the final product or service is exported. So, for example, Germany\u2019s exports create 6,200,000 jobs in Germany and a further 1,300,000 jobs in firms produc- ing components or providing services in other Member States. Another 870,000 Germans are in jobs linked to exports from other Member States to countries out- side the EU. This shows the ben- efits of the EU single market and its key role in keeping EU firms competitive. Last but not least, EU exports support 19 million jobs outside the EU in companies providing raw materials, components and services. So what is good for Europe is also good for our partners. In a globalised world, eco- nomic stakes are ever more interdependent.

        "40 The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP). No doubt you\u2019ve heard or read about it already \u2013 not least because it\u2019s one of this Commission\u2019s top 10 priorities. But how would TTIP, a new-generation free trade deal, work in practice? Why would it be good news for all of us? And what about the myths sometimes linked to it? TTIP (cid:4) A VERY SHORT INTRODUCTION by Alexander Walford, DG TRADE DOSSIER T TIP would have three main parts \u2013 market access, regulatory cooperation, and rules. The first part would involve opening up our markets to each other. TTIP would scrap or cut the taxes that EU exporters still face at US customs. It would also enable them to offer more kinds of service in the US, win more US government contracts, and speed up product checks at customs. Regulatory cooperation would bring together EU and US regulators to help cut the cost of red tape for exporting firms \u2013 like having to get products tested and approved twice over. These costs hit small business especially hard. Regulators would see where existing EU and US standards are equivalent, and cooperate more closely on developing regulations in future \u2013 for example, on electric cars. All without cutting corners in protecting people or the environment. Finally, new and clearer ground rules for trade between us would make trade easier and fairer. These rules would cover areas ranging from red tape at customs to free and fair competition. Measures would also be put in place to help small business take full advantage of TTIP. TTIP would bring clear benefits for people across Europe. Below are the top six: Expanding our economy Trade matters for our economy. Evidence shows EU trade deals deliver economic growth and create new opportunities for EU firms. Creating more and better-paid jobs 31 million jobs in Europe rely on exports. And studies show that they can be up to 16% better paid than other kinds of job. 5 million such jobs already depend on exports to the US. And TTIP would create even more. Offering more choice to consumers Opening our markets would mean a greater range of goods and services for consumers and businesses. Encouraging more investment The EU and US are already the biggest overseas investors in each other\u2019s econo- mies. TTIP would put in place clear, pre- dictable rules to help EU businesses expand and com- pete, and generate growth and jobs in the process. Protecting people\u2019s rights at work and the environment TTIP would put sustainability centre stage. It would help ensure businesses manage their global supply chains re- sponsibly, with accountability and transparency. And it would include specific provisions on everything from biodiversity to international labour standards. Shaping globalisation TTIP would set new ground rules and standards. These could serve as a model for global trade. That could in turn help us maintain our influence and promote our interests in a world of fast-emerging economies. ",
        "# J u i n 2 0 1 6 41 MYTH BUSTING Certain myths have developed about what TTIP would or wouldn\u2019t do \u2013 claims that simply don\u2019t stack up. Here are the top three. Myth 1 \u201cTTIP will lower food safety standards in Europe.\u201d The facts TTIP will mean no weakening of the EU\u2019s high food safety standards\u2013 absolutely none. The way we regulate things like genetically modified organisms (GMOs) and food safety will stay just like it is. TTIP will not force the EU to import GM foods which EU regulators haven\u2019t already approved, hormone-treated beef or meat from cloned animals. But it will enable EU and US regulators to work together to help make it easier to export and import whilst fully respecting our rules on food safety. Myth 2 \u201cTTIP would allow powerful US firms to sue govern- ments at will.\u201d The facts EU countries have more than 1,400 investment agree- ments with each other and with other, non-EU coun- tries to help attract foreign investors. The agreements include a system for resolving dif- ferences between investors and governments known as Investor-State Dispute Settlement, or ISDS. In TTIP we want to replace ISDS with a new Invest- ment Court System (ICS). This would commit govern- ments to respecting four basic guarantees for investors while explicitly safeguarding governments\u2019 right to regulate in the public interest. An investor could only bring a case to the ICS by claiming a government had broken one or more of these four guarantees. The EU and US would each ap- point to the Court fully-qualified, independent judges who would have to follow a strict code of conduct. Governments and investors would have the right to A new agreement with Canada The EU has recently negotiated a Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement (CETA) with Canada. Once applied, CETA will offer EU firms more and better business opportunities in Canada and support jobs in Europe. It will tackle a whole range of issues to make business with Canada easier \u2013 from removing customs duties, and ending limits on EU firms bidding for Canadian public contracts, to opening up Canada's services market, and encouraging greater investment in both directions. As well as delivering economic gains, the agreement will include provisions to safeguard the environment, and protect consumers' health and safety. appeal against decisions by the Court. And the public would have access to hearings and to any documents related to a case. Myth 3 \u201cTTIP will force EU governments to privatise the public services we all rely on.\u201d The facts All EU trade deals include specific guarantees for public services. After we sign trade deals, governments can still run these services exactly as they wish. For example, they can still define \u2018public services\u2019 as broadly as they want and freely decide when to let the public sector alone provide a particular service. Noth- ing in TTIP would stop a government from bringing an outsourced public service back into the public sector. And not renewing a company\u2019s contract to provide a public service would give no grounds for compensa- tion.

        "42 Ensuring transparency, listening attentively, and reaching out to everyone concerned are at the heart of the Commission\u2019s work on trade policy. They are also major priorities for Commissioner Malmstr\u00f6m. That is because getting the policy right \u2013 one that benefits as many Europeans as possible \u2013 means involving everyone with a stake in the outcome of trade negotiations, at every stage. DOSSIER A n effective trade policy must have broad sup- port, so DG TRADE is active in its transparency, listening and outreach efforts to ensure that all stake- holders feel included. This starts, as it should, with the general public. Extensive use is made of the internet to get a clearer idea of people\u2019s wishes and concerns about EU trade policy. For TTIP alone, for example, DG TRADE has held four online consultations. It also posts regular updates on its work to negotiate and implement trade agreements on Twitter (see below). DG TRADE also works in close partnership with the Commission\u2019s Representations in EU Member States to get its message across, to listen to people\u2019s wishes and concerns, and to respond accordingly. The Representations\u2019 work includes speaking at public debates and conferences; reaching out to gov- ernment ministers, officials, parliamentarians and interest groups; and advising DG TRADE on issues of particular importance locally. The Representations also engage with the public on Twitter and develop web content. National governments are of central importance, of course. The Commission gets negotiating guide- lines from the Member States for any trade negoti- ation it launches. The guidelines have to be agreed unanimously by the Member States, and they set out the issues on the table and any red lines gov- ernments might have. DG TRADE then consults governments throughout the negotiating process through the Council\u2019s weekly Trade Policy Com- mittee. Commission negotiators take part in many different meetings along the way \u2013 from detailed, technical discussions between trade policy officials, to meetings with Ministers. The Commission also keeps the European Par- liament informed of the negotiations. It does this mainly through the Parliament\u2019s Committee for International Trade (known as \u2018INTA\u2019). Commis- sioner Malmstr\u00f6m has also made a concerted effort to reach out to MPs in Member States. Since the beginning of 2015 she has met with 21 different national parliaments.

        "# J u i n 2 0 1 6 43 Advice from outside experts DG TRADE also meets regularly with outside experts for advice. For example, at the start of the talks on TTIP, DG TRADE set up a 16-strong Advisory Group. Its members come from a variety of backgrounds and have extensive experience in industry and commerce, consumer affairs, workers\u2019 rights, and environmental protection. Advisory Board members have access to key documents \u2013 even offers made to the US to open up EU markets, which are otherwise confidential. In return, they give DG TRADE high quality advice on topics it is negotiating. Members\u2019 details and meeting reports are available online (see link below). DG TRADE also wants to hear from other groups with a stake in EU trade policy, so it regularly meets people from firms large and small, and from indus- try bodies. Trade is, after all, about the mechanics of doing business, so their input is necessary. But DG TRADE also listens to people from consumer organisations and NGOs of all kinds; chambers of commerce and employers\u2019 and professional associ- ations; trade unions; the European Economic and Social Committee; and think tanks and researchers. This is done both formally and informally. Since 2014 it has increased the number of formal meetings to 25 per year. DG TRADE has also intro- duced innovative formats, from large-scale events such as The European Policy Day in 2015 to smaller workshops on specific areas of trade policy, such as international negotiations for an agreement on trade in environmental goods. Other formal meetings of- fer stakeholders regular updates on policy develop- ments or negotiating rounds. Interest in the civil society meetings on trade has grown, with ever more organisations and peo- ple taking part. Today, over 440 civil society groups are registered on DG TRADE\u2019s database \u2013 up by 40% since 2013. In 2014 DG TRADE also launched special events during the TTIP negotiating rounds so that in- terest groups could come and discuss their priorities with EU and US negotiators. Over 400 people came to the TTIP interest group meeting in February 2016. Of those, 80 made presentations to the team and answered the team \u2019 s questions. DG TRADE meets informally too, with industry, unions, and consumer and green groups. And negotiators\u2019 doors remain open to anyone who wishes to express their hopes or concerns. Sharing documents Last, but certainly not least, is the sharing of doc- uments. The aim is to share as many trade policy documents as possible \u2013 not just with governments and MEPs, but also with the public. With TTIP, for example, DG TRADE has taken the unprecedent- ed step of publishing more than 500 documents online. These include position papers setting out the EU\u2019s aims in a particular area; textual proposals (legal texts); factsheets and FAQs; press releases and background notes; and studies and meeting reports. DG TRADE has also reached an agreement with its US partners that means governments of EU Member States can now set up reading rooms in their capitals. There, government ministers and officials and national MPs can consult so-called \u2018consolidated texts\u2019. EU and US negotiators are working together on these legal texts and so have joint ownership of them.

        "44 Why was this review of support services necessary? This is about what we do and how we do it, to be more efficient and ease the pressure on all of us. Since this Commission took office, the challenges have not stopped. We have had to deal with the continuing im- pacts of the economic crisis. We are facing a migration and refugee crisis of unprecedented proportions. And we have been hit by terrible terrorist attacks that have shown the need for a more coordinated approach to security. Our colleagues have been working day and night to propose solutions to these rapidly evolving situations. This has highlighted the need to be able to move staff to priority policy areas and to react flexibly to unpredicted events. The Synergies and Efficiencies Review launched in early 2015 sought to align DGs\u2019 work to the Commis- sion\u2019s priorities. In a first stage, we examined four sup- port services \u2013 human resources, external and internal communication, information and communication technologies, and logistics and events. By modernis- ing services and working better together, synergies and efficiency gains can be found. This can free up staff to move to areas of policy priority, easing the pressure on our most over-worked colleagues and helping us deliver for the EU and its citizens. To guide these processes, the five DGs in the lead \u2013 HR, COMM, DIGIT, OIB and SCIC \u2013 will put in place change management plans and structured professionalisation programmes. What is new about this year\u2019s staff reallocation decision? This year for the first time ever, a differentiated approach has been taken. It was based on a fair and transparent On 4 April, the College adopted a Communication on \u2018Synergies and Efficiencies in the Commission\u2019 as well as this year\u2019s allocation of staff resources. Vice-President Kristalina Georgieva explains what these proposals mean for staff and the Commission. RESPONDING TO PRIORITIES THROUGH SYNERGIES AND EFFICIENCIES by Zach Hester, DG HR analysis of the situation and dialogue with Directors- General and Resource Directors. After discussion by the Group of Vice-Presidents, this new allocation decision was adopted by the College. The differentiated approach means that some DGs will contribute more than others as we seek to meet our targets of cutting posts. We have a commitment to reduce staff by 5% by 2017, and we will achieve that but not go beyond it. For most DGs, the contribution is 2%. However, based on a set of standard parameters, some DGs working in high priority areas will contrib- ute less and may even be reinforced, while some other AU QUOTIDIEN \u00a9 E U ",
        "# J u i n 2 0 1 6 45 DGs will contribute more. For those DGs contributing more, there will be opportunities for some Administra- tors to move with their posts towards the DGs being reinforced. How will the changes impact staff? I am convinced this will open up career opportunities and, at the same time, encourage managers to better identify and nurture the talents of every staff member. I understand some colleagues may have concerns \u2013 we are proposing something new. At the same time, I also see a lot of enthusiasm. For instance, when we offered staff the chance to move DGs to help deal with the mi- gration crisis, we had more than 1,000 applications for 50 jobs in DG HOME and 15 in DG ECHO! In April we launched a targeted call for Administrators to reinforce certain DGs working in high priority areas \u2013 HOME, ECHO, TRADE, COMP and NEAR \u2013 and the transfers are now taking place. I want to thank all those who put themselves forward. To support staff working in administrative support and secretarial functions who volunteer to move, DG HR will offer career guidance, training and match-making. What are the main changes foreseen in the support functions? In external and internal communication, the goal is to change the governance to take a more strategic ap- proach to communication, with DGs COMM and HR leading. Framework contracts will be reduced and cen- tralised, and the networks professionalised. DG COMM will also put in place a new system of web governance. For ICT, DG DIGIT will implement a Digital Trans- formation Agenda that ensures we all have the modern tools we need, without wasteful incompatibilities, and make better use of them. DG DIGIT will also take on responsibility for central provision and management of IT equipment. We also want to innovate in logistics, and event and meeting room management. OIB will set up a profes- sional Office Space Design team and take on central management of the mail delivery system. DG SCIC will take on responsibility for meeting room management, to help colleagues find and use spaces as efficiently as possible. SCIC will also lead on conference and event management, helping DGs to save money and organise conferences even better. And in human resources? The aim is to create clearer roles while maintaining and improving the quality and range of services. The new model will involve setting up local HR Business Partner Teams in DGs, and new Account Management Centres and a reinforced Centre of Expertise within DG HR. Work is already advancing with a review launched in April involving both central and local HR services. Participants have been identifying what can be simpli- fied, improved and automated and looking at respective roles in the new architecture. A pilot will launch this summer involving HR, DIGIT, GROW, IAS, COMM, HOME, JUST, PMO and EPSO. These changes can benefit all sides: colleagues gain in terms of professional development; all colleagues will benefit from better support services; and it\u2019s a win for the organisation as we can gain some resources to reinforce political priority areas. There are real oppor- tunities ahead, and I hope staff will seize them with both hands.

Le projet pilote de la Journ\u00e9e de la sant\u00e9 a \u00e9t\u00e9 lanc\u00e9 au sein de la DG HR le 18 mars dernier. Outre le rap- prochement du service m\u00e9dical et du personnel de la Commission, son objectif est d\u2019accro\u00eetre la prise de conscience et de sensibiliser l\u2019ensemble du personnel aux probl\u00e9matiques li\u00e9es \u00e0 la sant\u00e9 physique ou men- tale, notamment par le biais de visites dans les bureaux.

        "48 AU QUOTIDIEN What if there was a platform which could give you access to any information you need in a much faster and user-friendly way? COMING SOON A NEW LEARNING MANAGEMENT SYSTEM by Obhi Chatterjee, DG HR W hen you are working and you need some information, what do you do? You may search in Google, ask a colleague, or even check one of the many e-resources \u2013 like videos, tips & tricks or books \u2013 in the Learning Portal. And if you have a bit more time you can also look for a course in Syslog. Syslog was originally developed in-house in 1998 as a room-booking system. Gradually more and more features were added to it until it reached the version we use today to offer classroom training. However, the world has evolved since 1998, and both the internet and mobile devices have changed the way we learn. With this in mind, the HR Learning and Develop- ment unit has been preparing to introduce a new plat- form for our learning, which will replace Syslog before the end of this year. You control your learning and development The new learning management system will have a pow- erful search function to help you find courses, events or other learning resources you might be interested in. These resources, as is the case now with the Learning Portal, are recommended by colleagues and trainers. With the new platform you will not lose any of them, as the content of the Portal will be migrated. It will even add some new functionalities like the possibility to rate the resources, which will help to identify the most useful ones. An interinstitutional platform Colleagues from all EU Institutions, agencies and bod- ies, as well as external trainers, will be able to access the new system using their ECAS login. This should give you access to a more diverse learning offer and al- low you to join online communities with fellow course participants. When? Some courses are already available only in the new system. The number of these will increase progressively over the summer. For these courses, you will be redi- rected from Syslog. Syslog itself will be phased out by the start of 2017. In the meantime, the existing Learn- ing Portal will offer a bridge between the two systems. There will be brief video tutorials for learners, man- agers and trainers. There are also training courses for course managers starting from this month. We have been working hard to minimise any disruption to our learning offer during this transition period. We are looking forward to offering you a modern, mobile-friendly platform adapted for the learning you need. (cid:2) Learning Portal (cid:2) http://europa.eu/!BK49GR ",
        "# J u i n 2 0 1 6 49 Every day, personal data (or personal information) is processed within the EU administration and if this information is incorrect, out of date or disclosed to the wrong person, the damage caused to you could be quite serious. Commission en direct talks to Wojciech Wiewi\u00f3rowski, Assistant Supervisor at the European Data Protection Supervisor (EDPS), to learn more about your rights. EUROPEAN DATA PROTECTION YOUR DATA, YOUR RIGHTS by Antony Gravili, CEND What are your rights when the EU institutions process your personal data? Data protection is a fundamental right, protected by European law (see link below) and enshrined in the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. Whenever an EU Institution or body processes infor- mation about you (see link below), for example, in recruitment activities, medical records, complaints or other procedures, you have the right to be told which Institution is processing your data, why and who will receive the information. Furthermore, you are entitled to check any informa- tion being processed that is related to you. You can ob- tain, free of charge, access to that personal information and request corrections to inaccurate or incomplete information. You can block information if its accuracy is in question, or have it erased if its use is unlawful or it is no longer relevant. You have the right to request that third parties who received the information be noti- fied of any correction, erasure or blocking. And if there are compelling and legitimate grounds for doing so, you can object at any time to the processing of your personal information. What can you do if there is a problem? If you feel your right to data protection has been vio- lated, the first thing you should do is notify the EU body responsible for processing your personal data and ask them to take action. If you obtain no reply or you are not satisfied with the reply, contact the Data Protection Officer (see link below). You can also lodge a complaint with the EDPS, who will examine your request and adopt the necessary measures. If the issue remains unresolved, you can take your case to the Court of Justice of the European Union. What does the EDPS do to protect your data protection rights? The EDPS is an independent supervisory authority re- sponsible for ensuring that all European Institutions and bodies respect the fundamental right to the protec- tion of personal data. This means, for example, con- ducting enquiries, ordering an EU body to comply with a person\u2019s request to exercise their rights in this area, and warning it if it is unlawfully or unfairly processing someone\u2019s personal information. In extreme cases, we can also impose a temporary or definitive ban on the processing of personal information, and refer a case to the Court of Justice. Anyone can ask the EDPS for ad- vice on how to exercise their rights, and to investigate a complaint against an EU Institution or body.

        "50 Edmund Wellenstein (1919-2016) Edmund Wellenstein passed away on 27 February 2016 in \u2018s-Gravenhage (Netherlands), the place where he was born on 20 September 1919. Starting as a student in physics, he later switched to law and economics. His resistance work during World War II and his experience as a prisoner in a SS concentration camp caused him to switch from a scientific career to that of a \u2018social worker\u2019. In 1953, three years after Robert Schuman\u2019s declara- tion which lead to the creation of the European Coal and Steel Community (ECSC), Edmund Wellenstein accepted without hesitation an invitation to be part of Jean Monnet\u2019s pioneering team in Luxembourg. From 1960 to 1967, he was Secretary-General of the High Authority of the ECSC. From 1970-72, he headed the delegation for negotia- tions on enlargement which lead to the accession of the first three new Member States in the then European Communities: Denmark, Ireland and the UK. From 1973 to 1976, he was Director-General for Ex- ternal Relations. What marked the personality of Edmund Wellenstein was his humane treatment of people, whatever their background or rank. His analytical intellect proved to be a powerful tool and the essence of his work was to unite people. He achieved often far-reaching goals in a step by step, pragmatic way, always putting himself in the other person\u2019s position, trying to understand the historical and cultural backgrounds of his colleagues and interlocutors and focusing on what unites rather than on what divides. (cid:2) Richard Burke (1932-2016) Richard Burke, former European Commission Vice-Pres- ident, passed away on 15 March 2016 at the age of 83. Born in New York to Irish parents on 29 March 1932, Richard Burke returned to Upperchurch, in County Tip- perary (Ireland) in 1935. He was educated at Thurles Christian Brothers school and later studied at University College Dublin and King\u2019s Inns, Ireland\u2019s oldest School of Law. He qualified as a teacher and then as a barrister. Richard Burke played a central role in campaigning for Ireland to join the European Economic Community in 1973. From 1973 to 1977, he also served as Minister for Education in his homeland and contributed to the modernisation of the Irish education system. He was then appointed Commissioner for Transport, Taxation, Consumer Protection and European Parlia- ment Relations (1977-1980) in the Jenkins Commis- sion. He served a second term as a European Commis- sioner (1982-1985), when he was in charge of Personnel and Administration in the Thorn Commission. During this second term, recognition of his previous work saw him appointed Vice-President of the Commission. Some of the initiatives coming from Richard Burke\u2019s time include the infrastructure plan for Europe, the Green Paper on the TGV, the Channel Tunnel linking the UK and France and the development of the then European Communities\u2019 budget. President Juncker declared: \u201cRichard Burke was a true and devoted European, who believed in Europe as much as in his own country and whose progressive thinking and actions inspired many of us.\u201d (cid:2) IN MEMORIAM \u00a9 E U \u00a9 E U ",

        "54 GENERATIONS George Gwyer worked as an agricultural economist and aid manager in Africa, the Pacific and the Caribbean. His EU career culminated as EU ambassador to Barbados and the Eastern Caribbean and Head of the Pacific Unit in DG Development. In his memoirs \u2018Dilemmas in Development \u2013 Journeys of an Agricultural Economist \u2019, he reflects on a career spent in the field of development policy. DILEMMAS IN DEVELOPMENT AN AGRICULTURAL ECONOMIST\u2019S PERSPECTIVE by Zach Hester, DG HR How has thinking evolved over the years on development aid, notably regarding the role of agricultural exports? Fifty years ago some economists were pessimistic about development aid for the agricultural exports sector be- cause of the adverse terms of trade for primary products, coupled with concerns that price instability was inimical to development. From a global perspective, it was per- ceived that expanding exports of such products as cof- fee, cocoa and tea, given the nature of market demand, would only bring benefits to consumers. To combat the adverse effects of price instability, the Commission in- troduced the Stabex scheme within the framework of Lom\u00e9 in order to compensate countries suffering from adverse swings in export prices. Those countries which have nurtured their agricultural export sectors with mod- est taxes and sustained agricultural research \u2013 like Malay- sia, Colombia, and Kenya \u2013 have reaped the benefits in foreign exchange earnings which have been ploughed back into diversification of their economies. What explains the relative successes of some countries vis-\u00e0-vis others with similar agricultural potential? Positive policies toward the sector, backed by sustained agricultural research. Kenya has achieved remarkable success in boosting production and exports of tea with a high proportion coming from smallholders under the auspices of the Kenya Tea Development Agency. At the same time, Kenya has opened up markets for horticultural products exported by air to the European Union. Tanzania, which followed more socialist policies derived from the Arusha Declaration of 1967, gradu- ally lost an important source of foreign exchange after the sisal industry was nationalised. Nonetheless, coffee smallholders in Tanzania have continued to sustain higher levels of exports than Kenya. How does this compare with your experience in smaller, island states? In the Solomon Islands, forestry products were a major source of export earnings. Our EU studies revealed that the forests were being exploited by foreign logging companies, without regard to the principles of sustainable yield and conservation. Moreover, undervaluation of logs at point of export was rife. Clearly weak governance was at fault, which led eventually to serious internal conflict. For the Windward Islands, bananas have been a source of income and employment for the rural population for many years. We in the EU applied our best efforts in dia- logue with the political leadership, underpinned with \u00a9 A l l r i g h t s r e s e r v e d ",

Survival of the industry is important to avoid political unrest, which would in turn impact on tourism, another source of foreign exchange. What are the biggest dilemmas developing countries face today in agricultural production? Climatic variability is a major dilemma. Right now in Maharashtra state in India, small farmers are in despair as they suffer crop failure due to a poor monsoon last year. Many commit suicide. Helping displaced persons and refugees from drought-affected regions and coun- tries were major concerns when I worked in the Sudan Delegation in the 1980s. Once again there is a food crisis in Ethiopia. What are the main lessons you draw from a life largely spent \u2018in the field\u2019? The challenge of working in EU Delegations in the African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) world has been immensely rewarding. Much of the task lies in building relations with colleagues in the Delegation, including the local staff who see people from Brussels come and go. Relations have also to be built with the people of the country, especially the National Authorising Officer, and the representatives of other embassies. Some of these relationships are nourished by giving and attend- ing functions. In this regard, I must pay tribute to my wife Indu, who through her membership of Soroptimist International, was able to make friendships with many ladies of influence in the Solomon Islands and Barba- dos, thereby giving us privileged access to local society.

        "# J u i n 2 0 1 6 57 Cosmopolite, moderne et conviviale, la ville de Luxembourg se distingue par la richesse de sa vie culturelle, ainsi que par sa capacit\u00e9 \u00e0 encourager l\u2019art contemporain et le d\u00e9veloppement des derni\u00e8res tendances. LUXEMBOURG L\u2019ART CONTEMPORAIN F\u00caTE SES ANNIVERSAIRES par Nilde Marchitto, CEND D ans la capitale du Luxembourg, les relations entre lieux d\u2019art et acteurs culturels ont tou- jours \u00e9t\u00e9 tr\u00e8s \u00e9troites, au point que les influences entre cr\u00e9ations artistiques actuelles et pass\u00e9es sont \u00e0 l\u2019ordre du jour. A Luxembourg, il n\u2019est pas \u00e9tonnant de d\u00e9couvrir des tr\u00e9sors d\u2019art contemporain dans un ancien casino du XIXe si\u00e8cle du centre ville ou de voir un mus\u00e9e d\u2019art contemporain con\u00e7u par l\u2019architecte de la pyramide du Louvre s\u2019adosser \u00e0 des vestiges militaires du XVIIIe si\u00e8cle. De nombreuses institutions \u2013 mus\u00e9es, centres cultu- rels et galeries \u2013 contribuent \u00e0 dynamiser la vie artis- tique du Grand-Duch\u00e9 et ses rapports avec le monde ext\u00e9rieur. Parmi elles, deux lieux majeurs d\u2019expositions d\u2019art contemporain f\u00eatent respectivement leur vingt ans pour le Casino Luxembourg-Forum d\u2019art contemporain et leur dix ans pour le Mudam Luxembourg (Mus\u00e9e d\u2019Art Moderne Grand-Duc Jean). Un casino au centre ville Point de d\u00e9part pour d\u00e9couvrir l\u2019art contemporain \u00e0 Luxembourg et rencontrer ses protagonistes les plus r\u00e9cents issus de tous les pays du monde, l\u2019ancien palais du Casino Bourgeois est implant\u00e9 dans le centre ville, au bord de la vall\u00e9e de la P\u00e9trusse. Le Casino, b\u00e2ti en 1882, est devenu le centre privi- l\u00e9gi\u00e9 des manifestations culturelles de la Communaut\u00e9 europ\u00e9enne dans les ann\u00e9es 1950. Puis, \u00e0 la suite de la premi\u00e8re nomination de Luxembourg comme Capitale europ\u00e9enne de la culture en 1995, l\u2019architecte suisse Urs Raussm\u00fcller a transform\u00e9 le Casino en un lieu d\u2019exposition rebaptis\u00e9 le Casino Luxembourg-Forum d\u2019art contemporain. Cette ann\u00e9e, pour son 20e anniversaire, le Casino a red\u00e9fini sa mission de \u00abforum\u00bb et de lieu de cr\u00e9ation contemporains. De jeunes architectes ont travaill\u00e9 sur les espaces publics au rez-de-chauss\u00e9e et les salles d\u2019exposition au premier \u00e9tage afin de faciliter l\u2019acc\u00e8s du public aux \u0153uvres d\u2019art. Actuellement et jusqu\u2019en septembre, au sein de l\u2019exposition \u00abLe gypse\u00bb, l\u2019espagnole Lara Almarcegui explore la mat\u00e9rialit\u00e9 architecturale du b\u00e2timent du mus\u00e9e pour analyser ses phases de transformation et d\u00e9couvrir les relations entre espace d\u2019exposition et espace ext\u00e9rieur. Afin d\u2019interroger les artistes sur diff\u00e9rentes th\u00e9ma- tiques actuelles, le rez-de-chauss\u00e9e propose la BlackBox, nouvel espace de projection de films et de vid\u00e9os. En juin, le portugais Marco Godinho, qui vit entre Paris et Luxembourg, aborde le th\u00e8me de l\u2019immigration en lien avec les notions d\u2019errance, de d\u00e9placement et d\u2019exil ainsi que la perception subjective du temps. Une forteresse au Kirchberg A l\u2019entr\u00e9e du quartier europ\u00e9en, sur le plateau du Kirch- berg, le Mudam Luxembourg (Mus\u00e9e d\u2019Art Moderne Grand-Duc Jean) s\u2019adosse au Fort Th\u00fcngen dans le parc Dr\u00e4i Eechelen. Le b\u00e2timent \u00e0 la silhouette g\u00e9o- m\u00e9trique, con\u00e7u par l\u2019architecte sino-am\u00e9ricain Ieoh Ming Pei, prend appui sur les murs aux lignes souples d\u2019une ancienne forteresse de la ville. Comme le sugg\u00e8re l\u2019aspect \u00e9clectique du complexe mus\u00e9al, le Mudam pr\u00e9- sente des expositions ouvertes \u00e0 tous les domaines de la cr\u00e9ation actuelle, en \u00e9tablissant des collaborations avec des artistes reconnus \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9chelle internationale. Cette ann\u00e9e, \u00e0 l\u2019occasion de son 10e anniversaire, le Mudam fait un retour en arri\u00e8re et retrace l\u2019\u0153uvre de ",

De juillet 2016 \u00e0 janvier 2017, les visiteurs du Mudam peuvent explorer vingt-cinq ans de cr\u00e9ation de l\u2019artiste et admirer son chef-d\u2019\u0153uvre, la Chapelle, qui fait partie de la collection permanente du Mudam depuis son ouverture, ou encore Cloaca. Au long d\u2019un parcours qui investit rez-de-chauss\u00e9e et premier \u00e9tage, les visiteurs peuvent d\u00e9couvrir nombre de ses \u0153uvres o\u00f9 la tradition artisanale flamande se m\u00eale \u00e0 l\u2019ornemen- tation et \u00e0 l\u2019architecture gothique, selon des rencontres inattendues. L\u2019exposition de Fiona Tan \u00abGeography of time\u00bb aborde quant \u00e0 elle la th\u00e9matique des relations mul- tiples entre l\u2019individu, la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 et les dimensions espace-temps. L\u2019artiste traite de l\u2019histoire personnelle et de l\u2019histoire collective, et de la pr\u00e9sence du pass\u00e9 dans le pr\u00e9sent, \u00e0 travers les \u0153uvres photographiques et vid\u00e9ographiques issues de son projet \u00abVox Populi\u00bb (2000-2013) qui capturent les instants de vie des habi- tants d\u2019une m\u00eame ville ou d\u2019un m\u00eame pays. Les expositions investissent aussi l\u2019espace ext\u00e9rieur, dans les Jardins des sculptures du mus\u00e9e, o\u00f9 le Mudam et le Casino Luxembourg c\u00e9l\u00e8brent ensemble leurs anni- versaires respectifs. Du 2 au 10 juillet, la chor\u00e9graphie Public Collection des artistes roumains Alexandra Pirici et Manuel Pelmus \u2013 remarqu\u00e9s \u00e0 la Biennale de Venise 2013 \u2013 propose une interpr\u00e9tation d\u2019\u0153uvres d\u2019art histo- riques ou r\u00e9centes, en les r\u00e9activant par les mouvements de corps d\u2019un groupe de performeurs. Hors les murs Le Mudam ne conna\u00eet pas les contraintes g\u00e9ographiques. Jusqu\u2019au 4 septembre, ses collections s\u2019exposent au Mu- s\u00e9e des arts et m\u00e9tiers (Paris) pour pr\u00e9senter la suite de la collaboration entre les deux institutions.

Une nuit marathon au Mudam Le Mudam c\u00e9l\u00e8brera son 10e anniversaire avec un pro- gramme d\u2019\u00e9v\u00e8nements gratuits en continu du samedi 2 juillet au matin au dimanche 3 juillet en fin d\u2019apr\u00e8s- midi. Concerts, performances, lectures, ateliers, visites, expositions, projections reviendront sur les nombreux liens tiss\u00e9s par le Mudam avec des artistes et des institu- tions \u00e0 travers le monde: Hirshhorn Museum and Sculp- ture Garden (Washington), Artsonje Center (S\u00e9oul), Mus\u00e9e d\u2019Art Moderne de la Ville de Paris, Mus\u00e9e des arts et m\u00e9tiers (Paris) ou encore Whitechapel Gallery (Londres). Le Mudam rappelle ainsi sa conception de l\u2019art vu comme un moyen de regarder le monde en gardant une distance po\u00e9tique, le tout avec un brin d\u2019humour. A travers un programme \u00e9clectique et \u00e9tonnant, le public est invit\u00e9 \u00e0 vivre des exp\u00e9riences inattendues durant 31 heures pour un anniversaire inoubliable.
