        "UNITED KINGDOM 3 Main strengths and challenges 2. The education systems in the UK 1 perform well in many areas, including participation in early childhood education and care for children aged 4 and over, digital skills acquired at school, teachers\u2019 engagement in continuing professional development, tertiary education attainment rates and adult participation in lifelong learning. A major reform of the primary and secondary curricula is underway. Pioneering work has been done in the area of introducing computer programming skills (coding) into the primary school curriculum. Main challenges for the UK's education systems include access to early childhood education and care for children under the age of 4, literacy of 18-24 year-olds with only lower secondary education, numeracy skills among 15 year-olds and continued reduction in the early school leaving rate. In terms of transition to employment, whilst the employment rates of recent graduates at each level of education attainment in the UK are higher than the EU average, the availability of higher vocational and technical education trails behind other European systems. Box 1. The 2015 European Semester country-specific recommendation on education and training The 2015 European Semester country-specific recommendations (CSRs) to the United Kingdom (Council of the European Union 2015) includes the following recommendation on education and training: CSR 3: Address skills mismatches by increasing employers\u2019 engagement in the deliver y of apprenticeships. Take action to further reduce the number of young people with low basic skills. Further improve the availability of affordable, high quality, full-time childcare. Investing in education and training 3. The UK\u2019s general government expenditure on education as a proportion of GDP, which stood at 5.5% in 2013, is above the EU average (5%). However, this is the lowest rate the UK has witnessed since 2007 and represents a significant drop from 6.6% in 2010. 2 In June 2015, the newly-elected government announced further budgetary cuts in the areas of pre-primary, further and higher education as part of a broader fiscal savings agenda. These savings are expected to come from departmental underspends, increased efficiencies and some small budgetary reductions and will affect both the Department for Education (savings of GBP 450 million) and the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills (again GBP 450 million). The schools budget will not be affected by cuts at this stage and will increase in line with demographic increases, but it will not be protected against inflation in the coming years. 3 The Summer Budget 2015 has ushered in a number of novelties affecting funding of education and training, including replacing maintenance grants with maintenance loans for new higher education students from England, paid back only when their earnings exceed GBP 21 000 a year, saving GBP 2.5 billion by 2020-21. An announcement was made that from 2017/18 institutions will be allowed to increase their tuition fees in line with inflation if they demonstrate high teaching quality. In addition, changes are apparent in the levels and ways of funding skills in England and this particularly affects funding of adult skills. Whereas previously state-funded adult provision has 1 Each of the four UK countries (England, Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales) has devolved responsibility for their own education policy. The UK country sheet therefore presents an overall picture on system performance, where relevant, but recognises the substantial variation in the policies, organisation, funding and delivery of education across each of the devolved administrations. 2 Source: Eurostat, General government expenditure by function according to the Classification of the Functions of Government (COFOG) database. 3 Disclaimer: The 2015 Budget may not provide an aggregate picture of changes to education spending across all UK. ",
        "4 UNITED KINGDOM been the dominant form of adult learning, there has been a significant fall in the money available for such provision, and training providers are being encouraged to find alternative sources of funding. At the same time, the Conservative Manifesto and subsequently the Summer Budget 2015 announced a push to deliver 3 million new apprenticeships by 2020, funded by a levy on large employers. By comparison, in the last five years, 2.2 million apprenticeships have been delivered. This shows a willingness to shift to a more work-based learning model in post-16 education. The budget for 2015, presented in March 2015, announced a focus on funding for PhDs (the highest level of university degree) and apprenticeships, in addition to supporting science and innovation and addressing skills shortages in some areas. Since demand for individuals with a PhD is outstripping supply and UK PhD enrolment rates have remained relatively flat over the years, the government will be introducing measures and financial instruments to support PhDs and research- based master\u2019s degrees. Scientific research and infrastructure will receive a significant amount of extra funding in the period until 2020/21 in recognition of the impact of science on productivity, jobs and societal well-being. Tackling inequalities 4. The early school leaving rate in the UK fell from 14.9% in 2011 to 11.8% in 2014, which is close to the EU average of 11.1%. Unlike in other EU countries, the instances of early school leaving are less prevalent among students born outside the UK (9.4%) than those born in the UK (12.2%) with rates among males and females closer than on average across the EU (12.8% and 10.7% respectively). The UK performs somewhat better than the EU average in literacy and science skills at age 15, as measured by the 2012 OECD Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA). However, underachievement in mathematics remains above the EU target. When these results are broken down by gender, the UK exhibits the third highest gender difference in mathematics performance across all EU countries, with more girls underachieving than boys. 4 In science and literacy, the picture is better, with the gender gap in science performance being the lowest in the EU and reading underperformance existing in fairly equal measure among boys and girls (OECD 2013). 5 The performance in mathematics of students born in the UK compared to those born elsewhere is less equal. Compared to non-immigrants (among which 20.3% were low achievers), a higher share of first and second generation immigrants struggled to achieve the basic level in mathematics (26.5% and 27.2% respectively). The UK is a rare example where children of second generation immigrants achieve worse than first generation immigrants. England\u2019s average position in the PISA 2012 study compared to above average performance in the IEA\u2019s Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS) and Progress in International Reading Literacy Study (PIRLS) of fourth and eighth graders (years 5 and 9 in the UK), indicates that the problem of underachievement worsens in the final years of lower secondary education. The root of the problem may already be in primary school, when we consider that England\u2019s share of underperformance according to TIMSS and PIRLS is actually also relatively high compared to the UK's overall position. Despite the international evidence, national sources point to significant gaps in relation to gender, ethnicity and socioeconomic background in the English education system. For example, there is a gap of 27 percentage points between low-income students and other students in 4 23.8% of 15-year-old girls and 19.7% of 15-year-old boys failed to achieve the basic level of mathematics at the age of 15, which is a higher percentage difference among genders than in all EU countries but Luxembourg and Austria. 5 According to PISA 2012, 19.8% of boys and 13.5% of girls underachieve in reading. In science, 13.9% of boys and 16% of girls underperform. ",
        "UNITED KINGDOM 5 achieving the GCSE (lower secondary examinations) benchmark (five good GCSEs including English and maths) that has not narrowed, and a gap of 10 percentage points between girls and boys, which is widening. The geographical location of poorer children plays a major role in their chances of doing well at school, with the London area performing significantly better than rural and coastal areas (Social Mobility and Child Poverty Commission 2014). The rate of 4-year-olds enrolled in early childhood education and care remains stable and is above the EU average (96.6% compared to the EU average of 93.1% in 2013), despite average monthly childcare fees for younger children being the third highest in the EU (European Commission 2014a). The compulsory education leaving age is 16 in Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales, but was raised from 16 to 17 in 2013 in England and to 18 in 2015, which may bring the proportion of early school leavers below the Europe 2020 target of 10%. Importantly, this has the potential to reduce skills inequalities in the UK. Nevertheless, the concern is that young people in England will be able to complete compulsory education by doing a series of short courses (including part- time) with a low level of English and mathematics, which may minimise the effect of their continued education on reducing inequalities. Young people in other parts of the UK will still be leaving school at a relatively young age. Several initiatives to improve basic skills are being implemented across each of the UK countries. In England, \u201816 to 19 Study Programmes\u2019 require students who have not achieved the required standard in English and/or mathematics (GCSE grades A* to C or equivalent qualification) to continue to study these subjects. In 2013/14, this applied to around 39% of all pupils aged 16- 18. Implementation has led to a proliferation in \u2018functional skills\u2019 courses at the same level as GCSEs for apprentices, with the expectation that they pass the tests in order to obtain their apprenticeship qualification (Ofsted 2014). The remaining challenge is the training of teachers and trainers to teach maths and English and to incorporate this teaching effectively into vocational courses (Education and Training Foundation 2015). The Office of Qualifications and Examinations Regulation (Ofqual) is considering what improvements could be made to the standards, last reviewed in 2000, quality and assessment of functional skills. Finally, in the absence of a higher level applied mathematics qualification in England, the Department for Education in England recently announced a new post-GCSE core mathematics qualification, but no similar qualification exists for English as yet. By focusing efforts on making the content and assessment of key subjects more demanding, the other devolved administrations are taking a long- term approach to improving young people\u2019s basic skills. The \u2018Curriculum for Excellence\u2019 is in its fourth year of implementation in Scotland and continuously being improved in line with twice-yearly implementation plans. In October 2014 the Welsh Government published \u2018Qualified for Life\u2019, an education improvement plan for the period up to 2020. The plan, which covers education for 3- to 19-year-olds, consolidates the Welsh Government\u2019s key education priorities of raising standards in literacy and numeracy and breaking the link between deprivation and low attainment. It also announces the Welsh Government\u2019s ambition for Wales to achieve scores of 500 in reading, math ematics and science in the 2021 PISA test round. The \u2018Entitlement Framework\u2019 in Northern Ireland (introduced in 2007 and statutory since 2013) aims to guarantee pupils aged 14 and above access to a broad and balanced curriculum on an area basis, by requiring the offer of a minimum number of courses. Area Learning Communities have been established to help post-primary schools and further education colleges work collaboratively to ensure that the courses offered in a given area meet pupils\u2019 needs and the mini mum required by statute. The UK government funds 15 hours a week of free early education for all 3- and 4-year-olds in England and it has announced that this will be doubled to 30 free hours a week for working families from September 2016. In Scotland, funding for 30 hours free a week will be phased in ",
        "6 UNITED KINGDOM over a 5-year period. The offer of 15 free hours has also been available to 40% of the most disadvantaged 2-year-olds since September 2014 in England. But unofficial data from a survey conducted among nurseries in England has found that despite demand from the parents, 1 in 7 nurseries has not been able to increase their capacity owing to insufficient local government subsidies (National Day Nurseries Association 2015). A future challenge will therefore be to determine the new process and funding mechanism to support this increase in funded early education. In addition, the Early Years Pupil Premium of GBP 300 per eligible child will become available to preschool education providers in 2015/16. The government announced a new tax- free childcare scheme from autumn 2015 for working families not already in receipt of tax credits (HM Treasury 2014). Box 2. Curriculum reform in England The comprehensive curriculum reform consists of the following initiatives, designed to raise expectations of how young people perform in the basic skills: \uf0b7 The introduction of the new slimmed-down national curriculum in September 2014, which is expected to improve children \u2019 s numeracy, language and literacy skills and knowledge. The curricula for English, mathematics and science have been made more demanding, while other subjects have been slimmed down. The changes to the English and mathematics curriculum are being introduced in phases since September 2014, with the new national tests introduced for Key Stage 2 (end of primary school) in 2016. This reform is fully in line with the CSRs made to the UK between 2011 and 2014 which encouraged the UK to reduce the number of young people with low basic skills. \uf0b7 Reform will be accompanied by the tracking of schools\u2019 performance using national tests on literacy and numeracy against threshold targets for achievement, which are the statutory assessment results in English, maths and science published nationally. By 2016 primary schools will be judged against at new floor standard of 65% of students achieving the required standard in English and maths and making sufficient progress. Aside from the curriculum changes, school performance tracking is one of the most effective policy levers used in this reform. \uf0b7 Implementation of the GCSE reform, with the introduction of stricter assessment for English language examinations in summer 2014 and the development of reformed GCSEs in English language and maths to be introduced in September 2015 for examinations in summer 2017 (and science from September 2016). This reform will raise the bar for learners but will lead, at least in the short term, to a perceived fall in achievement. The more demanding GCSEs are likely to put some young people at risk of being ca tegorised as \u2018not in employment, education or training\u2019 (NEET) in the short term, while the reduction in adult skills funding will make some of those pathways unsustainable. \uf0b7 Subject knowledge enhancement courses to improve teaching effectiveness through continuing professional development in areas with teacher shortages such as mathematics (at both primary and secondary level) and science are being provided by \u2018teaching school\u2019 alliances to supplement programmes provided by professional bodies and subject associations that have some government funding. \uf0b7 Implementation of the reforms to the A-level (upper secondary examination), with the introduction of the first group of reformed A-levels to be taught in September 2015 for examinations in summer 2017. The government has recently announced that the new curriculum for A-level mathematics will not be introduced until September 2017, one year later than planned, so that students will be better prepared, having already worked towards the new, more challenging mathematics GCSE.

        "UNITED KINGDOM 7 Modernising school education 5. England fares well in terms of teacher training, as shown in the 2013 OECD Teaching and Learning International Survey (TALIS, OECD 2014b). 91.7% of teachers report having undertaken some professional development activities in the previous 12 months (compared to the EU average of 84.6%). Information and communications technology (ICT) is widely used in classrooms, by 37.1% of teachers compared to 34% in the EU as a whole. This also reflects the percentage of teachers having been trained in ICT (38.9%). A particularly high number of teachers report giving different work to students with learning difficulties and/or to those who can advance faster (63.2% compared to the EU average of 46.0%). This reflects a high percentage of teachers trained in special needs education (38.3% compared to the EU average of 32.4%). The number of schools failing to reach the national minimum standard set by the Department for Education in England 6 fell in both 2013 and 2014. General improvements are being reported at the end of key stage 2 (age 11) with improvements in 2014 over 2013 in the proportion of children achieving at least the expected level in reading (from 86% to 89%), writing (76%) and maths (86%) and an increase in the proportion performing above the expected level (Department for Education 2014). On the other hand, secondary schools have not exhibited similar progress along national standards. A major transformation underway in England concerns the rapid rise in the number of academies from 203 in May 2010 to 4 676 in June 2015. This has been achieved by changing the governance status of existing schools (especially schools assessed as \u2018failing\u2019 upon inspection) or creating new schools that are no longer accountable to local education authorities and free to employ senior management to bring about improvements in teaching and student behaviour. Today over half of all secondary schools in England are academies. The new government intends to convert an additional 1 000 schools that were ranked \u2018inadequate\u2019 into academies by bringing in new leadership to promote \u2018discipline, rigour and higher standards\u2019. On 3 June 2015, an Education and Adoption Bill was brought before Parliament to that purpose. There are mixed views on whether changing the governance status of schools to academies makes any lasting difference. It is still too early to judge the full impact of converter academy status on school performance, but some independent assessments have been done, albeit with inconclusive findings. A recent assessment showed that although results for young people with low prior attainment have generally fallen across all school types, on average the fall was less dramatic for chains than for other types of school, and a few chains succeeded in significantly improving the attainment of this group (Sutton Trust 2015). Nevertheless, when analysed against a range of Government indicators on attainment, a majority of the chains analysed still underperform the mainstream average on attainment for their disadvantaged pupils (Sutton Trust 2015). Other research has shown the amount of attainment progress made by pupils in sponsored and converter academies is not greater than in maintained schools with similar characteristics (NFER 2015). However, evidence was found that the attainment gap between pupils eligible for free school meals (disadvantaged pupils) and those that are not is narrower in converter academies than similar maintained schools (NFER 2015). National pupil projections in England report a continued increase in the primary school population since 2009, particularly in London. The rate of increase is forecast to drop, and pupil numbers are expected to become stable by 2024. The secondary school population has been falling since 2005, however numbers will start to rise in 2016 as a result of increases in the birth rate since 2002. While schools have been encouraged to expand, the forecasts require that new 6 In 2014, a primary school was seen as underperforming if fewer than 65% of pupils at the end of key stage 2 (14- to 15-year-olds) achieved level 4 or above in reading, writing and maths (in 2013 the threshold was 60%). A secondary school was seen as underperforming if fewer than 40% of pupils achieved five or more GCSEs at grade A*- C or equivalent in both English and maths. ",
        "8 UNITED KINGDOM schools be created. Although keeping up with demand continues to be a challenge, there have been few reported instances of children failing to secure a school place. However, the supply of newly-qualified teachers is starting to be cause for concern. While places for initial teacher training were increased for 2014/15, particularly for the School Direct programme that offers on-the-job training and qualifications for newly-qualified teachers, around a third of School Direct places were not taken up in 2013/14 (Universities UK 2014). Figure 2. Diversity of academy sponsors (absolute numbers) Source: Department for Education (2015b) In terms of new skills, in England, computing (which includes programming skills) has been introduced as a compulsory subject from primary school onwards. When it comes to the ability of 15-year-olds to use a foreign language, England is one of the lowest achievers in the EU. The 2011 European Survey on Language Competences showed that only 9.3% of students achieved a B1 level of proficiency in their first foreign language, 7 compared to 43.5% in the EU as a whole. The average number of foreign languages learnt in secondary education in the UK is one language per student, compared to the EU average of 1.5 languages. However, for the first time, the national curriculum includes the option of teaching foreign languages at key stage 2 (ages 7-11). The English Baccalaureate, introduced in 2011, has also led to an increase in the number of students taking modern foreign languages at GCSE level. Modernising higher education 6. The UK tertiary education attainment rate (the proportion of the population aged 30-34 having completed tertiary or equivalent education) has been increasing continually since 2000, reaching 47.7% in 2014, which is one of the highest rates in Europe and well above the EU average (37.9% in 2014). The employment rate of people having completed tertiary or equivalent education in the UK is above the EU average (86.2% compared to an EU average of 80.5%). 8 Labour market analysis shows that the past decade has seen gradually decreasing high skill employment rates among 7 According to the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages, B1 is the threshold or intermediate level.

        "UNITED KINGDOM 9 graduates (as well as non-graduates and postgraduates) from 70.9% to 66.4% in the general working age population (BIS 2015). However, the government reported that 43% of recent graduates (21-30-year-olds) are not using higher skills (BIS, 2015). An independent study has produced an analysis of overqualification of graduates on the UK labour market and concluded that the underutilisation of graduates is one of the highest in the EU27 (CIPD 2015). However, there is no decisive evidence in terms of the relevance of graduate skills for the labour market. For instance, while employer surveys lament shortages and difficulties with recruitment of science, technology, mathematics and engineering (STEM) graduates, the employability rates of STEM graduates suggest that the gap is not that significant (CBI 2014; UKCES 2013). Another remaining challenge for the UK higher education sector is to provide equal opportunities of studying at higher education level to students from all socio-economic backgrounds as well as to provide sufficient alternative routes to higher skills. In 2012/13, there was an increase in the overall number of young people entering university and at the same time the proportion of students from state schools, working class backgrounds and low-participation areas has increased. Nevertheless, very few children eligible for free school meals (disadvantaged students) progress to the top universities and the most disadvantaged among them are still six times less likely to enter an elite institution than the most advantaged (Social Mobility and Child Poverty Commission 2014). In England, as part of efforts to widen access to and improve participation in higher education, the cap on the number of students attending publicly-funded higher education institutions was removed in September 2015. Diversifying study programmes also has the potential to attract non-traditional learners to higher education, which is the hope with \u2018Degree Apprenticeships\u2019, due to start in September 2015. These allow young people to gain a full bachelor\u2019s or master\u2019s degree from a university while earning a salary and without paying tuition fees. Finally, student loans will become available for postgraduate studies in 2015/16. Scotland has set a policy to increase the number of students from state-funded schools, students from further education and mature students from disadvantaged background in higher education. It appointed a Commission on Widening Access consisting of key figures from education and business and student leaders in April 2015, whose role is to advise on meaningful milestones, targets and activities that will accelerate progress on widening access to higher education. In Wales, a Review of Higher Education Funding and Student Finance Arrangements is ongoing and will report in 2016. It will address issues of widening access and increasing part- time and postgraduate provision in Wales. Finally, Northern Ireland published \u2018A ccess to Success\u2019 in September 2012, an integrated regional strategy for widening participation in higher education, which includes the development of non-traditional routes into higher education through Adult Access Courses and increased part-time opportunities. Modernising vocational education and training and promoting adult 7. learning Despite initial measures to reform it, the vocational qualifications system remains complex. While the UK has a firmly-established set of qualifications frameworks, there is also training that is not part of these frameworks but is instead certificated by companies, charities and independent training agencies. The proportion of upper secondary students enrolled in initial vocational education and training in the UK is below the EU average (43.8% compared to 48.9% in 2013). In line with the wider EU trend, initial vocational education and training graduates in the UK have an employment rate that is 4 percentage points higher than their counterparts from general education. UK adult participation in learning, at 15.8%, is significantly higher than the EU average (10.7% in 2014). However, the participation of people from less advantaged backgrounds is significantly lower than that of other groups, and participation among unemployed people and those over 55 ",
        "10 UNITED KINGDOM appears to be declining. The announced cuts of 24% in funding for further education colleges (and 40% since 2010), which offer a wide range of adult courses from basic numeracy and literacy to vocational training, are estimated, by a national body representing further education colleges, to cause 190 000 adult education places to be lost (Association of Colleges 2015). The previous government published a plan to reform adult vocational qualifications with a view to simplifying the qualifications regime and ensuring that qualifications are recognised by employers before being approved. Following the Wolf Report (Wolf 2011), Tech-levels were introduced from September 2014 as an equivalent to A-levels for those who want to take a vocational route. The new UK government has announced that it will legislate to set a target of creating three million apprenticeships by 2020, to ensure their quality and to raise their reputation as part of a career path. Figure 3. Apprenticeship starts by level of qualification (in 1000s) Source: BIS (2015b) Many further education colleges, previously offering a wide range of general and vocational courses for the over-16s, have to reinvent themselves in response to the cut in 16-19 skills funding and the increase in funding for apprenticeships. It was announced that the word \u2018apprenticeships\u2019 would be legally protected by the Enterprise Bill, similarly to the word \u2018degree\u2019, in a bid to enhance the status of apprenticeships. This is justified, as for now, the latest figures show that the number of apprenticeship starts has fallen. In 2013/14 there were 440 000 apprenticeship starts in England, which is 70 000 fewer than the number of starts in the 2012/13 academic year. This is a result of the fall in the number of apprenticeship starts among people over the age of 25 as a result of removing of apprenticeships from the scope of the loans programme. This has so far deterred older people from enrolling. However, it has not yet encouraged a higher number of young people to enrol. Most apprentices chose to study for the service sector, with three quarters of starts concentrated in three sectors: business, administration and law; health, public services and care; and retail and commercial enterprise. Encouragingly, the percentage of men and women in apprenticeships is roughly equal, with women only slightly ahead (52% of women compared to 48% of men). The level of qualification acquired through apprenticeships tends to be low, with the highest level of apprenticeships making up only 2% of total apprenticeship starts (see Figure 3). 0 100 200 300 400 500 600 2009/2010 2010/2011 2011/2012 2012/2013 2013/2014 Up to Apr-15 Higher Advanced Intermediate ",

        "14 SUMMARY 1. Highlights of the cross-national analysis This first edition of the Education and Training Monitor developed under the Juncker Commission is published when Europe's need for long-term solutions to a growing social crisis has once more been thrown into sharp relief. Education is the foundation of Europe's future economic vitality, driving the employability, productivity, innovativeness and entrepreneurial spirit of tomorrow's working population. But equipping people for employment is only part of the picture. Education has an equally important role in creating a better society. Well-educated people are less at risk of marginalisation and social exclusion. Effective education is about inclusiveness, ensuring every citizen has an opportunity to develop their talents and to feel part of a shared future. Building effective education and training systems requires a focus on inclusion as part and parcel of the broader quest for excellence, quality and relevance. These objectives are well reflected in the Europe 2020 education headline target. Yet the latest available data shows a worrying decrease in education investment for the third consecutive year, jeopardising the EU's progress towards these objectives. Member States that have seen a spending cut for at least three years in a row are NL, FI, PT, IT, ES, IE and UK \u2013 the latter four proving the most problematic from a demographic perspective. The Education and Training Monitor 2015 shows that, in view of improving spending effectiveness and efficiency, mutual learning and evidence-based policy making are of vital importance. Inclusiveness Educational poverty, or the share of young people failing to reach minimum standards in education, is one of the greatest challenges in Europe today. Although education should level the playing field for all, opportunities and outcomes are still very much determined by people's socio-economic and immigration background. As a result, no EU Member State has managed to bring underachievement amongst 15 year-olds with low socio-economic status below 15%. And in BG, CY, RO, EL, SK and HU, over half of those with low socio-economic status are unable to solve very basic maths problems. Leaving school without upper secondary education attainment is another indication of educational poverty. Just like underachievement in basic skills, the rate of early leavers from education and training \u2013 now at 11.1% in the EU \u2013 is influenced strongly by students' parental background. In addition, about 60% of early school leavers are subsequently either inactive or unemployed, illustrating how educational poverty has long-term and serious repercussions. Widening access in higher education is made more difficult by a lack of inclusiveness in the earlier years of schooling. The tertiary education attainment rate in the EU now stands at 37.9%, but the social dimension of higher education remains an issue. A range of factors influence access to tertiary level education among under-represented groups, including their success and engagement in earlier stages of education. At the same time, as the student population does become more diverse, higher education will have to adapt to help prevent more disadvantaged students dropping out of the system before they graduate. A powerful example of how education can level the playing field concerns progress towards the Europe 2020 headline target amongst students born abroad. Foreign-born young people who arrived in their new country of residence before the beginning of compulsory education show virtually identical rates of early school leaving and tertiary education attainment when compared to native-born individuals. However, foreign-born students arriving during compulsory education perform less well and require targeted support. Many adults who, after having failed to acquire a sufficient level of knowledge, skills, competences and dispositions during initial education, are stuck in low-quality jobs that offer either little opportunity for career growth, or motivation for undertaking further learning. One in four adults in Europe is caught in a low-skills trap \u2013 one that limits access to the labour market while simultaneously closing avenues to further education or training. ",
        "SUMMARY 15 The Education and Training Monitor 2015 identifies three types of policy levers that could help improve the inclusiveness of Europe's education and training systems, thereby tackling educational poverty. It all starts with early childhood education and care (ECEC), which helps reduce the impact of socio-economic status on subsequent educational achievement. Outreach and, in some cases, positive discrimination measures are important, for instance through language programmes, targeted support to disadvantaged areas, quantitative targets for disadvantaged groups and home-learning guidance. Secondly, teachers have a strong role to play in inclusive education. Their need for training in the domains of special education needs, multicultural environments and individualised learning will have to be met with an incentivised, barrier-free offer of continuing professional development (CPD). Initial teacher education should cover issues of educational poverty, including underachievement in basic skills and risk factors associated with early school leaving. Thirdly, the education and training system needs to allow for more flexible transitions, whether between levels of education, between vocational and general education, or between the labour market and adult learning. Disadvantaged learners in particular benefit from permeable pathways, non-traditional entry routes into higher education and second chance education. Continued learning is essential for the 66 million adults with at best lower secondary education attainment, but only 4.4% of them participate in adult learning. Quality Expanding access to education and training is a crucial aspect of inclusion. But developing effective, efficient and responsive education and training systems means going beyond attainment levels and focusing strongly on the quality of education programmes. Despite the growing use of qualification frameworks and emphasis on learning outcomes, international assessments continue to reveal major disparities in competency levels between countries. The Education and Training Monitor 2015 highlights four domains of policy levers. Firstly, quality needs to start early. While ECEC participation is near-universal in an increasing number of EU Member States, little is known about the quality of provision or the necessary interactions between children, staff, authorities and parents. Many member states (BE de, BG, CZ, FR, IT, CY, PL, PT, SK, UK-WLS and UK-NIR) do not provide educational guidelines for the entire ECEC phase. ECEC lacks coherent vision, particularly as regards its governance and funding needs. ",
        "16 SUMMARY Secondly, quality means tackling underachievement in basic skills, and working to help students and students strengthen the competences they need in an increasingly international, competitive labour market. As one of many examples possible, the Education and Training Monitor 2015 looks at foreign language competences and the available infrastructures for language teaching and learning. An increasing percentage of students who at home speak a language different to the language of instruction demands Member States to develop new approaches to language teaching and learning, capitalising on existing diversity to increase awareness and metalinguistic skills. 18% of students in primary education and 10.3% of general upper secondary education students still do not learn any foreign languages. Such percentages need to be reduced and learning outcomes improved in order to overcome linguistic barriers to learning and working mobility. Thirdly, quality can be better exploited through innovation and digital technologies. In higher education, for example, this affects the delivery of learning, adoption of better assessment methods and new forms of accreditation. Massive open online courses (MOOCs) and other digital developments are challenging the role and structure of higher education institutions (HEIs). In turn, analysis of big data from digital learning experiences can be used to strengthen both processes and outcomes, and may help combat drop-out rates. Finally, all of these efforts to raise quality across Europe\u2019s education and training systems depend in large part on teachers\u2019 competences, and on setting high standards for their initial education, induction and CPD. This is the fourth domain of policy levers to improve quality as identified in the Education and Training Monitor 2015. It also concerns school leaders, who should allocate time and resources to encourage teachers to work together, diversifying their teaching and improving students\u2019 individualised learning and guidance throughout the education career. Relevance Acknowledging youth unemployment as a perpetuating challenge for Europe, the Education and Training Monitor 2015 identifies three domains of policy levers to improve labour market relevance. Firstly, through combining school- and work-based learning, vocational education and training (VET) strengthens labour market relevance. It ensures a continued feedback loop between the demands of employers and the design and evaluation of education curricula, ",
        "SUMMARY 17 professional standards and the examination of students. Apprenticeships are the most well- known example of such combined school- and work-based learning. The analysis shows, however, that both VET outcomes and access to quality VET vary significantly between Member States. Also, work-based learning is not equally prevalent across VET systems, despite its importance in improving relevance. For VET, quality and relevance are closely linked. But most Member States have significant room for improvement when it comes to VET, and better exploiting this potential is also likely to increase attractiveness. Secondly, in comparison with VET, graduates from higher education have better employment chances (80.5%) than young people with upper secondary degrees (70.8%). But while employment chances are slowly picking up for those with upper secondary qualifications, employment rates for tertiary graduates are stagnant. In addition, the limited cross-national data available suggests that occupational mismatch still persists for tertiary graduates, with 25% of them having jobs that would traditionally be viewed as not requiring a tertiary qualification. These findings question the labour market relevance of skills and qualifications. The challenge for Member States is to sensitise their higher education institutions (HEIs) to the needs of the labour market. Several ways of doing this remain underexploited across Europe. Again, mutual learning and evidence-based policy making prove to be of key value. Improvements can be achieved through a better, systematic use of information coming from labour market forecasting or graduate tracking surveys. Another improvement would be to embed work-based learning more firmly across tertiary education, as is the case already in parts of Europe. Finally, skills and qualifications do not remain relevant forever. The third domain of policy levers acknowledges that up-skilling and re-skilling will be needed to make sure that the skills of the working-age population do not lose touch with a changing labour market. The Education and Training Monitor 2015 clearly shows that Member States will have to re-think their adult learning interventions to improve participation in training after initial education \u2013 now at 10.7% across Europe. ",
        "18 SUMMARY 2. Highlights of the country analysis Volume 2 of the Education and Training Monitor 2015 comprises twenty-eight individual country reports, and can be found online (ec.europa.eu/education/monitor). The country reports follow a structure similar to that of Volume 1, but complement the cross-national analysis with country-specific data and information on policy measures and the latest reforms. AT Austria's early school leaving rate is below the EU average. The country\u2019s vocational education and training (VET) system is well adapted to the labour market, a factor that has contributed to it having one of the lowest youth unemployment rates in the EU. Nonetheless, foreign-born students are three times as likely to leave school early as native-born students and educational performance continues to be very dependent on parents\u2019 socio-economic status. Higher education lacks consistent strategic orientation and is underfunded. The drop-out rate from higher education remains high, and there is starting to be a lack of maths, science and technology graduates. BE The Belgian education system is still performing well on average. Participation in early childhood education and care (ECEC) is almost universal for children over the age of three and the early school leaving rate is on a downward trend. The rate of public expenditure on education is among the highest in the EU and all three language communities are conducting major school reforms. There is, however, high educational inequality related to socio-economic and immigrant status and wide gaps in performance between schools. There are also marked differences in basic skills performance and in early school leaving rates between the communities and regions. The academic performance of students enrolled in VET is poor. The most disadvantaged schools lack experienced teachers and head teachers, and there are capacity and quality problems in the education infrastructure. The transition from school to work is very difficult for young people leaving education and training with lower secondary education qualifications at most. Implementing the reforms will require major efforts from a wide array of actors. BG Bulgaria has recently improved its performance as regards basic skills and tertiary education attainment. However, it still needs to improve the overall quality and efficiency of its school education system and the capacity of higher education to respond to labour market needs. Access to education for disadvantaged children, in particular Roma, is an ongoing challenge. The quality of VET in Bulgaria is insufficient, including in terms of its integration in the general education system. The rate of adult participation in learning is among the lowest of the EU. CY Early school leaving has declined steadily in Cyprus in recent years and the tertiary education attainment rate is one of the highest in the EU. However, this phenomenon masks a lack of efficiency in public spending and the relatively low quality of education outcomes. Cyprus faces one of the lowest employability rates of recent graduates in the EU and an unsatisfactory performance in basic skills by students and young adults alike. The country also features one of the lowest participation rates in VET in the EU, but recent reforms and new initiatives in this area include a gradually expanding the VET offer. ",
        "SUMMARY 19 CZ The overall education outcomes and employability of school and higher education graduates in the Czech Republic are good. The early school leaving rate remains low and progress in tertiary education attainment is rapid. A new comprehensive strategy for education was adopted in 2014 and emphasises the need to reduce inequalities, support teachers and improve the governance of the education and training system. Provision of ECEC is being strengthened. Increasing participation in mainstream education among disadvantaged children, in particular Roma, is a challenge. Teachers' salaries are low in comparison to other countries and the teacher population is ageing. Graduates from the VET strands do not always have the skills needed on the labour market. As more and more young people are now entering higher education, further measures will be necessary to ensure quality and labour market relevance. DE Education outcomes of students, including those with a disadvantaged background, continue to improve. Germany reached its national Europe 2020 target for early school leaving and participation in ECEC keeps increasing. An effective dual education and training system ensures provision of the skills needed on the labour market. Nevertheless, there are shortages of highly qualified people in certain sectors and regions, in part due to negative demographic trends. Against this background, improving education outcomes still further and loosening the strong link between education achievement and socio-economic status are crucial for sustaining a skills-intensive and export- oriented economy. This implies more and better quality ECEC, increasing the number and the quality of all-day school places, and promoting access to training for the low-skilled. Finally, integrating the high number of recently arrived migrants into the education system and preparing their transition to the labour market will be important challenges to tackle. DK Denmark is performing well in many education and training areas, including early school leaving, tertiary education attainment, participation in ECEC, participation of adults in learning, as well as employment rates of recent graduates. The level of public funding for education remains one of the highest in the EU. Denmark\u2019s main challenges are to decrease the high proportion of underachievement in basic skills among students with an immigrant background and also to reduce the rate of drop-out from VET. The reforms in the school and VET sectors launched in 2014 provide an opportunity to address these issues. EE Basic skills levels and the tertiary education attainment rate in Estonia are very high. The number of graduates in science, technology, engineering and mathematics has been growing considerably and represents over one-fourth of all higher education graduates. The employment rate of recent graduates has recovered quickly after the economic crisis. Funding levels for education remain relatively high and fairly stable. However, there are certain structural challenges related to adapting the Estonian education system to the rapidly declining demographic situation and to the future requirements of a technologically-intensive labour market. The attractiveness of VET and the provision of apprenticeships remain problematic. Stronger links are needed with the economy. Finally, the gender gap in education is an issue, especially for young males. EL Greece performs better than the EU average as regards early school leaving and around the average on tertiary education attainment. In recent years, the education and training sector has undergone strict fiscal consolidation and a number of important structural reforms took place under the economic ",
        "20 SUMMARY adjustment programme. Greece has begun significant work to reorganise general education, to upgrade VET and to reform the governance and organisation of higher education. Recent legislation indicates the intention to revert to education policy from the pre-2010 period. The Greek education and training system requires further modernisation in terms of its performance and its ways of working, in particular with regard to providing basic skills, and its capacity to prepare young people for the transition to the labour market. ES Spain has one of the highest tertiary education attainment rates in Europe, and enrolment in VET has also increased with a particular expansion of the dual model of work-based training combined with vocational school training. Participation in ECEC is almost universal. Despite a steady fall in early school leaving over the past six years, Spain still has the highest rate in Europe, with significant differences between regions. There are also great disparities in the performance of school students in basic skills between cohorts, schools and regions, mostly linked to socio-economic status. Recent reform of the education and training system is expected to reduce the early school leaving rate still further while improving basic skills levels of low performers. The reform is being implemented at different paths across the autonomous communities. Employability of higher education graduates, particularly in certain disciplines, remains a major challenge, as well as the significant proportion of graduates employed in jobs that do not require a university degree. FI Finland has an equitable education and training systems providing for very good learning outcomes. The early school leaving rate is stable and the level of basic skills remains high, despite somewhat less favourable results in recent international surveys. New challenges are emerging, especially for students with an immigrant background and in the light of a recent trend towards differentiation between schools in densely populated urban areas. While there is a high level of participation in VET and new apprenticeships have been created recently, the overall number of apprenticeship-type placements is comparably low. FR Participation in ECEC is almost universal for children from three years old. Public investment in education remains high and since 2013 the country has been engaged in ambitious reforms in all sectors and at all levels of education and training. However, results are average in comparison to other countries and educational inequalities linked to socio-economic status have been widening consistently. Despite an early school leaving rate below EU average, significant regional disparities remain. Moreover, too many young people, in particular among those with an immigrant background, still leave education with at most a lower secondary level qualification, while the labour market prospects for this group have significantly deteriorated. The number of apprenticeships increased at higher-level VET, but there are still not sufficient apprenticeships for the least qualified. Finally, the level of adult literacy and numeracy is among the lowest in the EU for those with a lower level qualification and for older age groups. HR The main strengths of Croatia's education and training system are a low early school leaving rate and a high proportion of secondary vocational school graduates continuing into higher education. Positive developments in the country include the adoption of a comprehensive strategy for education, science and technology, which will be the main driver of reform in the coming years. On the other hand, the Croatian education and training system faces a ",
        "SUMMARY 21 significant number of challenges, including improving education outcomes in mathematics in primary and secondary schools, modernising initial VET curricula in line with the needs of the labour market, and increasing access and completion rates in higher education. There are relatively low participation rates in both ECEC and adult learning. Croatia faces significant structural problems in the form of stretched capacities in pre-school centres and an under-regulated and under-funded system of adult learning. HU Hungary has adopted several national strategies in 2014-15 to improve the quality of its education and training system: on early school leaving, public education development, VET, higher education and lifelong learning. Moreover, ECEC is compulsory for all children from the age of three as of September 2015. The education and training system faces a number of issues: the proportion of underachievement in basic skills is increasing and the socio- economic gaps in performance are still among the highest in the EU. Increasing the participation of disadvantaged students, in particular Roma, in mainstream inclusive education and improving support through targeted teacher training is a challenge. Vocational schools are not attractive to young people, show high drop-out and do not provide flexible career opportunities. Many students drop out of higher education and adult participation in learning remains very low. General government expenditure on education as a share of GDP is among the lowest in the EU. IE Ireland\u2019s tertiary education attainment rate is one of the highest in the EU. Early school leaving has been falling and is well below the average. There have also been positive developments in basic skills proficiency. At the same time, re-skilling and up-skilling are a challenge for the education and training system. In a very difficult fiscal context with decreasing public spending on education, reforms have been put in place to achieve a system that is more responsive and relevant to labour market needs. Access to full-time childcare remains limited and expensive. IT Italy has made progress in improving its education and training system over the last few years. A school evaluation system is being implemented, basic skills proficiency has improved, the early school leaving rate is on a decreasing trend and participation in ECEC is almost universal for children aged four to six. Moreover, the recent reform of the school education system can help create the conditions to further improve school outcomes. Nonetheless, the early school leaving rate remains well above the EU average. Regional differences in basic skills proficiency are wide. The tertiary education attainment rate for young people is the lowest in the EU and many students still drop out of tertiary education. Work-based learning is not sufficiently developed and entry into the labour market is difficult for young people, including the high-skilled. General government expenditure on education as a share of GDP is among the lowest in the EU, especially at the tertiary level. LT With low early school leaving and high tertiary education attainment rates, Lithuania is performing well vis-\u00e0-vis the Europe 2020 headline target in education. Students\u2019 education outcomes may be boosted by recent policy measures, such as making ECEC compulsory for all from the age of five, the development of a nation-wide student competence measurement system, induction and more professional support to teachers. At the same time, skills acquired in secondary and tertiary education often do not meet the needs of the labour market. Underachievement in reading and maths is high and participation in initial VET is relatively low. Only a small percentage of adults ",
        "22 SUMMARY participate in learning. Finally, the teaching workforce is ageing and there are difficulties in attracting young people to the profession. LU Luxembourg is a trilingual country and this plurality of languages is well reflected in the education and training system. Luxembourg provides significant resources to the system and has seen very high growth rates as regards tertiary education attainment. However, socio-economic status plays a significant role in influencing education outcomes. Students with an immigrant background generally achieve significantly worse results than non-immigrant students. Similarly, although Luxembourg scores well in early school leaving, the percentage of early school leavers is relatively high among students with an immigrant background. Performance in basic skills, furthermore, remains somewhat below the average in reading, mathematics and science. Luxembourg is also the country with the second highest retention rates in secondary education in the EU. Progress on the planned school reform will be key for further improvement. LV In recent years, Latvia has made remarkable progress in reducing its early school leaving rate, raising its tertiary education attainment rate and improving basic skills proficiency \u2013 outperforming the EU average in all these indicators. The provision of labour market relevant skills for the workforce is the main challenge for the VET system. In the higher education sector, there is significant scope to help raise the innovation potential of the Latvian economy. In particular, public funding for higher education has lacked a performance- oriented component. However, promising reforms in this area are on-going. The gender gap in education, finally, is a transversal challenge, with women significantly and persistently outperforming men both in terms of qualifications and basic skills proficiency. MT Malta has invested significantly in its education and training system in recent years. Transition from education to the labour market is easier than in most other EU countries. However, skill levels of the workforce will not improve in the long-term without addressing some bottlenecks of the education and training system. Firstly, despite recent progress, the early school leaving rate remains high. Secondly, basic skills proficiency is poor in international comparison. Lastly, the supply of skills from the VET system has not yet adjusted to labour market requirements. NL The Netherlands has a high tertiary education attainment rate and made good progress in reducing the number of early school leavers, which can in part be attributed to the implementation of a comprehensive early school leaving strategy. The share of secondary level students in VET, the employment rate of recent upper secondary graduates and adult participation in learning are significantly above the EU average. Education performance is good, but it has, in contrast to other countries, not improved in recent years. Action is taken in particular to improve numeracy skills in primary, secondary and vocational schools. Challenges also include the aging teaching population and a shortage of well-qualified teachers, in particular for teaching languages, maths, science and students with special needs. PL Poland has one of the EU\u2019s lowest proportions of early school leavers and of students with underachievement in basic skills. There has also been rapid progress in tertiary education attainment and increased participation in ECEC. The Polish education and training system has undergone profound changes in terms of its structure, organisation, management and core curricula in the face ",
        "SUMMARY 23 of the population\u2019s increasingly high educational a spirations. However, a significant number of challenges remain. These include issues relating to access to quality ECEC, particularly for children under the age of three, the teaching of transversal skills, the attractiveness of VET, and the relevance of higher education to the labour market. In addition, the low level of adult participation in learning and poor skills levels among adults, particularly in ICT, remain a source of concern for the future. PT Portugal has significantly reduced its early school leaving rate, and tertiary education attainment has greatly improved. The government has continued to implement major reforms, with the aim of improving the level of basic skills in the population. Enrolment in VET has continued to increase and a first set of new short-cycle higher technical courses (TeSP) were launched. The high proportion of students re-sitting years and the extent to which socio-economic status determines education achievement demonstrate the extent to which ensuring equity in basic education remains a problem, despite the many new programmes and measures introduced over the last decade. Enrolment rates in higher education have shown some fluctuations over the past three years. RO Romania\u2019s tertiary education attainment rate has risen consistently in recent years, but remains the second lowest in the EU. The Romanian Government has adopted a strategy on tertiary education, which has two overarching aims: to make higher education more relevant by aligning it more closely with labour market needs; and to improve the accessibility of higher education for disadvantaged groups. It also adopted a strategy for reducing early school leaving in June 2015. The early school leaving rate remains well above the EU average. The availability and access of ECEC services is limited, especially in rural areas and for the Roma community. Adult participation in learning remains far below the EU average and general government expenditure on education as a share of GDP is the lowest in the EU. SE The Swedish education and training system performs well in many areas including ECEC, students' civic knowledge and linguistic competence in English as a foreign language, tertiary education attainment rates and adult participation in learning. Sweden has continued to invest heavily in education and training. However, school outcomes have deteriorated in terms of basic skills proficiency, and equity in schools has declined. The fact that younger age groups perform worse than their predecessors is of concern, as a high-skilled workforce is crucial to sustaining competitiveness, living standards and innovation capacity in the long run. Transition from school to work remains difficult for young people who leave school without having completed upper secondary education. Integrating in the education system the large number of newly arrived immigrant students is an important challenge. SI Slovenia has the second lowest early school leaving rate in the EU and tertiary education attainment is above the EU average. Average basic skills proficiency is satisfactory, especially in mathematics and science. The proportion of upper secondary students in VET remains above the EU average. However, the higher education system is marked by a disproportionately high number of study programmes, a high drop-out rate and problems with fictitious enrolment. In addition, it is under-funded, and as a result, the quality of teaching and resources is unsustainable. In upper secondary education, the reversing demographic trends and the drop in student numbers have caused schools across the country to function below their capacity. Finally, there are very marked regional differences in national examinations, indicating that socio- ",
        "24 SUMMARY economic status has a strong effect on education achievement. SK In Slovakia, the early school leaving rate remains low, but a recent increase calls for targeted measures. Capacities for ECEC are being strengthened. A new VET act is set to improve graduates' preparedness for the labour market. However, inequalities remain and education outcomes have deteriorated over the last years. Participation of Roma children in mainstream education and in high-quality ECEC is an issue. The attractiveness of the teaching profession for talented young people is low and initial teacher education as well as continuing professional development are problematic. The quality of higher education and cooperation with employers remain a challenge and the proportion of tertiary education graduates working in a job below their level of qualification has increased. UK The education and training systems within the UK perform well in many areas including ECEC for those aged four and above, digital competences acquired at school, teachers' engagement in continuing professional development, tertiary education attainment rates and adult participation in learning. A major reform of the primary and secondary curricula is underway. Pioneering work has been done in the area of introducing computer programming skills (coding) into the primary school curriculum. Main challenges include access to ECEC for children under the age of four; literacy of 18 to 24 year-olds with only lower secondary education, numeracy skills among 15 year-olds and a sustained decrease in the early school leaving rate. In terms of transition to employment, while the employment rates of recent graduates at each level of education attainment in the UK are higher than the EU average, the availability of higher vocational and technical education trails behind other European systems.
