Some of these areas suffer from political instability, con- flict and profound economic challenges. But can the EU simply isolate itself from its own neighbourhood? \u201c No man is an iland, intire of it selfe; \u201d wrote the English poet John Donne in 1624, \u201c every man is a peece of the Continent, a part of the maine. \u201d Commissioner Hahn has a similar message, as he sets out why it is in Europe\u2019s own interest to engage with these countries and invest in economic and political stabilisation. The dossier also takes a look at the many success sto- ries in the region, as the EU builds strong partnerships based on shared strategic interests. This reflects a shift in policy towards a more individual, tailored approach to relations with our neighbours.

        "POST It is always with great pleasure that I page through Commission en direct ! The photo on page 15 of the September edition (Cend#33) is splendid, especially the gesture of Elisa Di Francesca, presenting the European flag on the oc- casion of the Olympic Games in Rio. However, the not so small flaw of the design of our flag becomes evident once again! She is holding the flag upside down. Maybe you could spare some space to explain the right orientation to your readers. Already during my active times I suggested a redesign of our flag in order to avoid such problems. Circling the stars around the centre like in the picture enclosed (right) would be perfect! The European Peace Cross on Grosse Kinigat (Monte Cavallino) in the Carnic Alps, where Italians and Aus- trians fiercely fought against each other during WWI, is a strong and very symbolic example! Kind regards Karl G. Doutlik formerly Head of Representation in Austria EDITOR'S REPLY Many thanks for your kind words, and for your eagle-eyed observation! Our European flag suffers the same fate as the flag of the country I know best (the UK) - always in danger of being flown the wrong way round. Readers who would like to know more about the dos and don'ts of flying the European flag, as well as its official Heraldic and Geometrical descriptions (the more poetic-minded will certainly gravitate towards the former), should head towards the website below.

        "8 Economic Partnership Agreement with southern African countries A new Economic Partnership Agreement (EPA) between the EU and five southern African countries entered into force last month. The agreement applies to trade with Botswana, Lesotho, Namibia, South Africa and Swazi- land. Mozambique, currently in the process of ratify- ing the agreement, is expected to join as soon as the procedure is complete. Under the EPA, Botswana, Lesotho, Mozambique, Na- mibia, and Swaziland are granted duty and quota-free access to the Single Market. South Africa will also ben- efit from enhanced market access, going beyond the previous bilateral arrangement with the EU. The southern African markets will open partially to EU exports, gradually over time, providing their industries with intermediary goods needed to support growth. The agreement provides a number of protective meas- ures in these countries, for instance for nascent, fragile industries or for food security reasons. Furthermore, southern African producers will have more flexibility to use components from various other countries, without risking their free access to the EU market.

The country was hit hard by the most powerful Atlantic cyclone of 2016, which left more than 1,000 dead, millions of people affected and damage estimated to reach several billions of euros. EU Member States offered assistance via the EU Civil Protection Mechanism. A team of eleven EU civil protection experts from Denmark, Finland, France, Romania and Sweden travelled to the affected ar- eas, to lead the efforts of the humanitarian workers. France, Spain and the United Kingdom supplied shel- ters, water purification modules and other flooding management items. In addition, the EU's Copernicus emergency management service supported efforts by offering satellite maps to help assess the damage. Since 1994, the European Commission has granted \u20ac514.3 million in humanitarian aid to the Caribbe- an, of which \u20ac53 million has been allocated to help communities prepare and strengthen their resilience through Disaster Risk Reduction programmes.

        "9 New edition of the Education and Training Monitor T he Education and Training Monitor 2016 (ETM), due to be published on 7 November, gives the latest analysis on how the EU's educational systems are faring with regard to the Europe 2020 tar- gets. It also discusses the current challenges they face. For example: tackling educational poverty, integrat- ing and upskilling immigrants, assuring equal op- portunities for EU citizens with migrant background and modernising education, as well as innovative teaching practices and investment in education. This is the fifth edition of this annual publication that captures the evolution of Europe's education and training systems by delivering a rich source of evidence. The ETM consists of EU-level analysis with cross-country comparisons, the 28 country reports and a dedicated webpage with additional data and interactive infographics. The ETM shows that the objectives for growth and jobs can only be met if education is put at the heart of economic and social policy. Further, it identifies tan- gible policy levers and best practices to improve the inclusiveness, quality and labour market relevance of Europe's education and training systems.

On the other side of the coin, at the time of going to press, the fate of the Schiaparelli lander remained uncertain, although it is thought to have crashed. The agency is analysing the data received. The TGO\u2019s crucial manoeuvre to enter into Mars' or- bit lasted for more than two hours and included a planned burn of the main engine to slow the space- craft sufficiently to be captured by Mars\u2019 gravity. The success of this operation marks the second time that the agency has placed a satellite into orbit around the red planet. The TGO, equipped with a suite of scientific instruments, will make a detailed inventory of Mars\u2019 atmospheric gases, paying particular attention to rare gases like methane. ExoMars 2016 was the first part of a two-fold international endeavour conducted by the European Space Agency in cooperation with the Russian agency Roscosmos. The second part of the mission will be launched in 2020. (cid:2) (cid:2) http://bit.ly/1SM9pYy \u00a9 E S A / A T G m e d i a l a b ",
        "10 Two years ago on 1 November 2014, President Juncker took office and presented ten priority areas to serve as the Commission\u2019s guiding lines for the next five years. What progress has been made over the last two years? Commission en direct investigates. Jobs, Growth and Investment As early as July 2014, Juncker had already made clear in his Political Guidelines that job creation would be number one on his \u2018to do\u2019 list: \u201c\u2026 my first priority as Commission President will be to strengthen Europe\u2019s com- petitiveness and to stimulate investment for the purpose of job creation .\u201d To deliver this, a strategy focused on investment, structural reforms and responsible public spending was put in place. Numbers show that much progress has been made: unemployment has fallen to its lowest level in seven years and there are now eight million more jobs than in 2013. The Investment Plan for Europe, the flagship initiative of the priority which came into force in June 2015, has already raised \u20ac116 billion in its first year through the European Fund for Strategic Investments. Digital Single Market The internet and digital technologies have revolution- ised the way we live. But to ensure that citizens, gov- ernments and businesses can fully reap the benefits, realising the \u2018Digital Single Market\u2019 is key. Since the strategy was adopted in May 2015, roaming charges have been cut and should be abolished by June 2017, new EU data protection rules were agreed, proposals to boost e-commerce have been made and the Commis- sion has also worked alongside industries and national authorities to support initiatives to digitise industry. Fi- nally, a public-private partnership on cybersecurity was launched, expected to trigger \u20ac1.8 billion of investment. Energy Union and Climate At the heart of the European project since its founda- tion, energy remains a crucial priority. Although there is more to do, headway has been made in making our energy more secure, sustainable and affordable: the Commission has supported vital European infrastruc- ture projects, promoted interconnectivity with Member States, agreed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by at least 40% by 2030 and, in April 2016, signed the Paris Agreement on climate change.

A lot has already been done including the Capital Markets Union Action Plan, composed of 33 actions and already helping businesses diversify their sources of finance. A Deeper and Fairer Economic and Monetary Union The Commission\u2019s work on completing the Economic and Monetary Union is moving ahead. Greece is on track to reform its economy and build recovery since the summer of last year; a reform of the European Se- mester of economic policy coordination has made it more democratic and has made social priorities more of a focus; and a European Fiscal Board to advise the Commission on fiscal priorities for the euro area as a whole has been launched. A Balanced EU-US Free Trade Agreement The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership talks are ongoing and work remains to be done to achieve a reasonable and balanced agreement. However, 15 rounds of negotiations have taken place, the talks have been the most transparent ever, and the Commission has paid full attention to citizens\u2019 concerns, proposing to replace the existing system for settling disputes with a new, reformed Investment Court System. Justice and Fundamental Rights More than a common market, the EU is also a union of values. The Commission has been working with Member States on achieving a Security Union through various channels including Europol\u2019s new European Counter-Terrorism Centre, the Radicalisation Aware- ness Network\u2019s Centre of Excellence and the new Pas- senger-Name Record System for airlines. Migration The tragedy unfolding in the Mediterranean means that migration, in all its aspects, has to be better managed. Considerable efforts have been made in that direction. More than \u20ac15 billion from the budget in 2015 and 2016 has been allocated to migration; a position of Commissioner for Migration (Dimitris Avramopoulos) was created to lead the work; and Frontex joint opera- tions have rescued 400,000 people in the Mediterra- nean and the Aegean in 2015-2016. The new European Border and Coastguard Agency has also just begun its operations to strengthen the EU\u2019s external borders. A Stronger Global Actor A strong common foreign policy is vital if the EU is to project its values, contribute to world peace and ad- dress global challenges effectively. The Commission has been working hard to achieve this by launching a new Global Strategy. It has signed the first-ever EU- NATO Joint Declaration, supported Ukraine\u2019s territorial sovereignty, worked on relations with China and Cuba and supported UN-led efforts to restore peace in Syria, amongst many other actions. The EU also remains the world\u2019s largest donor of assistance. Democratic Change Against a background of increasing public dissatisfac- tion with the EU, the Commission has strived to recon- nect with citizens and focus on what really matters for people: new major legislative initiatives were cut from 130 in 2014 to 23 each in 2015 and 2016; a new inter- institutional agreement to smooth the law-making pro- cess has been negotiated with the Parliament and the Council; several citizens\u2019 dialogues have taken place; and, following public consultation, a proposal has been made to widen the scope of the Joint Transparency Register.

        "12 The new State of European Cities Report gives an overview of the EU\u2019s urban landscape. It stresses the distinctive features of cities, their important contribution to the economy and their social and environmental challenges. The document, presented last month, serves as a basis for both the EU and the UN Urban Agendas. H ow do European cities compare to those in the rest of the world? New data produced by the Joint Research Centre shows that European cities are twice as dense as their North American counterparts. African, Asian and Latin American cities are even denser than that, but are likely to spread out as they become more affluent and transport infrastructure improves. Critical to their future energy needs is whether they maintain densities high enough to support efficient public transport, walking and cycling. And here, many European cities can provide good examples of how to achieve this. European cities have several distinct demographic characteristics. Cities, and especially capital cities, tend to grow faster than their country as a whole. They at- tract a larger working age population, looking for a higher education or a better job. People born outside, but living in, the EU tend to concentrate in cities, espe- cially the larger ones in Western Europe. Economically, European cities make a big contri- bution. They generate more GDP and employment growth than their country as a whole. They have higher employment rates. They are more productive and in- novative and their residents are more educated. In almost all countries, the capital city performs best. In some countries, it can seem like the capital performs too well while the other cities underperform. Socially, European cities offer a mixed picture. In eastern EU Member States, they tend to have lower unemployment, poverty and exclusion rates. In some western EU Member States, cities have higher unem- ployment rates, despite the concentration of jobs in cities. The housing and transport challenge Housing is an area for concern. Urban housing tends to be smaller and more expensive, which leads to more households living in crowded conditions. Many resi- dents in high-income cities say it is difficult to find good housing at a reasonable price. Transport is also a constant concern for cities. Con- gestion and pollution are often high on the political agenda. Cities, however, offer many mobility benefits. Due to the short distances to many different destina- STATE OF EUROPEAN CITIES URBAN AREAS LEAD THE WAY by Lewis Dijkstra, DG REGIO \u00a9 B u b b a w i l l u m s ",
        "# N o v e m b r e 2 0 1 6 13 tions, walking and cycling offer realistic alternatives to driving. The concentration of population and the clus- tering of destinations make it efficient to offer public transport. But cities do not automatically have a high share of low-carbon mobility. They need to make it convenient, efficient and safe to encourage more people to use these modes of transport. In addition, urban areas may want policies like congestion pricing or higher parking charges in the city centre to reduce traffic. This would also have the benefit of improving air quality, which in many cities does not comply with EU air quality Directives and remains a health threat. Cities are more resource efficient than towns, sub- urbs or rural areas. On a per capita basis, they use less land and require fewer local roads. This implies sub- stantial cost savings in terms of investment and mainte- nance. Land use per capita has increased in most cities, but more than half the cities with a growing population reduced the amount of land used per resident. Climate change solutions Cities are increasingly focused on climate change. Many EU cities have signed the Covenant of Mayors, commit- ting to reductions in greenhouse gas emissions. Increas- ingly, cities are using nature-based solutions because they can efficiently contribute to multiple goals. For example, green roofs can help reduce the impact of heat waves, catch run-off water and reduce the need for cooling. In most countries, local governments, including cities, play a greater policy role than regions do. Due to population growth and better transport connec- tions and communication, however, the impact of a city today extends far beyond its municipal border. This means that urban governance needs to shift to a metropolitan scale to match these bigger labour and housing markets. That is why many countries are ex- perimenting with different metropolitan governance systems. Cities need sufficient autonomy and resources, a clearly identified decision-making process, the support of residents and, possibly, a directly-elected mayor. Al- though the autonomy of cities has grown over the past two decades, the economic crisis has led to a reduction of public investment and of the share of public invest- ment managed by local governments. The indicators used in the report can be visualised and accessed on the new urban data platform produced by the JRC. This platform (see link below) makes it easier to find comparable indicators for European cit- ies and helps cities to learn from each other.

        "14 EUROPE & BEYOND T he internet can be a powerful tool for groups such as Al Qaeda and Islamic State (IS), in order to magnify terrorist actions. To counteract this threat, in July 2015 Europol set up the Internet Referral Unit (EU IRU). The unit is composed of staff with diverse skills and backgrounds, including linguists, ICT developers and experts in law enforcement and terrorist ide- ologies. According to Vincent Semestre, Head of EU IRU, such a combination of expertise \u201cis an asset in fast-moving crisis situations,\u201d such as the aftermath of high profile attacks. \u201cBig attacks are usually followed by a wave of state- ments and multimedia productions claiming responsibil- ity for the attack and glorifying terrorism,\u201d he says. \u201cRe- moving this content quickly is part of limiting the impact that terrorist groups can achieve with regard to intimi- dating populations and recruiting supporters.\u201d \u201c Terrorist online propaganda has shifted away from the \u2018broadcast model\u2019 of communication (one to many) towards a dispersed network of accounts, which constant- ly reconfigures in a fast and resilient form,\u201d Semestre says. To maximise their outreach, IS and other groups seek to maintain an active presence on the most popular social media. EU IRU has encountered different material like video footage, audio files and images officially re- leased by terrorist groups. \u201cSocial media companies are making great efforts to limit the misuse of their platforms for terrorism propaganda purposes. Nevertheless, IS and its supporters are constantly adapting their communica- tion strategies to counter these efforts,\u201d he says. New technical opportunities are quickly grasped by these groups. For example, automated botnets are used to boost their number of followers. Online archiving capacity is also exploited to make content available for a longer time. National counterparts Semestre says that the unit has also built up a network of relations with national authorities during its first year, setting communication and coordination pro- cedures. \u201cThe cooperation has been tested and improved in Action Days, during which Member States and Europol team up to make a joint effort to target online terrorist propa- ganda.\u201d National counterparts can also request support in case of major incidents. \u201cAll attacks nowadays have an online dimension,\u201d he concludes.

For one night, Parc L\u00e9opold and the streets around the European institu- tions were unusually lively, with installations, performances, screenings and other artistic projects. The Solvay Library, Concert Noble, Residence Palace and other well-known buildings hosted some of the activities, while others were in empty premises or outdoors. The topic, though, was highly political: borders. Most of the artists touched upon the current refugee crisis and migra- tion flows, reflecting on ideas like exile, identity or belonging. For example, the visitor was confronted with shoes and messages le(cid:3) by migrants in the Calais jungle, with a march of people wearing life vests or with testimonials of undo- cumented migrants. Other installations questioned the freedom of choice or the technological achievements in the latest century, among other issues. In short, a night to stay awake and raise awareness.

        "18 EUROPE & BEYOND T he week of events, from 5-9 December, was an- nounced in the New Skills Agenda for Europe earlier this year. It will focus on the critical role of vo- cational education and training (VET) in supporting innovation and competitiveness in Europe, and how it can contribute to improving employability. Why are we doing this? Despite its positive outcomes on skills and employabil- ity, perceptions exist in many Member States that VET is a second option after general education and training. We want to promote VET to learners and their parents as a smart choice. Choosing and pursuing a qualification through initial VET, and then engaging in continuing VET throughout one's life, can lead to quality employment, an entrepreneurial mind-set, at- tractive and challenging careers, and opportunities for upskilling and re-skilling. VET can be an excellent option. What is the objective? Showcasing the excellence and quality of VET during this first European Vocational Skills Week, while rais- ing awareness of the wide range of opportunities that it provides, will contribute to changing its image and attractiveness. Our aim is to reach as wide a public \u2013 parents, learn- ers, companies, society at large \u2013 as possible by organ- ising a variety of activities across several days, at EU level and within participating countries, to highlight the positive experiences and opportunities of VET. We aim to inspire learners and entrepreneurs of all ages to actively consider VET through new eyes. How will the week unfold? We are encouraging companies, VET providers and other organisations to open their doors to potential learners in participating countries leading up to and during the week. The Commission has a mobilising and supporting role through a large-scale communi- cation campaign using traditional and social media, to support a stakeholder-led approach reaching out to the grassroots. So far, a large number of events have already been registered across the EU and participating countries, with activities ranging from open days to photo contests for VET learners, skills competitions, etc. The Commission is organising its first-ever European Vocational Skills Week next month. The aim is to raise the attractiveness and improve the image of vocational education and training. EU VOCATIONAL SKILLS WEEK DISCOVERING TALENT! by Dana Bachmann, DG EMPL \u00a9 E U ",
        "# N o v e m b r e 2 0 1 6 19 In parallel, a number of meetings will be organised in Brussels. A Conference on Adult Skills will focus on the need to continuously invest in skills develop- ment throughout our working lives, and a Business Forum on Vocational Training will include separate gatherings on issues such as excellence in VET provi- sion, mobility in VET, the European Alliance for Ap- prenticeships (see box), VET research, and VET for sector-specific skills. There will also be a Conference on Quality Assurance in VET (EQAVET). At the closing event, an award ceremony will highlight excellence and quality in various VET categories (learners, teach- ers, researchers, VET providers, apprentices). We will also hold an exhibition of excellent projects that have received either EU or national funding. Who will be involved? The European Vocational Skills Week is coordinated by the European Commission, with the strong support of the European Centre for the Development of Voca- tional Training and the European Training Foundation. All stakeholders are invited to join: learners, par- ents, companies, business organisations, education and training providers, adult learning organisations, researchers, career counsellors, Member States and other participating countries, social partners, and so- ciety at large. We are combining forces with a range of stakehold- ers and organisations we interact with daily: the Euro- pean Alliance for Apprenticeships and the business-led European Pact for Youth, European social partners, the Platform of European Associations of VET providers, members of the Advisory Committee for Vocational Training a national government-led Directors-General for Vocational Training group, and members of the European Qualifications framework advisory group. National representatives for the Erasmus+ programme, the European Social Fund managing authorities, and those implementing the European Agenda for Adult Learning are also closely involved. Why is it important? Where would the European economy be without vo- cationally and technically-trained people to guide ro- bots making cars, to design textiles with embedded information technologies, to support modern business administration, or to provide quality social service sup- port to address real needs? Europe needs skilled people and it needs to attract more learners to vocational pro- grammes delivering these skills. Learners across Europe and beyond are encouraged to discover their talent by exploring the opportunities in VET. The motto of the week is: Discover your talent! (cid:2) European Vocational Skills Week (cid:2) http://europa.eu/!vV64dP The European Alliance for Apprenticeships (EAfA) Did you know that apprentices find a job quicker, keep it longer and get better paid than their peers? By combining learning in school with on-the-job training, apprenticeships deliver skills for jobs and life. The EAfA aims to boost the supply, quality and image of apprenticeships. So far, 32 European countries have joined, and over 150 pledges have been made by companies and other stakeholders. Some 250,000 training and job opportunities have been mobilised. Apprenticeships will stay high on the EU agenda in the coming years. In June 2015, ministers, social partners, VET providers and the Commission agreed that work-based learning and apprenticeships would be one of five key priorities until 2020. This year, the New Skills Agenda for Europe confirmed this priority. The European Vocational Skills Week will be a great opportunity to showcase the benefits of apprenticeships!

        "20 EUROPE & BEYOND The food on our plate, the drink in our glass, the fuel in our car, the shoes on our feet: welcome to the world of the customs laboratories! E uropean customs laboratories are the scientific arm of customs and an important tool for cus- toms and tax authorities. Their work is crucial in tradi- tional areas of customs, excise and agriculture policy, such as analyses to determine tariff classification, pay- able duties and taxes. But their role has also evolved over time with changes in the trade environment and globalisation: customs laboratories now play an important part in anti-fraud operations, determining the authenticity and origin of products, detecting illegal imports like narcotics and drug precursors, protecting consumers against dangerous goods or contaminated food, safe- guarding the environment and endangered species and fighting against terrorism. Nowadays, customs have to organise their work by taking into account elements relevant to the whole planet. And with the acceleration of technological advances, customs laboratories' experts are no longer limited to a specific geographical area. Their coopera- tion with other customs and forensic laboratories is essential. We live, unfortunately, in a world with rapidly emerging threats to the fiscal integrity and the safety and security of our society. And customs laboratories need to be able to respond swiftly to these threats. Therefore besides verifying the composition of a prod- uct necessary to determine the customs tariff, nowadays increasing effort also needs to be put into non-tariff controls. Acting as one All EU Member States\u2019 customs laboratories are fac- ing similar problems. So DG TAXUD has set up the Customs Laboratories European Network (CLEN). This network coordinates the activities of customs labora- tories and harmonises their working methods. It does this through six actions: \u2022 Action 1: maintenance and enrichment of the inter- laboratory inventory of analytical methods; \u2022 Action 2: inter-laboratory tests to ensure the uniform application of the control of goods; \u2022 Action 3: networking to develop a common quality policy and sampling manual for customs and tax authorities - SAMANCTA (see link below) ; \u2022 Action 4: scientific and technical communication and strategy, using seminars and strategic discussions on highly sophisticated techniques and specialised areas; \u2022 Action 5: scientific expertise sharing via the organi- sation of workshops, project groups of experts, and training sessions; CUSTOMS LABORATORIES EXPERIENCE YOU CAN RELY ON by Herv\u00e9 Schepers, DG TAXUD \u00a9 E U ",
        "# N o v e m b r e 2 0 1 6 21 New psychoactive substances - Claude Guillou, JRC The rapid emergence of new psychoactive substances (NPS) driven by rapid changes in technology and globalisation is causing a significant shi(cid:3) in the way that drugs are manufactured, marketed and sold. Most of these substances are produced in non-EU countries and are imported into Europe under false chemical declarations. The increase in number and diversity of these substances makes it difficult for customs controls to detect and identify them. Analytical data are generally not available for these new chemicals, which are now appearing on the European market at a rate of about two new substances every week. The scientific expertise and high-level laboratories of the JRC help CLEN chemists to rapidly identify these substances (see link below). In the past two years, the JRC examined about 200 products seized by customs, among which more than twenty were identified as new NPS detected for the first time in Europe. NPS constitute a serious public health threat with several cases of serious intoxications and even fatalities reported across Europe. The role of customs, as a first defence for early detection of such dangerous products, is very important for the protection of European citizens. (cid:2) http://europa.eu/!jk98hQ (How to not get) lost in translation - Ninetta Kapetanaki, DGT The EU requires the \u2018acquis\u2019 to be translated into all EU languages. This represents a tremendous challenge for chemical names, as one letter can change the meaning of a chemical name and subsequently its customs treatment. European Commission translators (who, in principle, are not chemists) o(cid:3)en have to translate chemical names. Having so(cid:3)ware that automatically translates chemical names from English into the other EU languages may seem a pipe dream, but that is exactly what DG TAXUD is doing in collaboration with DGT, by including a translation tool in the European Customs Inventory of Chemical Substances database. This is a big challenge as rules for chemical nomenclature are not available in all languages. In Maltese, for example, there are no published books dealing in depth with International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry nomenclature. Thanks to collaboration between DG TAXUD and DGT, most Maltese names are now covered. \u2022 Action 6: maintenance and enrichment of the Eu- ropean Customs Inventory of Chemical Substances (ECICS database), which allows for the clear iden- tification and classification of chemicals in all EU languages (see link below and box, right). CLEN allows for benchmarking, assessing performance, and cooperating with other stakeholders such as scien- tific institutes, academia and industry. Contributing to EU policies CLEN also plays a key role in keeping experts up to speed on customs excise, consumer protection and oth- er policy developments. This close collaboration allows for a more rapid and comprehensive response to fraud, the maintenance of equipment and expertise even for rare and unusual analyses, the wide and correct imple- mentation of EU policies and support for development of new EU policies while, at the same time, permitting economies of scale. In a nutshell, whatever a customs laboratory may need - an expert opinion, an analysis, a training session, information to buy new equipment, or help with an unforeseen crisis - CLEN can help.

        "22 In April 2013, following a proposal from the Commission, all Member States committed to a Youth Guarantee as a flagship initiative to tackle youth unemployment. Three years later, there are 1.4 million fewer unemployed youngsters in the EU. The scheme has proved its value to drive structural reforms and to provide young people with a bridge to the labour market. THREE YEARS OF THE YOUTH GUARANTEE PREVENTING A LOST GENERATION by Mar\u00eda Fern\u00e1ndez Garc\u00eda, CEND T he Youth Guarantee was born against the back- ground of the economic crisis, when young people were among those having the greatest difficul- ties in finding a job. It was a strong political commit- ment by all Member States to avoid a lost generation. A Communication adopted last month highlights the progress made since the initiative was launched. Build- ing on this success, the Commission calls for accelera- tion and broadening of its implementation, as well as the extension of its funding complement, the Youth Employment Initiative. The original idea was ambitious: to ensure that all young people under 25 receive a good-quality offer of employment, continued education, an apprenticeship or a traineeship within four months of leaving school or becoming unemployed. Thirteen Member States decided to extend the upper age limit to 30. A strong focus was put on the so-called NEETs - young people Not in Employment, Education or Training. In order to speed up implementation of the Youth Guarantee, a specific funding instrument was created, ensuring dedicated support for measures targeting this group: the Youth Employment Initia- tive (YEI). It mobilised \u20ac3.2 billion from a dedicated budget line, matched by another \u20ac3.2 billion from the European Social Fund (ESF), to finance actions in those regions with youth unemployment rates over 25%. A total of 20 EU countries could benefit from the initiative. The YEI complemented the support already pro- vided by the ESF, which remains the main EU source of funding for youth employment policies and pro- grammes in Member States. In addition to the sup- port for youth employment, for the current 2014-2020 period \u20ac27 billion from the ESF has been allocated to education measures, such as tackling early school- leaving, and encouraging lifelong learning, and vo- cational education and training. Making the Youth Guarantee a reality was a ma- jor priority for DG EMPL and the results shown by the recent progress report are encouraging. \u201cAlthough a number of challenges remain, the Youth Guarantee is working. Over the last three years, the youth team in DG EMPL has worked intensively to help Member States design their implementation plans, to establish a framework for monitoring implementation within the Employment Com- mittee, and to set off a number of Youth Guarantee pilot projects in regions and municipalities, to name but a few. It is a great pleasure to see that our efforts are starting to bear fruit, to the benefit of young Europeans,\u201d says Max Uebe, Head of the Employment Strategy Unit in DG EMPL. Positive outcomes Remarkably, 14 million young people registered for the scheme across the EU. A strong effort was made to reach out to unregistered NEETs, and the Commis- sion provided Member States with a toolkit designed to raise awareness among this group, and piloted a campaign with this goal in four countries. After entering the scheme, up to 9 million young people took up an offer. In most cases, it was a job offer (70.2%), followed by education (13.6%), traineeships (12.1%) and apprenticeships (4.1%). YEI actions, on their side, supported 1.4 million NEETs. Looking at the unemployment trends in the EU, the analysis suggests that the Youth Guarantee was a contributing factor to reducing youth unemployment. EUROPE & BEYOND ",
        "# N o v e m b r e 2 0 1 6 23 \u00a9 E U Indeed, unemployment rates dropped more for young people than for the adult population both in the EU as a whole, and also within most Member States. The way forward Despite these positive developments, more efforts are needed to reduce youth unemployment further, which is still above pre-crisis levels and unevenly spread across the EU. In particular, better support is needed for those who are furthest away from the labour mar- ket, like those facing social exclusion, disability or discrimination. Therefore, as youth unemployment still remains too high in many Member States and NEETs have traditionally been the hardest to reach, the Commis- sion has proposed to increase the YEI budget by an additional \u20ac1 billion for the period 2017-2020, to be matched by the same amount from the ESF. Since its inception, the Youth Guarantee was con- ceived as a long-distance race. Keeping up the political commitment and the financial support for this long- term reform will be crucial to fully reap the benefits of the progress made so far. (cid:2) Youth Guarantee (cid:2) http://ec.europa.eu/social/youthguarantee Some good practice in the Member States Belgium: the Brussels Region launched the \u2018Transition Traineeship\u2019 in May 2013. It focused on coaching and follow-up for young job seekers and students with low educational attainment. Twelve months a(cid:3)er the end of the traineeships, 73% of the participants recorded positive outputs (including employment and return to education). Bulgaria: a network of youth mediators was put in place in 2015 to reach out to non-registered NEETs. These mediators act as intermediaries with public institutions that provide social, health, educational and other services. During the May- December 2015 period, they consulted 5,078 young people. Spain: Thanks to significant structural reforms, the number of apprentices in the country increased from 4,000 to 15,000 in just three years (between 2013 and 2016), while the number of enterprises offering this training grew from barely 500 to 5,660. Italy: the Youth Guarantee prompted changes reflected in the broader reforms launched by the Jobs Act. The number of young people registered with the scheme has been increasing steadily, reaching more than one million by 2016.

        "24 B ecause knowledge depends in the first place on people, achieving this quality means the focus must be on the involvement and connection of all Commission staff, to allow the country teams who pre- pare the outputs to harvest the best country-specific data, information, knowledge and analysis. It is also vital that Commission staff in the various services dis- cuss and exchange their country-specific knowledge so as to build common messages and story lines. This also applies to the country-specific analysis produced by the Commission on other topics, like the Investment Plan, the Innovation Union or the Energy Union. In addition to explicit and formal knowledge, tacit and social knowledge (for example: who is the best expert on issue X in Member State Y?) is also crucial to the Commission. So while some DGs have set up internal country-specific teams, their knowledge should be made accessible to other DGs and services in the Commission. Many colleagues in the Commission of- ten have country-specific knowledge, even if they do not have country-specific responsibilities. Being able to tap into country-specific knowledge inside the Commission and share it more easily could also improve our understanding of the national dimen- sion of EU policies. The CONNECTED platform is one way of achieving this. It combines social networking and collaborative work- ing features in one single tool (see CEND #34). Earlier this year, the JRC was invited to co-ordinate a pilot project for country-specific knowledge manage- ment using the CONNECTED platform. The first step, in May, was to set up two CONNECTED pilot collabora- tive spaces for the European Semester country teams of Belgium and Italy, called CONNECTED European Semester. European Semester country teams are formed by representatives of around 20 DGs, and chaired by the Secretariat-General. They meet on a regular basis and contribute to the drafting of the yearly country reports and the Commission proposals for country-specific rec- ommendations. The development of CONNECTED collaborative spaces for the Belgian and Italian European Semester OUR STORIES IN THE KNOW SHARING KNOWLEDGE FOR BETTER OUTPUTS by Giovanni La Placa, JRC Since 2011 the European Semester, the yearly cycle of economic policy coordination, has become a core activity in the EU policy agenda. The most visible and important outcomes of the European Semester process are the Commission's country reports and country-specific recommendations; the latter being endorsed by the European Council and formally adopted by the Council. Clearly, the strategic importance of this exercise in terms of visibility and the credibility of the Commission requires the highest possible analytical quality in all the Commission's outputs. ",
        "# N o v e m b r e 2 0 1 6 25 teams helped to transfer a large part of the country teams' working processes to CONNECTED (e.g. emails, conversations and meetings) and increased knowledge sharing by stimulating thematic discussions, and ensur- ing a more collaborative preparation of missions and meetings, agendas and minutes. Following the successful implementation of CON- NECTED European Semester for Belgium and Italy, the SG decided to extend the initiative to all country teams: since the end of September, knowledge sharing spaces have been activated and all country teams have moved their activities to the platform. The collaborative spaces are moderated by a Community Manager from the SG for each of the country teams. To protect the preparation of the European Semes- ter deliverables, which often involves handling sensi- tive information, access to these collaborative spaces had to be restricted to the members of the country teams, and all their interactions on the platform are tracked. But country-specific knowledge is used and pro- duced on a daily basis by Commission staff in many places and ways. The need to restrict access to CON- NECTED European Semester should not be an obsta- cle to sharing other country-specific knowledge. So a pilot collaborative space specifically designed for country-specific knowledge sharing by all staff in the Commission has just been launched. This is designed as an open space, accessible to all Commission staff, where all the country-specific knowledge and insights inside the Commission on a particular Member State \u2013 Commission, national and international reports, briefings, analyses, data sets, etc. \u2013 will potentially be accessible. Called CONNECTED Country Knowledge, it once again uses Belgium and Italy as test countries, with the objective of extending the initiative to all other Mem- ber States, after a short pilot period. CONNECTED Country Knowledge is an attempt to crowdsource country-specific knowledge produc- tion and sharing: all staff are encouraged to use the platform to share and discuss their country-specific knowledge. A move towards more collaborative forms of working will be one of the themes of the forthcoming Communication on Data, Information and Knowledge Management in the Commission. This will feature in a future edition of Commission en Direct .

        "26 Juvenes Translatores is celebrating its 10 th anniversary. Launched to promote languages and translation among young people, it has allowed colleagues in DGT to meet some brilliant students, discover some true linguistic gems, and even a future co-worker. 10 TH JUVENES TRANSLATORES CONTEST FOUND IN TRANSLATION by Mar\u00eda Fern\u00e1ndez Garc\u00eda, CEND O n 24 November, 17-year old students from schools all over the EU will compete once more in Juvenes Translatores. The contest coordina- tor, Anna Holmen (DGT), has been involved since its inception and is convinced that she has the best job in the Commission. It all began with an idea proposed by a colleague during a brainstorming about how to promote multilingualism. That was the starting point for an initiative which quickly engaged the enthusiasm of DGT staff. Anna remembers that, back in those days, DGT didn't have experience organising conferences or events. \u201c It was moving in the blind, but we could build it the way we wanted it to be, really from our passion for languages and translation. \u201d The contest allows translations from any of the 24 EU languages into any other of them. In case you are wondering, that gives 552 possible combinations! \u201c You couldn't do this anywhere else in the world, it is mind-blow- ing, \u201d she says. All language departments in DGT are therefore mobilised in the initiative, first drafting the 24 origi- nal texts that participants have to translate, and later marking the exams. Each year, over 3,000 students take part. That means many texts to look at. But Anna said: \u201c markers love it, they find it really motivating and find the time even if they stay late or have to mark during holidays. \u201d Reflecting Europe\u2019s diversity Behind the translations, the participants\u2019 personal sto- ries are a reflection of Europe\u2019s diversity. For instance, two years ago, the Italian, Greek and Swedish winners translated from Polish, as they all had family ties with Poland. In these ten years, the contest has gained popularity and there is high interest, notably in Eastern and South- ern countries. Around 1,700 schools registered last year, though DGT needs to cap its number to 751 due to the available resources. A random draw is held and \u00a9 E U (cid:2) Happy winners of the 7 th Juvenes Translatores ",
        "# N o v e m b r e 2 0 1 6 27 the selected schools can then enter between two and five students. Anna affirms that the level of the students' trans- lations is really impressive, and it is often difficult to select only 28 winners, one per language. For this rea- son, special mentions are given to around 10% of the participants, \u201cto show those who did something really good, even if they didn't win.\u201d From contest to career path For some winners, Juvenes Translatores has been a life- changing experience. One was so impressed by the in- terpreters at the award ceremony that she decided not to study physics but interpretation instead. Another former winner now works in a translation bureau in Switzerland. And there is even a contest laureate who has ended up in DGT's Maltese department. The recognition can be particularly important for students with special needs. Anna remembers an email from the father of a student who got a special mention, explaining how important this would be for his son\u2019s CV, as his Asperger\u2019s Syndrome made it very difficult for him to find a job. For a Luxembourger winner with very limited eyesight, the contest offered her the pos- sibility to meet a DGT colleague who had been blind from birth, and to learn about the tools she uses for her daily job. \u201c It is extremely gratifying, \u201d says Anna, who has plenty of other stories from this last decade. Many more will surely come up in the 10 th edition, with the winners announced in February.

Two years later, it has over 50 members and offers classes of different levels in the VM2 building and, on Thursdays, also in Beaulieu. In last September\u2019s European Week of Sport, the club organised an exhibition that attracted around 25 col- leagues, curious to know more about it. Amira Sz \u0151 nyi, who currently works in OLAF, is be- hind the foundation of the club. Five years ago, she started practising Krav Maga after trying other fighting sports like judo and kung fu . \u201cI became passionate very fast,\u201d she says, to the extent that she decided to start a club in the Commission. Now, she is one of the three available instructors. Krav Maga is quite well known in Hungary, Amira's home country, since it was invented by a Hungarian Jew, Emrich \u2018Imi\u2019 Lichtenfeld, who grew up in Brati- slava. During the 30s, when the Jewish population in the city began to suffer from racist attacks, he started de- veloping this system of practical self-defence. Later, he would become an instructor in the Israeli army, which has continued to use and develop his techniques to this day. Therefore, Krav Maga is a way of doing physical activity while learning some valuable lessons for self- protection. \u201c It is very logical, that is what I like, \u201d Amira says about this sport, pointing out that it is based on natural reflexes and includes three strands: self-defence, fighting and third-party protection. Techniques and role-playing The classes usually start with a technical part intro- ducing different types of attack and defence, and then continue with role-playing exercises which try to simu- late real-life situations. \u201c This is what people enjoy most, \u201d Amira says, as the drills confront the participants with tactical choices. The techniques and physical exercises of this sport are accessible to anyone. According to the club's presi- dent, people of all ages can practise it. Between 10 and 20% of the members are over 50. Most classes are mixed but there is one specific group for women, currently accounting for between 20-30% of the members, as \u201c sometimes at the beginning it is easier for women to practise among themselves, though later we encourage them to move to the mixed classes. \u201d For next year, the club is planning a visit to Buda- pest, combining training with some sightseeing. If you are interested, you can check the conditions to become a member, at any time of the year, on the club's website (see below). (cid:2) Krav Maga European Commission (cid:2) http://kravmaga-ec-eu.vpweb.be/ Krav Maga is considered to be one of the most efficient self-defence systems.

        "# N o v e m b r e 2 0 1 6 29 For the last eight years, Gabriella Kovacs (DG HOME) has volunteered for l\u2019Association Femmes d'Europe . The organisation, which is celebrating its 40 th anniversary, currently has over 800 members, and supported nearly 100 projects last year. Gabriella talked to Commission en direct about her activities. ASSOCIATION FEMMES D\u2019EUROPE VOLUNTEERING BY AND FOR WOMEN by Mar\u00eda Fern\u00e1ndez Garc\u00eda, CEND How did you become involved in the association? I moved to Belgium in 2007. At that time my husband worked but I didn't, and I wanted to do something use- ful. In 2008, I found Femmes d'Europe . The leader of the national group for Hungary invited me to the monthly meeting where we looked at projects and upcoming events, and it was so impressive for me that I stayed. Currently you work in DG HOME. How do you combine your job with volunteering? Both can be harmonized. It is not true that members of Femmes d\u2019Europe typically do not work. There is a mixture of people. There are some meetings and events organised during working time, but most take place in the evening, and some tasks can be done after work, like drafting and managing projects. In which activities are you active? On the one hand, we have horizontal activities, like the Christmas Bazaar, and on the other, those organised by the national groups, like lectures, concerts, dinners, etc. On the spending side, we identify small-scale projects all over the world, mainly supporting women and chil- dren in hardship. The vast majority of our projects are sustainable. We revisit them and make sure after several years, even decades, that our money was used for good objectives. And we transmit our know-how on project management to the beneficiaries, who sometimes learn how to apply for higher funding from other sources. You must now be very busy preparing the traditional Christmas Bazaar in Beaulieu. Yes, it is our main horizontal activity. Thanks to our fundraising activities, our annual budget is more or less \u20ac350,000 and about \u20ac150,000 comes from the Christmas Bazaar. The Bazaar reflects our philosophy. It is multicultural, with different national products, from food to jewellery. On Friday 25 November it is for Commission staff only. On Saturday 26 November, the day it is open to the general public, the restaurant in Espace Beaulieu will be open for us and meals will be prepared by the national groups. And during the day, we are usually preparing some surprises, shows, dance demonstrations or choirs. What do you enjoy the most? Working for solidarity and helping people. We have to admit that we are in a privileged position. It is somehow our duty to help those less fortunate than us. There is hard work behind the association but, on the other hand, it is fun. It is a very good opportunity to meet people. For example, I found not only good friends but also stable bridge partners. Is there any group for husbands? Not yet [she smiles]. But we are thinking of creating a group for men, as they often help us. (cid:2) Association Femmes d'Europe asbl (cid:2) http://www.assocfemmesdeurope.eu/ \u00a9 E U OUR STORIES ",

Partir en vacances, c'est litt\u00e9ralement se rendre vacant, pour mieux recharger les batteries. Or quoi de mieux qu'un immense espace pour se vider l'esprit? Pause. Le temps ralentit, enfin. Le temps se met au diapason des pas, le c\u0153ur s'apaise. Dans le d\u00e9sert, qu'il soit de sable ou de glace, je me retrouve face \u00e0 moi-m\u00eame. C'est dur et salutaire. Ce chemin-l\u00e0, hors du tourbillon habituel, m'am\u00e8ne \u00e0 me poser de vraies questions, sans \u00e9cran, sans faux-fuyant. Confront\u00e9e \u00e0 ces lieux purs, \u00e0 l'\u00e9tat brut, o\u00f9 la beaut\u00e9 explose et o\u00f9 le danger r\u00f4de, pal- pable, mon existence se charge d'intensit\u00e9, ainsi que mes relations aux autres: s'il me prenait l'envie d'aller bouder, je risquerais vite de me perdre et cela pourrait s'av\u00e9rer fatal. C'est ainsi que se nouent des liens forts entre humains. Dans ces contr\u00e9es, toute vie est un mi- racle: telle simple fleur jaune, qui passerait inaper\u00e7ue ici, devient pr\u00e9cieuse quand elle surgit d'une plaine de cailloux secs. Arctique, Sahara, Antarctique\u2026 flore et faune, exub\u00e9rantes parfois, vuln\u00e9rables souvent, y sont un \u00e9merveillement permanent.

Nous avons pass\u00e9 le Cap Horn, travers\u00e9 le mythique passage du Drake, jusqu'\u00e0 la p\u00e9ninsule antarctique, o\u00f9 la mer est beaucoup plus calme. Nous avons alors navigu\u00e9 paisiblement entre \u00eeles et icebergs. Ensuite j'ai eu l'occasion unique de passer une semaine sur une base scientifique ukrainienne au sud de la p\u00e9ninsule: une mine d'informations sur la recherche en Antarctique - de la biodiversit\u00e9 au chan- gement climatique - \u00e0 travers notamment une s\u00e9rie d'interviews que j'ai enregistr\u00e9es sur place et que j'aime- rais d'ailleurs partager.

        "# N o v e m b r e 2 0 1 6 33 As the news headlines have amply illustrated over recent years, what happens in Europe's neighbourhood inevitably has an impact on the European Union itself. This has led to a refocusing of both the European Neighbourhood Policy and Enlargement Policy. For the former, out goes the one-size-fi ts-all approach, in comes a more tailored approach for each partner country that places the accent on political and economic stability. For the latter, accession negotiations have been redefi ned as a total transformation process. Commission en direct fi nds out what this means for our neighbours \u2013 and for us. DOSSIER EUROPE'S NEIGHBOURHOOD A tailored approach to stabilisation ",
        "34 Johannes Hahn, Commissioner for European Neighbourhood Policy and Enlargement Negotiations, tells Commission en direct about the challenges he faces encouraging stability, prosperity and cooperation among the EU\u2019s neighbours. GEOGRAPHY IS DESTINY REACHING OUT TO EUROPE\u2019S NEIGHBOURS by Antony Gravili, CEND Your portfolio brings together countries which seem to have little in common: from Morocco to former Soviet republics. Why is the EU seeking special relations with these countries and what are your priorities? Indeed, these countries do differ, but they have one thing in common: they are all in our more or less im- mediate neighbourhood. Geography is destiny: What happens in these countries has a direct impact on the security and prosperity of our Union and our citizens. Therefore, we have a vital self-interest to reach out to them: to support stability and prosperity by promoting political and socio-economic reforms based on the rule of law, and by tackling common challenges together, from crisis management to migration or energy secu- rity. The key priority now and for the coming years is to invest more smartly and actively in the political and economic stabilization of these regions. What would you list as your main achievements since you took up your current office? As regards our eastern and southern neighbourhood, I have pushed a comprehensive review of the Euro- pean Neighbourhood Policy to move it from a slightly bureaucratic process to a more realistic policy of sta- bilization and investment (see pg 39). The result is a more robust and flexible framework, allowing us to find a sharper focus on shared strategic interests the EU wishes to pursue with each of its partners, rather than a one-size-fits-all approach. This new differentiated, tailor-made approach is a major shift in EU foreign policy-making. Intensive work is currently ongoing with partner countries to establish strategic partnership priorities. In this context, we will continue to uphold and promote key EU values and interests, with a par- ticular focus on reaching out to civil society, businesses and social partners. \u00a9 E U (cid:2) Commissioner Hahn with young refugees ",
        "# N o v e m b r e 2 0 1 6 35 On the enlargement side, I have changed the stra- tegic approach by defining accession negotiations as a comprehensive transformation process (see pgs 42-43). Developments such as the ongoing migration challenge have proven that this policy is as relevant as ever. And I can say that there has been good progress in all parts of the region on the EU path: we opened the first negotia- tion chapters with Serbia and adopted the EU-Kosovo Stabilisation and Association Agreement. Bosnia and Herzegovina submitted its membership application fol- lowing months of hard work which put the country back on the reform path. Albania and Montenegro are making headway, and we also helped to defuse a major political crisis in Skopje. At the regional level, the EU connectivity agenda which I spearhead promotes reconciliation and cross- border cooperation: by connecting markets, infrastruc- ture and people, we bring peace and opportunities, inspired by our own European success story. Thus it is justified to say that the overall trend is encourag- ing. Again, it has to be stressed that this is in the EU's interest: a firm, fair and clearly conditioned accession perspective for the future gives us major leverage to achieve our goal: a stable and prosperous environment, new markets and finally integration for the sake of a peaceful Europe. \u2026 and as the main challenges ahead? I am afraid that the political instability in parts of our neighbourhood will not go away easily, with ongoing or frozen conflicts, and deep economic challenges, es- pecially high unemployment among young people. That's why it is more important than ever for the EU to engage and support reforms that will help address the root causes of these problems, including migration. The recently announced External Investment Plan will be a further tool to boost our partners' economies. On the other side of the coin, we also need to work harder to regain our citizens' confidence and show that a carefully managed enlargement process and a robust stabilization policy in our neighbourhood are in our own interest. In this context, it is paramount to ensure greater visibility for the EU's assistance. Citizens need to know that EU support makes a difference! What impact is the migration crisis having on the neighbourhood and enlargement policies, and how can these policies contribute to a solution? The migration crisis brought to the fore how crucial good relations with our neighbours are. Cooperation with the countries in the Western Balkans over the management of refugee flows is a good example of how these countries are already part of the solution to the challenges we face together. We found a com- mon agreement with Turkey, which delivers results and helps save lives. Our Facility for Refugees in Turkey and the EU Regional Trust Fund in response to the Syrian crisis are delivering assistance to refugees quickly and efficiently (see pgs 44-45). Together with the Trust Fund for Africa, they will also help address the root causes of migration more broadly. With Jordan and Lebanon, the countries hosting the most refugees in proportion to their population, we are currently finalizing \u2018Com- pacts\u2019, a holistic reply to the challenges posed by the Syrian crisis. Last but not least: Turkey. What perspective do you see for the EU's relations with this country? Turkey is a very important partner for the EU. A stable, democratic and prosperous Turkey is a key element of security and stability in Europe and beyond, and hence very much in our interest. Turkey is a candidate coun- try. This is why the EU \u2013 while continuing to engage closely with Turkey on issues ranging from migration, energy, counter-terrorism, economy and trade \u2013 does not shy away from expressing our serious concerns about the deterioration in the area of the rule of law and fundamental freedoms.

THE KEY TO SUCCESS WORKING WITH PARTNERS by Carmen Falkenberg Ambrosio, DG NEAR DOSSIER DG NEAR works on transforming countries in the EU's neighbourhood to integrate them further with the EU. How do you see the role of your DG in this challenging task? In the enlargement region, we support countries' efforts in meeting the criteria and strict conditions that they have to comply with to be able to become EU Member States. Democracy, human rights, minority rights and a functioning market economy all need to be in place. The Commission's regular assessment of how far the countries have come in their reforms and what they still need to do is made public in the \u2018enlargement pack- age\u2019; the next one will be published very soon. Reforms take time and cost money \u2013 we support the countries\u2019 transformation financially through the Instrument for Pre-accession Assistance. In other, \u2018neighbourhood policy\u2019 countries, our objective is to foster stability, security and prosperity. Stabilisation is the main political priority in the years to come. Recognising that partners aspire to different types of relations with the EU and mutual ownership are key elements of the policy, as is the promotion of universal values, democracy, human rights, fundamen- tal freedoms and the rule of law. These policy objec- tives are supported financially through the European Neighbourhood Instrument. I guess much of your work is done through, and in close cooperation with, EU Delegations? Indeed. Delegations are our eyes and ears in a coun- try: they report on developments and their knowledge contributes to shaping our relations and policies in a country or region. Delegations are also responsible for the implementation of EU financial support, or mak- ing sure that this implementation, when national au- thorities are responsible, takes place as agreed between the EU and the country concerned. Delegations also represent the EU when they talk to the authorities, stakeholders, donors, etc., and work with our partners on the ground. What do you mean by \u2018working with partners\u2019? This means pooling together the capacity and resources of those interested in a particular challenge in a coun- try or region, to jointly contribute to solving it. Our main partners are usually Member States, financial in- stitutions (e.g. the European Investment Bank or the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development), regional or international bodies like the Council of Eu- rope or the World Bank, and UN agencies. Challenges in our neighbouring regions are big, and only by working together towards a common objective and exploiting synergies can we make a substantial impact.

        "# N o v e m b r e 2 0 1 6 39 The European Neighbourhood Policy (ENP) originally set out to build an area of security, stability and prosperity following on from the 2004 enlargement. The idea was that those in the EU's neighbourhood making the greatest advances towards democracy, human rights and the rule of law would receive more from the EU: more funding, more options for mobility including visa facilitation and visa liberalisation, and more trade liberalisation. This was the basis of an incentive-based (\u2018more for more\u2019) approach. F or some partners, ENP actions bore fruit. Other countries found the approach too prescriptive and not reflective of their aspirations. Throughout the last ten years, protracted conflicts, political violence in the post-Arab Spring transitions, transnational ter- rorism, an assertive Russian foreign policy and the migration crisis all increased instability in our partner countries and reinforced the importance of the neigh- bourhood for the EU. A review of the policy was launched in spring 2015 with a public consultation \u2013 the first time that an EU foreign policy initiative was opened up for such a de- bate. The consultation led to a Joint Communication on the revised European Neighbourhood Policy in No- vember 2015. The overarching theme of the review was stabilisation, with the following four priorities: \u2022 Good governance, democracy, rule of law and human rights: renewed support for civil society and a com- mitment to working on human rights with all our partners in mutually-agreed formats. \u2022 Economic development for stabilisation: an emphasis on employability; support for the private sector and SMEs; connectivity; energy efficiency and climate change. \u2022 Security: using all the instruments at the EU's disposal to work with Member States on improving security, tackling terrorism and disrupting organised crime. \u2022 Migration and mobility: working within the frame- work of the European Agenda on Migration to support countries assisting refugees and internally displaced people; tackling the causes of irregular migration; cooperating on returns and readmission and looking at increased opportunities for circular migration. Since the adoption of the Communication, work has been done on refocusing our priorities through updated Association Agendas and newly-created Partnership Priorities, and we are rolling out these new priorities through political dialogues and our upcoming program- ming.

Regional, Neighbourhood-wide and Cross-Border Cooperation programmes complement bilateral cooperation. ",
        "40 The framework for EU cooperation with its neighbours to the East is the Eastern Partnership. Launched in 2009, it is a joint initiative based on shared values of liberty, democracy, respect for human rights and the rule of law. T his eastern dimension of the European Neigh- bourhood Policy (ENP) aims to deepen and strengthen relations between the EU and Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Georgia, Moldova and Ukraine. It involves EU institutions, Member States, partner countries and stakeholders, and engagement with civil society is key. The Eastern Partnership Summit in Riga last year and the ENP Review called for efforts to focus on stabilisation and resilience, particularly by boosting economic develop- ment. We are moving forward in each priority area (eco- nomic development and market opportunities; strength- ening institutions and good governance; connectivity and energy efficiency; mobility and people-to-people links), with a focus on tangible benefits for citizens. A strong emphasis is put on economic development and diversification, with actions supporting the private sector, the creation of a business-friendly environment, developing e-commerce, and the implementation of the Deep and Comprehensive Free Trade Area in Georgia, Moldova and Ukraine (assisted by the Support Group for Ukraine in DG NEAR). A particular effort is being made to maximise the impact of investments under the Neighbourhood In- vestment Plan. Investments in human capital and skills development, with a focus on youth leadership and entrepreneurship, will favour the creation of new job opportunities.

        "# N o v e m b r e 2 0 1 6 41 Early recovery through education in Syria Children are at the centre of our response to the Syrian refugee crisis. The EU-funded project \u2018Creating a Path to Early Recovery through Education in Syria\u2019 has already successfully delivered: \u2022 improved access to education for two million children in the academic years 2013/14 and 2014/15; \u2022 medical education and psychosocial support in 180 schools; \u2022 refurbishment of 100 schools; \u2022 training of 1,500 teachers, focusing on special needs children. The situation in the EU\u2019s Southern Neighbourhood is volatile, with ongoing conflicts resulting in unprecedented refugee and migration flows, severe security challenges and uneven progress in economic development and democratic reforms. Limited space for opposition views, pressure on civil society and weak economic performance create vulnerabilities to violent extremist views. The region is also one of the least integrated in the world, with countries now drifting even further apart. THE EU'S SOUTHERN NEIGHBOURHOOD STABILISATION AND REFORMS by Christina Moldt, DG NEAR DOSSIER T he EU revised its European Neighbourhood Policy in 2015 to be able to cater better for the stabilisation needs to its South and East. Support for the EU's Southern neighbours (Algeria, Egypt, Israel, Jordan, Lebanon, Libya, Morocco, Syria, Tunisia, West Bank and Gaza) is provided by tailor-made cooperation at bilateral, regional, neighbourhood-wide and cross- border level. Programmes cover areas like: inclusive and sustainable socio-economic development, democracy promotion, rule of law, human rights and good govern- ance, migration and mobility as well as security. For instance, new Partnership Priorities and EU Compacts have been developed with Jordan and Leba- non (to support economic and political reforms, with mutual commitments to sustain Jordan and Lebanon's resilience in light of the refugee crisis), and a Joint Communication on Tunisia was recently developed to strengthen our cooperation. Two new EU Trust Funds are designed to increase the flexibility and scale up the EU's response: the EU Regional Trust Fund in Response to the Syrian Crisis, or the \u2018Madad Fund\u2019 (in Arabic, \u2018madad\u2019 roughly means \u2018providing aid and help jointly with others\u2019), and the North African part of the Emergency Trust Fund for Africa, which is aimed at stability and addressing root causes of irregular migration and displaced persons in Africa. Both Trust Funds combine resources from EU financial instruments, EU Member States and also non- EU partners like Turkey. Regional cooperation builds bridges between the EU and its neighbours, and between the neighbours themselves. Countries work together on areas of com- mon interest like energy security, improved access to investment, mobility or security, which impact on citi- zens' lives. The main framework is set by the Union for the Mediterranean, to support projects and policies contributing to better integration, long-term stability and economic growth.

        "42 The EU's enlargement policy aims at preparing those European countries which aspire to join the EU - and have been given the perspective to do so - for membership. It serves our interests by making Europe a safer place and promoting democracy and fundamental freedoms, while consolidating the rule of law in the aspiring countries. By extending the single market it brings benefits to all: as a result of successive enlargements, with more than 500 million citizens, the EU is now the largest economy in the world. EU ENLARGEMENT TRANSFORMATIVE POWER by Claus Giering, DG NEAR T he current enlargement agenda covers the coun- tries of the Western Balkans and Turkey. They are at different stages in the process: \u2022 Accession negotiations are open with Turkey, Mon- tenegro and Serbia. \u2022 The former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and Al- bania have been granted candidate status but have not yet opened accession negotiations. \u2022 Bosnia and Herzegovina and Kosovo are potential candidates. In September 2016, the Council invited the Commission to submit its Opinion on the appli- cation of Bosnia and Herzegovina for membership of the European Union. A Stabilisation and Association Agreement with Kosovo entered into force in April this year. Fundamentals first Entry to the EU is based on strict conditions \u2013 as long as countries do not meet the criteria, they cannot join the EU. How do we ensure that the countries will be well prepared once they join the European Union? For this to happen, enlargement policy focuses on the \u2018fundamentals first\u2019 principle, including: a) Rule of Law \u2013 a fundamental value on which the EU is founded. Countries aspiring to join need to establish from an early stage the proper functioning of the core institutions necessary for securing the rule of law, for example a functioning judiciary. This is also crucial for a stable business environment, providing legal cer- tainty for economic operators, supporting consumers and stimulating investment, jobs and growth; b) Fundamental Rights \u2013 including freedom of media and expression and protection of minorities and in particular their full implementation not just in theory but also in practice; c) Economic development and competitiveness \u2013 as be- coming a member of the EU is not just about complying with EU rules and standards; it is also about making a \u00a9 E U (cid:2) Building bridges between the EU, the Western Balkans and Turkey.

The quality of administration also directly impacts governments\u2019 ability to provide public services, to prevent and fight against corruption and to foster competitiveness and growth. In practice, we expect the countries not only to adopt relevant legislation and set up the necessary institu- tions; what really matters is implementation. For the credibility of the enlargement process it is indispensable that we see real results on the ground. Regional cooperation In addition to the reform agenda of each partner country, good neighbourly relations and regional co- operation are also essential elements which continue to drive transformation and anchor stability in the re- gion. Neighbourly relations continue to be reinforced through various regional cooperation initiatives. Important progress has been achieved here, notably through the Berlin Process and the Western Balkans Six format, which brings together heads of state and government from the region and is strengthening the countries' ownership of regional co-operation. As part of these processes, the Commission's connectivity agen- da aims to improve links within the Western Balkans as well as between the region and the EU. The European Union has set aside up to \u20ac1 billion for connectivity investment projects and technical assistance for the 2014-2020 period. (cid:2) Enlargement policy highlights (cid:2) http://europa.eu/!Yu89Vf IPA \u2013 the EU Instrument for Pre-accession Assistance The EU helps the countries that wish to become members with financial and technical support. This makes it easier for them to apply the new Regulations, or to be able to implement the new requirements in order to bring their own systems in line with the European one. The European Commission gives the countries financial support through the Instrument for Pre-accession Assistance (IPA). For the period 2014\u20132020, the EU has foreseen \u20ac11.7 billion for this instrument. IPA II targets reforms within the framework of pre- defined sectors, which cover areas closely linked to the enlargement strategy, such as democracy and governance, rule of law or growth and competitiveness. This sector approach promotes structural reform that will help transform a given sector and bring it up to EU standards. It allows a move towards a more targeted assistance, ensuring efficiency, sustainability and a focus on results. Consolidating law enforcement in Albania (PAMECA IV) With an EU contribution of \u20ac4 million, this IPA-financed project helps the Albanian State Police in their reform efforts to become a more modern police force. At the end of the project, it is expected that the police service will see its functioning improve and its capacity to investigate organised crime and corruption increase. Improved protection of the rights of detainees and prevention of ill-treatment of people in police custody, better community policing, enforcement of traffic laws and management of the borders are also expected to be among the benefits of this ongoing project.

        "44 DG NEAR has several financial and assistance instruments at its disposal to translate policy into results. One of the best known is the Commission's Technical Assistance and Information Exchange instrument (TAIEX), which celebrates its 20 th anniversary this year (see CEND #33). Below are some of the other major ones. The EU Regional Trust Fund in Response to the Syrian Crisis Set up in December 2014, the EU Regional Trust Fund in Response to the Syrian Crisis - the 'Madad Fund' - pro- vides a faster and more integrated European response to the massive needs resulting from the Syrian refu- gee crisis. It primarily addresses longer-term resilience and recovery needs of Syrian refugees in neighbour- ing countries (Jordan, Lebanon, Turkey and Iraq) and also assists their overstretched host communities and administrations. The fund focuses on key priority needs in line with the international commitments agreed at the \u2018Support- ing Syria & the Region Conference\u2019 in London, back in February: first, promote education, protection and engagement opportunities for children and young people in line with the No Lost Generation Initiative; and second, reduce the pressure on host countries and strengthen resilience by providing access to education and employment for both refugee and host commu- nities. Water, sanitation and hygiene needs, as well as health and livelihood projects are also directly sup- ported. The fund is the main channel for delivering non- humanitarian aid to Syria\u2019s neighbouring countries and is one of the key tools for implementing the new EU Compacts with Jordan and Lebanon. To date it has mo- bilised over \u20ac736 million from the EU and 22 Member States and will reach \u20ac1 billion by the end of 2016. So far, \u20ac628 million has been committed to projects, and contracts worth \u20ac207 million are already delivering on the ground. Blending: public and private funds working together Blending is the use of a limited amount of (public) grants to mobilise financing from partner financial institutions and the private sector to increase the de- velopment impact of grant funding. Projects supported through blending are frequently in sectors of strategic importance for partner countries, e.g. energy, transport, environment. The type of blending may vary. The EU contribution can take the form of technical assistance, investments grants, interest rate subsidies, guarantees, risk capital or any mix of these. These funds are com- bined with the contribution by the beneficiary, loans, DOSSIER DELIVERING ON OUR POLICIES THE FINANCIAL RESPONSE by Carmen Falkenberg Ambrosio, DG NEAR \u00a9 U N I C E F - L e b a n o n / Z a k i r a ",

Targeted at achieving key development policy objectives, it often has secondary benefits, such as bet- ter donor coordination and increased sustainability of projects. The EU conducts blending operations with a region- al focus, such as the Neighbourhood Investment Facil- ity (NIF), which is a powerful tool to leverage private sector funds across the whole neighbourhood. Making the EU\u2019s neighbourhood region more interconnected is a key strategic objective of the NIF. Since 2008, it has contributed over \u20ac700 million to transport and energy projects. Overall, we estimate that the NIF has helped to ensure investments of almost \u20ac20 billion in these sectors. The Facility for Refugees in Turkey Turkey currently hosts more than 2.7 million registered Syrian refugees and is making commendable efforts to provide them with humanitarian aid and support. The European Commission is helping by providing humanitarian assistance to support refugees who have fled violence in their country, in particular those living outside camps and in need of immediate aid, and those with health and education needs. The Facility for Refu- gees in Turkey was set up in early 2016, and answers Member States\u2019 call for significant additional funding to support refugees in Turkey. It is designed to ensure that the needs of refugees and host communities are addressed in a comprehensive and coordinated manner. The facility focuses on six priority areas: humanitarian assistance, education, migration management, health, municipal infrastructure, and socioeconomic support. It has a budget of \u20ac3 billion for 2016-2017, from the EU budget and EU Member States funding. The total amount allocated for implementation already stands at over \u20ac2.2 billion.

        "46 W hether you are volunteering in your own time or organising a volunteering team event with work colleagues, your first step is to decide what you want to do - humanitarian and develop- ment aid; social projects with children, the elderly and people with a disability; educational projects; cultural and sports activities; or environmental projects. If you are in a group, try to get a consensus and accept that colleagues may have different interests to you. Larger groups are not suited to projects involving vulnerable people, so be flexible and look for creative alternatives. How much time are you and your colleagues willing and able to dedicate to the volunteering activity? \u2018Low- skill\u2019 activities such as an environmental clean-up cam- paign, or sorting clothes and making food for homeless groups are more suited to one-off events; while helping at a homework club or mentoring a young person re- quires a regular commitment. Be aware of the voluntary organisation\u2019s capacity to welcome volunteers. Under Belgian law, volunteers should receive information on the organisation's set-up and activities and details of the tasks, hours and other arrangements for the volunteer activity. The Luxem- bourg Agence du B\u00e9n\u00e9volat publishes a simple checklist which you can use to discuss what you will do before you start (see link below). In both Belgium and Luxembourg, accredited vol- untary organisations must have civil liability insurance for their volunteers. It\u2019s a good idea to check this out beforehand (see My IntraComm link below). In common with all outside activities, volunteering activities must be compatible with our institutional val- ues. You should know who you are volunteering with, and check there is no conflict of interest or anything controversial which could bring the Commission into disrepute. The Fondation Roi Baudouin has established a database of nearly 5,000 voluntary organisations in Belgium (see link below) while the Agence du B\u00e9n\u00e9volat keeps a similar inventory for Luxembourg. Setting limits Volunteering experiences can be highly rewarding, especially when we are challenged to go outside our comfort zone. There are two areas where we need to set some limits. The first relates to health and safety issues. Of course we don\u2019t expect luxury but at the same time, don\u2019t put yourself at physical risk in unsafe premises or vehicles. Do not hesitate to walk away if you are unhappy with the environment you are volunteering in. The second area is more sensitive. Some projects can involve working with people suffering from al- cohol or drug addiction or with mental health prob- lems. Most of the time, the exchanges are positive but it is sensible in these circumstances to seek the advice of your project leader on what to do and how to behave. DG HR will organise short training sessions on appropriate non-confrontational behaviours on demand. These basic tips should help you avoid the main pitfalls and ensure both you and the people you are helping have a positive experience.

        "48 Since 1995, the Foyer europ\u00e9en located in a protected, 100-year-old building a few minutes' walk from Luxembourg's city centre, has served staff from all EU institutions in Luxembourg as a place to enjoy a meal and to get involved in cultural activities. O ver the years, the inter-institutional Foyer es- tablished a good reputation as a place where you could eat well and practise a multitude of hobbies hosted by the cultural and sports clubs of the Cercle cul- turel and Cercle sportif . But time inevitably left its mark on the premises. After two decades, the Commission decided that the moment to renovate the outdated and somewhat rundown facilities had arrived, and work began in October 2013. After an extensive makeover lasting two years, the refurbished Foyer opened earlier this year. From under the tarpaulins emerged an elegant and light interior, up to modern standards both technically and safety-wise, while the fa\u00e7ade of the centenarian building was left intact. Windows were replaced with triple glazing whilst complying with the requirement to respect the look of the old. The roof was repaired, and a new heating system installed and piping redistributed. A ventilation system was put in place and cabling for audiovisual and IT systems was installed. The kitchen was complete- ly renovated with more storage and cold space made available. Access for people with reduced mobility was improved throughout the building. The bar, previously located on the first floor, was brought down to ground level and now serves clients next to the restaurant, with access to the terrace. And as a final touch, all walls were painted and floors redone. Together with its facelift, the Foyer has expanded its ser- vice offer. Clubs of the Cercle culturel and the Cercle sportif have re-found a home for their activities there. In addition, the Foyer now hosts five meeting rooms with a capacity of 12-49 people that can be reserved for training sessions, seminars, team buildings, cocktails and other events. All events, whether work-related or private, such as anniversaries or leaving drinks, are ac- companied by catering. All rooms are equipped with technical facilities in- cluding PC, screen, CD/DVD player, microphones, wifi and flipcharts. Completing the range of services, the restaurant of the Foyer has also extended its opening hours. During the summer, the Jean Monnet \u00e0 la carte restaurant, previously located in the JMO building, moved to the Foyer and opened its doors in the new location in Sep- tember. With this change, the restaurant, the chef and his team are able to propose both lunch and dinner services to their clients.

It was set up as a place of social interaction and integration for the personnel. The Foyer was located fi rst on rue Notre Dame in Luxembourg's city centre (right), then in the Jean Monnet building. In November 1994, ARBED (today ArcelorMittal), the owner of the building located on rue Heine, rented it to the State of Luxembourg, who then proposed to sub-rent it to the EU institutions. Since 1995, the Foyer has thus been located at its current address. Since 2009, the Commission has owned the building and manages it on behalf of all EU Institutions in Luxembourg.

        "50 Traditionally, those about to retire from the Commission faced a long trek from building to building and queue to queue, tying up loose administrative ends before they go. The whole process could be a dispiriting end to a long career of public service. So this autumn saw the launch of the Departure Desk, a one-stop shop designed to give retiring officials a proper send-off. Irene Souka, DG HR\u2019s Director-General, explains more. THE DEPARTURE DESK A ONE(cid:3)STOP SHOP FOR RETIRING OFFICIALS by Paul Gormley , DG HR Can you tell us what led to this new service? I have been conscious for some time that we have a very highly appreciated welcome and integration service which cover also activities for the families of newly-arrived colleagues. However, until the launch of the Departure Desk we had nothing similar, for those colleagues leaving after 25, 30 or 35 years\u2019 service. Cer- tainly we had the pre-retirement course, but when the time came to finally retire colleagues had to make a \u2018tour\u2019 of five or six different services to return the badge, the special identity card, the official phone or credit card for those who had them, the library books and so on. It seemed to me to be unreasonable to expect officials with many years of service to spend their last days in the Commission queueing up in different build- ings to hand things back. So what happens now? Now we have a one-stop shop where the staff of the DG HR Departure Desk (who in fact are the same colleagues who welcome newcomers) contact each departing of- ficial to fix an appointment to return all the various material \u2013 badges, cards \u2013 in one fixed location. The Departure Desk colleagues distribute the material re- ceived to the various appropriate services. The new ser- vice now being offered is not however only concerned with gathering items to be returned. It also allows each colleague who is retiring to ask any general questions about the services available on retirement or simply have a reflective chat on the experiences of life in the Commission over a long active service. I should point out that colleagues who are retiring will still need to have contact with PMO 4 to discuss their pension situation, as this is an individual discus- sion which cannot be carried out at the Departure Desk but has to be handled directly by PMO. How has the new service been received? We have had very positive reactions during the three months of the pilot project in the summer months. \u00a9 E U ",
        "# N o v e m b r e 2 0 1 6 51 Colleagues who are retiring have been very responsive to the idea of the one-stop shop. They also seem to un- derstand that DG HR is constantly striving to improve the overall well-being of staff members in these difficult times we are going through. At the very least, colleagues who are retiring now get a service which is equivalent to the service we provide for newcomers. Not the same service of course, but a service which responds to the different needs at the end of service compared to those at the beginning. Does this service require extra resources? No. In the DG HR reorganisation at the start of this year I put in place a new Well-being and Working Condi- tions unit where the Departure Desk fits perfectly. No new posts were created and I would like to thank the Welcome Office colleagues for their flexibility in taking on the tasks associated with the Departure Desk. We took the opportunity however to improve the signage at the entrance to Montoyer 34. We found that with the number of services gathered it was not enough to simply add another sign \u2018Departure Desk\u2019. So I am grateful to the OIB for re-thinking the signage at the front of the building. I hope the result will be clearer for colleagues visiting not only the Departure Desk and the Welcome Office, but also the Expat Administrative Support Service, the Security Service and PMO 1, who also have offices in the mezzanine of Montoyer 34. I should mention that a similar service will exist in Luxembourg from December 2016. Is this service only for officials who are retiring? The service is currently set up to facilitate officials who are leaving on retirement or under the invalidity pro- cedure. Commission officials generally spend many years in the institution and when they leave there is a certain amount of personal reflection on a long career spent as a Commission official. We now try to ease the procedural and administrative aspects of the departure. By giving the opportunity to reflect in a friendly setting we also want to show that we care about our colleagues who will remain linked to the Commission through their pension and possible other links such as the \u2018ac- tive senior\u2019 initiative, as they move from active service to retirement. For the moment it is only officials who have had such long careers and who have now come to the end of their active Commission career. Other categories of staff are generally not at the end of their careers when they leave the Commission and therefore an end of career discussion would not be appropriate. In future however, as certain contract agents or temporary agents come to the end of their working career while in the Commission, we can expect that they would be con- tacted by the Departure Desk.

        "52 Every country has its own legal system, instruments, processes and traditions. In a union of countries that aim at working together, these differences might seem like obstacles to efficient cooperation. Today there is a new solution to overcome these differences and facilitate access to information on legislation, as well as its exchange. T he European Legislation Identifier (ELI) is a way to uniquely identify EU and national legislation in a standardised way, based on existing citation prac- tices. ELI has a simple structure that makes it possible to directly access information about legislation (also called \u2018metadata') and to harvest and reuse it. ELI also makes it easier to connect legislation from different legal systems. At the Publications Office we believe that by leverag- ing the strengths of technology, we can contribute to more transparency and help increase trust in govern- ments and institutions. ELI brings benefits for anyone who wants to ac- cess or share European or national legislation online, be they citizens, businesses, public authorities, legal professionals or academics: \u2022 By giving easier access to legislation, ELI fosters trans- parency and openness, thus reinforcing legitimacy and accountability; \u2022 As an instrument enabling interoperability between legal systems, ELI is a driver for cooperation on legal matters and so contributes to the development of the EU's area of freedom, security and justice; \u2022 ELI makes it easier to reuse legal data in a smart way, and creates opportunities for new services by the private sector, thereby contributing to the develop- ment of the Digital Single Market. History and governance Initiated in the framework of the European Forum of Official Gazettes, the ELI project was endorsed in 2012 by the Council in its conclusions inviting the intro- duction of the European Legislation Identifier. Since 2014, ELI is supported through DIGIT's programme \u2018Interoperability Solutions for Public Administrations\u2019 (see link below). The Publications Office, which drove this project from its early beginnings with key Member States, coordinates these activities for the EU institu- tions. The ELI initiative is now driven forward by a task force, made up of a group of countries that have al- ready implemented it. At the time of writing, this task force includes Denmark, Finland, France, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg (chair), Norway, the United Kingdom and the Publications Office. Since more countries have com- mitted to deploying ELI in their systems, this group is certain to grow. If you are interested in the latest ELI deployment sta- tus or the list of national ELI coordinators, please visit our dedicated website on EUR-Lex (see link below).

        "54 GENERATIONS La pr\u00e9paration \u00e0 la retraite est une partie importante du panorama administratif offert au fonctionnaire, mais bon nombre d'actifs, trop occup\u00e9s, mal inform\u00e9s, peu conscients de l'importance de cette pr\u00e9paration - parfois les trois \u00e0 la fois - passent \u00e0 c\u00f4t\u00e9 de cette possibilit\u00e9 qu'offre l'institution de participer \u00e0 un s\u00e9minaire qui aborde tous les aspects du passage \u00e0 la retraite. S\u00c9MINAIRE DE PR\u00c9PARATION \u00c0 LA RETRAITE UN MUST! par Jeannine Franchomme et Michel Foucault, AIACE O n a parfois l'impression qu'une retraite heu- reuse se fonde sur une bonne planification fi- nanci\u00e8re. Erreur! La clef de la r\u00e9ussite, c'est de donner un nouveau sens \u00e0 son existence. On ne tourne pas le dos \u00e0 trente ans - ou plus - de vie active en criant simplement: Stop! M\u00eame s'il nous exasp\u00e8re parfois, le travail com- ble, chez l'\u00eatre humain, des besoins essentiels, comme le sentiment d'accomplissement, d'appartenance, d'estime de soi, sans oublier naturellement la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 financi\u00e8re. Apr\u00e8s la vie active, il faut trouver de nou- veaux moyens de r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 ces besoins, faute de quoi on risque de conna\u00eetre un tr\u00e8s grand sentiment de vide. L'erreur, c'est que les pr\u00e9retrait\u00e9s passent \u00e9norm\u00e9ment de temps \u00e0 planifier financi\u00e8rement leur retraite mais ne consacrent qu'une fraction de ce temps \u00e0 la pr\u00e9parer. Selon une statistique, 20% des personnes de 65 ans et plus souffrent de d\u00e9pression \u00e0 divers degr\u00e9s. Quelques pi\u00e8ges \u00e0 \u00e9viter Les anciens coll\u00e8gues exp\u00e9riment\u00e9s vous diront que ces pi\u00e8ges sont nombreux et peuvent nuire \u00e0 une bonne planification de la retraite. En voici quelques-uns: Prendre des d\u00e9cisions trop radicales: \u2022 un d\u00e9m\u00e9nagement rapide \u00e0 la campagne alors que l'on n'y conna\u00eet personne; \u2022 une installation dans un autre pays, si beau, si lu- mineux, mais si malcommode ou si compliqu\u00e9 \u00e0 l'usage; \u2022 un retour sans pr\u00e9caution dans son pays d'origine: combien de coll\u00e8gues, s\u00fbrs de retrouver l'Eldorado, n'a-t-on pas vu revenir, la valise \u00e0 la main, apr\u00e8s des retrouvailles m\u00e9diocres. Avoir une vision \u00e0 court terme de la retraite: \u2022 r\u00e9nover sa maison de fond en comble par exemple, bravo, et apr\u00e8s... \u2022 tout miser sur une seule activit\u00e9: jouer au golf le plus souvent possible, mais en plus des risques de lassitude, que faire en cas de blessure\u2026 \u2022 se remettre en forme, mais faire de l'exercice trois fois par semaine ne constitue pas un plan de retraite; \u2022 se consacrer \u00e0 ses petits-enfants: si vous \u00eates trop accaparant, vos enfants commenceront \u00e0 trouver votre aide un peu... lourde; \u2022 ne pas associer suffisamment son conjoint aux d\u00e9ci- sions du couple, que de drames en perspective! L'int\u00e9r\u00eat des s\u00e9minaires de pr\u00e9paration \u00e0 la retraite Lorsqu'on envisage de prendre sa retraite, ou lorsqu'on approche du terme fix\u00e9 par le statut du personnel, on doit s'interroger sur la nouvelle vie qui nous attend et se donner un moment de r\u00e9flexion. Quoi de mieux que de participer aux s\u00e9minaires offerts par l'administration (au plus t\u00f4t 10 mois avant le d\u00e9part \u00e0 la retraite. Les institutions dont les effectifs sont les plus nombreux (Commission, Conseil, Parlement) organisent elles- m\u00eames des s\u00e9minaires de pr\u00e9paration \u00e0 la retraite. Rien que pour Bruxelles, il y a, en 2016, vingt s\u00e9minaires (en anglais ou en fran\u00e7ais) \u00e0 la Commission, au Conseil et au Parlement, outre deux s\u00e9minaires \u00e0 Luxembourg et deux \u00e0 Ispra. Les pr\u00e9retrait\u00e9s du Conseil \u00e9conomique et social et du Comit\u00e9 des r\u00e9gions \u00e0 Bruxelles, ceux de la Cour de justice et de la Cour des comptes \u00e0 Luxem- bourg y sont \u00e9galement accueillis. Les th\u00e8mes abord\u00e9s ",
        "# N o v e m b r e 2 0 1 6 55 dans ces s\u00e9minaires sont multiples: assurance mala- die et assurances compl\u00e9mentaires, pensions, droits p\u00e9cuniaires, services sociaux, activit\u00e9 professionnelle apr\u00e8s la cessation de fonctions, fiscalit\u00e9, droits de suc- cession, mais aussi la di\u00e9t\u00e9tique et une rencontre avec un psychoth\u00e9rapeute. Sur tous ces th\u00e8mes, l'informa- tion des \u00abpensionnables\u00bb est souvent lacunaire. Un seul exemple: sait-on que le pensionn\u00e9 n'est plus couvert contre les accidents de la m\u00eame mani\u00e8re que lorsqu'il \u00e9tait en activit\u00e9 et qu'il peut donc y avoir des disposi- tions personnelles \u00e0 prendre? Le r\u00f4le de l'AIACE Outre les services administratifs qui prodiguent les in- formations sur les th\u00e8mes dont il vient d'\u00eatre question, les associations d'anciens fonctionnaires participent \u00e9galement, activement, aux s\u00e9minaires. L'Association Internationale des Anciens de l'Union Europ\u00e9enne (AIACE) existe depuis 1969. Forte actuellement de plus de 11.000 adh\u00e9rents, r\u00e9partis dans 15 sections nationales (Allemagne, Autriche, Belgique, Dane- mark, Espagne, Finlande, France, Gr\u00e8ce, Irlande, Italie, Luxembourg, Pays-Bas, Portugal, Royaume-Uni, Su\u00e8de), l'AIACE est, en vertu d'un accord de partenariat conclu avec toutes les institutions europ\u00e9ennes, l'organisation repr\u00e9sentative des pensionn\u00e9s. Elle assure la d\u00e9fense des int\u00e9r\u00eats l\u00e9gitimes des anciens, la promotion d'actions de solidarit\u00e9 et maintient la p\u00e9rennit\u00e9 des contacts entre les membres de l'association. Ses repr\u00e9sentants dans les s\u00e9minaires \u00e0 Bruxelles sont Dominique Deshayes, Roy Edwards, Michel Fou- cault, Jeannine Franchomme, Evelyne Gratier-Soe- tewey et Nadine Wraith. Tous b\u00e9n\u00e9voles, ceux-ci sont porteurs d'une exp\u00e9rience tr\u00e8s riche qu'ils mettent \u00e0 la disposition des futurs pensionn\u00e9s. Inutile de souligner l'importance pour les participants aux s\u00e9minaires de pouvoir dialoguer avec des anciens coll\u00e8gues sur leur exp\u00e9rience, leurs conseils et l'aide qu'ils peuvent leur apporter dans la perspective de cette \u00e9tape essentielle que repr\u00e9sente le d\u00e9part \u00e0 la retraite.

Jusqu\u2019au 15 janvier, le Grand Palais consacre au cr\u00e9ateur de Tintin la plus importante r\u00e9trospective jamais vue de son travail \u00e0 Paris. Commission en direct passe en revue la carri\u00e8re de l\u2019auteur bruxellois, ses influences artistiques et ses c\u00e9l\u00e8bres personnages. FREIZEIT HERG\u00c9 \u00c0 PARIS HOMMAGE AU P\u00c8RE DU NEUVI\u00c8ME ART by Mar\u00eda Fern\u00e1ndez Garc\u00eda, CEND D ans une interview en 1969, Herg\u00e9 affirmait son espoir que la bande dessin\u00e9e aurait acquis \u00abdroit de cit\u00e9\u00bb au XXI\u00e8me si\u00e8cle. Son r\u00eave s\u2019est fait r\u00e9ali- t\u00e9. Cette saison au programme du Grand Palais, il c\u00f4toie Frida Kahlo et Diego Rivera, parmi d\u2019autres artistes. Cette monographie, r\u00e9alis\u00e9e en collaboration avec le Mus\u00e9e Herg\u00e9, rassemble \u00ab le plus grand corpus de docu- ments originaux jamais pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 sur Herg\u00e9 \u00bb, affirme son commissaire, J\u00e9r\u00f4me Neutres. Des centaines d\u2019\u0153uvres et de pi\u00e8ces permettent au visiteur de d\u00e9couvrir l\u2019artiste derri\u00e8re les aventures de Tintin dans une atmosph\u00e8re ludique. Ce personnage, n\u00e9 en 1929 dans les pages du Petit Vingti\u00e8me , est tr\u00e8s pr\u00e9sent tout au long du parcours. Mais il est accompagn\u00e9 par d\u2019autres comme Quick et Flupke, Jo, Zette et Jocko ou Totor. Des premi\u00e8res esquisses et planches jusqu\u2019aux couvertures, on constate toute la production derri\u00e8re les albums d\u2019Herg\u00e9, qui a vendu presque 250 millions d\u2019albums. L\u2019amateur d\u2019art L\u2019exposition emm\u00e8ne le visiteur jusqu\u2019aux sources de l\u2019inspiration d\u2019Herg\u00e9 pour montrer \u00ab les diff \u00e9 rents ressorts de son processus cr\u00e9atif \u00bb, d\u2019apr\u00e8s Neutres. On pr\u00e9sente le dessinateur en tant qu\u2019amateur d\u2019art, tout aussi bien des grands ma\u00eetres du pass\u00e9, comme Bosch ou Holbein, que des arts premiers ou des mouvements d\u2019avant-garde. Durant les ann\u00e9es 60, Herg\u00e9 se met \u00e0 collectionner des \u0153uvres contemporaines et fait m\u00eame une br\u00e8ve in- cursion dans la peinture. Les toiles expos\u00e9es t\u00e9moignent de sa passion pour des peintres comme Joan Mir\u00f3. On trouve aussi le portrait d\u2019Herg\u00e9 fait par Andy Warhol, qui a reconnu l\u2019empreinte laiss\u00e9e sur son \u0153uvre par le dessinateur belge. Dans l\u2019\u0153uvre d\u2019Herg\u00e9 il y a aussi un dialogue avec le cin\u00e9ma. Si le montage et le cadrage de ses dessins et les gestes de ses personnages ont une dette envers les films muets, ses albums auront \u00e9galement une influence sur de futurs r\u00e9alisateurs. M\u00eame Spielberg s\u2019est inspir\u00e9 de Tintin pour Indiana Jones. Une partie m\u00e9connue de la carri\u00e8re d\u2019Herg\u00e9, son acti- vit\u00e9 comme graphiste publicitaire, est aussi pr\u00e9sente. Une salle montre plusieurs affiches con\u00e7ues par l\u2019artiste, o\u00f9 l\u2019on retrouve la ligne claire des albums de Tintin. Tintin lui-m\u00eame, via son compte Twitter, a qualifi\u00e9 l\u2019expo de superbe. Et le capitaine Haddock, le person- nage pr\u00e9f\u00e9r\u00e9 d\u2019Herg\u00e9, s\u2019est mis \u00e0 renouveler son r\u00e9per- toire de plus de 200 jurons pour l\u2019occasion. Il suffit de le suivre et le mentionner avec le hashtag #capitaine- Haddock pour recevoir un tout nouveau juron. Comme il dirait: Tonnerre de Brest! , qu\u2019est-ce que vous attendez pour y aller?

        "58 The Solomon R. Guggenheim and Peggy Guggenheim Collections of New York and Venice are famous the world over and, until 12 February 2017, visitors can discover parts of these collections at the Brussels ING Art Centre. Commission en direct spoke to Patricia De Peuter, the centre's Head of Art Management. GUGGENHEIM. FULL ABSTRACTION ABSTRACT EXPRESSIONISM IN BRUSSELS by Nathalie Paulger, CEND \u201cT his year we are cel- ebrating the 30 th anniversary of the ING Art Centre and we wanted something special,\u201d explains Patricia. After two suc- cessful exhibitions in 2016 al- ready (Pop Art in Belgium and Next-Peter Kogler) , the Guggen- heim. Full Abstraction exhibition features works from artists never shown before in Brussels. Patricia stresses that, with so many post- war abstract artworks on show at the same time, this is a unique opportunity to get a good over- view of the period and to enjoy a display of a high artistic level. Speaking of the attacks in March leading to a decline in tourism and of the great security concerns surrounding the art pieces, she concludes \u201cthis means a lot for a city like Brussels.\u201d The exhibition is set up as a narrative that recon- structs relationships across the Atlantic through the mu- seums of two American collectors \u2013 Peggy Guggenheim and her uncle Solomon R. Guggenheim. A testament to the importance of the two collections, it confirms the crucial role they played in the history of 20 th Cen- tury art. Solomon Guggenheim, an American business- man and art collector, first opened a Museum of Non-Objective Painting in 1939. Four years later, he commissioned the design of the famous museum on Fifth Avenue, which opened in 1959 and was to carry his name following his death. Peggy Guggenheim, who opted for more wide-ranging collect- ing and was open to a variety of movements of her time, first operated a gallery in New York, before opening her museum in the Palazzo Venier dei Leoni in Venice in 1951. Opening with masterpieces by well-known artists like Du- champ and Max Ernst, the exhibition goes on to explore post-war developments on both sides of the Atlantic with the In- formalism of European masters such as Alberto Burri, Emilio Ve- dova, Lucio Fontana and Jean Dubuffet, and with work by leading figures on the American art scene from the 1940s to the 1960s: Jackson Pollock \u2013 with no fewer than fifteen works \u2013 Mark Rothko and Alexander Calder with the so-called \u2018mobiles and stabiles\u2019, along- side work by Willem de Kooning, Sam Francis, Robert Motherwell, Cy Twombly and others. Paintings, sculptures, engravings and photographs from the Guggenheim collections of New York and Venice, as well as from a small number of other muse- ums and collections are exhibited, offering the public the chance to admire and compare some of the great masterpieces which played a crucial role in defining the very concept of post-war 20 th Century art.

In March 1976, the European Parliament passed a unanimous resolution to found the European Community (now Union) Youth Orchestra, and a month later the European Commission assumed its official patronage. Since then, the orchestra has performed in more than 40 countries, 177 cities and 224 venues, including cities in all 28 EU Member States. (cid:2) Claudio Abbado, Founding Music Director of the EUYO, conducts the orchestra. When the European Parliament approved the creation of the EUYO, Lionel Bryer and Joy Bryer, respectively the Chairman and Secretary General of the International Youth Founda- tion of Great Britain, founded it. Two years later it launched its inaugural tour, conducted by Founding Music Director Claudio Abbado, with concerts in Amsterdam, Bonn, Paris, Lux- embourg, Brussels, Milan and Rome. During its first years, it performed under the baton of im- portant conductors such as Herbert von Karajan and Daniel Barenboim. (cid:2) The EUYO performs at the Davos World Economic Forum under the baton of Ivan Fischer. During its history, the EUYO has performed in many of the world's major concert halls, like the Royal Albert Hall, the Boston Symphony Hall, the Musikverein and Carnegie Hall. It is an ambassador of the European ideals of cultural unity and cooperation and, at the same time, it provides invaluable professional experience for young orchestral musicians aged 16-26, from the 28 EU Member States. (cid:2) Performance of the EUYO in Grafenegg, its Summer Home and Principal Venue Partner. The EUYO celebrates its 40 th anniversary with performances in every capital city of the EU\u2019s 28 Member States.
