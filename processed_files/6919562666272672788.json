The cooperation and verification mechanism and its related benchmarks were designed to allow Romania to demonstrate, on a regular basis, that it has made progress on reforming the judicial system and in fighting corruption. According to this report, Romania presents a mixed picture. It has put the fundamental elements of a function- ing system in place. In this regard, the Superior Council of Magistracy has been allocated the human and financial resources necessary to allow it to assume its core responsibilities for judicial reform. A number of steps have been taken with respect to the fight against high-level corruption. Romania is pursuing awareness-raising cam- paigns and continuing to introduce preventive measures to counteract local corruption. How- ever, the foundations of the Romanian judicial system are fragile and decisions on corruption are highly politicised. Commitment to reform by Romania\u2019s key institutions and bodies as well as with regard to different benchmarks is uneven. The Commission considers support to be more effective than sanctions and will not, at this point, invoke the safeguard provisions set out in the Accession Treaty. The continuation of the coop- eration and verification mechanism will be needed for some time. Romania has started to move in the right direction but more effort is still required. The Commission strongly encouraged Romania to intensify its reforms and to maintain its close cooperation with the other Member States and the Commission so that the significant remaining challenges can be tackled successfully together.

        "Institutional questions 10 Bull. EU 7/8-2008 related benchmarks were designed to allow Bul- garia to demonstrate, on a regular basis, that it has made progress on reforming the judicial sys- tem and in fighting corruption. According to this report, Bulgaria presents a mixed picture. Bul- garia has taken steps in the right direction such as the setting up of the State Agency for National Security, the proposed reform of the Ministry of Interior and the appointment of a deputy Prime Minister for coordinating the sound management of EU funds. However, delivering results, irre- spective of structural deficiencies, should be the first priority. This requires continued political will and determination. The assessment pointed out the serious difficulties which the Bulgarian authorities are facing in making real headway in judicial reform, the fight against corruption and organised crime. Despite the efforts of the Bul- garian government, progress has been slower and more limited than expected. The Commission considers support to be more effective than sanc- tions and will not, at this point, invoke the safe- guard provisions set out in the Accession Treaty. The continuation of the cooperation and verifica- tion mechanism will be needed for some time. The Commission strongly encouraged Bulgaria to intensify its reforms and to maintain its close cooperation with the other Member States and the Commission so that the significant remaining challenges can be tackled successfully together.

Since the French and Dutch rejection of the draft Constitutional Treaty, everyone agreed on the need to communicate Europe more effectively and the result of the Irish referendum showed that this willingness has yet to be translated into effective measures at national or European level. Inevitably, communicating Europe is a complex task: the European project has always had its detractors \u2014 those who want less Europe, those who want more, or those who want things to move forward faster. It is thus a struggle to communicate Europe in a balanced and understandable way. According to the Com- mittee, the aim is not to \u2018sell Europe\u2019, but to enable citizens to live in the European environ- ment and to take part in the choices that deter- mine the future direction of the EU with full knowledge of the facts. Communicating Europe is about conveying a political set-up which is without parallel in the history of mankind and about presenting a project. A balance must be struck between communicating that project, an area for which political authorities are responsi- ble, and providing the requisite information on what the institutions do, which is a matter for the individual institutions themselves and is targeted at the relevant sections of the public.

Parliament urged the Italian authorities to refrain from collecting fingerprints from Roma, includ- ing minors, and from using already collected fin- gerprints, pending the forthcoming announced evaluation by the Commission. It shared the con- cerns of Unicef and considers that it is inadmis- sible, with the aim of protecting children, to vio- late their fundamental rights and to criminalise them. Parliament called on Member States to take firm steps to protect unaccompanied minors sub- jected to exploitation, irrespective of their ethnic origin and nationality. It condemned utterly and without equivocation all forms of racism and dis- crimination faced by the Roma and others regarded as \u2018gypsies\u2019. Parliament called on the Council and the Commission to further strengthen EU policies on the Roma by launch- ing an EU Roma strategy to support and promote actions and projects by Member States and NGOs linked to the integration and inclusion of the Roma, particularly of Roma children. It reiterated the importance of developing strategies at EU and national level, making full use of the opportuni- ties provided by EU funds to: \u00a1 abolish Roma segregation in education; \u00a1 ensure equal access to quality education for Roma children; \u00a1 ensure and improve Roma access to labour markets; \u00a1 provide equal access to healthcare and social security benefits; \u00a1 combat discriminatory practices in the pro- vision of housing; \u00a1 and increase the participation of the Roma in social, economic, cultural and political life. 1.6.2.

It asked that Troy Davis\u2019 death sentence in the United States be commuted and, in view of the abundant evidence which might lead to such commutation, for the relevant courts to grant him a retrial. Parliament appealed urgently to the Georgia State Board of Pardons and Paroles to commute Troy Davis\u2019 death sentence.

European Economic and Social Commit- tee own-initiative opinion on the reasons for the difference between perceived inflation and actual inflation. Adopted by the European Economic and Social Committee on 10 July. The Committee noted that, since its launch, the single currency has been much criticised and is notably blamed for price rises. Nevertheless, it seems that price movements have been similar in the countries which do not have the single currency. Fur- thermore, since the introduction of the euro, only a few categories used to calculate the har- monised index of consumer prices show a marked acceleration in prices. The Committee explained the difference between perceived inflation and actual inflation using a combina- tion of socioeconomic and psychological expla- nations. It recommended that the Commission and/or the ECB publish figures at least once a year on the impact of inflation on household purchasing power in relation to levels of income. The Committee also hoped that the work being done at Eurostat to develop rigor- ous methods for incorporating changes in hous- ing costs into the inflation index would be com- pleted quickly. Member States as well as Eurostat were invited to make more use of the price data they collect in order to produce detailed indices breaking down price rises by category of distribution circuit and by category of products, ranking them according to whether they are bottom of the range, medium range or top of the range. Finally, the Committee rec- ommended supporting public institutions and NGOs which provide information for con- sumers.

Although not a participant in the third stage of economic and monetary union, the United King- dom is obliged, under Article 116(4) of the EC Treaty, to \u2018endeavour to avoid excessive deficits\u2019. In light of both the assessment contained in its report concerning the United Kingdom and of the opinion given by the Council\u2019s Economic and Financial Committee, the Commission considered that the government deficit is neither temporary nor exceptional and exceeds the reference value of 3% GDP. The Commission therefore advised the Council of the existence of an excessive deficit. SEC(2008) 2189; SEC(2008) 2194; SEC(2008) 2201 Formally adopted by the Council on 8 July . Hav- ing found that an excessive government deficit exists in the United Kingdom, the Council gave it a period of six months to take corrective meas- ures. The United Kingdom is required to put an end to its excessive deficit by the 2009\u201310 finan- cial year at the latest, with at least a 0.5% of GDP improvement in structural balance during the 2009\u201310 financial year.

Reference: Council opinion on the updated stabil- ity programme of Belgium 2006\u201310: OJ C 89, 24.4.2007; Bull. 3-2007, point 1.6.3 Commission proposal: SEC(2008) 2013; Bull. 6- 2007, point 1.7.8 Adopted by the Council on 8 July. After an impres- sive reduction in the debt ratio since 1993 to 85% in 2007, the programme envisages a continued and rapid reduction through a gradual build-up of headline surpluses following the budgetary dete- rioration in 2007, in order to reach a debt ratio of 71% of GDP in 2011. There are risks to the achievement of the budgetary targets particularly in view of the relatively favourable underlying macroeconomic assumptions for 2008 and 2009 regarding employment, wage and consumption growth, which may have led to an overestimation of tax revenue, and the fact that the programme does not specify measures seemingly required in order to meet the targets. Therefore, in the absence of additional measures, the adjustment to the medium-term objective in 2008 does not appear to be sufficient and it seems unlikely that it will be met in 2009 as planned. In addition, the budget- ary implementation in 2007 was not fully in line with the invitation in the Council opinion on the previous update of the stability programme. In view of this assessment the Council followed the Commission recommendation and invited Belgium to implement additional structural budgetary meas- ures to ensure that the objective of a balanced bud- get is met in 2008, given that there are no negative developments in terms of growth. Belgium should also ensure that the medium-term objective is obtained in 2009 by carrying out the benchmark adjustment in structural terms of 0.5% of GDP, including through the implementation of additional structural measures, in particular on the expendi- ture side. Moreover, in light of the still high level of debt and the projected increase in age-related expenditure, Belgium is invited to continue address- ing the long-term sustainability of public finances by achieving high structural primary surpluses as well as by implementing reforms to increase the employment rate and potential growth, and to con- tain the budgetary cost of ageing.

EU 7/8-2008 No 1466/97 on the updated convergence pro- gramme of Poland, 2006\u201309: Bull. 1/2-2007, point 1.6.18 Commission recommendation: SEC(2008) 2012; Bull. 6-2008, point 1.7.9 Adopted by the Council on 8 July. The macroeco- nomic scenario underlying the updated conver- gence programme of Poland envisages that real GDP growth will gradually decrease from 6.5% in 2007 to 5.2% on average over the rest of the programme period. This scenario appears to be based on plausible growth assumptions. Neverthe- less, the programme\u2019s projections for inflation appear to be reflecting slightly favourable assump- tions on import prices and a relatively low increase in nominal compensation per employee and so seem to be optimistic. Following the correction of the general government deficit in 2007 and while the deficit and the debt will remain below the ref- erence values of respectively 3% and 60% of GDP, the programme envisages a deterioration of the general government balance by 0.5 percentage points of GDP in 2008 and a back-loaded progress towards the medium-term objective (MTO) in the following years in a context of favourable growth prospects. Given the risks to the budgetary targets from 2009, mainly due to a lack of specified meas- ures, the MTO may not be achieved by 2011 as planned in the programme. Moreover, should infla- tionary pressures emerge, a tighter fiscal stance than foreseen in the programme would be required. As regards the long-term sustainability of public finances, Poland appears to be at low risk, but the early retirement system is in need of reform. In view of this assessment and the need to ensure sustainable public finances, the Council followed the Commission proposal. It invited Poland to exploit the favourable growth conditions to strengthen the pace of structural adjustment towards the MTO, including in light of possible inflationary pressures, by using any extra revenue and unspent resources for deficit reduction in 2008 and by spec- ifying and implementing measures in the following years, especially on the expenditure side.

Parliament welcomed the fact that 10 years after the launch of the EMU, both the ECB and the euro are well respected and generally accepted within the global economy. It believed that the ECB had been strengthened by its successful handling of the current financial crisis and highlighted the increased need for cooperation between central banks and supervisory authorities in order to uphold stability in the financial markets. Parlia- ment reiterated its call for more transparency in the ECB but appreciated the improvements that had already been implemented in this area. It called on the ECB to present its ideas for reform- ing the structure of the governing council, as the number of governors is expected to exceed 15 ",

Finally, Parliament noted a steady rise in the status of the euro as an international currency but pointed out that the EU\u2019s representation concerning economic and monetary affairs in international forums poorly reflected the true economic weight of the euro area and therefore called for concrete steps to be taken towards a unified euro area represen- tation within international financial institutions.

Reference: Commission communication on a com- mon European approach to sovereign wealth funds: COM(2008) 115; Bull. 1/2-2008, point 1.7.18 Adopted by the Parliament on 9 July. Parliament considered that sovereign wealth funds (SWFs) had not caused any disruption of capital markets, but that their structure, size and rapid growth call for a careful analysis of their role and influence. It was concerned that the lack of transparency of certain SWFs may not allow a proper under- standing of their structure and motivation. It wel- comed the Commission communication and asked it to work closely with the IMF and the OECD to establish a global code of conduct. Par- liament also invited the Commission to monitor SWFs activities and play a coordinating role in order to ensure that national initiatives do not counter the commitment to openness to invest- ments or endanger the EU\u2019s position on global markets. It requested the Council and the Com- mission to conduct an in-depth analysis of the functioning of the global financial markets and to define and promote a strong EU vision, taking into account global initiatives, of what should be the principles and rules guiding their functioning.

During the period 2000\u201307, 19 decisions were approved for a total amount of EUR 1 085 million. The Balkan coun- tries (Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, the for- mer Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Kosovo, Montenegro and Serbia) have benefited from 13 assistance decisions of the Council. This makes the Balkan countries the main beneficiaries of MFA with a total of assistance amounting to a maximum of EUR 783 million out of 1 085 mil- lion. Two decisions were adopted by the Council in 2007 to the benefit of Moldova and Lebanon. Disbursements of MFA amounted to EUR 20 mil- lion for Moldova. In addition, thanks to opera- tional assessments, the Commission has noticed real improvements at all levels in the public finance management of the beneficiary countries. COM(2008) 520 ",

The results of the pilot studies on statistics on the import and export of waste confirmed the need for such statistics for the purpose of monitoring Community waste policy. The current provi- sions of Regulation (EC) No 2150/2002 do not describe the requirements for statistics on the import and export of waste in sufficient detail. The Commission should therefore propose spec- ifications for these statistics by way of a proposal amending Annex I of the above regulation. With regard to statistics on waste generated by agri- culture, hunting, forestry and fisheries, the pilot studies concluded that no additional implement- ing measures were necessary. The current Com- munity statistical legislation on waste is suffi- ciently detailed to cover waste generated by these economic activities. COM(2008) 501 ",

Accord- ing to the Commission, technological advances, globalisation and an ageing population are chang- ing European societies. Europeans are living longer, healthier lives in new family configura- tions and working patterns. At the same time stark realities remain: too many people are inac- tive or unemployed and too many young people leave school early, and as a result, there are still too many people living in poverty (especially children and older people) and in social isolation. Change is rapid and policies need to keep pace, responding innovatively and flexibly to the chal- lenges of globalisation, technological advances and demographic developments. The Commis- sion underlined that this renewed social agenda is such a response and it shows how the goals of opportunities, access and solidarity will be trans- lated into concrete actions. This communication covers the package adopted on 2 and 3 July. It contains 19 initiatives in the areas of employment and social affairs, education and youth, health, information society, and economic affairs. The initiatives are centred on the following priorities: \u00a1 preparing for tomorrow: children and youth; \u00a1 investing in people: managing change; \u00a1 supporting longer and healthier lives; \u00a1 fighting discrimination; \u00a1 strengthening instruments; \u00a1 shaping the international agenda; \u00a1 combating poverty and social exclusion. It is an integrated policy response, complement- ing the Lisbon strategy and demonstrating a com- mitment to delivering results for citizens. It shows that European values remain at the core of EU policies and are an integral part of the EU response to globalisation. It reflects this Com- mission\u2019s strong commitment to the social dimen- sion, already set out in its strategic objectives in 2005 and is an essential contribution to wider efforts to make the Union economically strong, socially responsible and secure. This agenda, including its actions and instruments will be reviewed together with the Lisbon strategy for the post-2010 period. COM(2008) 412 Employment 1.9.2.

This com- munication is part of the Commission communi- cation on a \u2018Renewed social agenda: Opportuni- ties, access and solidarity in 21st century Europe\u2019. It proposes the reinforcement of one of the most important instruments in support of social development in the EU and Member States, i.e. the open method of coordination in the field of social protection and social inclusion (\u2018social OMC\u2019). This method, launched in 2000 as a voluntary self-evaluating process, based on common objectives, complements a compre- hensive mix of legislation, financial instruments (including the ESF) and coordination processes (particularly the Lisbon strategy) that have sup- ported social cohesion and solidarity within the EU. However, delivery on common objec- tives (fighting poverty and social exclusion, ensuring pension adequacy and sustainability, ensuring equitable access to health- and long- term care) remains a challenge. An open coordi- nation process, based on voluntary cooperation between numerous and diverse Member States, cannot, by definition, produce large-scale results in a limited period of time. This communica- tion proposes to strengthen the social OMC by improving its visibility and working methods, strengthening its interaction with other policies, reinforcing its analytical tools and evidence base, and enhancing ownership in Member States through peer review, mutual learning and involve- ment of all relevant actors. COM(2008) 418 1.9.11. European Economic and Social Commit- tee exploratory opinion on the integration of minorities \u2014 Roma. Adopted by the European Economic and Social Committee on 9 July. The Committee considers ",
        "Employment and social policy Bull. EU 7/8-2008 27 that integration of minorities, especially Roma, requires: \u00a1 a legal basis for action that builds on the acquis as well as on the pertinent areas of the open method of coordination (education, employ- ment, social protection and social inclusion); \u00a1 a coherent and long-term umbrella policy strategy from the Commission; \u00a1 a structured, transparent and sustainable cooperation between all organised civil society players and the promotion of capacity building for NGOs; \u00a1 the active responsible involvement of the Roma representatives in the process; \u00a1 a responsible institutionalised platform struc- ture for the practical implementation of specific steps; \u00a1 a positive action programme to be developed around education, training and employment, including self-employment. Additionally, the Committee called for the estab- lishment of a Jean Monnet chair of Romani (the Roma language) and Roma culture. The Com- mittee considers that only by persuading the Roma community, especially the male leaders, can positive developments be achieved. This requires investments in the training of Roma. The European Structural Funds could be used in this context. 1.9.12. European Parliament resolution on the census of the Roma on the basis of ethnicity in Italy ( \u2192 point 1.6.1).

Accord- ing to the Commission, today the EU has one of the most advanced non-discrimination legal frameworks in the world. But while much progress has been made, many Europeans still feel that discrimination continues to be wide- spread. Drawing on the successful implementa- tion of the 2005 framework strategy against dis- crimination and the 2007 European Year of Equal Opportunities for All and the contributions received from the European institutions, civil society and the social partners, this communica- tion presents a comprehensive approach to step up action against discrimination and promote equal opportunities. In particular, this communi- cation is accompanied by a proposal for a new directive prohibiting discrimination on grounds of age, disability, sexual orientation and religion or belief outside the employment sphere. This landmark proposal opens the way for the com- pletion of the legal framework for Europe-wide action against all forms of discrimination as pro- vided for in Article 13 of the TEC. The Com- mission also considered that better legislative protection against discrimination must be accom- panied by an active strategy to promote non- discrimination and equal opportunities. So this communication also proposes actions to give new impetus to the dialogue on non-discrimination policy and to make more effective use of the available instruments, both in general and with particular emphasis on promoting the social inclusion of Roma, given the particular discrim- ination problems they face.

The aim of this proposal is to implement the principle of equal treatment between persons irrespective of religion or belief, disability, age or sexual orien- tation outside the labour market. It sets out a framework for the prohibition of discrimination on these grounds and establishes a uniform min- imum level of protection within the EU for peo- ple facing such discrimination. This proposal supplements the existing EC legal framework under which the prohibition of discrimination on grounds of religion or belief, disability, age or sexual orientation applies only to employment, occupation and vocational training. It covers access to goods and services, social protection, healthcare and education. It only addresses com- mercial transactions and does not cover purely private transactions between individuals.

This United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and its optional protocol were adopted on 13 December 2006 by the United Nations General Assembly. On the basis of negotiating directives, the Com- mission conducted the negotiation of the conven- tion on behalf of the European Community. The Council decision authorised the Community to sign the convention and issued a declaration on the optional protocol (Annex II of the decision) stating that the Council shall reconsider the ques- tion of signing the said protocol as soon as pos- sible. The Commission signed the convention on 30 March 2007. On 3 May 2008, the convention and its optional protocol entered into force. Since the optional protocol has not yet been signed, its accession should be proposed. Two proposals, one for concluding the convention, the other for acceding to the optional protocol, are therefore required. COM(2008) 530 Labour law and industrial relations 1.9.16.

According to Article 138 of the EC Treaty, the Commission consulted management and labour on the advisability of developing the existing Community acquis by adapting, consol- idating or complementing it in the light of the Maritime Labour Convention, 2006. The social partners requested that the Commission propose a Council directive giving effect to their agree- ment and its Annex A under EU law, in accor- dance with Article 139 of the EC Treaty. This proposal responds to this request. It aims to implement the agreement on the Maritime Labour Convention 2006 concluded by the ECSA and ETF and thereby aims to amend Council Direc- tive 1999/63/EC, the scope of the amendments being limited to matters regulated by the Mar- itime Labour Convention 2006.

European works councils (EWCs) represent almost 15 mil- lion employees and are an important tool for anticipating and managing change responsibly in transnational undertakings, particularly through their ability to involve employees. However, all too often their potential remains untapped. In addition to promoting best practices for manage- ment and labour, which the EU continues to strongly support, the proposal aims to ensure that the legal framework for EWCs meets the follow- ing objectives: \u00a1 ensuring the effectiveness of employees\u2019 transnational information and consultation rights, which is currently lacking in a significant frac- tion of situations; \u00a1 increasing the number of established EWCs; \u00a1 resolving the problems encountered in the practical application of the directive and reme- dying the lack of legal certainty resulting from some of its provisions or the absence of certain provisions; \u00a1 improving the coherence of the Community legislative instruments on the information and consultation of employees by taking account of the definitions and provisions in the most recent legislation in this area and by linking the instru- ments more closely. The proposal takes account of the opinions of management and labour on the guidelines and content of the planned Community initiative and the results of the impact assessment which was carried out.

The Committee considers that a new European social action programme (ESAP) is needed so that EU social developments can keep pace with economic and market developments. The new ESAP should promote, in tangible and practi- cal ways, EU social policy goals and ambitions well beyond 2010 and be a comprehensive policy roadmap of action. Social dialogue remains one of the main pillars and should be reinforced. The pro- gramme should reconnect with citizens and organ- ised civil society and should specifically address policy areas such as: quality of life; fundamental social rights; empowering people; social solidar- ity; employment and work of high quality; socie- tal entrepreneurship; management of change; pro- motion of core social standards in EU external relations, especially in the area of trade.

The Community strategy on gender equality was adopted in 2000 and a Community programme was drawn up in 2001 to support the imple- mentation of the framework strategy. In accor- dance with Article 12 of the programme decision, the Commission presented a final eval- uation report on the framework strategy and the programme. According to this report, the pro- gramme has demonstrated its value through its ability to support the implementation of the equality objectives and to strengthen the coor- dination mechanisms and governance at Euro- pean level. The measures that have supported the promotion of values and improved under- standing of equality questions are very useful for Community action. However, the Commis- sion considered that, despite this positive assessment, major gender inequalities still per- sist and there are still many challenges to be taken up. COM(2008) 503 ",

The study reached the con- clusion that, while not undergoing a structural modification, the internal market seems to be defined in a more social way. The Lisbon Treaty seems to give the internal market more social aims by working towards \u2018a social market economy, aiming at full employment and social progress\u2019. The legislative process relative to the internal mar- ket will be marked by the intervention of national parliaments. The Lisbon Treaty also evolves towards a general use of the \u2018ordinary legislative procedure\u2019 (co-decision under Article 251 of the EC Treaty) for the internal market, as witnessed by its Article 48 on measures in the area of social security necessary for the free movement of labour. 1.11.2. Report from the Commission to the Coun- cil on the review of the transitional measures for the acquisition of agricultural real estate set out in the 2003 Accession Treaty. Adopted by the Commission on 16 July. The report reached the following conclusions. \u00a1 Despite the temporary restrictions, a consid- erable foreign presence in the form of rented agri- cultural land in the seven Member States that joined the Union in 2004 has been accommo- dated without any visible shock to the system and could even be seen as helping to resolve some institutional restraints such as unfinished privati- sations and costly transfer procedures. This for- eign presence may have a positive influence on agricultural reform, by introducing new tech- nologies and providing much-needed capital for production. \u00a1 The gap between these seven Member States and the EU-15 in terms of income and land prices has declined over recent years. However, prices are still far from complete convergence, though this would neither be expected nor seen as a nec- essary condition for terminating the derogations. There is also a marked but smaller price diver- gence within the EU-15, albeit at a higher aver- age price level. \u00a1 Socioeconomic conditions for agricultural production have improved and this positive trend is expected to continue. However, a large gap in productivity remains between the seven Member States and the EU-15. COM(2008) 461 1.11.3.

This system is based on the 1875 Paris Con- vention and is regularly updated by the general conference on weights and measures. Freedom to provide services and freedom of establishment Financial services 1.11.8. Council conclusions on financial markets. Adopted by the Council on 8 July. The Council reviewed recent market developments and progress made in the implementation of the roadmap on the financial market turmoil. Concerning: \u00a1 market transparency, the Council welcomed the: \u2014 CEBS\u2019 reports; \u2014 guidance provided by CEBS; \u2014 initiatives undertaken by the industry to improve transparency for investors, markets and regulators of securitised markets; \u00a1 the role of rating agencies: the Council wel- comed the revision by IOSCO of its code of con- duct at the international level. It considers that the revisions provide for a minimum benchmark for the actions that credit rating agencies should take to address concerns about their activities in the market for structured products. The Council also supported the principle envisaged by the Com- mission according to which the rating agencies should be subject to an EU registration system. 1.11.9. European Economic and Social Commit- tee opinion on the White Paper on the integration of EU mortgage credits markets. White Paper: OJ C 106, 26.4.2008; COM(2007) 807; Bull. 12-2007, point 1.10.7 Reference: Green Paper \u2014 \u2018Financial services policy 2005\u201310\u2019: COM(2005) 629; Bull. 12-2005, point 1.3.20 Adopted by the European Economic and Social Committee on 9 July. According to the Commit- tee, it would be interesting to develop a proposal which would consist in adopting an interpretative scheme for mortgage credit that subdivides each loan transaction into a portfolio of two passive components: \u00a1 firstly, an asset-backed loan, the value of which is based on the market price and possible property value fluctuations; \u00a1 secondly, a prospective loan (personal loan), the value of which is based on the borrower\u2019s economic/financial capacity and prospects. Adopting a twin-mortgage system could have a number of advantages to be verified during fur- ther analysis, including: \u00a1 simplifying the risk assessment of the rational aspect of the transaction (asset-backed loan) vis-\u00e0-vis the risks associated with the mort- gagee\u2019s solvency (prospective personal loan); \u00a1 the possibility of establishing transparent prices that reflect the various risk levels repre- sented by the two components of the loan trans- action (objective asset-backed loan and subjec- tive personal loan); \u00a1 reducing the adverse impact on the financial system in the event of mortgage defaults by an excessive number of borrowers, contrary to the impact recently experienced by the financial mar- ket (i.e. the sub-prime mortgage credit crisis). 1.11.10.

In the White Paper on investment funds, the Commis- sion undertook to tackle observed problems by issuing proposals that would introduce new man- agement and cost-saving opportunities, while resolving shortcomings with existing provisions of the directive. This proposal translates this com- mitment in the form of a proposal for amend- ments to the UCITS directive that will: \u00a1 remove administrative obstacles and delays to the cross-border marketing of funds by over- hauling the current notification procedure; \u00a1 improve the quality and usefulness of prod- uct disclosure to retail investors; \u00a1 introduce provisions for fund mergers and allow fund managers to create \u2018master-feeder\u2019 structures with the aim to centralise management of assets gathered through local funds; \u00a1 strengthen supervisory powers and supervi- sory cooperation.

Reference: Council conclusions on clearing and settlement (Target2-Securities project): Bull. 1/2- 2007, point 1.10.8 Officially launched by the European Central Bank on 17 July. Target2-Securities (T2S) is a platform which will centralise the settlement of euro-denominated securities (the system will also be open to other currencies) between participat- ing entities. T2S will thus contribute to the elim- ination of the distinction between domestic and cross-border settlement between those entities. The purpose of the platform is to be offered as a service to central securities depositories and to be managed by the Eurosystem (the ECB and the national central banks of the Member States that have the euro as their currency). T2S will lower the costs of securities settlement and remove a number of barriers and exploit economies of scale amongst the participating entities. IP/08/1193 Taxation Direct taxation 1.11.12. Proposal for a Council directive on the common system of taxation applicable to merg- ers, divisions, partial divisions, transfers of assets and exchanges of shares concerning companies of different Member States and to the transfer of the registered office of an SE or SCE between Member States (codified version).

The pur- pose of this proposal is to undertake a codifica- tion of Council Directive 90/434/EEC.

In this context, Annex III to the VAT directive, which contains the list of goods and services eligible for reduced rates, will in future also include the following issues: \u00a1 the whole housing sector, including: fur- bishing, construction, renovation, repairing and cleaning; renovation, repairing, transformation, maintenance and cleaning services relating to places of worship, cultural heritage and histori- cal monuments recognised by the Member State concerned; \u00a1 restaurant and catering services; \u00a1 locally supplied services: labour intensive services for which the reduced rates experiment expires on 31 December 2010; gardening, land- scaping services and maintenance of gardens; minor repair of movable tangible property, as well as their cleaning and maintenance (ironing, laundry); home care services (directed at chil- dren, elderly persons and disabled persons) per- sonal care (hairdressers, beauticians, etc.).

The pro- posed directive foresees a gradual increase in the EU minimum taxation levels on cigarettes and fine-cut tobacco up to 2014. It also updates the definitions of different types of tobacco products so as to remove loopholes which allow certain cigarettes or fine-cut tobacco to be presented as cigars, cigarillos or pipe tobacco and therefore to benefit from a lower tax rate. It will also make the taxation rules more transparent, thereby creating a level playing field for manufacturers and giving flexibility to Member States to set minimum taxes.

COM(2008) 460 Industrial and intellectual property 1.11.17. Proposal for a European Parliament and Council directive amending Directive 2006/116/ EC of the European Parliament and of the Coun- cil on the term of protection of copyright and related rights. Directive to be amended : Directive 2006/116/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council: OJ L 372, 27.12.2006; Bull. 12-2006, point 1.10.21 References: Commission communication \u2014 \u2018An industrial property rights strategy for Europe\u2019: COM(2008) 465; point 1.11.18 of this Bulletin Green Paper \u2014 \u2018Copyright in the knowledge economy\u2019: COM(2008) 466; point 1.11.19 of this Bulletin Adopted by the Commission on 16 July. This pro- posal aims to improve the social situation of per- formers and in particular session musicians, tak- ing into account that performers are increasingly outliving the existing 50-year period of protec- tion for their performances. An early expiry of copyright protection would mean that performers would lose their principal income streams just as they are about to retire. This loss of income would affect both featured performers (those who receive contractual royalties) and the thousands of anonymous session musicians (those who do not receive royalties and rely solely on statutory remuneration claims). In particular those musi- cians who assigned their exclusive rights to the phonogram producer against a flat-fee payment (\u2018buy out\u2019) would be negatively affected: their statutory claims to \u2018single equitable remunera- tion\u2019 for broadcasting and communication to the public, which are never assigned to the phono- gram producer, would cease. This proposal there- fore consists of extending the term of protection for performers and phonogram producers from 50 to 95 years. In order to achieve the right bal- ance between the benefits of record companies and featured artists and the genuine social needs of session musicians, the proposal contains cer- tain accompanying measures such as establishing a fund for session musicians and introducing UIOLI (use it or lose it) clauses in contracts between performers and phonogram producers that would be triggered in the extended period beyond the initial 50 years.

The Green Paper concentrates on how research, sci- ence and educational materials are disseminated to the public and whether knowledge is circulat- ing freely in the internal market. It focuses on both the creation and the dissemination of knowl- edge for research, science and education and on the current legal framework in the area of copy- right, the role of the European publishing indus- try and the legal framework enforceable to vari- ous users (social institutions, museums, search engines, disabled people, teaching establish- ments). The Green Paper addresses the following issues: \u00a1 the development of existing exceptions and limitations in a digital environment; \u00a1 the role of libraries, museums and archives in the digital environment, the remit of the current exception for the benefit of these establishments; \u00a1 issues involving online access for disabled people; \u00a1 exceptions for teaching and research; \u00a1 user-created content. The Green Paper is the starting point for a struc- tured debate on the long-term future of copyright policy and points to future challenges in fields that have not been a focal point up to now, such as scientific and scholarly publications, as well as the role of libraries, researchers and disabled persons.

The aim of this communication is to present the Commis- sion\u2019s strategy to support an integrated approach in the EU and internationally to further sustain- able consumption and production and to promote its sustainable industrial policy. This strategy complements existing environmental policies with regard to energy use. The challenge is to cre- ate a virtuous circle: improving the overall envi- ronmental performance of products throughout their life-cycle, promoting and stimulating the demand of better products and production tech- nologies, and helping consumers to make better choices.

The Council considers that the ongoing review of the IASCF (International Accounting Standards Committee Foundation) constitution offers an important opportunity to introduce changes to further enhance the legitimacy and acceptability of inter- national accounting standards developed by the IASB (International Accounting Standards Board). It welcomed the proposals that have been made in this direction by the IASCF and consid- ers that the further reform of the IASCF and the IASB\u2019s governance and public accountability should be made according to the following key principles: \u00a1 the public accountability of the IASCF should be enhanced through the creation of an effective monitoring board, which should have sufficient powers to provide the necessary oversight of the IASCF; \u00a1 the monitoring board should be composed of relevant authorities responsible for public interest related to the adoption and endorsement of account- ing standards in their respective jurisdictions; \u00a1 the IASB must achieve greater transparency and legitimacy of its standard-setting and agenda- setting processes; \u00a1 members of the IASB should reflect an appropriate balance of practical and technical expertise, as well as a diversity of geographical experience in order to contribute to the develop- ment of high quality, global accounting standards; \u00a1 the Council emphasised the urgency of enhancing the EU\u2019s ability to contribute in a timely and consistent manner to the international accounting debate. The Council urged all parties concerned to finalise these arrangements before the end of 2008. 1.13.4.

The aim of the recast of framework Directive 2005/32/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council, referred to as the \u2018ecodesign directive\u2019, is to incorporate amending Directive 2008/28/EC and to extend its scope to allow for the setting of Community ecodesign requirements also for energy-related products. In doing so, it follows the overall objective to ensure free movement of products and improve their environmental per- formance, thereby protecting the environment. Establishing a single framework for the ecode- sign of energy-related products will ensure effi- ciency and consistency by using a common methodology. It will thus avoid the risk of over- lapping national and Community initiatives. COM(2008) 399 1.13.5.

Adopted by the Commission on 12 August. This report describes the progress in restructuring made by Bulgarian and Romanian steel compa- nies. Although state aids for restructuring the steel industry are expressly forbidden under EU law, the EU agreed on transitional arrangements for according certain aids which would allow these new Member States to complete this task while minimising social and market disturbance. In both countries, existing plants are being mod- ernised so as to adapt production to the quality of steel required by the EU and export markets. Changes in management structures took place in parallel with the ongoing concentration processes, especially in Romania. However, in spite of these efforts, the Commission has identified delays, sometimes significant, in the implementation of the obligations and requirements as specified in the respective decisions and protocols. It consid- ers it necessary to intensify the restructuring process so as to enable the beneficiary compa- nies to achieve viability in 2008. COM(2008) 511 Capital goods industry Maritime 1.13.12.

European Economic and Social Com- mittee opinion on developments in the construc- tion sector in Europe. Adopted by the European Economic and Social Committee on 9 July. According to the Commit- tee, the future of the construction industry will depend less on the public spending it receives (although greater continuity in programming would definitely not go amiss) than on the abil- ity of the relevant authorities to work out a regu- latory framework, applicable to all, that ensures maximum transparency in competition and the best use of the potential and know-how of busi- nesses of every size. Accordingly, the Commit- tee mainly recommends: ",
        "Enterprise 46 Bull. EU 7/8-2008 \u00a1 putting in place unified tender procedures by means of regulations as soon as possible; espe- cially in the public sector, such procedures should give clients as broad and clear-cut a choice as possible, so that they can choose contractual tools to suit their needs; \u00a1 giving construction professionals regulatory scope to substantially contribute to the challenges of sustainable development: through the use of the overall costs approach, public\u2013private part- nerships of all sizes, and financing based on expected performance; \u00a1 making major efforts to promote training for trades accounting for a substantial percentage of European jobs which are not at risk of relocation; \u00a1 promoting sustainable construction activity in the EU; \u00a1 maintaining a healthy economic environment and employment conditions in line with people\u2019s needs in the countries where they work; \u00a1 boosting European competitiveness.

The Committee considers it advisable to minimise this negative financial impact on SMEs. It welcomed the introduction of a differ- entiated regime based on the risk assessment of substances classified as carcinogenic, mutagenic or reprotoxic (CMR).

The Committee approved the pro- posal to amend Directives 2001/82/EC and 2001/83/EC, recognising that these amendments ensure the harmonisation of the rules regulating all medicinal products, a high level of public health protection and the efficient functioning of the internal market, whilst also eliminating unnecessary administrative and financial burdens for businesses. As in previous opinions on this issue, the Committee supported and even encour- aged the Commission\u2019s efforts to improve the safety of medicinal products, a fundamental fac- tor in safeguarding human and animal health. It is therefore in favour of harmonising the rules regulating all medicinal products regardless of authorisation procedures through a simple leg- islative amendment, thereby simultaneously elim- inating any future obstacles to free trade in such products. While in favour of modifying the legal basis, the Committee awaits the legislative pro- posal currently being drafted, believing it to be of greater significance to the future of the pharma- ceutical sector.

The Committee welcomed the Community-level establishment of har- monised standards for the type-approval of hydrogen-powered vehicles and endorsed the choice of a single Community procedure to be valid in all Member States as this is simpler and much less burdensome than 27 different type- approval systems. It urged the Commission to start work now on examining the issue of distri- bution network coverage, as safe and efficient storage and adequate distribution systems are essential elements in the dissemination of vehi- cles powered by gas mixes. The Committee con- siders that steps must be taken to restore the con- fidence of future users and dispel the doubts that still surround hydrogen use. It invited the Com- mission to reconsider its proposal to label hydro- gen-powered cars, as this could be seen as crim- inalising them in some way, identifying them as \u2018dangerous\u2019, whereas their safety test results are on a par with those for cars powered by other fuels.

Directive to be amended: Council Directive 76/769/EEC on the approximation of the laws, reg- ulations and administrative provisions of the Mem- ber States relating to restrictions on the marketing and use of certain dangerous substances and prepa- rations: OJ L 262, 27.9.1976, as amended by Directive 2007/51/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council: OJ L 257, 3.10.2007; Bull. 9- 2007, point 1.12.18 References: Council Directive 98/24/EC on the protection of the health and safety of workers from the risks related to chemical agents at work: OJ L 131, 5.5.1998; Bull. 4-1998, point 1.2.14 Regulation (EC) No 1907/2006 of the European Parliament and of the Council concerning the reg- istration, evaluation, authorisation and restriction of chemicals (REACH), establishing a European Chemicals Agency, amending Directive 1999/ 45/EC and repealing Council Regulation (EEC) No 793/93 and Commission Regulation (EC) No 1488/94 as well as Council Directive 76/769/ EEC and Commission Directives 91/155/EEC, 93/67/EEC, 93/105/EC and 2000/21/EC: OJ L 396, 30.12.2006; Bull. 12-2006, point 1.12.17 Commission proposal: OJ C 4, 9.1.2008; COM(2007) 559; Bull. 10-2007, point 1.12.18 Endorsed by the Parliament (first reading) on 9 July, subject to certain amendments relating to Annex I. So, Parliament considers that, in order to protect consumers, it is necessary to restrict the placing on the market and use of preparations con- taining 2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethanol (DEGME), 2-(2-butoxyethoxy)ethanol (DEGBE), methyl- enediphenyl diisocyanate (MDI) and cyclohexane during specific applications. Services 1.13.21. European Economic and Social Com- mittee exploratory opinion on developments in the business service sector in Europe. Reference: European Economic and Social Com- mittee opinion on services and European manu- facturing industries: interactions and impacts on employment, competitiveness and productivity: Bull. 9-2006, point 1.12.16 Adopted by the European Economic and Social Committee on 9 July. The Committee felt that there is an urgent need for a genuine change and broadening of focus towards services, which ",
        "Enterprise Bull. EU 7/8-2008 49 should no longer be considered as a mere appen- dix to the manufacturing industry. Society is undergoing great changes and services lie at the centre of these changes. Given the broad range of possible actions in policy areas related to busi- ness services, it is of the utmost importance that these actions be prioritised, which, according to the Committee, should be established in the fol- lowing order: \u00a1 action on business services policies and a high-level group. The Committee recommended that a high-level group on business services be set up; \u00a1 labour market policies in business services. An in-depth examination is required at sectoral level of the challenges being created by the new types of employment generated by interactions between business services and manufacturing industry; \u00a1 business services in innovation policies. R & D and innovation programmes and actions for service innovation should be strongly pro- moted; \u00a1 business services standards development. Enterprises should be encouraged to help estab- lish standards through self-regulation after a thor- ough consultation with users of business services; \u00a1 promoting service science as a new discipline in education and training; \u00a1 the internal market and regulation affecting business services. The Committee has identified a list of areas that need to be tackled in order to bring about simplification, clarification and a reduction of regulatory burdens; \u00a1 further improvements in business services statistics. Member States are recommended to collaborate more in order to improve statistics on business services. Tourism 1.13.22. European Economic and Social Com- mittee opinion on the communication from the Commission: Agenda for a sustainable and com- petitive European tourism. Commission communication: OJ C 4, 9.1.2008; COM(2007) 621; Bull. 10-2007, point 1.12.21 Adopted by the European Economic and Social Committee on 9 July. The Committee welcomed and commended the Commission communication and supported the pledge to consolidate tourism policy and strategy for the next few years in a coherent manner by means of the agenda, thereby enabling them to be put into practice on a daily basis. It once again proposed and recommended boosting the European tourism forum and push- ing forwards with discussions and a study on set- ting up a European tourism board and a European tourism agency. Although the communication takes account of the social factors that shape tourism, the Committee regretted the absence of any reference to the concept and reality of Euro- pean citizenship. According to it, in the process of making tourism more competitive and sus- tainable, account should be taken of destinations\u2019 specific features. Therefore, the Committee rec- ommended that attention be paid to the specific features of those Member States that are heavily dependent on tourism. ",

The EAEC and the Department of Energy of the United States of America (USDOE) have been cooperating together since 1982 in order to improve and strengthen the methodologies and technologies necessary for the implementation of nuclear safeguards. In 1995, the agreement was amended to include the commitment of the two partners to coordinate their respective activities in support of third countries. The development of the Tacis programme and the success of this collaboration led both partners to widen the field of their cooperation in numerous areas, covering other activities related to research, development and training in the field of nuclear security. The Commission considers that this broadening of the scope necessitates an appropriate legal framework. In the light of the above, the Coun- cil is invited to take a decision authorising the Commission to open and conduct negotiations with the USDOE on a widening of the 1995 agreement.

The Committee called on the EU to adopt an integrated approach for a bet- ter integration of islands in the internal market as a key factor to enhance the cohesion and growth of the Union and thereby to fully achieve the objectives of the revised Lisbon agenda. Such an integrated approach is justified insofar as, despite their differences (particularly as regards their sizes), islands face common key problems. The Committee underlined the need for sound gover- nance to cope with problems such as: informa- tion and communication; quantification and qual- ification of data; a common strategic vision; networking and clustering or civil society partic- ipation. At the implementation level, the Com- mittee called for carrying out an impact assess- ment on islands for any EU initiative for the internal market, including an \u2018island touch\u2019 in all EU policies and implementing the simplification of administrative tasks, especially for SMEs. Because accessibility is a key issue for islands, the Committee stressed the quality of territorial continuity. Such a tool should be more developed in the EU. Its use must be operated from the islands to the continent and not the contrary. European Union Solidarity Fund 1.16.2.

It concluded that in gen- eral the management of the fund is efficient, but considers that there is room and need for a speed- ier management and therefore urged Member States to carefully assess the validity of applica- tions before presenting them to the Commission. It welcomed the Commission\u2019s commitment not to present preliminary amending budgets to the budget authority in order to activate the fund together with other budgetary changes as this may cause a delay in the adoption of the proposal.

Proposal for a Council regulation amend- ing Regulation (EC) No 3/2008 on information provision and promotion measures for agricul- tural products on the internal market and in third countries. Regulation to be amended: Council Regulation (EC) No 3/2008: OJ L 3, 5.1.2008; Bull. 12-2007, point 1.18.4 Adopted by the Commission on 7 July. Council Regulation (EC) No 3/2008 has appreciably sim- plified the administrative procedures involved in implementing information provision and promo- tion measures for agricultural products on the internal market and in third countries by provid- ing for a single legal framework, facilitating access to and participation in the scheme. How- ever, there is still room for legislative improve- ment so as to allow the interested Member States to draw up a relevant programme in the case where proposing organisations do not wish to submit programmes to be carried out in third countries. By way of this proposal, Member States will have the possibility to broaden the scope of the actions to be covered by these pro- grammes and also to allow them to seek the help of international organisations when implement- ing them.

Agriculture is based on the systematic use of the photosynthetic capabilities of plants to convert solar energy into energy that can then be used by humans in the form of food or fodder. For the Committee, it is necessary not only to discuss the negative repercussions of cli- mate change for agriculture, but also to keep in mind that agriculture itself contributes to climate change and to take steps to reduce the climate- harming effects of agriculture. There are basically four aspects of agriculture which are of particu- lar relevance to climate change: \u00a1 conversion of woodlands, peat bogs, wet- lands or grassland into arable farmland; \u00a1 greenhouse gas emissions from cultivated land and livestock; \u00a1 energy use in farms and in upstream and downstream sectors, for example in the form of fuel, and energy used in the manufacture of chemical fertilisers, pesticides and other products; \u00a1 production of biomass for energy. It is also important to take into account the vari- ous ways in which agriculture can help to com- bat climate change. Rural development 1.19.5.

This communication sets out the context of rising fuel prices in the fisheries sector and its impact on fleet structures and profitability in EU fish- eries. The Commission plans to introduce a range of measures for persons and enterprises affected by the situation induced by the increase of oil price in 2008. Five main types of measures are envisaged: emergency meas- ures; restructuring measures; horizontal meas- ures; market measures; and measures facilitat- ing the use of the European Fisheries Fund. Other measures (de minimis and social aid) are also examined, as well as the need for addi- tional funding. COM(2008) 453 1.20.2.

This pro- posal concerns instituting an ad hoc regime which will derogate from some provisions of the Euro- pean Fisheries Fund regulation for a period until the end of 2010. It purports to support a faster adaptation of the Community fleet to the present situation and to provide temporary relief in order to cushion economic and social consequences in the transitional phase. COM(2008) 454 Endorsed by the Parliament on 10 July. Agreed by the Council on 15 July. Adopted by the Council on 24 July. The Coun- cil adopted a regulation instituting a temporary specific action aiming to promote the restruc- turing of the EU fishing fleets affected by the increase of oil prices in 2008. The aim of the regulation is twofold: to provide immediate, temporary aid to those fishermen most affected by the rise in the price of fuel and to seek a sus- tainable solution to the in-built overcapacity of European fishing fleets, thereby creating the conditions for greater profitability in the sector. The regulation, which will remain in force until 31 December 2010, provides for temporary dero- gations from certain provisions of the European Fisheries Fund and includes general measures applicable to the fisheries sector and special measures for vessels participating in fleet adap- tation schemes.

Communication from the Commission to the Council and the European Parliament \u2014 \u2018Report on implementation of the Hague pro- gramme for 2007\u2019. Previous report: COM(2007) 373; Bull. 7/8-2007, point 1.20.1 References: The Hague programme: strengthening freedom, security and justice in the European Union: OJ C 53, 3.3.2005; Bull. 11-2004, point I.4 Action plan on the Hague programme: Strength- ening freedom, security and justice in the Euro- pean Union: OJ C 198, 12.8.2005; Bull. 6-2005, point 1.4.2 Adopted by the Commission on 2 July. This report monitors the adoption of the measures envisaged in the Hague programme both at institutional level (Part I and Annex 1) and their implementation at national level (Part II and Annex 2). This includes the drugs action plan, the strategy covering the external aspects of the area of freedom, security and justice, and the action plan to fight terrorism. All the measures proposed for 2007, and those still not achieved since 2005, are explored. The report broadly confirms the trends of the previ- ous reports, with insufficient progress made, espe- cially in areas related to the \u2018third pillar\u2019, with the exception of the fight against terrorism. In line with the 2005 and 2006 results, the achievement rate in \u2018first pillar\u2019 actions is the highest. COM(2008) 373 Union citizenship Right to diplomatic protection 1.21.2.

The report can be summarised as follows: ",
        "Area of freedom, security and justice 68 Bull. EU 7/8-2008 \u00a1 full visa waiver reciprocity has now been achieved with Israel, Malaysia and Paraguay; \u00a1 significant progress has been achieved with Canada, for which only Bulgaria and Romania remain under visa obligation; \u00a1 in the dialogue with Australia the Commis- sion has achieved access for all Member States to the \u2018autogrant facility\u2019 and equal treatment for the nationals of all Member States from Octo- ber 2008; \u00a1 negotiations on a short-stay visa waiver agreement with Brazil have started; \u00a1 no progress has been achieved with Japan, Panama, Singapore and the USA. With regard to Singapore the Commission suggests that retalia- tory measures should be introduced if within a reasonable time no full reciprocity has been achieved; \u00a1 regarding the USA, despite all efforts of the Commission and individual Member States and the promises by the USA to bring additional EU Member States in the visa waiver programme, no tangible progress has been made. Therefore, the Commission will propose retaliatory measures (e.g. temporary restoration of the visa require- ment for US nationals holding diplomatic and service/official passports) as from 1 January 2009 if no progress has been achieved; \u00a1 with regard to the US electronic system for travel authorisation, the Commission will pre- pare a preliminary assessment and a final assess- ment once the final rule is published in the fed- eral register.

The Committee recalled that in its 2002 opinion on \u2018Immigration, inte- gration and the role of civil society\u2019 it had high- lighted the need to develop clear and effective integration policies as part of an EU framework programme. In addition, it shared the holistic approach put forward recently by the European Council. The Committee considers that, in order to improve the coherence of the EU\u2019s policy and instruments in this regard, a platform for civil society participation should be put in place, known as the \u2018European integration forum\u2019 (the name adopted by the European Commission in its 2005 communication). It agreed that the forum\u2019s main tasks should be \u2018consultation, exchange of expertise and drawing up recom- mendations\u2019. The Committee suggested that the forum have a maximum of 100 members and meet twice a year, and that the forum\u2019s work adopt a European approach, based on national experiences and practice. 1.21.10.

The Committee noted that the rights and obligations for third-country nationals contained in the proposed directive represent a good starting point for immigration legislation, which should be extended to all categories of immigrant workers. It expressed its support for a single procedure for immigration for the purpose of employment. The Committee wished to high- light the role of the social partners at the differ- ent levels (business, sector, national and Euro- pean) in promoting equal treatment at work. It pointed out that immigrant workers pay taxes to the national authorities of their host country, in addition to employment-related social security contributions, in line with Member State legisla- tion. Finally, the Committee highlighted the importance of integration, stressing that the EU and the national authorities should work together to promote policies to this effect. 1.21.11.

The Committee believes that there should be a common, fast and transpar- ent procedure for admitting workers, in line with the provisions of the Lisbon Treaty, regarding Member States\u2019 right to define the number of immigrants that they will admit. It noted that the rights and obligations for third- country nationals contained in the proposed directive represent a good starting point for immigration legislation, which should be extended to all categories of immigrant work- ers. The Committee considers that salary is not an appropriate criterion for consideration as a \u2018highly qualified\u2019 worker, and that the concept of \u2018highly qualified\u2019 should be linked to higher education certificates and qualifications or equivalent vocational skills. Finally, the Com- mittee highlighted the importance of integra- tion, stressing that the EU and the national authorities should work together to promote policies to this effect. 1.21.12.

Parliament welcomed the Commission\u2019s acknowledgment that national judges play an essential role in ensuring respect for Community law. It considers that lan- guage is the main tool of practitioners of justice, and that the current level of foreign language train- ing for national judges limits not only possibilities for judicial cooperation on specific instruments, but also the development of mutual trust, proper use of the acte clair doctrine, and participation in exchange programmes. In this regard, Parliament called on all players involved in judicial training to give specific attention to the training of judges in foreign languages. It noted that complete and up- to-date information on Community law is not available in a systematic and proper manner to many national judges, and called on Member States to renew efforts in this area. Finally, Parlia- ment called for the EU component in the training at national level of all members of the judiciary: \u00a1 to be systematically incorporated into train- ing for, and examinations to enter, the judicial professions; \u00a1 to be further strengthened from the earliest possible stage onwards, with an increased focus on practical aspects; ",

In 2002, the Commission presented two proposals for the signing and the conclusion by the Com- munity of the above instruments. However, because of a dispute between Spain and the United Kingdom relating to Gibraltar, the Coun- cil did not adopt the proposals. This dispute was solved in December 2007. However, the context has substantially changed since December 2003 as a number of new Member States have joined the Community and the convention and protocol are no longer open to signature. Therefore an amended proposal was necessary, which would merge the draft Community declarations for the signature and conclusion into a proposal for one Council decision on the conclusion.

The cooperation will take place with due regard to transparency, complementarity of tasks and coor- dination of efforts. 1.21.21. Report from the Commission to the Council \u2014 Second monitoring and evaluation report on the operation of Council Common Posi- tion 2005/69/JHA.

Com- mon Position 2005/69/JHA obliges Member States to ensure that their competent law enforce- ment authorities exchange data on issued and blank passports that are stolen, lost or misappro- priated and formatted for integration in a specific information system, whilst at the same time ensuring that the fundamental rights of data sub- jects are respected. Further to the 2006 report, which concluded that implementation of the com- mon position was incomplete, the Council instructed the Commission to submit a second report to assess the extent to which Member States have taken appropriate action in the mean- time. This second report noticed a substantial improvement in the operation of the common position since the 2006 report. Member States have taken various steps in order to comply with their obligations. However, the implementation of the common position in the fullest sense of the term is still incomplete and requires a more proactive and committed effort on the part of Member States.

This decision is designed to determine the conditions under which, in the course of criminal proceedings against a person, previous convictions handed down against the same person for different facts in other Member States are taken into account. This framework decision replaces Article 56 of the European Convention of 28 May 1970 on the international validity of criminal judgments, con- cerning the taking into consideration of criminal judgments, as between Member States parties to that convention. Member States will have two years from the entry into force of the decision to comply with its provisions. OJ L 220, 15.8.2008 Combating terrorism 1.21.23.

        "Area of freedom, security and justice Bull. EU 7/8-2008 73 Adopted by the Council on 8 July. The Council stressed the importance of an efficient exchange of information between Member States as well as a high level of cooperation between compe- tent authorities at both national and EU levels. It invited Member States and the Commission to take concrete steps to exchange best practices and to discuss the possibility of elaborating method- ologies which could be used for assessing the effectiveness of measures in this field, taking into account the differences in national experiences in this area. The Council called upon Member States to launch further joint initiatives in the different areas of countering radicalisation and recruitment not yet covered by existing national or EU ini- tiatives. Finally, it welcomed the Commission\u2019s work on various aspects of this problem, inter alia the studies being carried out on violent radicali- sation and the preparation of a communication on the subject. 1.21.24. Council conclusions on cooperation with western Balkan countries on the fight against organised crime and terrorism. References: EU strategy for combating radicalisation and recruitment to terrorism: Bull. 12-2005, point 1.4.19 European Union counter-terrorism strategy: Bull. 12-2005, point 1.4.24 Adopted by the Council on 8 July. The Council recognised the region\u2019s progress in the field of freedom, security and justice, notably in strength- ening border management and cross-border coop- eration, as well as in combating organised crime. However, it noted that the western Balkans is one of the main entry routes for drugs from Asia to the EU. The Council considers that radical ele- ments in the region do not currently represent a direct terrorist threat to the EU and that structural links between organised crime groups and terror- ist structures in the western Balkan countries have not so far been demonstrated. Nevertheless, it stressed the importance of further developing security from terrorism in the region, preventing radicalisation and recruitment, limiting illegal access to explosives and weapons, and minimis- ing potential links between organised crime and terrorism. Finally, the Council proposed: \u00a1 inviting Europol and the joint situation cen- tre of the EU, taking into account the available resources, to consider the possibility of carrying out regular assessments of the use of explosives originating in western Balkan states and of the extent of radicalisation and recruitment in the region; \u00a1 inviting competent authorities of Member States in cooperation with EU institutions to engage in dialogue and in exchanges of best prac- tice with western Balkan states on the security of explosives with a view to raising security stan- dards for the control of explosives; \u00a1 inviting said authorities to share with the western Balkan states the general recommenda- tions resulting from the first round of peer eval- uation on national counter-terrorism arrange- ments and familiarise them with EU efforts to combat terrorism with a view to enhancing the security of both EU and western Balkan states. 1.21.25.

The aim of this report is to assess whether Member States have correctly implemented Council Framework Decision 2005/222/JHA into their national law. The Commission noted that the framework deci- sion was still being implemented in Member States. Significant progress has been made in practically all the 20 Member States assessed in this report, where the level of implementation has been found to be relatively good. The Commis- sion invited the seven Member States \u2014 Ireland, Greece, Spain, Malta, Poland (which complied July 2008), Slovakia and the United Kingdom \u2014 which have not yet implemented the framework decision to do so as soon as possible.

The eval- uation concluded that the Europass initiative is achieving its objectives as a mobility tool for cit- izens and is relevant to their needs, helping them to make their competences and qualifications easier to understand and more acceptable in both learning contexts and the labour market. Its cost- effective implementation tools (the network of national Europass centres and the Internet portal managed by Cedefop) are appreciated by stake- holders and largely satisfy users. However, the evaluation pointed out that the low qualified are a small share of this large number of users. Also, some of the Europass tools have been less successful. The use of the Europass mobility is increasing, but remains below its potential, while the Europass diploma supplement and the Europass certificate supplement are not adequately integrated in the framework. The evaluation made specific recommendations to strengthen the initiative\u2019s overall logic, better address occupational mobility, build upon the successful CV tool, widen take-up, enhance effectiveness and improve the management information system.

Cross- border mobility of young volunteers in the EU is low. Young people who wish to volunteer abroad in Europe do not have enough opportunities to do so. This is why the proposed initiative aims at enhancing the mobility of young volunteers throughout Europe. Positive side effects will be enhanced opportunities for non-formal education and increased employability, competitiveness, cit- izenship and social inclusion. Through this pro- posal, the Commission strives for a solution that allows all existing volunteering systems to inter- operate. While the primary objective of the pro- posed initiative is to enhance the mobility of young cross-border volunteers, its specific objec- tives are to: improve the knowledge of cross-bor- der opportunities of volunteering for young peo- ple; increase exchange opportunities for young volunteers; ensure a reasonable level of quality; recognise the skills and competences acquired by young volunteers; target support for socio- educational instructors and youth leaders working ",

The Committee fully supports any measures to encourage creativity and promote innovation among EU citizens and welcomed the initiative to devote a European Year to supporting and fostering creativity, through lifelong learning as a driver for innovation. However, the Com- mittee does not believe that this proposal is the best possible instrument for reaching the settled goal. According to the Committee, the proposal remains very vague about two highly relevant aspects: the funding of the Year and the reference to support or participation from other EU poli- cies and programmes outside the field of lifelong learning. The Committee proposed that the Commission reconsider its proposal and take into account the comments made herein. It also pro- posed that Parliament and the Council take these points into consideration and modify the text of the proposal in those areas which require the greatest clarification. Visits 1.22.6.

Proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Direc- tive 2003/87/EC so as to improve and extend the greenhouse gas emission allowance trading sys- tem of the Community. Directive to be amended: Directive 2003/87/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council con- cerning the establishment of a scheme for green- house gas emission allowance trading in the Com- munity: OJ L 275, 25.10.2003; Bull. 10-2003, point 1.4.41, as amended by Directive 2004/101/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council: OJ L 338, 13.11.2004; Bull. 9-2004, point 1.4.19 Commission proposal: OJ C 118, 15.5.2008; COM(2008) 16; Bull. 1/2-2008, point 1.23.1 European Economic and Social Committee opin- ion on 9 July. According to the Committee, the greenhouse gas emission allowance trading sys- tem must be perceived as stimulating for a low- carbon economy and encouraging climate pro- tection, adaptation and mitigation. It should seek to minimise bureaucratic obstacles and achieve clarity and transparency. The system should be seen as equitable within the EU whilst recognis- ing the pressing need of newly industrialising and less-developed countries to create sustainable growth and alleviate poverty. In the absence of an effective international agreement on climate change, which imposes emission reduction on energy-intensive sectors and subsectors vulnera- ble to international competition, measures in order to protect these specific industries should be considered, in order to avoid \u2018carbon leakage\u2019. Maritime transport should be included in the trad- ing system and the action taken with regard to issues such as the use of forestry as a carbon sink, deforestation and land use must receive greater emphasis than is currently allowed for in the Commission proposals. Finally, a solution must be found for potential difficulties which may be caused in those east European Member States whose main grid electricity supply comes from Russia rather than the EU. 1.23.2. Proposal for a decision of the European Parliament and of the Council on the effort of Member States to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions to meet the Community\u2019s green- house gas emission reduction commitments up to 2020. Commission proposal: OJ C 118, 15.5.2008; COM(2008) 17; Bull. 1/2-2008, point 1.23.1 European Economic and Social Committee opin- ion on 9 July. The Committee welcomed the Commission\u2019s initiative under which Member States are asked to share the effort of combating climate change and endorsed the EU\u2019s leading role in the international negotiations on envi- ronmental and climate protection commitments. It considers that civil society has a key role to play in implementing the decision and meeting the commitments undertaken by the countries concerned. In order to avoid excessively rigid measures, the Committee proposed that each Member State establish its own plan to achieve the targets fixed in the proposal. It considers that an appropriate balance must be struck between action taken within the EU to cut greenhouse gas emissions on the one hand, and a sense of soli- darity in the face of the introduction of emission- reducing measures in developing countries on the other hand. However, the use of flexible tools to this end should not stimulate leakage of green- house gas emissions from EU to non-EU coun- tries. The Committee believes that any decisions on measures to cut greenhouse gas emissions must not undermine Europe\u2019s economic compet- itiveness in the long-term perspective. That, how- ever, is difficult to avoid unless businesses are given support for R & D from the EU and Mem- ber States. 1.23.3.

The Committee welcomed the pro- posed directive on capture and long-term storage (CCS) of carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) released by the use (combustion) of fossil fuels that aims to sub- stantially help to combat climate change. The Committee recalled that the development of the overall CCS value added chain, involving the capture, transport and storage of CO 2 , remains at an early \u2014 and, in some cases, still at an exploratory \u2014 stage. The provisions of the direc- tive need to take this into account and some fine- tuning is still needed in certain areas. According to the Committee, some sections of the proposed directive should be amended to enable rapid implementation of initial projects and to make them more manageable by both the relevant national authorities and potential investors; this would also ensure planning certainty and provide incentives for action. For instance, this applies to liability issues and the nature and extent of finan- cial security payments. Sixth environment action programme 1.23.4.

The fifth environment policy review reports on the main developments in EU environment policy during 2007 in the four main policy areas of the sixth environment action programme 2002\u201312 (EAP). According to the communication, the main com- mitments under the sixth EAP have been deliv- ered. Environment issues are now firmly at the top of the political agenda and command the attention of decision-makers, the media and the public. A good example is climate change, particularly since the endorsement of the energy and climate change package in March 2007 by European Heads of State or Government. Instruments have been fine- tuned where possible under the better regulation exercise. Externally, the EU has kept the lead on environmental issues, backed up by solid achieve- ments at home and by good bilateral and multilat- eral relations with key partners. In global negoti- ations, it has made significant advances in several areas, notably on climate in the UN climate change conference in Bali. It is now time to further strengthen the efforts to implement the sixth EAP. COM(2008) 409 Taking environment into account in other policies Green public procurement 1.23.5.

Green public procurement (GPP) can be understood as a process whereby public authorities seek to pro- cure goods, services and works with a reduced environmental impact throughout their life cycle when compared with those that would otherwise be procured. This communication provides the political and operational support to allow public authorities throughout the EU to contribute to reduce the environmental damage caused by pub- lic sector consumption and to use GPP to stimu- late innovation in environmental technologies, products and services. Its specific objectives are to address the obstacles to the uptake of GPP by setting forth a political target of 50% GPP by 2010, linked to indicators and future monitoring and to common GPP criteria to be included in tender documents. The communication proposes a process of cooperation with Member States to agree upon common GPP criteria.

Parliament underlined that Europe needs to find ways to respond to the vital question of security of energy supply and that it is essential to support initia- tives aimed at diversifying energy sources. Energy security must be regarded as an essential component of the overall security of the EU whereby its definition should not be merely lim- ited to the lack of internal EU production; it should also take into account the geopolitical aspects of dependency on imports and the poten- tial therein for politically motivated interruptions. In parallel, Parliament underlined that the Baltic Sea is one of the world\u2019s most polluted maritime areas and is environmentally particularly vulner- able. The execution of works under the special conditions in the Baltic Sea could result in an important risk for the environment and human health. Taking into account the potential impact of the gas pipeline on the Baltic marine environ- ment and on states bordering the Baltic Sea, Par- liament is opposed to the carrying-out of an investment on the proposed scale, without first having a positive environmental impact assess- ment. Parliament regretted the marginal role played by the EU in this project and called on the Commission and the Council to make a full com- mitment to analysing the environmental impact of the construction of the north European gas pipeline. It considers that the project should be realised in cooperation with each of the states around the Baltic Sea in accordance with the Espoo Convention, the Helsinki Convention and other pertinent legal instruments. Finally, it emphasised that, given the growing EU gas demand, alternative gas pipeline routes should be analysed and promoted, taking into account envi- ronmental and economic aspects.

Beyond conservation concerns, methods used to kill seals have raised serious concerns among citizens, organisations and certain Member States for sev- eral years on account of the fear, pain, distress and other forms of suffering experienced by seals. This proposal for a regulation is intended to ban the placing on the market, the import, the transit through, and the export from the Community of seal products. Trade in those products would, however, be possible under certain conditions, which concern the manner and method whereby seals are killed and skinned. It also establishes information requirements aimed at ensuring that seal products whose trade would be possible by derogation to the prohibitions otherwise in force would be clearly identified as coming from a country meeting the required conditions, or alter- natively as having been killed and skinned by persons acting under the jurisdiction of countries where the said conditions are met.

EU 7/8-2008 Directive to be amended: Directive 2003/87/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council con- cerning the establishment of a scheme for green- house gas emission allowance trading in the Com- munity: OJ L 275, 25.10.2003; Bull. 10-2003, point 1.4.41, as amended by Directive 2004/ 101/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council: OJ L 338, 13.11.2004; Bull. 9-2004, point 1.4.19 Commission proposal: OJ C 181, 3.8.2007; COM(2006) 818; Bull. 12-2006, point 1.21.11 European Economic and Social Committee opinion: OJ C 175, 27.7.2007; Bull. 5-2007, point 1.22.8 Committee of the Regions opinion: OJ C 305, 15.12.2007; Bull. 10-2007, point 1.22.1 Parliament opinion (first reading): Bull. 11- 2007, point 1.22.5 Council agreement on a common position: Bull. 12-2007, point 1.22.17 Council common position: OJ C 122 E, 20.5.2008; Bull. 4-2008, point. 1.23.6 Parliament amendments (second reading) on 8 July. Following a compromise with the Coun- cil, Parliament adopted amendments to the pro- posal, which aims to include the aviation sector in the scheme for greenhouse gas emission allowance trading within the Community (ETS). The trading of emission quotas will apply to the aviation sector as of 2012 and the proposal con- cerns all flights taking off or landing on EU ter- ritory. The objective is to cap aircraft operators\u2019 annual emissions at 97% of historical emissions (based on the annual average of 2004\u201306 emis- sions) between 2012 and 2013 and at 95% of historical emissions from 2013 onwards. Every aircraft operator will be allocated an amount of CO 2 emission allowances, based on its annual average activity during 2010. Whereas 85% of allowances will be allocated for free, 15% will be auctioned by Member States as of 2013. Member States should use revenues generated from the auctioning of allowances to: tackle cli- mate change; reduce greenhouse gas emissions; fund R & D for the development of greener air transport; promote energy efficiency and renew- able energies; and support measures to tackle deforestation. The ETS system, in particular, excludes: flights for the purpose of scientific research; rescue flights and fire-fighting flights; military, customs and police flights; emergency medical service flights; humanitarian flights; and flights with total emissions lower than 10 000 tonnes per year. Environment and health General 1.23.13. Council Regulation (EC) No 733/2008 on the conditions governing imports of agricul- tural products originating in third countries fol- lowing the accident at the Chernobyl nuclear power station (codified version). Codified regulation: Council Regulation (EEC) No 737/90 on the conditions governing imports of agricultural products originating in third countries following the accident at the Chernobyl nuclear power station: OJ L 82, 29.3.1990; Bull. 3-1990, point 1.1.90, as amended by Council Regulation (EC) No 616/2000: OJ L 75, 24.3.2000; Bull. 3- 2000, point 1.4.37 Commission proposal: OJ C 191, 17.8.2007; COM(2007) 291; Bull. 6-2007, point 1.22.16 Formally adopted by the Council on 15 July. The purpose of this regulation is to undertake a cod- ification of Council Regulation (EEC) No 737/90 on the conditions governing imports of agricul- tural products originating in third countries fol- lowing the accident at the Chernobyl nuclear power station. The new regulation will supersede the various acts incorporated in it; this proposal fully preserves the content of the acts being cod- ified and hence does no more than bring them together with only such formal amendments as are required by the codification exercise itself.

Communication from the Commission to the Council pursuant to Article 37 of the Act of Accession of Bulgaria to the European Union regarding a draft regulation repealing Regulation (EC) No 1962/2006. Regulation to be repealed: Commission Regula- tion (EC) No 1962/2006 in application of Arti- cle 37 of the Act of Accession of Bulgaria to the European Union: OJ L 408, 30.12.2006 Adopted by the Commission on 22 July. With Regulation (EC) No 1962/2006 the Commission imposed safeguard measures in respect to Bul- garia in the area of civil aviation, resulting from its failure to implement commitments with regard to Community policy in the area of aviation safety concerning economic activities with cross- border effects. At present, the Commission con- siders that the commitment of Bulgaria to fully apply the Community rules in the area of air transport is fulfilled and that the safeguard meas- ures should be lifted. The Commission has the obligation to inform the Council in good time before revoking regulations and decisions estab- lishing the safeguard measures and to take any observations of the Council in this respect duly into account. Accordingly, with the present com- munication the Commission formally informs the Council of its intention to adopt a draft Com- mission regulation repealing Regulation (EC) No 1962/2006.

The Committee welcomed the Commission communication and supports the general focus on the establishment of a stable investment climate and a good social climate in ports and the sustainable development of ports. The Committee believes that the optimisation and further development of port and port-related infrastructure should be a matter for the manag- ing body of a port in conjunction with regional or national authorities where applicable. It supports the implementation of major cross-border rail infrastructure projects connecting to ports. The Committee underlined that measures to ensure administrative facilitation in ports should be stepped up and therefore welcomed the Com- mission\u2019s intention to present a European mar- itime transport space without barriers in 2008. Finally, it approved the Commission\u2019s aim to pro- mote and enhance cooperation between cities and their ports. Internal transport market Opening up rail transport 1.24.3.

It further- more explains what has already been done at EU level. The communication stresses that, as society bears the costs of transport, there is little incen- tive for users to change their behaviour and reduce the negative impacts they cause as regards accidents, congestion and environmental damage. It underlines that establishing prices for road infrastructure users, that correspond to its real costs, is essential in achieving sustainable mobil- ity, but to ensure an optimal efficiency, the mar- ket must offer alternative means of mobility.

This pro- posal provides Member States with a framework to enable them to introduce tolls for heavy goods vehicles calculated on the basis of their external cost and in a way compatible with the internal market. These tolls shall be calculated, not only on the basis of the infrastructure costs but also on the basis of the costs of air pollution, noise and congestion. The proposal amends Directive 1999/62/EC (the Eurovignette direc- tive) as follows: \u00a1 Member States will be authorised to calcu- late and vary tolls on the basis of the costs of air pollution and noise as well as the costs of con- gestion on roads that experience congestion at rush hour; \u00a1 the revenue from the portion of the tolls based on external costs is to be used to fund proj- ects designed to promote sustainable mobility; \u00a1 tolls will have to be collected by means of automatic systems that do not slow down traffic and avoid the local nuisances created by the bar- riers used in traditional systems; \u00a1 finally, the proposal extends the scope of the directive beyond the trans-European network and makes the existing provisions more effective by authorising higher tolls in mountainous areas to part-finance priority trans-European network projects on certain conditions. The proposed framework leaves the decision to introduce such a pricing system to Member States. The Commission will draw up a report in 2013 in which it will examine the possibility of introducing a compulsory minimum charge based on the experience acquired in frontrunner Mem- ber States. This proposal is part of the package on greening transport, which also includes a com- munication on greening transport, a communica- tion on a strategy for the internalisation of exter- nal costs and a communication on rail noise abatement measures addressing the existing fleet.

The pur- pose of the proposal is to align the regulation and statutes of the SESAR joint undertaking with the new approach that the EU institutions have adopted for the establishment of joint undertak- ings. The absence of a clear definition of the legal status of joint undertakings in Community or national legislations has given rise to many diffi- culties in setting up their legal and administrative structure. In the context of the creation of joint technology initiatives, which are to be imple- mented by joint undertakings under the terms of the seventh framework programme for R & D, the Community institutions have specifically addressed the issue of better defining the status of these entities in order to adopt a common approach for their establishment. In order to ensure consistency with the Community\u2019s approach to setting up these bodies, the SESAR joint undertaking should enjoy the same treat- ment as the one afforded to similar structures.

Parliament welcomed the Green Paper on a new culture of urban mobility as a suitable basis for discussion. It believes that the EU should define an overall strategy on urban mobility leading to a more rational use of private cars and promote a modal shift towards sustainable modes of transport in order to support the EU\u2019s commitments to envi- ronmental protection and cutting greenhouse gas emissions. Parliament called for specific Euro- pean rules and/or guidance for standardisation and harmonisation and called for the broadest possible dissemination of data on issues relevant to urban mobility. It stressed the need for R & D in the field of sustainable transport, particularly to promote technological progress in the develop- ment of cleaner vehicle technologies. Parliament pointed out that the EU has a role to play in the development and promotion of intelligent trans- port systems and in funding innovative technolo- gies. It underlined that exchanges of best prac- tices concerning mobility governance and better coordination are essential for improving urban transport and mobility. It insisted on the need for an integrated approach and promoted individual responsibility. Parliament believes that the EU can make an important contribution to financing urban passenger and freight transport measures and that in the future the financing of projects from EU funds should be more closely linked to conditions and requirements relating to sustain- able transport and environmental protection.

This com- munication describes the Commission\u2019s activi- ties carried out under Title II, Chapters 3 to 10, of the Euratom Treaty in 2007. It includes a brief overview of the Euratom Supply Agency (ESA) activities. In the context of an increasing interest in nuclear energy, the Commission adopted a communication on an energy policy for Europe and a nuclear illustrative programme in which it highlighted the key contribution of nuclear power to reducing CO 2 emissions, increasing security of supply as well as competitiveness in Europe. To commemorate the 50th anniversary of the Euratom Treaty, the Commission issued a communication and a commemorative publi- cation presenting the principal elements of the Treaty\u2019s implementation within this time. It also published a report on the use of financial resources for decommissioning. In the field of safeguards, the Commission\u2019s conclusions, which are based on inspections and nuclear material accountancy, acknowledge that nuclear material has not been diverted from its intended use within the EU. The Commission submitted its revised approach for implementing nuclear safeguards in the EU to the Council. Coopera- tion with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has been strengthened. The Commission made proposals for regulations on the conditions governing imports of agricultural products following the Chernobyl accident and on maximum permitted levels of radioactive con- tamination of foodstuffs and of feedstuffs after a nuclear accident. The preparation for the recast of the Euratom basic safety standards continued and the Council adopted new statutes for ESA. In the international domain, the entry into force of a new instrument for nuclear safety coopera- tion and the Council\u2019s approval of Euratom adhe- sion to the Convention on the Physical Protection of Nuclear Material and Nuclear Facilities was highlighted.

Parliament welcomed the European strategic energy tech- nology (SET-Plan) and considers that a European energy technology policy with adequate financial support is fundamental to achieving the EU\u2019s energy and climate change objectives for 2020. It believes that the development and deployment of innovative, low-cost, low-carbon energy tech- nologies, energy efficiency and renewable energy are essential to reducing the cost of cutting emis- sions whilst maintaining a competitive and sus- tainable economy. Parliament underlined the need to enhance the coordination of strategic energy technologies at various levels and among differ- ent partners. It insisted on the need to avoid excessive bureaucracy, ensure simplicity and clar- ity and secure widespread participation of all potential partners. It stressed that necessary coor- dination has to extend to the various scientific and technological fields and emphasised the need to improve the transfer of technology from research centres to enterprises. Parliament wel- comed the proposed European industry initiatives and underlined the need to promote the latter. It insisted that energy efficiency should figure more prominently in the SET-Plan. Parliament stressed that the latter should not be financed through the reallocation of funds made available for energy under the seventh framework pro- gramme or the EU competitiveness and innova- tion programme and believes that significant additional EU resources for energy efficiency and renewable energy technologies are needed. It called on the Commission to put forward pro- posals for additional resources in the mid-term review of the 2007\u201313 financial framework. 1.25.8. European Economic and Social Commit- tee opinion on the communication from the Commission \u2014 A European strategic energy technology plan (SET-Plan): \u2018Towards a low car- bon future\u2019. Commission communication: OJ C 55, 28.2 2008; COM(2007) 723; Bull. 11-2007, point 1.24.1 Reference: Council conclusions on the European strategic energy technology plan: Bull. 1/2-2008, point 1.25.12 Adopted by the European Economic and Social Committee on 9 July. The Committee welcomed the Commission communication and considers that the strategic plan should not only include the setting of priorities at EU level, but also the estab- lishment of specific priorities at Member State level that respect their capacities and experience, the allocation of sufficient funds from public finances (of the EU and Member States), the opti- mum use of R & D capacities, private sector involvement as well as legal and fiscal instru- ments to stimulate the energy market. The EU requires more targeted and effective mechanisms which enlist the potential of public funding, industry, universities and research and boost the synergy between them. At the international level, broader collaboration and measures to prevent the fragmentation of research are also needed. The Committee appreciated the Commission\u2019s approach of urging financial, but above all human, resources to be mobilised. ",

This pro- posal for a directive, which is accompanied by a communication, aims to provide a clear Commu- nity framework for cross-border healthcare. As well as setting out relevant legal definitions and general provisions, this framework is structured around three main areas: \u00a1 common principles in all EU health systems, setting out which Member State shall be respon- sible for ensuring compliance with the common principles for healthcare and what those respon- sibilities include, in order to ensure that there is clarity and confidence with regard to which authorities are setting and monitoring healthcare standards throughout the EU; \u00a1 a specific framework for cross-border health- care: the directive will make the entitlements of patients to have healthcare in another Member State clear, including the limits that Member States can place on such healthcare abroad and the level of financial coverage that is provided for cross-border healthcare, based on the princi- ple that patients are entitled to obtain reimburse- ment up to the amount that would have been paid had they obtained that treatment at home; \u00a1 European cooperation on healthcare: the directive establishes a framework for European cooperation in border regions and in areas such as recognition of prescriptions issued in other coun- tries, European reference networks, health tech- nology assessment, data collection and quality and safety, in order to enable the potential con- tribution of such cooperation to be realised effec- tively and on a sustained basis.

This ini- tiative aims at ensuring a clear and transparent framework for the provision of cross-border healthcare within the EU, for those occasions where the care patients seek is provided in another Member State than in their home coun- try. When this happens, there should be no unjus- tified obstacles. The care should be safe and of good quality. The procedures for reimbursement of costs should be clear and transparent. While respecting principles of universality, access to quality care, equity and solidarity, the objectives of this framework will therefore be to: \u00a1 provide sufficient clarity about rights to be reimbursed for healthcare provided in other Member States; \u00a1 ensure that the necessary requirements for high-quality, safe and efficient healthcare are ensured for cross-border care.

As required by Article 12(3) of the programme deci- sion, the Commission has to have an external assessment of the implementation and achieve- ments during the three first years of the pro- gramme conducted by independent qualified experts by the end of the fourth year of the pro- gramme. It also has to assess the impact the pro- gramme has had on health, the efficiency of the use of resources, as well as the consistency and complementarity with other relevant pro- grammes, actions and initiatives implemented under other Community policies and activities. The purpose of this communication is to present the conclusions of the external assessment and to communicate them to the European Parlia- ment, the Council, the European Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions.

Parliament agreed with the Commission that past enlarge- ments have been a great success, benefiting old as well as new EU Member States by fostering eco- nomic growth, promoting social progress and bringing peace, stability, freedom and prosperity to the European continent. It believes that lessons can be learned from previous accessions and that further ways of improving the quality of the enlargement process must be based on the posi- tive experiences accumulated so far. Parliament reaffirmed its firm commitment to all candidate countries and to those which have been given clear membership prospects, with the under- standing that full and rigorous compliance with all the criteria laid down in Copenhagen in 1993 is imperative, that the EU must make efforts to strengthen its integration capacity and that this capacity should be fully taken into account. In this context, it recalled that, for the countries of the former Yugoslavia, full cooperation with the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia is also a sine qua non. Parliament took the view that the EU\u2019s enlargement strategy should comply with the provisions of the EU Treaty and reflect the commitments already entered into by the EU, as well as striking a bal- ance between the EU\u2019s geostrategic interests, the impact of political developments outside its borders and the EU\u2019s integration capacity, includ- ing its ability to cope with future internal and external challenges and to realise its political inte- gration project. Finally, it recalled the need to undertake the necessary internal reforms in this context, which are aimed at, inter alia, increasing efficiency, social cohesion and strengthening democratic accountability.

The Committee considers that civil society in all its forms has a vital role to play in the democratic and civil development of all countries. It further stated that this is par- ticularly the case in a country like Albania which, strengthened by its important geopolitical posi- tion, has made significant progress in recent years in building up democratic institutions and engag- ing with European and other western organisa- tions (such as NATO). To achieve inclusive and democratic social progress, the people need to have an input into the policies adopted by gov- ernment and these policies must be monitored. The Committee therefore pointed out that the Commission delegation to Albania should devote more attention and resources to the activities of civil society as a whole, which should be among its priorities. Civil society activities should be stepped up in the country\u2019s rural and less-devel- oped areas. Given that a number of international players are present in Albania, who support the work of its civil society through various projects and in view of certain difficulties and specific fea- tures inherent to the country\u2019s social fabric, the way in which the EU conducts its relations is very important. The Committee considers that, in par- ticular, access to funding should be conditioned by certain requirements favouring organisations with established, clearly defined objectives and which are genuinely representative of the people. 1.27.5.

Concerning Serbia, the Council welcomed the arrest of Radovan Karadzic, who is indicted by the Inter- national Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia for genocide, crimes against human- ity and war crimes. According to the Council, this development illustrates the commitment of the new government in Belgrade to contribute to peace and stability in the Balkan regions. It is a significant step on Serbia\u2019s path towards the EU. The Council encouraged the Serb government to continue along that path. The Council drew atten- tion to the European Council conclusions of 19 and 20 June 2008, which state that Serbia can accelerate its progress towards the EU, including candidate status, as soon as all the necessary con- ditions are met. The Council also encouraged the new Serb government to maintain positive rela- tions with the EU and its Member States and to take a constructive approach towards the EU\u2019s efforts to contribute to peace and stability in the Balkan region. The Council also reiterated its attachment to dialogue on visa liberalisation with Serbia and called on the new government to focus on full implementation of the criteria set out in the roadmap. 1.27.12.

Parliament noted the importance of the space dimension to the security of the EU and the need for a common approach necessary for defending European interests in space. It underlined the need for space assets in order that the political and diplomatic activities of the EU may be based on independent, reliable and complete informa- tion in support of its policies for conflict preven- tion, crisis management operations and global security: especially the monitoring of prolifera- tion of weapons of mass destruction and their means of transportation and verification of inter- national treaties; the transnational smuggling of light weapons and small arms; the protection of critical infrastructure and of the EU\u2019s borders; and civil protection in the event of natural and man-made disasters and crises. Parliament encouraged Member States, the European Space Agency and the various stakeholders to make greater and better use of the existing national and multinational space systems and to foster their complementarity. It also gave its opinion on the following topics: \u00a1 autonomous threat assessment; \u00a1 Earth observation and reconnaissance; \u00a1 navigation \u2014 positioning \u2014 timing; \u00a1 telecommunications; \u00a1 space surveillance; \u00a1 satellite-based early warning against ballis- tic missiles; \u00a1 signal intelligence; \u00a1 autonomous access to space and international environment; \u00a1 governance; \u00a1 financing; \u00a1 protection of space infrastructure; \u00a1 international legal regime for uses of space; \u00a1 transatlantic cooperation on space policy and missile defence; \u00a1 other international cooperation. 1.28.2.

Parliament called on Member States and the Commission to ensure that any anti-competitive actions contained in legislation or in executive policy that would improperly restrict the ability of EU companies to compete in either civil or military programmes should be met if neces- sary, case by case and with the appropriate response by the Community and its Member States. It fully supports the defence of EU inter- ests in the pending dispute settlement proceed- ings before the WTO and urges the Commission to continue its efforts in this regard. Parliament doubts, however, whether WTO rulings in them- selves will provide the long-term solution required by the market as a basis for future peaceful and fair competition in this sector which, by contrast, a negotiated solution could deliver.

Previous report: OJ C 246, 20.10.2007; COM(2007) 461; Bull. 7/8-2007, point 1.29.4 Adopted by the Commission on 4 July. The num- ber of trade defence measures in force against the EU at the end of 2007 has slightly increased com- pared with the previous year. Those measures are mainly anti-dumping measures, but the use of the safeguard instrument is constantly increasing. The Commission has continued to closely moni- tor this activity, to provide assistance to the EU industry concerned and to intervene where appro- priate. Positive results were achieved this year but the problems identified in the past still exist and often unduly restrict market access for EU exporters. The Commission will therefore con- tinue this important activity and intensify bilat- eral contacts with third countries in order to pro- mote increased disciplines when using trade defence instruments.

The Council adopted a regulation updating the EU system of generalised tariff preferences (GSP). This update is in the framework of the guidelines adopted by the Commission in 2004, which established the main principles of the GSP for 2006\u201315. In this context, the system of gener- alised tariff preferences consists of a general regime for all the recipient countries and territo- ries and of two special regimes taking into account the various needs of developing coun- tries: the special regime in favour of less advanced countries, which provides a duty-free access to the Community markets to products originating from these countries, and the SPG+ regime, now principally focused on fostering sus- tainable development and good governance, which gives additional tariff preferences to vul- nerable countries.

With this proposal, the Commission wished to launch a short- term response, called a \u2018facility\u2019, to the recent soar- ing global of food prices. It would be implemented through international and regional organisations and would primarily support agriculture in developing countries and enable them to enhance production levels. The facility will also help those countries to rapidly mitigate the negative effects of high food prices on the poorest. The regulation will be valid for a limited period of two years (2008\u201309) and the total financial reference amount proposed for its implementation over that period is EUR 1 billion.

Previous report: OJ C 4, 9.1.2008; COM(2007) 555; Bull. 9-2007, point 1.31.1 Reference: Council Regulation (EC) No 1257/96 concerning humanitarian aid: OJ L 163, 2.7.1996; Bull. 6-1996, point 1.4.42 Adopted by the Commission on 9 July. In 2007, the EU provided humanitarian assistance to an estimated 127 million beneficiaries in third coun- tries through its humanitarian aid budget. In addi- tion, 19.5 million people benefited from actions in respect of disaster preparedness and improved response capacity to potential risks. Due to the integration of food aid and aid to uprooted people, the initial humanitarian aid budget made available for the year 2007 rose to EUR 722 million with a predicted annual indicative increase of 3% (2% inflation and 1% net increase). In contrast with previous years, 2007 saw no major new crises. Nevertheless, natural disasters, accentuated by climate changes, continue to increase both in fre- quency and severity, affecting already vulnerable people more often and more severely. ACP coun- tries were the biggest recipients of aid (EUR 422.7 million \u2014 i.e. 55% of its total final bud- get), followed by Asia and Latin America (EUR 157.4 million \u2014 20.5%) and eastern Europe, new independent States, the Middle East and Mediter- ranean countries (EUR 124.9 million \u2014 16.2%).

The Council welcomed the action plan presented by the Com- mission for the implementation of the European consensus on humanitarian aid as an important contribution to efficient, well-coordinated and reinforced European humanitarian aid. The Coun- cil confirmed that EU Member States will actively engage in the implementation of the action plan. The Council will ensure regular a review of progress on implementation and discuss priorities, including through the newly mandated Working Group on Humanitarian Aid and Food Aid that takes effect from 1 January 2009. The Council recalled that a partnership approach is fundamen- tal to the effective delivery of humanitarian aid and that actions outlined in the action plan should be pursued where appropriate in close collabora- tion with the humanitarian partner organisations and other stakeholders.

The Committee underlined that the Black Sea synergy is designed to focus political attention on the region and to capitalise on the new opportunities gained from Romania\u2019s and Bulgaria\u2019s membership of the EU. It concen- trates on five issues: good governance, transport, energy, environment and the fight against cross- border crime. The synergy should also contribute to the promotion of the European social model and the principle of social and civil dialogue. It should also address poverty reduction in the Black Sea region in cooperation with relevant international organisations. The Committee called on the Black Sea governments, as well as regional and international organisations to involve civil society in regional dialogue and cooperation and to offer a fresh perspective on major topics, such as: sustaining political stability, democracy, rule of law, human rights and fundamental freedoms; promotion of economic reforms, development and trade; cooperation in the field of transport, energy and the environment; as well as people-to-people contacts. The Committee promoted the establish- ment and the strengthening of the role of national European and social committees and tripartite commissions in all Black Sea countries and the development of regional cooperation among tri- partite structures in the region. In countries with- out national European and social committees, social partners should be encouraged to engage in the consultation process and their creation. ",

The Paris summit officially launched the Barcelona process: Union for the Mediterranean. The summit was preceded by a meeting of the Ministers for Foreign Affairs during which the addition of four new members was confirmed (Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Monaco and Montenegro) and Egypt was chosen as the first co-presidency. A common declaration was adopted during the meeting of Heads of State or Government. It recalled that the union for the Mediterranean aims to achieve a future of peace and shared prosperity by implementing projects that will enhance the flow of exchanges among the people of the whole region. This initiative gives new impetus to the Barcelona process in three important ways: \u00a1 by upgrading the political level of the EU\u2019s relationship with its Mediterranean partners; \u00a1 by providing an improved distribution of responsibilities in multilateral relations; \u00a1 by making these relations more concrete and visible through additional regional and subregional projects, relevant for the citizens of the region. The declaration envisages summits taking place every two years, a co-presidency chosen by con- sensus from the Mediterranean side, a European co-presidency compatible with the rules of exter- nal representation of the EU, a joint secretariat and a joint permanent committee based in Brus- sels.

The Coun- cil recalled that the EU had expressed its grave concern at recent developments in Georgia, and the open conflict between Russia and Georgia. It welcomed the agreement subscribed to by the parties on the basis of the mediation efforts car- ried out by the EU. The principles to which the parties have subscribed are as follows: \u00a1 not to resort to force; \u00a1 to end hostilities definitively; \u00a1 to provide free access for humanitarian aid; \u00a1 Georgian military forces will have to with- draw to their usual bases; \u00a1 Russian military forces will have to withdraw to the lines held prior to the outbreak of hostili- ties; pending an international mechanism, Russ- ian peacekeeping forces will implement addi- tional security measures; \u00a1 opening of international talks on the security and stability arrangements in Abkhazia and South Ossetia. The Council emphasised the EU\u2019s commitment to contribute actively to the effective implemen- tation of these principles. It stressed the human- itarian emergency and the EU\u2019s resolve to pro- vide vital assistance to the population. Finally, in view of the destruction caused by the conflict, the Council emphasised the need to identify recon- struction requirements as of now and to prepare to make a significant contribution to meeting those requirements at EU level. It invited the Commission to report back to it on this matter before its next meeting. 1.35.14.

EU 7/8-2008 Cooperation Council discussed a number of issues of importance to both parties, including political reforms, rule of law and human rights, regional cooperation in central Asia and interna- tional issues, implementation of the EU strategy for central Asia across different priority sectors, and water management. It underlined the impor- tance of regional cooperation in central Asia as an effective means of conflict prevention and socioeconomic development in the region and welcomed the increasingly active role Kyrgyzstan is playing in different regional and bilateral ini- tiatives. Finally, special attention was given to discussion on international issues, including Afghanistan and Iran. United States, Japan and other industrialised countries Group of Eight (G8) 1.35.17.

        "Asia Bull. EU 7/8-2008 129 history marked by Soviet occupation, the fight between various Mujahedeen factions and repres- sion under the Taliban regime, the country has started an important and complicated recon- struction of its society and must continue its efforts to this end. Progress was noted in the fields of health and education, with some advances also made in state building through elections and the establishment of democratic institutions in Afghanistan. It considers that rela- tions between Afghanistan and Pakistan were the primary source of instability in the region and therefore concluded that stabilising the region required a comprehensive policy geared towards that relationship. However, Parliament remained critical of the international military efforts, the coordination of assistance, the failure to advance security sector reform comprehensively, the lack of democratic progress (weak institutions, free- dom of expression and media, human rights) and the failures to address the drug problem effec- tively (eradication being considered counter- productive). It believes that, without the active commitment and support of the international community, the two countries will not be able to extricate themselves from their difficult bilateral relations. Parliament welcomed the commitment expressed in the Afghanistan Compact to work towards a stable and prosperous Afghanistan, in which good governance and human rights pro- tection for all under the rule of law are granted. It expressed its deep concern about the ever- expanding cultivation and trafficking of opium, which has serious political and national security implications in Afghanistan and neighbouring countries. 1.35.23.

Parliament urgently called on the government of India to ensure that independent and impartial investigations are undertaken into all suspected sites of mass graves in Jammu and Kashmir and, as an immediate first step, to secure the grave sites in order to preserve the evidence. It expressed its concern for the safety of Parvez Imroz and other human rights activists who are investigating the unmarked graves and other allegations of human rights abuses in Jammu and Kashmir. It reiterated its call on the Indian government and the state authorities to investigate all allegations of enforced disappearances.

The main aim of the proposed agreement is to enhance cooperation between the Community and China to further strengthen the controls over synthetic drug precursors\u2019 import from China into the Community. The proposed agreement is expected to address the increasing concern about the illicit manufacture of amphetamine and MDMA (commonly referred to as ecstasy) in the Community which continues to be reported as the major source of amphetamine and MDMA in the word. The main source of synthetic drug precur- sors required to produce those drugs is China. This proposal aims at helping to substantially reduce their supply. COM(2008) 437 1.35.30.

It welcomed the resump- tion of contacts between the representatives of the Dalai Lama and the Chinese authorities after the events of March 2008 in Lhasa. Parliament noted with satisfaction that China rapidly agreed to accept the assistance of the international com- munity in helping the victims of the earthquake in the Sichuan region and facilitating the opera- tion of voluntary humanitarian aid organisations in distributing aid.

Concerning Brazil, Parliament noted that the draft annual action programme (AAP) for Brazil for 2008 contains the academic mobility programme for Brazil 2008\u201310 (which is the Erasmus Mundus external cooperation window for Brazil) as the only action. It further noted that this action comes under the country strategy paper\u2019s priority sector I on \u2018Enhancing bilateral relations, Action 2: Higher education programme for Brazil\u2019 and that the financing for mobility of EU national stu- dents and academic staff (up to 30% of the total funding for individual mobility for students and staff) is provided for as an important element of the AAP. Concerning Argentina, Parliament noted that the draft AAP for Argentina for 2008 contains the Erasmus Mundus external cooperation window for Argentina as the only action, that this action comes under the country strategy paper\u2019s focal sector entitled \u2018Strengthening of bilateral rela- tions and mutual understanding between the EC and Argentina\u2019. It further noted that the financing of mobility of EU national students and academic staff (up to 30% of the total funding for individ- ual mobility for students and staff) is provided for as an important element of the AAP. Parliament took the view that the Commission therewith exceeds its implementing powers in the AAPs laid down in the basic act: according to Par- liament, given that the abovementioned elements are not in compliance with Article 2(1) and (4) of Regulation (EC) No 1905/2006, as the primary objective of these elements is not the eradication of poverty; it further noted that these elements do not fulfil the criteria for official development assistance established by the OECD/DAC (Devel- opment Assistance Committee). As a consequence, Parliament called on the Commission to withdraw its draft decisions establishing AAPs for Brazil and for Argentina for 2008 and to submit new draft decisions fully respecting the provisions of Regulation (EC) No 1905/2006 to the DCI (devel- opment cooperation instrument) Management Committee.

In the mid-1990s, the EU negotiated an economic part- nership, political coordination and cooperation agreement with Mexico. The need has been felt for a wider and more ambitious political frame- work to be established between the EU and Mex- ico, in order to translate the political dialogue into an effective instrument for the coordination of positions on global issues, as well as on other issues of mutual concern, within multilateral forums and international institutions. Rather than aiming at establishing a common agenda or at producing a specific action plan, the strategic partnership with Mexico, which is being recom- mended by the Commission, will favour the adoption of a methodology for consultation and coordination. It should lead to the emergence of a new mutual sensitivity, causing the parties to pay due attention to their respective interests and ",

Since the dec- laration of initial operating capability on 15 March 2008, the EU military operation in the Republic of Chad and in the Central African Republic (operation EUFOR Chad/RCA) has played a key role in bringing security to the areas where it was present, in particular during the attacks by rebel movements in the Goz Be\u00efda region in mid-June. Highlighting the excellent coordination established between operation EUFOR Chad/RCA and the UN, the Council wished the UN mission in Chad and in the Cen- tral African Republic (Minurcat) to be deployed as swiftly as possible. Minurcat\u2019s role is central in effectively responding to the non-military threats of banditry and crime. Zimbabwe 1.35.52. European Parliament resolution on the situation in Zimbabwe.

Parliament called on the AU, the Southern African development community and the UN to facilitate an inclusive mediation process with clear time- frames for negotiations, which enables a rapid and positive solution to the Zimbabwe crisis based on free and fair elections. It stressed that, for the mediation effort to lead to a meaningful and productive national dialogue, other external actors alongside President Thabo Mbeki must be brought in. Furthermore, internal dialogue should not be restricted to the two political parties, but rather include other civil society actors such as NGOs, churches, trade unions and the parliament. The Parliament thus called for a negotiated set- tlement of the current crisis, which should lead to the creation of a transitional administration with a mandate to end state-sponsored violence, demobilise militias, repeal repressive legislation, resolve the humanitarian crisis, stabilise the econ- omy, initiate an inclusive constitutional review process and reconstitute the Zimbabwe Electoral Commission (ZEC) in order to create conditions for free and fair presidential elections in the near future under the auspices of the AU and the UN. 1.35.53.

The Council noted that the election observation missions of the Pan-African Parliament, the AU and the SADC concluded that the elections of 27 June 2008 had not complied with AU standards and had not reflected the will of the Zimbabwean peo- ple. It is ready to continue giving its support to any credible mediation effort which might lead to the establishment of a transitional government and to the holding of free, pluralist and transpar- ent elections as soon as possible. The Council wants the will of the Zimbabwean people, which was expressed on 29 March 2008, to be respected. In the absence of any positive development in the next few weeks towards a transitional government based on the results of the elections of 29 March, the Council is prepared to take the additional measures it considers appropriate. 1.35.55.

Adopted by the European Parliament on 8 July. Parliament took note of the preliminary draft bud- get (PDB) priorities as set out by the Commis- sion. It expressed its conviction that the EU must be equipped with the level of resources necessary to fully implement its current policies and activ- ities, and at the same time have enough flexibil- ity to meet new policy challenges. Nevertheless, it made certain remarks on the PDB presented by the Commission. In particular, Parliament could- n\u2019t always see a clear correlation between the Commission\u2019s political priorities and increases in the corresponding budget lines and policy areas. Moreover, it is still not satisfied with the attempts of the Commission to include Parliament\u2019s prior- ities in the PDB. In addition, Parliament is not convinced that the climate change priority really is reflected throughout the budget as proposed by the Commission, and pointed out the need to revise current programmes at the mid term review in order to better integrate climate change objec- tives and provide for improved policy coherence. It stressed the importance of clarity, consistency and transparency in the presentation of the EU budget and deplored the fact that, at the moment, there was no clear indication of the exact changes made in a financial programming document newly presented, compared with the previous one, nor of whether, or how, increases in a par- ticular year are being compensated for or how back- and front-loadings are taking place. This not being in line with the provisions of the interinstitutional agreement, Parliament called on the Commission to fulfil its obligations in this respect. Finally, it was surprised by the extremely low level of payment appropriations proposed by the Commission. 1.36.2. Draft budget 2009.

The 2009 draft budget (see Table 7) at first reading amounts to: \u00a1 EUR 133 932 757 913 in commitment appropriations; \u00a1 EUR 114 972 328 243 in payment appropri- ations. Compared with the 2008 budget, these amounts represent a 2.8% increase in commitment appro- priations and a 4.7% decrease in payment appro- priations. Compared with the preliminary draft budget for 2009, these amounts represent a EUR 469 481 336 decrease in commitment appro- priations and a EUR 1 771 434 086 decrease in payment appropriations. The Council took account of the following major principles: \u00a1 work within the framework of the budget guidelines established for the 2009 budget in the Council conclusions adopted in March 2008; \u00a1 apply budgetary discipline and sound finan- cial management to a realistic and comprehen- sively balanced budget; \u00a1 not to adopt expenditure relating to the implementation of the Lisbon Treaty; \u00a1 provide adequate funding for the EU various priorities, taking into account the budget imple- mentation rate in 2007, forecasts in 2008 and real- istic capacities for programme implementation. 2008 financial year 1.36.3.

EU 7/8-2008 Reference: Commission communication on the modernisation of the accounting system of the European Communities: COM(2002) 755; Bull. 12-2002, point 1.7.10 Adopted by the Commission on 13 August. This communication pointed out that the new account- ing system of the Commission has allowed it to meet the statutory deadlines set for the prepara- tion of annual accounts, prepared on an accrual basis and which comply with internationally accepted accounting standards in all material respects. Nevertheless, it is necessary to continue improving and developing accounting and finan- cial processes. The most immediate challenges remaining are to: \u00a1 continue making the necessary improvements to the systems to ensure that all accounting trans- actions are recorded accurately by the DGs; \u00a1 complete the validation of the local systems of the External Relations DG and Education and Culture DG; \u00a1 incorporate the EDF accounts in the accrual- based accounting and train staff in 46 delegations; \u00a1 optimise the integration of the IT systems, integrating, when possible, the Commission\u2019s accounting processes into one single platform; \u00a1 enhance financial and management reporting; \u00a1 provide the same level of service to new clients.

In this report, the Commission took stock of events since the situation report of 30 June 2007 and analysed changes in the risk situation and activa- tion of budgetary guarantees during this period. It also evaluated potential risks resulting from the economic and financial situation of the non- member countries benefiting from the main loan operations. COM(2008) 451 Financial operations European Community 1.36.7. Report from the Commission to the Euro- pean Parliament and the Council on the manage- ment of EU funds in Bulgaria. Reference: Council Regulation (EC) No 1083/2006 laying down general provisions on the European Regional Development Fund, the European Social Fund and the Cohesion Fund: OJ L 210, 31.7.2006; Bull. 7/8-2006, point 1.15.6 Adopted by the Commission on 23 July. Bulgaria has received important financial and technical support from the EU in the pre-accession period and is eligible for continued high levels of finan- cial support under the current 2007\u201313 financial perspective (EUR 6.852 billion from the Struc- tural Funds alone). Pre-accession support \u2014 the Phare programme and its transition facilities, Sapard (agriculture) and ISPA (infrastructure) \u2014 was designed to help Bulgaria consolidate socioeconomic reform and to prepare for the absorption of larger amounts of Structural Funds. These pre-accession programmes are at various stages of implementation, but not all funds have been contracted and there are significant amounts remaining to be paid. The Structural Funds and other programmes (such as the Schengen facil- ity) falling under the current financial perspec- tives are at an early stage of implementation, with ",

Fol- lowing allegations of irregularities as well as sus- picions of fraud and possible conflict of interest in the award of contracts, the Commission initi- ated investigations into the management of EU funds by the Bulgarian authorities. These inves- tigations led to the temporary suspension of pre- accession funds and the freezing of payments under various other financial instruments in the second half of 2007 and the first half of 2008. Given its responsibility under the Treaty for the implementation of the budget, and in particular having regard to the need for the sound financial management of EU funds and for protecting expenditures under the EU budget, the Commis- sion considers it necessary to inform the Euro- pean Parliament and the Council, i.e. the budget- ary authority, about the situation in Bulgaria, the steps that are being taken by the Commission and the remedial actions that are being taken by or that are expected from the Bulgarian authorities. This report examines the situation for the main funding programmes, provides an overview of measures taken to date and an indication of next steps.

Internal audit and control 1.36.9. Commission communication to the Euro- pean Parliament and the Council \u2014 \u2018Annual report to the discharge authority on internal audits carried out in 2007\u2019. Previous report: COM(2007) 280; Bull. 5-2007, point 1.35.5 Reference: Council Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 1605/2002 on the financial regulation applica- ble to the general budget of the European Com- munities: OJ L 248, 16.9.2002; Bull. 6-2002, point 1.7.2, as amended by Council Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 1525/2007: OJ L 390, 30.12.2006; Bull. 12-2006, point 1.34.4 Adopted by the Commission on 24 July. The Commission informed the discharge authority about the work carried out by the internal audit services (IAS) in 2007, in accordance with Arti- cle 86(4) of the financial regulation. This report is based on IAS audit and consulting reports finalised in 2007. It concerns audit and consult- ing work related to Commission DGs and ser- vices and executive agencies only. Thus, it does not cover the IAS work on other agencies or bodies. The report concluded that progresses had been made on the Commission\u2019s internal control systems but that more improvements were still needed. It recalled that all DGs and services con- cerned should pay particular attention to infor- mation security and should coordinate with and seek validation of all their security measures by the corporate security service. In addition, the Commission having recently adopted a new approach to fraud proofing, the directors-general, as authorising officers by delegation, have front- line responsibility for fraud prevention. Besides, the report noted that the assurance process for the annual activity report was constantly improving. Finally, the IAS noticed that the follow-up of audit recommendations had improved, but still takes too long in some areas.

Previous report: COM(2007) 390; Bull. 7/8-2007, point 1.35.8 Adopted by the Commission on 22 July. As required by the EC Treaty, the Commission has drawn up an annual report for transmission to Parliament and to the Council on the measures taken by the Community and the Member States in 2007 to ensure the protection of the Commu- nities\u2019 financial interests and detailed the main results. The report consists of five parts: ",

EU 7/8-2008 \u00a1 the first part gives a summary of the statis- tics on irregularities reported by the Member States in 2007 according to the sectoral regula- tions, gives an estimate of the irregularities that occurred in the field of direct expenditure and provides some figures relating to the operational activity of OLAF; \u00a1 the second part presents the main develop- ments of 2007 at the level of prevention and the fight against fraud and other irregularities to pro- tect the Communities\u2019 financial interests; \u00a1 the third part concerns checks to detect fraud and other irregularities, with particular emphasis on management checks; \u00a1 the fourth part deals with the limitation period for proceedings concerning irregularities and the limitation applicable to the implementa- tion of a decision establishing an administrative measure or penalty following such proceedings; \u00a1 finally, the fifth part gives an account of recoveries made in 2007 in all budget areas. COM(2008) 475 1.36.11. Proposal for a Council regulation amending Regulation (EC) No 2182/2004 con- cerning medals and tokens similar to euro coins; proposal for a Council regulation amending Reg- ulation (EC) No 2183/2004 extending to the non- participating Member States the application of Regulation (EC) No 2182/2004 concerning medals and tokens similar to euro coins. Regulations to be amended: Council Regulation (EC) No 2182/2004: OJ L 373, 21.12.2004; Bull. 12-2004, point 1.7.10 Council Regulation (EC) No 2183/2004: OJ L 373, 21.12.2004; Bull. 12-2004, point 1.7.10 Reference: Commission communication on copy- right protection of the common face design of the euro coins: OJ C 318, 13.11.2001; COM(2001) 600; Bull. 10-2001, point 1.3.9 Adopted by the Commission on 13 August. Coun- cil Regulation (EC) No 2182/2004 aims to pro- tect euro coins against medals and tokens which are similar to euro coins. Experience gained dur- ing the implementation period has highlighted the need to clarify the protective provisions and to increase transparency in the decision-making process. In particular, the public may be led to believe that some medals or tokens have legal tender status not only when they bear a design similar to the ones on legal tender euro coins but also when they bear distinctive parts of these designs. It is therefore necessary to formally define the specific signs which should not be reproduced on medals and tokens. In addition, the criteria on the basis of which the Commis- sion declares if a design is similar or not to the ones appearing on euro coins must be explicitly stated in the regulation. These modifications must be extended to Regulation (EC) No 2183/2004 concerning Member States not participating in the euro. COM(2008) 514 ",

(1) A substance such as that at issue in the main pro- ceedings, namely heavy fuel oil sold as a combustible fuel, does not constitute waste within the meaning of Council Directive 75/442/EEC of 15 July 1975 on waste, as amended by Commission Decision 96/350/ EC of 24 May 1996, where it is exploited or marketed on economically advantageous terms and is capable of actually being used as a fuel without requiring prior processing.

(3) For the purposes of applying Article 15 of Direc- tive 75/442/EEC, as amended by Decision 96/350/EC, to the accidental spillage of hydrocarbons at sea caus- ing pollution of the coastline of a Member State: \u00a1 the national court may regard the seller of those hydrocarbons and charterer of the ship carrying them as a producer of that waste within the meaning of Arti- cle 1(b) of Directive 75/442/EEC, as amended by Deci- sion 96/350/EC, and thereby as a \u2018previous holder\u2019 for the purposes of applying the first part of the second indent of Article 15 of that directive, if that court, in the light of the elements which it alone is in a position to assess, reaches the conclusion that that seller-charterer contributed to the risk that the pollution caused by the shipwreck would occur, in particular if he failed to take measures to prevent such an incident, such as meas- ures concerning the choice of ship; \u00a1 if it happens that the cost of disposing of the waste produced by an accidental spillage of hydrocarbons at ",

In accordance with the \u2018polluter pays\u2019 principle, however, such a producer cannot be liable to bear that cost unless he has contributed by his conduct to the risk that the pollution caused by the shipwreck will occur.

(2) Articles 56 EC and 58 EC preclude legislation of a Member State, such as the legislation at issue in the main proceedings, which grants a concession to fiscal investment enterprises established in that Member State on account of tax deducted at source in another Mem- ber State or third country from dividends received by those enterprises, and reduces that concession where and to the extent to which the shareholders of those enterprises are natural or legal persons resident or established in other Member States or in third coun- tries, since such a reduction adversely affects all the shareholders of those enterprises without distinction. In that respect, whether the foreign shareholders of a fiscal investment enterprise are resident or established in a State with which the Member State of establish- ment of that enterprise has concluded a convention pro- viding for reciprocal crediting of tax deducted at source from dividends is irrelevant. (3) A restriction is covered by Article 57(1) EC as being a restriction on the movement of capital involv- ing direct investment in so far as it relates to invest- ments of any kind undertaken by natural or legal per- sons and which serve to establish or maintain lasting and direct links between the persons providing the cap- ital and the undertakings to which that capital is made available in order to carry out an economic activity.

Since no doubt has been expressed as regards the authenticity of that certificate and since it was drawn up in accordance with the stan- dard form set out in Annex IV to the regulation, oppo- sition to the recognition of the decision ordering return is not permitted and it is for the requested court only to declare the enforceability of the certified decision and to allow the immediate return of the child.

(3) Article 31(1) of Regulation (EC) No 2201/2003, in so far as it provides that neither the person against whom enforcement is sought, nor the child is, at this stage of the proceedings, entitled to make any submis- sions on the application, is not applicable to proceed- ings initiated for non-recognition of a judicial decision if no application for recognition has been lodged beforehand in respect of that decision. In such a situ- ation, the defendant, who is seeking recognition, is entitled to make such submissions. OJ C 223, 30.8.2008 1.37.15. 17.7.2008 \u2014 Case C-66/08 \u2014 Szymon Kozlowski. Article 4(6) of Council Framework Decision 2002/584/JHA of 13 June 2002, on the European arrest warrant and the surrender procedures between Member States, is to be interpreted to the effect that: \u00a1 a requested person is \u2018resident\u2019 in the executing Member State when he has established his actual place of residence there and he is \u2018staying\u2019 there when, fol- lowing a stable period of presence in that State, he has acquired connections with that State which are of a similar degree to those resulting from residence; \u00a1 in order to ascertain whether there are connections between the requested person and the executing Mem- ber State which lead to the conclusion that that person is covered by the term \u2018staying\u2019 within the meaning of Article 4(6), it is for the executing judicial authority to make an overall assessment of various objective factors characterising the situation of that person, including, in particular, the length, nature and conditions of his pres- ence and the family and economic connections which that person has with the executing Member State.

(2) It is for the referring court to determine whether the fact that a worker, in the situation of the applicant in the main proceedings, returns at the end of each working day to the family residence in the Member State concerned is relevant for the purposes of decid- ing whether such a worker satisfies the requirements for the grant of the child benefit in question in that State pursuant to its legislation.

(1) The fact that an employer states publicly that it will not recruit employees of a certain ethnic or racial ori- gin constitutes direct discrimination in respect of recruitment within the meaning of Article 2(2)(a) of Council Directive 2000/43/EC of 29 June 2000 imple- menting the principle of equal treatment between per- sons irrespective of racial or ethnic origin, such state- ments being likely strongly to dissuade certain candidates from submitting their candidature and, accordingly, to hinder their access to the labour market. (2) Public statements by which an employer lets it be known that under its recruitment policy it will not recruit any employees of a certain ethnic or racial ori- gin are sufficient for a presumption of the existence of a recruitment policy which is directly discriminatory within the meaning of Article 8(1) of Directive 2000/43/EC. It is then for that employer to prove that there was no breach of the principle of equal treatment. It can do so by showing that the undertaking\u2019s actual recruitment practice does not correspond to those state- ments. It is for the national court to verify that the facts ",

EU 7/8-2008 alleged are established and to assess the sufficiency of the evidence submitted in support of the employer\u2019s contentions that it has not breached the principle of equal treatment. (3) Article 15 of Directive 2000/43/EC requires that rules on sanctions applicable to breaches of national provisions adopted in order to transpose that directive must be effective, proportionate and dissuasive, even where there is no identifiable victim. OJ C 223, 30.8.2008 1.37.21. 17.7.2008 \u2014 Case C-303/06 \u2014 S. Cole- man v Attridge Law, Steve Law. (1) Council Directive 2000/78/EC of 27 November 2000 establishing a general framework for equal treat- ment in employment and occupation, and, in particu- lar, Articles 1 and 2(1) and (2)(a) thereof, must be interpreted as meaning that the prohibition of direct discrimination laid down by those provisions is not limited only to people who are themselves disabled. Where an employer treats an employee who is not him- self disabled less favourably than another employee is, has been or would be treated in a comparable situa- tion, and it is established that the less favourable treat- ment of that employee is based on the disability of his child, whose care is provided primarily by that employee, such treatment is contrary to the prohibition of direct discrimination laid down by Article 2(2)(a). (2) Directive 2000/78/EC, and, in particular, Articles 1 and 2(1) and (3) thereof, must be interpreted as mean- ing that the prohibition of harassment laid down by those provisions is not limited only to people who are themselves disabled. Where it is established that the unwanted conduct amounting to harassment which is suffered by an employee who is not himself disabled is related to the disability of his child, whose care is provided primarily by that employee, such conduct is contrary to the prohibition of harassment laid down by Article 2(3).

(1) Article 5(1) and (2) of First Council Directive 89/104/EEC of 21 December 1988 to approximate the laws of the Member States relating to trade marks and Article 3a(1) of Council Directive 84/450/EEC of 10 September 1984 concerning misleading and com- parative advertising, as amended by Directive 97/55/EC of the European Parliament and of the Coun- cil of 6 October 1997, must be interpreted to the effect that the proprietor of a registered trade mark is not enti- tled to prevent the use by a third party of a sign iden- tical with, or similar to, his mark, in a comparative advertisement which satisfies all the conditions, laid down in Article 3a(1) of Directive 84/450/EEC, under which comparative advertising is permitted. However, where the conditions required in Arti- cle 5(1)(b) of Directive 89/104 to prevent the use of a sign identical with, or similar to, a registered trade mark are met, a comparative advertisement in which that sign is used cannot satisfy the condition, laid down in Article 3a(1)(d) of Directive 84/450/EEC, as amended by Directive 97/55/EC, under which com- parative advertising is permitted. (2)Article 5(1)(b) of Directive 89/104/EEC is to be inter- preted as meaning that the proprietor of a registered trade mark is not entitled to prevent the use by a third party, in a comparative advertisement, of a sign similar to that mark in relation to goods or services identical with, or similar to, those for which that mark was registered where such use does not give rise to a likelihood of confusion on the part of the public, and that is so irrespective of whether or not the comparative advertisement satisfies all the conditions laid down in Article 3a of Directive 84/450/EEC, as amended by Directive 97/55/EC, under which comparative advertising is permitted.

(1) The validity of Directive 2005/35/EC of the Euro- pean Parliament and of the Council of 7 September 2005 on ship-source pollution and on the introduction of penalties for infringements cannot be assessed: \u00a1 either in the light of the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships, signed in London on 2 November 1973, as supplemented by the Protocol of 17 February 1978; \u00a1 or in the light of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, signed in Montego Bay on 10 De- cember 1982. (2) Examination of the fourth question has revealed nothing capable of affecting the validity of Article 4 of Directive 2005/35/EC in the light of the general principle of legal certainty.

In contrast, in that same context, it is not contrary to those provisions for a Member State to decide to suspend that right if it is clear from entries in that licence or from other incon- testable information supplied by that other Member State that the condition of residence imposed in Arti- cle 7(1)(b) of that directive was not satisfied at the moment when that licence was issued.

        "Bull. EU 7/8-2008 159 38. Community institutions European Parliament General aspects 1.38.1. European Parliament resolution on the defence of its prerogatives before the national courts. Adopted by the European Parliament on 8 July. Parliament emphasised that it does not have direct instruments with which to defend its prerogatives before the national courts since it can neither par- ticipate in national legal proceedings nor directly bring an action before the Court of Justice to defend its decisions; it cannot even initiate, as a last resort, infringement proceedings against a Member State, since only the Commission has the power to do so. In order not to hamper its effectiveness as a polit- ical and legislative body, Parliament considered that it would be advisable to strengthen the meas- ures to protect parliamentary prerogatives not by amending the EC Treaty but by attempting to extrapolate from the experience of the national parliaments remedies that are appropriate to its specific requirements. Accordingly, Parliament called on the Commission to take account of its requests to bring infringement proceedings against any Member State for breach of parlia- mentary prerogatives. It also suggested that the statutes of the Court of Justice be amended in order to give the European Parliament the right to submit its observations to the Court in all cases in which, directly or indirectly, its prerogatives are called into question. Finally, it considered it advis- able to foster a policy of cooperation between the European Parliament and national courts, along the lines of that which is already producing good results in a number of Member States. Rules of procedure 1.38.2. European Parliament decision on amend- ment of Parliament\u2019s rules of procedure in light of the proposals by the Working Party on Parlia- mentary Reform concerning the work of the ple- nary and initiative reports. Reference: Rules of procedure of the European Parliament: OJ L 44, 15.2.2005 Adopted by the European Parliament on 8 July. The main amendments concern: \u00a1 the reform of the procedures concerning written questions to the Council or the Commis- sion: due to the workload that the number of these questions imposes, the modification estab- lishes that the president of the Parliament will rule on their admissibility; in order to avert any abuses, provisions are also introduced to set aside identical or similar questions, as well as the non- admissibility of questions making use of offen- sive language; \u00a1 the possibility for short presentations of reports not needing a full debate (mostly own- initiative reports): these reports will be presented to the plenary by the rapporteur during a specific time slot; this presentation would only be fol- lowed by an oral reaction by the Commission, if it so wishes; Members will, however, have the opportunity to hand in written interventions; \u00a1 the own-initiative reports: a number of amendments clarify and consolidate the rules with regards to the handling of own-initiative reports. Among others it is stipulated that instead of tabling individual amendments in the future a political group or a group of at least 40 Members may table an alternative motion for resolution; \u00a1 the increase of Parliament\u2019s visibility (allo- cation of speaking time): discussions on legisla- tive texts will be introduced and concluded by the rapporteur; after the statement given by the Com- mission and/or the Council and by the speakers who are officially designated by their political groups, a part of the debate could be reserved for interventions and questions by those Members who have been attending and participating in the assembly.

        "European Parliament 160 Bull. EU 7/8-2008 1.38.3. European Parliament decision on amend- ments of Rule 29 of Parliament's rules of proce- dure \u2014 Formation of political groups. Reference: Rules of procedure of the European Parliament: OJ L 44, 15.2.2005 Adopted by the European Parliament on 9 July. At present, a political group can be formed in the Parliament by a minimum of 20 Members (or 2.5% of Parliament\u2019s membership), who also rep- resent at least one fifth of the Member States (i.e. six countries). In order to avoid an excessive frag- mentation of the Parliament, the House agreed to raise the threshold to 25 Members (3.1% of the total membership), representing at least seven countries. New rules were also introduced on the possibility for a political group to continue to exist, under certain conditions, until Parliament\u2019s next constitutive sitting, if the group falls below the required threshold. The adopted changes will come into effect after the June 2009 European elections. 1.38.4. European Parliament decision on amend- ment of Parliament\u2019s rules of procedure with respect to the approval of the Commission ( \u2192 point 1.1.9). Strasbourg, 7 to 10 July 1.38.5. In a relatively consensual session, Parlia- ment proceeded with a heavy agenda of important political debates and strategic legislative files. The political highlight of the session was the debate on the French Presidency\u2019s work pro- gramme. Mr Sarkozy gave a very well-received presentation and offered Members a frank polit- ical debate in plenary on a broad range of issues. He stressed the need to find European solutions, fully acknowledging the roles of both the Parlia- ment and the Commission, and insisted that Europe being of variable geometry should remain the last option. Specifically on the issue of the Lisbon Treaty, he urged that Ireland should not be left behind, citing the precedent of Denmark to illustrate how a problem may evolve over time. President Barroso warmly welcomed France\u2019s \u2018return\u2019 to the EU and put into perspective the need for European action to meet a series of global challenges. The four priorities of the Pres- idency (energy/climate, immigration, defence, and the common agriculture policy) were well received by Members whilst also triggering ques- tions. Prioritisation was also the major theme earlier in the week when Parliament set out its first orien- tations on the draft budget for 2009 in view of the first conciliation, in which the Commission was criticised for not having matched the politi- cal priorities sufficiently in the preliminary draft budget. Parliament foresees better funding for cli- mate change, immigration policy and growth/ employment as well as specific funding for food aid and SMEs. Whilst not scheduled for the plenary, Commis- sioners S pidla and Vassiliou presented, respec- tively, the social package and the cross-border health initiative to the relevant parliamentary committees (Committee on Employment and Social Affairs and Committee on the Environ- ment, Public Health and Food Safety) and received broad support. The horizontal anti-dis- crimination proposal was warmly supported by all (except for German EPP Members). The directive on the application of patients\u2019 rights in cross-border healthcare was well received across party lines, particularly by PSE and ALDE, although some regretted that it came with some delay. A more heated political confrontation took place on Italian measures related to Roma. The debate was not exempt of some Italian infighting and, in the face of the uncertainty of the situation in terms of legal and political steps taken and to be taken, the Commission was asked to inform the Parliament as soon as possible on the situation in Italy. Vice-President Barrot gave a statement con- firming the position of the Commission as set out earlier during the week by Commissioner S pidla and informed Parliament about contacts with Ital- ian authorities and their commitment to provide detailed information by the end of July. Despite some attempts to postpone the vote on the related resolution, the vote was maintained, and the final resolution was adopted by a comfortable major- ity (336/220/77). The three institutions also moved efficiently to allow adoption, in accordance with the emer- gency procedure, of Parliament\u2019s position on the proposal for a regulation containing emergency measures to address the fuel crisis in the fisheries ",

In assess- ing the ECB\u2019s 2007 report, Parliament gave a rather late but very positive assessment of the Bank\u2019s handling of the early phases of the finan- cial crisis \u2014 but also called for more trans- parency, reinforced supervision and questioned whether the Bank\u2019s policies were sufficient to steer clear of stagflation and lead an active exchange rate policy. Mr Trichet for the ECB, and Mr Juncker for the Euro Group, defended the sta- tus quo whilst recognising a need to review supervision once planned measures had been implemented and also called on Member States to play their role in fighting inflation. Parliament also adopted a resolution on sovereign wealth funds on the basis of oral questions. The Council and the Commission highlighted the ongoing work of the IMF and OECD to establish voluntary codes of conduct but the resolution adopted maintains calls on the Commission to monitor developments and consider ways of improving transparency and governance. Parliament examined 30 legislative files in total, including several top priorities for the Commis- sion. In this regard, the House supported the inclusion of aviation in the European emissions trading scheme. For the wider climate change ini- tiative, however, developments in the margins of the session only accentuated the uncertainties about the prospects for the package as a whole and it appears increasingly likely that Parliament is moving towards the splitting of the energy/ climate package starting with an early first read- ing on renewable energy. On the complementary internal energy market package, Parliament adopted its first reading posi- tion on the gas-related proposals (the electricity proposals were dealt with in June). Parliament included as expected an alternative to ownership unbundling, modelled closely on the alternative already developed in Council albeit reinforced by a trustee to safeguard the independence of trans- mission system operators. In response to the Council\u2019s announced timetable (political agree- ment in October, followed by a second reading) some Members believed that a more ambitious timing would allow for an agreement already before the end of the year. The telecoms package was voted at committee level, confirming by large majorities the inten- tion to propose significant amendments to the Commission\u2019s proposals. However, technical complexity, sometimes chaotic voting and unre- solved issues between Parliament committees led to the decision by the Conference of Presidents to postpone the final plenary vote on the package to the second session of September, whilst the debate remains scheduled for the first session of September. Further legislative files on food additives, coor- dination of social security systems, air ticket pric- ing and the Community railways package were largely consensual and supportive of the Com- mission\u2019s proposals. After a controversial debate, pitching the two large political groups against the small and very small, the House adopted the Corbett report on the formation of political groups including the compromise amendment which increases the threshold from 20 to 25 Members coming from at least seven Member States. Parliament approved, by a large majority, modi- fications of its rules of procedure which trans- lates the first package of Parliament reforms con- cerning mainly own-initiative reports and guidelines for written parliamentary questions. The debate was largely consensual, critical voices came only from the Independence and Democ- racy Group and non-attached members. Vice- President Wallstr\u00f6m underlined the importance of admissibility criteria as well as the principle of equal treatment between the Commission and the Council with regard to the order of interventions and speaking time. Parliament also endorsed, by large majority and without debate, procedures for approval of the Commission with provisions on the hearing pro- cedure, through modifications introduced in Par- liament\u2019s rules of procedure. The Commission made a statement recalling that the procedures to be applied in different cases (approval of the Commission at the beginning of the mandate, replacement of commissioners and substantial portfolio changes) had to respect the treaties and ",
        "Council 162 Bull. EU 7/8-2008 the framework agreement and should be differ- entiated accordingly. The Commission reserved its right to settle the relevant procedures on a case-by-case basis. Parliament adopted positions on a wide range of external policy issues, which were generally con- cluded by resolutions enjoying broad support. It adopted in particular the report on the enlarge- ment strategy, which proposes to look for an intermediary solution between the European neighbourhood policy and full integration into the EU. Some EPP-ED Members suggested that an alternative be investigated after the accession of Croatia, applying in particular for Turkey. Com- missioner Rehn considered that the EU should not impose new intermediate stages before can- didacy or accession for the western Balkans and Turkey as this would create doubts about the EU\u2019s commitment and weaken the incentive nec- essary for reform. The planned gas pipeline in the Baltic Sea between Russia and Germany continued to pro- voke serious concerns in the Parliament; a reso- lution based on a broad majority called on the Commission to ensure an independent environ- mental impact assessment. Finally the discussion on the Green Paper \u2018Towards a new culture of urban mobility\u2019 gave rise to some concerns relating to subsidiarity; sev- eral PPE-DE Members warned that according to them there was no EU competence and thus no need for EU action in this area. The session also gave the opportunity to proceed to the signature of the Galileo regulation by the Council and Parliament. On this occasion Galileo was presented by President P\u00f6ttering as a great illustration of a European project realised in unison. Council 2882nd meeting 1.38.6.

The Council took a decision on the adoption by Slovakia of the euro as from 1 January 2009 and set the permanent conversion rate for the Slovak koruna to the euro. The decision will extend the euro area from 15 to 16 Member States, allowing six months for Slovakia to prepare for the changeover. The Council concluded an excessive deficit pro- cedure concerning Poland and at the same time opened a procedure concerning the United King- dom. It adopted opinions on Belgium\u2019s stability programme and Poland\u2019s convergence programme. In the course of a discussion on the rise in oil prices, it reached political agreement on the weekly publication of oil stocks. The Council also adopted conclusions on IASB governance and on initiatives taken following the recent turmoil on the financial markets, concern- ing in particular transparency and rating agencies, including their registration at European level. 2883rd meeting 1.38.7.

It held a policy debate on the \u2018health check\u2019 of the common agricultural policy reform. The Council adopted a regulation concluding a protocol provided for in the partnership agree- ment between the European Community and the Islamic Republic of Mauritania and a regulation reviewing fishing opportunities for certain fish stocks for 2008.

The Council welcomed the arrest of Radovan Karadzic, who has been indicted by the Interna- tional Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) for genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes. It felt that this development illustrated the commitment of the new government in Bel- grade to contribute to peace and stability in the Balkans region, and was a significant step in Ser- bia\u2019s rapprochement with the EU. The Council encouraged the Serbian government to continue along this road. It regretted that the people of Zimbabwe were unable to vote freely in the election on 27 June, the result of which the EU regards as illegitimate. It decided to penalise those responsible for the campaign of violence which marked the elec- tions, by extending the restrictive measures (a visa ban and the freezing of funds) to more indi- viduals, and by adding entities linked to them. The Council also decided to reinforce the travel ban arrangements and declared that it was ready to continue giving its support to any credible mediation effort which might lead to the estab- lishment of a transitional government and to the holding as soon as possible of free, pluralist and transparent elections. The Council also held detailed discussions on Ukraine, with a view to the EU\u2013Ukraine summit to be held on 9 September 2008 and in the con- text of the ongoing negotiations on an enhanced agreement, and on the Middle East and the Union\u2019s contribution to efforts to support the peace process, in the presence of the representa- tive of the Quartet, Tony Blair. 2887th meeting 1.38.11.

Commission: Mr Barrot, Vice-President. The Council held a policy debate on two Com- mission proposals concerning the conditions of entry and residence of third-country nationals for the purposes of highly qualified employment and sanctions against employers of illegally staying third-country nationals. These two proposals form part of the EU\u2019s general policy on migration and aim to combat a major pull factor for illegal immigration and the exploitation of migrants. It agreed on a general approach to a draft decision on the strengthening of Eurojust. The purpose of the text is to strengthen Eurojust through the fol- lowing steps: creating a common minimum basis of powers for national members; creating an emergency coordination mechanism; improving the transmission of information to Eurojust; improving the national base of Eurojust; and strengthening judicial cooperation with third countries by enabling Eurojust to post liaison magistrates to those countries. The Council also agreed on a general approach to a draft decision on the European judicial network in criminal matters. Finally, the Council took note that the United Kingdom wished to accept, in its entirety, the reg- ulation on the law applicable to contractual obli- gations (Rome I). The Minister for Justice of the Netherlands, Mr Hirsch Ballin, stressed the importance of developing a proposal for training of the judiciary. Extraordinary meeting 1.38.12. General affairs and external relations (Brussels, 13 August) Previous meeting: point 1.38.10 of this Bulletin President: Mr Kouchner, Minister for Foreign and European Affairs of France. Commission: Mr Rehn. The Council discussed in depth the situation in Georgia on the basis of a Presidency presentation of the efforts which had led to agreement between the parties. In particular, it: \u00a1 recalled that the European Union had expressed its grave concern at recent develop- ments in Georgia; \u00a1 welcomed the agreement subscribed to by the parties on the basis of the mediation efforts carried out by the Union; \u00a1 called on the parties to honour all the com- mitments, beginning with an effective ceasefire, and to ensure that they were implemented effec- tively and in good faith both on the ground and in the relevant forums; \u00a1 emphasised the Union\u2019s commitment to con- tribute actively to effective implementation of these principles; \u00a1 considered that the European Union must be prepared to commit itself, including on the ground, to support every effort, including those of the UN and the OSCE, with a view to a peaceful and lasting solution to the conflict in Georgia.

        "European Economic and Social Committee 168 Bull. EU 7/8-2008 European Economic and Social Committee 446th plenary session 1.38.17. The European Economic and Social Committee held its 446th plenary session, on 9 and 10 July, chaired by Mr Dimitriadis, President. The session was marked by the presence of Mr Dermagne, President of the Economic and Social Committee of France (CESF). The Par- liament adopted 30 opinions, including nine exploratory opinions and six initiative opinions. In the social field, an exploratory opinion on a new social action programme was adopted for strengthening the social dialogue. Synergies have to be set up between all existing instruments. It is also appropriate to reallocate the financial resources of the current budget to support the pro- gramme. An opinion on the special situation of the islands (\u2018Better integration into the internal market, a key factor of cohesion and growth for the islands\u2019) led to a strong argument in favour of their spe- cific character, inviting the Commission not to focus on a uniform policy. A better definition of the islands should be clarified: the enlarged EU includes \u2018Member States \u2014 islands\u2019 which, in addition to numerous differences with the island regions of other countries, show characteristics profoundly different from dry land. Concerning the Irish referendum, the exploratory opinion on the national and European dimension in the communication on Europe reignited a glimmer of hope in the rows of Parliament. Three points were put forward: the importance of sim- plifying the language used in communication, the need for a better coordinated communication pol- icy between the various levels and the urgency to target young generations (through, in particular, a school syllabus of civics including a common base of knowledge and European values). An opinion on sustainable and competitive tourism approved the engagement of the Com- mission to implement this new policy through dialogue, cooperation and the launching of sup- port projects as well as coordination between the various actors concerned. However, the Commit- tee considers that the Commission can and has to play an active role and take the lead in the launch- ing of numerous European scope initiatives. As regards environment, the Committee concen- trated on an exploratory opinion on the relation- ship between climate change and agriculture at the European level, with some Members consid- ering that the opinion was not balanced enough. The Committee\u2019s greatest concern was with respect to the negative effects that climate change will have on European agriculture and on the strength of the economy in numerous rural areas. Moreover, the Committee adopted an opinion on the division of efforts in the reduction of green- house gases between now and 2020. It welcomes favourably the Commission\u2019s initiative and stresses the crucial role of civil society in the implementation of the decision and the respect of the commitments entered into by various coun- tries. Moreover, it invites the Commission to envisage the imposition of a fine to Member States whenever the quantity of emissions exceeds the authorised limit. Several opinions concerned economic matters. The opinion on the reasons for the difference between perceived inflation and real inflation stresses the different impact of inflation on house- holds according to their incomes. According to the Committee, one must identify which income class benefits from rises in wages and deplore the negative actions of speculators. The matter of services to companies was dis- cussed between employers and workers. The cor- responding opinion recommends the creation of a high-level group on services in companies, a sectoral study on challenges generated by new types of jobs, the promotion of research, tech- nology and innovation programmes, and the adoption of standards after a detailed consulta- tion of the users. Still in the field of companies, the construction industry was the subject of an exploratory opin- ion which recommends the setting up of a \u2018tool- box\u2019 giving to customers the broadest and the clearest set of options possible so that they can choose the contractual tool meeting their need. Moreover, the rapporteur stressed the importance of adapting efficiently to constraints related to ",
        "European Economic and Social Committee Bull. EU 7/8-2008 169 sustainable development and energy saving, whilst retaining the means of coping with com- petition external to the EU. As regards transport, the opinion on a rail net- work with freight priority was located in line with the diagnosis established by the Commission, even if the Committee considered that its pro- posals had a \u2018taste of the unfinished\u2019, taking account in particular of the absence of measures of financing on a European scale to cope with the infrastructure investments which are necessary in the current economic situation. The Committee welcomed favourably the Com- mission document on a European ports policy, which puts forward mainly non-binding legal measures. Moreover, it supports the general importance attached to the introduction of a sta- ble climate of investment and of a favourable social environment in the ports, from the sus- tainable development of ports to the uniform application of the provisions of the treaty. In the field of road transport, the working time of independent drivers was the subject of an addi- tional opinion of the Committee who call for the latter to be included in the scope of Directive 2002/15/EC in accordance with the provisions of its Article 2 (as from 23 March 2009). According to the majority of the participants, such an exten- sion is necessary in order to promote road safety, contribute to equitable competition and improve the working conditions of mobile and independ- ent workers, and in particular their physical and mental health. The Committee approved the opinion on the European Year of Creativity and Innovation (2009). It expresses its full support to all meas- ures of encouragement for creativity and the pro- motion of innovation, developed by citizens of the European Union. It regrets, however, that the European Year 2009 was organised in a relatively short space of time and that the Commission proposal does not contain any concrete budget estimate. The opinion on the role of civil society in Com- munity programmes of pre-accession aid in Albania almost achieved unanimity. The Com- mittee considers that it would be appropriate that delegation services of the Commission in Alba- nia pay more attention and resources to the action of civil society as a whole, in particular in the rural and less-developed areas of the country. In the institutional field, despite the uncertain- ties relating to the ratification of the Lisbon Treaty, it was decided to send institutions the information paper on the impact of the Lisbon Treaty on the functioning of the internal mar- ket; this report can serve as a base for the future. Mr Dermagne illustrated the priorities of the President in Office. The work agenda of the French ESC, in conjunction with the Committee, plans to approach the revision of the directive regulating the works councils and to study in greater detail the flexicurity concept. With glob- alisation in the background, the energy crisis and tensions on the agricultural food product markets, the Union must activate its guiding role in the maintenance of the social dimension with respect to third countries and with respect to international authorities. The speaker also regretted the absence of the Economic and Social Committee in five Member States of the Union and highlighted the role played by the Committees European network in the positive development of Euromed and in the Barcelona process. The Committee decided to create an observatory on the Lisbon strategy, whose activity will be car- ried out until October 2010 and which will work in close conjunction with its ECO section. ",
