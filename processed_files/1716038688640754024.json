        "4 Summary This summary sheet provides an overview of recent developments in the social situation in the EU, based on the results from the latest edition of the Social Protection Performance Monitor (SPPM) dashboard, a tool which uses a set of key EU social indicators for monitoring developments in the social situation in the European Union. A more detailed assessment of the recent trends and related analysis is available in the 2014 Social Protection Committee (SPC) annual report on the social situation in the EU 1 . This year's update of the Social Protection Performance Monitor shows little improvement in the overall social situation in the EU, with continued disparities across Member States (MS) and a worsening situation in several. Even though trends are more mixed than in previous years, with 11 Member States registering statistically significant falls in poverty and social exclusion in 2013, around a 1/3 still saw significant rises, and the most recent figures for the EU at-risk-of poverty or social exclusion rate point to stagnation at a high level. These latest figures on living and income conditions in the EU show that the EU is not making any progress towards achieving its Europe 2020 poverty and social exclusion target of lifting at least 20 million people from poverty and social exclusion by 2020. In 2013 there were 4.8 million more people living in poverty or social exclusion in the EU28 compared to 2008, and a total of 122.6 million or close to 1 in 4 Europeans. Compared to the results from last year\u2019s SPPM update, there is a more mixed picture across the EU but with the following negative social trends to watch for the latest period being identified in around a third or more of all Member States: \uf0b7 increases in the risk of poverty and especially its depth for the overall population; \uf0b7 continued rise in the share of the population in (quasi-) jobless households; \uf0b7 increase in the share of the working poor; \uf0b7 declines in real gross household disposable income; \uf0b7 increasing housing cost overburden rate. At the same time, long-term unemployment and low employment opportunities for youth (15-24) and young adults remain major challenges in the EU labour market. Moreover, poverty and social exclusion have risen substantially over recent years in most Member States, affecting particularly the working age population and, by extension, children. Although some of these challenges may have recently eased slightly, they remain substantial and need to be tackled urgently. The above-mentioned negative trends are partly balanced by positive developments in the labour market participation of older workers and the further reduction in the rate of early school leavers. Owing to the structural stabilising role of social protection, and pensions in particular, the income and living conditions of the elderly continue to improve relative to the rest of the population. 1 http://ec.europa.eu/social/main.jsp?catId=738&langId=en&pubId=7744&visible=0 ",

Eurostat calculations on statistical significance of net change have been used for the following indicators: for the period 2012-2013 \u2013 AROPE, AROP, SMD, (quasi-)jobless households (i.e. VLWI households), persistent poverty rate, IWP, Children AROPE, AROPE 65+, AROP in (quasi-)jobless households, housing cost overburden rate, for the period 2008-2013 \u2013 AROPE, persistent poverty rate. In all the remaining cases (except for real GHDI growth where any non-zero result is shown as significant) a 1pp threshold has been used for all indicators but the indicators based on ratios and the healthy life years indicators for which a 5% threshold has been used as specified in the SPPM methodological paper approved by the SPC. ii) No 2013 data for IE for SILC-based indicators, so for these figures refer to 2012 and changes are presented for the period 2008-2012 only; iii) Breaks in series in 2013 for all EU-SILC income-based indicators for ES, so no latest year changes are shown while longer term changes are presented for the period 2008-2012 only; iv) For UK, changes in the EU-SILC survey vehicle and institution in 2012 might have affected the results on trends since 2008 and interpretation of data on the longer term trend must therefore be particularly cautious.

        "9 Detailed review of the social trends identif ied in the 2014 SPPM dashboard Although the EU has resumed economic growth, the recovery remains subdued. Despite the weak macroeconomic background, employment has shown a small but consistent growth in the EU since mid-2013 and in the large majority of EU Member States (although this is yet to be fully reflected in all social indicators). Nevertheless, labour market and social conditions remain extremely challenging. Compared to the results from last year\u2019s edition of the SPPM, there is a more nuanced picture across the EU with more mixed signs of developments in the living conditions of the population across Member States, although trends in the share of (quasi-) jobless households, the risk and depth of poverty, the evolution in household disposable income and housing cost overburden remain mainly negative. This is reflected in the analysis of the key social indicators included in the Social Protection Performance Monitor, which identify the following main negative trends to watch (i.e. where at least 1/3 of Member States show a significant deterioration in the given indicator) for the most recent period 2012-2013 (Figure 1): \uf0b7 increases in the risk of poverty for the overall population (registered in 8 MS) and in the depth of poverty as proxied by the poverty gap (registered in 10 MS) \uf0b7 continued rises in the share of (quasi-) jobless households (registered in 11 MS) \uf0b7 increasing housing cost overburden rate (in 9 MS) \uf0b7 declines in real gross household disposable income (in 11 MS) \uf0b7 increases in the number of working poor (8 MS). These negative social trends are partly balanced by positive developments in the following areas: \uf0b7 rising labour market participation of older workers (increase of the employment rate for 55-64 year olds in 18 MS) \uf0b7 improving income and living conditions situation of the elderly (improvements in 15 MS) \uf0b7 some improvement in the severe material deprivation rate (in 11 MS) and the risk of poverty or social exclusion for the overall population (in 11 MS) ",
        "10 \uf0b7 further reductions in the rate of early school leavers (in 10 MS) \uf0b7 some improvement in the situation of the working poor (in 7 MS) and in the risk of poverty or social exclusion among children (8 MS).

As a result, income related indicators are not comparable to 2012 for this country and ES has therefore not been considered in the trends to watch for these indicators. iii) For the \u201cpersistent at- risk-of-poverty rate\u201d most figures are for the change 2011-2012, but where figures for 2013 are available (AT, CZ, DK, EE, FI, HU, MT and SI) the changes 2012-2013 are used.

Of particular note is the number of countries which have experienced significant rises in long-term unemployment and reduced employment opportunities for youth, together with the substantial increases in poverty and social exclusion over recent years in most Member States, affecting particularly the working age population and, by extension, children. The full list of areas with the most substantial deterioration are as follows: \uf0b7 youth exclusion (significant increases in NEETs and youth unemployment ratio in almost all MS) \uf0b7 (long term) exclusion from the labour market (increases in the long term unemployment rate and in the share of the population in (quasi-) jobless households in more than 2/3 of MS), together with rises in the poverty risk for (quasi-) jobless households in 14 MS \uf0b7 child poverty and social exclusion (with 19 MS registering increases with reference to 2008) \uf0b7 increasing income inequality (in 13 MS) \uf0b7 rising housing cost overburden rate for households (in 15 MS) \uf0b7 declines in real gross household disposable income (in 11 MS) \uf0b7 increases in self-reported unmet need for medical care (9 MS) \uf0b7 increase in the level and the depth of poverty and deterioration in living conditions (increases in the at-risk-of-poverty rate in 1/3 of MS and in the severe material deprivation rate and the poverty gap in around 2/3 of MS, increases in the overall at risk of poverty or social exclusion rate in \u00bd of all MS). The dashboard indicators show there have been also a number of improvements, notably in the areas of increasing number of healthy life years, especially among men, and significant decreases in the number of early school leavers in Europe (in 20 MS). The labour market situation of older workers has also improved markedly, as evidenced by improvements in the employment rate for the age group 55-64 in 2/3 of Member States. The relative situation of the elderly aged 65 and over also shows clear signs of improvement in almost all MS, with decreases in the number of elderly living in poverty or social exclusion as well as the improvement of their income situation with respect to the rest of the population. However, this trend should be read with great caution as it does not necessarily show improvement in absolute terms. As pension income remained stable during the economic crisis while the working age population suffered from substantial income loss (wage decreases, job loss, decrease in benefit levels), the relative, but not necessarily the absolute, position of the elderly has improved, highlighting the important role of pension systems.

        "14 Annex 1: SPPM methodology The Council endorsed on 4 October 2012 the main features of a new instrument, proposed by the Social Protection Committee (SPC), called the \"Social Protection Performance Monitor\" (SPPM) aimed at contributing to strengthening the monitoring of the social situation and the development of social protection policies in the EU, according to the Treaty mandate (art. 160 of TFEU) of the SPC to work in this area. What is the objective? The objective of the SPPM dashboard is to identify annual \"social trends to watch\" and \"positive recent social trends\" in the EU, common to several Member States, which can stimulate in-depth review and targeted multilateral surveillance. Given the objective of the dashboard, the focus is on both most recent changes and changes in comparison to 2008, as the base year for monitoring progress for the social aspects of the European 2020 Strategy. What is the basis of the SPPM dashboard? The SPPM makes use of the EU portfolio of social indicators, recognizing effectively the importance of the overarching portfolio as a summary set/first tier of indicators to be used for monitoring the major social trends in EU countries across the relevant social policy areas. How are trends identified? The indicators are monitored on the basis of levels and evolutions. In order to assess the statistical significance of the year-to-year changes and the changes in comparison to the reference year 2008, use is made of accuracy estimates, developed by Eurostat in cooperation with the Second Network for the analysis of EU-SILC (Net-SILC 2). For the indicators defined as ratios (e.g. S80/S20, aggregate replacement ratio, median relative income ratio of elderly people), further work to produce estimates of the significance of net changes is ongoing. Similarly, further work on the LFS- based indicators is also necessary. Where such estimates are not yet available, specific tentative criteria have been agreed, awaiting further statistical developments. The current situation regarding the statistical significance rules applied for each SPPM indicator is summarised in the following table. A trend needs to be evident in a certain number of Member States in order to qualify as a \"social trend to watch\" or a \"positive recent social trend.\" The general criterion of at least 1/3 of Member States is used in order to ensure that there is a significant basis for conclusions. However, a certain level of flexibility is kept and if a strong trend is evident in a smaller number of countries or this is the case for a specific group of countries, it could still be considered as a \"trend to watch\" or a \"positive trend.\" ",
        "15 How are the SPPM results used? At the beginning of each year, the SPPM results are presented in the annual SPC social situation report and are endorsed by the March EPSCO Council. On the basis of the identified social trends to watch, the SPC undertakes thematic in-depth reviews in the second half of the year where drivers and policy solutions for the identified challenges are discussed among Member States.

        "20 Definition of the in-work at-risk-of-poverty rate Individuals who are classified as employed, defined here as being in work for over half of the year and who are at risk of poverty, i.e. live with an equivalised disposable income after social transfers below 60% of the national median equivalised disposable income. In defining in-work (monetary) poverty, the income for people who are employed is calculated for households, but the poverty status is assigned to the individual. This means that in-work poverty, when measured, is influenced by both the total disposable income (including non-wage income) and the household composition. The assumption of equal sharing of resources within households (giving the so-called equivalised income) that underlies the definition of monetary income poverty means that the economic well-being of individuals depends on the total resources contributed by all members of the households. In this respect some income can move from one household member to the other without affecting the actual income of the individual. Hence, measuring attachment to the labour market at the level of households provides a better indicator of the welfare implications associated with labour market status than individual employment rates. Income/disposable income Household income comes from different sources. Employment is generally the main source of income but not the only one. Individuals may receive transfers from the state (e.g. unemployment benefits, pensions, etc.); property income (e.g. dividends from financial assets, etc.); and income from other sources (e.g. rental income from property or from the sale of property or goods, etc.). Employed In EU SILC, people are defined as employed based on the self-declared economic status. Working full year/less than full year Working full year corresponds to working during the total number of months for which information on the activity status has been provided. Less than full year corresponds to working for more than half, but less than all, the numbers of the months for which information on activity status is provided. ",

It is produced by the Social Protection Committee as part of its work of monitoring social situations in the Member States. The 2014 dashboard results paint a picture of little improvement in the overall social situation in the EU, with ongoing disparities across Member States and, for some, a worsening situation. Unemployment, poverty and social exclusion again stand out as areas of concern, despite early signs of economic recovery.
