        "EN 1 EN EXPLANATORY MEMORANDUM 1. CONTEXT OF THE PROPOSAL \u2022 Reasons for and objectives of the proposal The European Green Deal 1 (\u2018the Green Deal\u2019) launched a new strategy to transform the European Union into a sustainable, fair and prosperous society, with a modern, circular and competitive economy and zero net emissions of greenhouse gases in 2050. It underlines the Commission\u2019s c ommitment to tackle climate change and environmental degradation and to deliver on the objectives adopted under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (the \u2018Paris Agreement\u2019) to keep the global temperature increase well below 2\u00b0C and pursue efforts to keep it to 1.5\u00b0C. The cost of non-action on climate and environmental policy would be immense for people, in particular those in vulnerable situations, in terms of living standards, health and wellbeing. With a view to the path to net zero emissions, the need for a fair transition is an integral part of the Green Deal which underlined that no person and no place should be left behind. In June 2021, the Council of the European Union and the European Parliament adopted the \u2018European Climate Law\u2019 2 , which sets out the binding objective of climate neutrality in the Union by 2050 3 , and a binding intermediate target of a net domestic reduction in greenhouse gas emissions of at least 55% compared to 1990 levels by 2030. To deliver on these targets, the Commission proposed the \u2018Fit for 55\u2019 legislative package in July 2021. The package comprises a coherent set of measures in legislative proposals. Among these, the package puts forward a proposal for establishing a new Social Climate Fund 4 of EUR 72.2 billion for the period 2025-2032 to support vulnerable households, transport users and micro-enterprises affected by the introduction of emissions trading for fuels used in road transport and buildings. Fairness and solidarity are defining principles of the European Green Deal. At the international level, Member States have endorsed in particular the UN Sustainable Development Goals and the Paris Agreement, which refers to \u2018 the imperatives of a just transition of the workforce and the creation of decent work and quality jobs \u2019 . This is confirmed and i n line with Article 2(1) of the Paris Agreement, the European Council\u2019s Strategic Agenda 2019-2024 and Article 2(2) of the European Climate Law, as well as the European Pillar of Social Rights. The International Labour Organisation (ILO) Guidelines for a just transition towards environmentally sustainable economies and societies for all also provide an internationally established policy framework for a just transition. Furthermore, Member States and social partners endorsed the 2018 Solidarity and Just Transition Silesia Declaration, adopted at COP-24 in Katowice, and the 2021 Declaration on Supporting the Conditions for a Just Transition Internationally, adopted at COP-26 in Glasgow. 1 Communication from the Commission \u2018The European Green Deal\u2019, COM(2019) 640 final. 2 Regulation (EU) 2021/1119 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 30 June 2021 establishing the framework for achieving climate neutrality and amending Regulations (EC) No 401/2009 and (EU) 2018/1999 (\u2018European Climate Law\u2019) (OJ L 243 , 9.7.2021, p. 1). 3 In pursuit of the long-term temperature goal set out in point (a) of Article 2(1) of the Paris Agreement. 4 Proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing a Climate Social Fund, COM(2021) 568 final.

        "EN 2 EN Policy actions to support people and their active participation are required for a successful green transition. The vision for a fair transition towards a strong, climate-neutral Social Europe reflects the 20 principles of the European Pillar of Social Rights, which were proclaimed at the Gothenburg Summit in November 2017, and comprise the \u2018 social rulebook \u2019 for fair and well-functioning labour markets and welfare systems in 21st century Europe. The implementation of the Pillar will support a fair transition, which is key for ensuring social cohesion. The European Pillar of Social Rights Action Plan 5 aims at rallying forces at all levels to turn the principles into concrete actions. It sets three EU headline targets for 2030 in the areas of employment, skills, and poverty reduction, which were welcomed by EU leaders in the Porto Declaration of May and by the European Council in June 2021. It emphasises the need to strengthen the European social dimension across all policies of the Union to ensure that the transition to climate-neutrality is socially fair and just. Accompanied with the right policies, the transition could create around 1 million jobs in the EU by 2030 6 and 2 million jobs by 2050 7 . It could create particularly middle-skilled, middle- paying jobs 8 , with varying impacts across countries, regions and sectors. This could contribute to mitigating labour market polarisation stemming from other megatrends, notably digitisation, to raising incomes and to reducing poverty overall 9 . As highlighted in the impact assessments of the 2030 Climate Target Plan and the legislative proposals of the \u2018Fit for 55\u2019 package, significant labour reallocation within and across sectors will require large-scale investment in reskilling and upskilling. For example, while it is estimated that 160,000 additional construction jobs could be created in the EU by 2030 through the climate transition 10 , currently skills gaps are visible in occupations related to green design, technologies and materials in this sector. The right accompanying policies can reduce - and even prevent - energy poverty, which stems from a combination of low income, a high share of disposable income spent on energy and poor energy efficiency. In addition, they can promote access to affordable and low-emission transport and mobility options, tackle social exclusion and socio-economic, regional and health inequalities, improve health and well- being, and promote equality, in general and also for disadvantaged persons. To fully realise the employment and social potential of the green transition, it is essential to use all available tools and put the right accompanying policies in place at EU, Member States, regional and local levels. Conversely, in the absence of well-designed accompanying employment and social policies, there are socio-economic risks. It is therefore crucial that the responsible authorities put in place the appropriate polices, and do so without undermining the incentives for the changes in investment and consumption required by the transition. 5 Communication from the Commission \u2018The European Pillar of Social Rights Action Plan\u2019, COM(2021) 102 final, 4 March 2021. 6 According to the impact assessment accompanying the 2030 Climate Target Plan (SWD(2020)176 final). 7 European Commission (2019), \u2018 Sustainable growth for all: choices for the future of Social Europe, Employment and Social Developments in Europe 2019 \u2019 , 4 July 2019.

Given the investment needs in renovation at EUR 275 billion annually, as referred to in the Communication, and the ability of retrofits and energy efficiency investments to create 9-20 jobs per every million dollar invested (SWD(2021) 623 final), the figure could be significantly higher.

        "EN 3 EN Importantly, such mechanisms should be accompanied by measures to ensure inclusive governance and the active involvement of those most affected by the green transition. While Member States have put in place and are preparing a multitude of actions to promote a fair transition towards climate neutrality, there is scope to further enhance the design of policies supporting a fair green transition and ensure coherence of the efforts between the various tools available at EU and national level (see next section). Therefore the Commission announced as part of the \u2018Fit for 55\u2019 package a proposal for a Council Recommendation by the end of 2021 to provide further guidance to Member States as how to best address the social and labour aspects of the green transition. In parallel to delivering on the European Green Deal, the Commission is also closely monitoring short-term developments on energy markets driven primarily by global market developments and, on 13 October 2021, presented a Communication on \u2018Tackling rising energy prices: a t oolbox for action and support\u2019 outlining immediate measures to protect consumers and businesses 11 . This forthcoming proposal was also referred to in that Communication as policy framework to support a fair green transition over the medium run and build resilience to any future price developments. \u2022 Consistency with existing policy provisions in the policy area of employment, skills, social and distributional aspects of the green transition In line with the Political Guidelines of the Commission 2019-2024 12 the European Pillar of Social Rights Action Plan highlights that, as part of a new \u2018social rulebook\u2019, social rights and the European social dimension need to be strengthened across all policies of the Union as enshrined in the Treaties, in particular Article 3 TEU and Article 9 TFEU, to move towards a greener and more digital decade in which Europeans can thrive. In turn, the European Green Deal foresees the mainstreaming of sustainability in all EU policies, in particular by pursuing green finance and investment and ensuring a fair transition. The Commission Recommendation on effective active support to employment following the COVID-19 crisis (EASE) 13 highlighted that the EU and the Member States should act together to promote a dynamic, job-rich and inclusive recovery and facilitate the green and digital transition in the European labour market. The 2020 guidelines for the employment policies of the Member States 14 stated that policy action should combine measures to boost labour demand, increase labour supply, improve access to employment, skills and competences, and enhance the functioning of labour markets and the effectiveness of social dialogue, while taking into account their environmental, employment and social impact. The proposed Joint Employment Report 2022 emphasised that investing in upskilling and reskilling are a top priority to foster an inclusive recovery and support the digital and green transitions 15 . Member States are invited to inter alia introduce support for the reallocation of labour, for instance via well-designed hiring incentives and training, notably towards the green and digital economy, while protecting workers during the transition. This is in line with 11 COM(2021) 660 final. 12 \u2018A Union That Strives for More: My Agenda for Europe\u2019 \u2013 Political Guidelines for the next European Commission 2019-2024, 16.07.2019, President von der Leyen. 13 Commission Recommendation (EU) 2021/402 of 4 March 2021 on an effective active support to employment following the COVID-19 crisis (EASE) (OJ L 80, 8.3.2021, p. 1). 14 Council Decision (EU) 2020/1512 of 13 October 2020 (OJ L 344, 19.10.2020, p. 22). 15 COM (2021) 743 final, Proposal for a Joint Employment Report 2022.

In the framework of the Energy Union and Climate Action Governance Regulation 18 , Member States draw up integrated national energy and climate plans (NECPs), which cover ten-year periods, taking into account the long-term perspective, and the five dimensions of the Energy Union, i.e. energy security; the internal energy market; energy efficiency; decarbonisation; research, innovation and competitiveness. Such NECPs shall be updated five years after the first submission of the NECPs and subsequently every ten years. Pursuant to Article 3(3) (d) of Regulation (EU) 2018/1999 on the Governance of the Energy Union and Climate Action, in the event that a Member State finds that it has a significant number of households in energy poverty, it shall include in its plan a national indicative objective to reduce energy poverty together with a timeframe for when the objectives are to be met as well as policies and measures to address energy poverty, including social policy measures and other relevant national programmes 19 . While several Member States have developed concrete initiatives aimed at tackling energy poverty and/or supporting vulnerable consumers that may also address the potential distributional effects of climate policies 20 , the Commission\u2019s assessment in 2020 of the final NECPs concluded 21 that, \u2018 a large majority of Member States still needs to develop clearer strategies and objectives through a cross-cutting approach to identify and measure the social, employment and skills consequences and other distributional impacts of the energy transition and give proper consideration on how to address these challenges \u2019 . Under the Common Provisions Regulation 22 , which covers inter alia the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF), the European Social Fund + (ESF+), the Cohesion Fund and the Just Transition Fund (JTF), Member States are expected to take account of the contents of their integrated NECPs and the Commission recommendations regarding these plans, for their programmes, including during the mid-term review. The territorial just transition plans (TJTPs) under the JTF should focus on tackling the socio-economic impact of the transition in selected territories relying on fossil fuels or greenhouse gas-intensive industrial activities and include a general section on the national transition process based on the NECPs. The Just Transition Platform was set up to support all relevant stakeholders in using the resources of the Just Transition Mechanism. In addition to the Just Transition Fund (pillar 1), it contains a dedicated scheme under Invest EU (pillar 2) and a public sector loan facility (pillar 3). 16 Council Recommendation of 30 October 2020 on \u2018A Bridge to Jobs \u2013 Reinforcing the Youth Guarantee and replacing the Council Recommendation of 22 April 2013 on establishing a Youth Guarantee\u2019 (OJ C 372, 4.11.2020, p. 1). 17 Council Recommendation of 24 November 2020 on vocational education and training (VET) for sustainable competitiveness, social fairness and resilience (OJ C 417, 2.12.2020, p. 1). 18 OJ L 328, 21.12.2018, p. 1. 19 EED recast proposal Art. 8 (4) also asks Member States to include information on energy efficiency measures and end-use energy savings achieved among people affected by energy poverty, vulnerable customers and, where applicable, people living in social housing. 20 Eurofound (2021), \u2018Distributional impacts of climate policies in Europe\u2019, Publications Office of the European Union, Luxembourg. 21 COM(2020) 564 final. 22 Regulation (EU) 2021/1060 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 24 June 2021 laying down common provisions on the European Regional Development Fund, the European Social Fund Plus, the Cohesion Fund, the Just Transition Fund and the European Maritime, Fisheries and Aquaculture Fund and financial rules for those and for the Asylum, Migration and Integration Fund, the Internal Security Fund and the Instrument for Financial Support for Border Management and Visa Policy (OJ L 231, 30.6.2021, p. 159).

        "EN 5 EN With three of the six pillars setting out the scope of the Recovery and Resilience Facility focusing on social elements, the recovery and resilience plans (RRPs) under the Recovery and Resilience Facility (RRF) outline a significant number of reforms and investments that address the aspects of the fair transition in terms of both reforms and investments. The national plans and operational programmes are to be implemented within the current financing period. While the reforms and investments are designed to have a lasting impact, because of this limited duration, they do not provide for a fully comprehensive approach on fair transition at the national level beyond 2027, notably with a view to the EU climate targets. Other available sources of funding support further complementary actions in this area, including ERASMUS+, the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund for Displaced Workers (EGF), the Recovery Assistance for Cohesion and the Territories of Europe (REACT-EU), the Modernisation Fund and auctioning revenues under the EU Emissions Trading System (ETS), the LIFE+ programme and the Horizon Europe Programme. In particular, the ESF+ Regulation 23 stipulates that the ESF+ shall aim to contribute, in line with its specific objectives under Article 4(1), to objectives related to a greener, low carbon Europe through the improvement of education and training systems necessary for the adaptation of skills and qualifications, upskilling including of the labour force, the creation of new jobs in sectors related to the environment, climate, energy, the circular economy and the bio-economy. Several other strategies and actions plans contribute to a fair green transition. The 2020 European Skills Agenda 24 aims to empower individuals to learn and make sure their skills are fit for the twin transition. In the Skills Agenda, the Commission announces a set of actions to support the acquisition of skills for the green transition, including on individual learning accounts 25 , a European approach for micro-credentials 26 and learning for environmental sustainability 27 . The Pact for Skills 28 aims at mobilising private and public stakeholders to take concrete action for the up- and reskilling of people on the labour market, and, where relevant, pool efforts in partnerships. As of end November 2021, five such partnerships had been established 29 , which committed to the up- and reskilling of 1.5 million people in the coming years. By end November 2021, the Pact for Skills had assembled more than 500 members, including sectoral business organisations, large and small companies, universities, VET providers, social partners, chambers of commerce, regional and local authorities and public and private employment services. The EU\u2019s updated New Industrial Strategy supports job creation in the green economy, stipulating, for example, the important roles of investments in skills, agile public-private partnerships, cooperation in stimulating social dialogue, as well as the creation of green jobs, such as through the various European-wide 23 Regulation (EU) 2021/1057 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 24 June 2021 establishing the European Social Fund Plus (ESF+) and repealing Regulation (EU) No 1296/2013 (OJ L 231, 30.6.2021, p. 21). 24 Communication from the Commission \u2018European Skills Agenda for sustainable competi tiveness, social fairness and resilience\u2019, COM(2020) 274 final, 1 July 2020. 25 Proposal for a Council Recommendation on individual learning accounts, COM(2021) 773 final, 8 December 2021. 26 Proposal for a Council Recommendation on a European approach to micro-credentials for lifelong learning and employability, COM(2021) 770 final, 8 December 2021. 27 Proposal for a Council Recommendation on learning for environmental sustainability, COM(2021) 557 final, 8 December 2021. 28 https://ec.europa.eu/social/main.jsp?catId=1517&langId=en . 29 These cover the following industrial eco-systems: automotive; microelectronics; aerospace and defence; shipbuilding; offshore renewable energy.

In particular, the proposed revision of the Energy Taxation Directive 34 offers possibilities for temporarily exempting vulnerable households from higher energy taxes. The proposed recasts of the Energy Efficiency Directive 35 and of the Energy Performance of Buildings Directive 36 , and the proposed revision of the Renewable Energy Directive 37 stimulate energy savings which can be strong instruments for alleviating energy poverty. Further to that, the application of the \u2018energy efficiency first p rinciple \u2019 will ensure that economically disadvantaged groups will benefit from energy efficiency solutions being considered as the first option in policy, planning and investment decisions and other policy areas. The Energy Efficiency Directive recast proposal furthermore includes a specific obligation for Member States to support energy-poor and vulnerable households to achieve energy savings. The proposed Alternative Fuels Infrastructure Regulation 38 will ensure that charging and refuelling infrastructures for zero emission vehicles will reach all parts of Europe and be accessible to all.

The Modernisation Fund 40 supports ten lower-income EU Member States in their transition to climate neutrality by helping to modernise their energy systems and improve energy efficiency. The Just Transition Fund 41 is designed to address the social and economic impacts of the green transition, focusing on the regions, industries and workers who face the greatest challenges during the transition. The proposed Social Climate Fund will help mitigate the impact on vulnerable households, transport users and microenterprises that are significantly affected by the price increases of fossil fuels as a result of the introduction of emissions trading for fuels used in buildings and road transport. It will promote fairness and solidarity between and within Member States while mitigating the risk of energy poverty and transport challenges, complementing existing mechanisms. The Fund will support households when investing into the energy efficiency and clean heating and cooling of buildings, including the integration of renewable energy, and also finance access to zero- and low- emission mobility. Where needed, pending the impact of the investments on reducing vulnerable groups\u2019 emissions and energy bills, the Fund will enable Member States to finance measures providing temporary direct income support to vulnerable households and households that are vulnerable transport users to reduce the immediate impact of the increase in the price of fossil fuels resulting from the inclusion of buildings and road transport into the scope of Directive 2003/87/EC. Moreover, as outlined in the impact assessment accompanying the 2030 Climate Target Plan and in some of the initiatives of the \u2018Fit for 55\u2019 package, Member States can further make use of the revenue generated from the auctions of the EU ETS allowances, levies and taxes on energy prices, as well as from environmental taxes to support disadvantaged groups. 2.

Consultations provided a broad support to an initiative addressing social and labour aspects of the transition, ensuring that no one is left behind. More specifically, parties agreed, overall, on the need for several elements: comprehensive policy packages to achieve a fair transition, including measures for up-and reskilling; making good use of existing policies and funding instruments, avoiding duplication and administrative burden; an improved understanding of employment and social impacts of climate change policies, including effects on the quality of jobs, and related monitoring and reporting based on \u2018 real life data \u2019 and relevant indicators; mainstreaming equality, but also requests for more funds and capacity building, notably for SMEs; integration into existing governance mechanisms; and the involvement of social partners and civil society in the design and implementation of climate change and funding strategies for fair transitions. The Commission also launched an open Call for Evidence from 29 October 2021 to 19 November 2021, having received 66 contributions from a broad spectrum of stakeholders: public authorities, European and national social partners, civil society organisations in the area of social affairs, but also climate and environmental organisations and academic and research institutions. Overall, respondents displayed strong support for a long-term strategy on green transition and welcomed the focus on employment and social aspects. More specifically, the potential impact on inequalities, jobs and skills was raised in several contributions, with an overall appeal for providing adequate funding, as well as technical assistance regarding available funding instruments to Member States, notably focusing on vulnerable regions, sectors and groups. Contributions also highlighted an increased need to invest in reskilling and upskilling initiatives, capacity building and infrastructures. There was broad support to strengthening social dialogue and collective bargaining, with some respondents calling for workers\u2019 right to information, consultation and co-decision. Moreover, the vast majority of contributions stressed the need for a granular mapping and analysis.

Four main areas of research are covered by the SSM: Poverty, income inequality, social inequalities, health and well-being; employment, unemployment and labour market outcomes; the welfare state, social, and labour market policies; and labour market and distributional impacts of megatrends. Following on from earlier events on the topic, in November 2021, the SSM held its yearly research seminar, under the title \"Social and Labour Aspects of the Transition to Climate Neutrality\". The event focused on the potential impacts of the green transition in terms of employment, job quality, skills and other distributional impacts such as energy poverty and access to essential services. According to the main findings discussed with the experts, at the aggregate level, the expected impact is overall positive, with a boost of employment predicted in the energy-saving, construction and renewable energy sectors, including for low and medium-skilled workers. In contrast, employment and wages are expected to be reduced in energy-intensive and hard-to- abate \"brown industries\", highlighting the need for investment in the massive up- and reskilling challenge. Among the policy instruments identified by the experts to foster a fair transition were taxes, transfers, subsidies and regulations, each entailing diverse levels of equity and efficiency. Experts agreed broadly on the importance of offsetting, through transfers and subsidies, certain regressive or disproportionate effects in particular for low income and lower middle income households, also to garner and safeguard social acceptance of policy measures. The seminar also identified areas that would benefit from further research, including on: (a) the geospatial dimension of employment, social and distributional effects of climate action, including through further simulations covering all EU countries and estimation of impacts by area and degree of urbanisation; (b) integration of macro- and micro-models, including a more granular modelling of labour market transitions, notably across sectors, and the related social investment needs to support retraining, reskilling and upskilling; (c) integration of income distribution and household budget models into the underlying macro-models; and (d) the development of indicators of the \u2018greenness\u2019 of tasks, jobs and skills. \u2022 Impact assessment The proposed instrument \u2013 a Council Recommendation \u2013 offers guidance on the implementation of social, employment and related policies to address the challenges of the green transition.

Moreover, it is proposed that Member States take into consideration this Council Recommendation in the update of their integrated National Energy and Climate Plans (NECPs) in 2023 (for draft NECPs) and 2024 (for the final NECPs) pursuant to Article 14 of Regulation (EU) 2018/1999 on the Governance of the Energy Union and Climate Action (\u2018the Governance Regulation\u2019) and in their national energy and climate progress reports pursuant to Article 17 of that Regulation. In particular, the Recommendation should inform the mainstreaming of fair transition aspects across the measures and actions foreseen under each of the five dimensions of the Energy Union outlined in Article 1(2) of the Governance Regulation. The Recommendation should also inform specific national actions and measures aimed at addressing employment, skills, energy poverty and other social and distributional aspects of the internal energy market, where Member States choose to take such actions, thereby supporting them, in particular those with a significant number of households in energy poverty, to outline adequate policies and measures addressing the issue in their integrated NECPs in line with Article 3(3d), including social policy measures and other relevant national programmes and policies. Through the multi-lateral surveillance mechanism and governance mechanisms in place, the Commission will analyse possible impacts of the transition, identify the most affected people and address, where appropriate, country-specific recommendations to Member States in the context of the European Semester, on the basis of the guidelines for the employment and social policies of the Member States. \u2022 Explanatory documents (for directives) Not applicable. \u2022 Detailed explanation of the specific provisions of the proposal \u00a7 1 to 2 indicates the subject matter, objectives and structure of this Recommendation. \u00a7 3 contains definitions which are to be applied for the purpose of the Recommendation. 47 An overview of relevant funding instruments and their inter-linkages, as well as their role in addressing the recommendations made under this proposal, are described in further detail in the accompanying Staff Working Document (SWD(2021) 452).

Having regard to the proposal from the European Commission, Whereas: (1) Greenhouse gas emissions need to be urgently reduced, in particular to decrease sea level rise and the likelihood of extreme weather events that already affect every region across the globe 48 and to reduce the economic and social costs associated with the effects of global warming 49 . The Union and its Member States are Parties to the Paris Agreement adopted under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) in December 2015 (\u2018the Paris Agreement\u2019) 50 , which binds its Parties to holding the increase in the global average temperature to well below 2\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels and to pursuing efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels. (2) Climate change and environmental degradation pose severe threats that require urgent action, as reaffirmed most recently by the Sixth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) on the Physical Science Basis. Human suffering and economic losses stemming from more frequent climate-related extreme events, such as floods, heatwaves, droughts and forest fires, are becoming more common. In the EU, these losses already average over EUR 12 billion per year 51 .

The need for a fair transition is an integral part of the Green Deal which underlined that no person and no place should be left behind. The European Climate Law 53 sets out a binding Union-wide objective of climate neutrality by 2050 and a binding intermediate target of a net domestic reduction in greenhouse gas emissions of at least 55% by 2030 compared to 1990 levels. The 8 th Environment Action Programme to 2030 54 aims to protect, conserve and enhance the Union's natural capital and protect the health and well-being of citizens from environment-related risks and impacts. (4) The transformation to a climate neutral economy and society requires comprehensive policy action and substantial investment across many areas, such as climate action, energy, environment, industry, research and innovation. 55 To deliver on the binding Union-level target for 2030, the Commission put forward t he \u2018Fit for 55\u2019 56 package on 14 July 2021. This package includes proposals for updating relevant legislation, including the EU Emissions Trading System (ETS) 57 , the energy taxation, energy efficiency and renewable energy Directives, the CO 2 emission standards Regulation for cars and vans, the Regulation on the inclusion of greenhouse gas emissions and removals from land use, land use change and forestry, the Directive on alternative fuels infrastructure, and the effort sharing Regulation with respect to sectors outside the current ETS, namely transport and building sectors. It also includes new legislative proposals, notably to support the use of cleaner fuels in the aviation and maritime transport sectors, as well as to introduce a Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism and establish a Social Climate Fund, which is directly related to the proposed introduction of emissions trading system for fuels used in buildings and road transport. The \u2018Fit for 55\u2019 package, combined with measures taken at EU level to support and incentivise the necessary public and private investments will help to support and accelerate the growth of new markets, for instance for clean fuels and low-emission vehicles, thereby driving down the costs of the sustainable transition for businesses and citizens alike.

However, in a pessimistic scenario, the impacts of the green transition towards climate neutrality combined with an inadequate policy mix could imply job and GDP losses of up 0.39% in the Union, and job losses of up to 0.26% 69 . (9) The impacts of the green transition on business and employment will vary by sector, occupation, region and country, implying job changes within sectors and industrial ecosystems, as well as large labour reallocations across them 70 . Restructuring and adjustment in the companies, sectors and ecosystems concerned require the development of new business models and large labour reallocations across sectors and regions. For instance, job losses are expected in some mining activities or fossil-fuel based energy production, as well as in parts of the automotive sector. Conversely, new job opportunities are expected in circular value retention activities and sustainable transport and energy production. Member States should therefore follow granular approaches, focusing on the individual regions and ecosystems concerned, in liaison with social partners and/or local and regional authorities and stakeholders. (10) By creating quality job opportunities for everyone while taking measures to alleviate and prevent energy and transport poverty, the green transition can contribute to raising incomes and reducing inequalities and poverty overall 71 . It can thus help tackle pre- existing socio-economic inequalities and social exclusion, improving health and well- being, and promoting equality. Particular attention should go to certain population groups, notably those in already vulnerable situations. This includes notably low- and lower-middle income households, who spend a high share of their income in essential services such as energy, transport and housing, as well as micro, small and medium- sized enterprises. Modelling results show that whether environmental taxes are progressive or regressive will depend largely on instrument design, including, for example, the extent to which income tax cuts or other revenue recycling options are targeted at lower income earners 72 . (11) Circular value retention activities (including repair, re-use, remanufacturing and servitisation business models) can foster affordable and sustainable access to goods and services.

(12) According to latest available data in EU-SILC for 2019/2020 73 , energy poverty affected about 8% of the EU population, i.e. more than 35 million people, who were unable to keep their homes adequately warm, with significant differences between Member States and between income groups 74 . Overall, the Energy Poverty Observatory estimates that more than 50 million households in the European Union experience energy poverty. Energy poverty, resulting from a combination of low income, a high share of disposable income spent on energy and poor energy efficiency, has been a major challenge for the Union for some time. This form of poverty affects not only low-income households, but also lower middle-income households in many Member States 75 . Households with above-average energy needs, which includes families with children, persons with disabilities, and older persons, are also more susceptible to energy poverty 76 and to its effects. Women, and in particular lone parents and older women 77 , are also particularly affected by energy poverty. In addition to energy poverty, the concept of transport poverty is increasingly recognised where certain categories of population are unable to attain a socially and materially necessitated level of transport services. Without the right accompanying measures to alleviate and prevent energy and transport poverty, these risk being exacerbated notably due to the internalisation of emissions costs in price formation or to the costs of adaptation towards higher-efficiency, lower-emission alternatives. (13) Principles of social fairness and solidarity are firmly built into the design of relevant climate, energy and environmental frameworks at the Union level 78 , including via the \u2018polluter pays principle\u2019 and the effort sharing between Member States as well as in some redistribution of ETS allowances for the purposes of solidarity, growth and interconnections within the Union and their use for the Modernisation Fund which contributes to the significant investment needs of the lower-income Member States to modernise their energy systems. Moreover, the framework of the EU energy policy legislation provides Member States with tools to ensure the protection of energy poor and vulnerable household customers while avoiding market distortions 79 . While these tools help in facilitating the green transition, they are intended to provide the means to ensure the necessary protection more generally, as shown for instance by the recent Communication on \u2018T ackling rising energy prices: a toolbox for action and support\u2019 80 . 73 2019 EU-SILC data available for all MS; 2020 data not available for all Member States yet. 74 Moreover, up to 6.2% of Europeans, i.e. over 27 million people, have arrears in paying their utility bills. 75 SWD(2019)579 final. 76 See the report of the workshop on \u2018Energy Poverty\u2019, organised on 9 November 2016 for the EP Committee on Industry, Research and Energy (ITRE). 77 See Gender perspective on access to energy in the EU (europa.eu), Gender and energy | European Institute for Gender Equality (europa.eu), GFE-Gender-Issues-Note-Session-6.2.pdf (oecd.org) . 78 Social fairness is also incorporated in the design of Commission proposals that are part of the \u2018Fit for 55\u2019 package, including proposals on the Energy Taxation Directive, the Energy Efficiency Directive, the Renewable Energy Directive, the Alternative Fuels Infrastructure Directive, the Effort Sharing Regulation, and the proposal to establish a Social Climate Fund. 79 Article 5 of Directive (EU) 2019/944 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 5 June 2019 on common rules for the internal market for electricity and amending Directive 2012/27/EU (Text with EEA relevance.)

The Fund facilitates addressing the social impacts via measures and investments intended to reduce reliance on fossil fuels through increased energy efficiency of buildings, decarbonisation of heating and cooling of buildings, including the integration of energy from renewable sources, and granting improved access to zero- and low-emission mobility and transport to the benefit of vulnerable households, vulnerable micro-enterprises and vulnerable transport users, complemented with temporary direct income support to vulnerable households, including vulnerable transport users, where necessary. (14) Member States have a range of tools at their disposal to outline and coordinate their actions for a fair transition. National Energy and Climate Plans (NECPs) should to assess the number of households in energy poverty and outline the measures needed to address the social and territorial implications of the energy transition 82 . Territorial Just Transition Plans (TJTPs) should identify the territories eligible for support under the Just Transition Fund up to 2027 83 . Funded by NextGenerationEU, national Recovery and Resilience Plans (RRPs) set reforms and investments to foster the green transition, inclusive growth, social and territorial cohesion, resilience and prospects for the next generation, with an implementation horizon up to 2026. 84 (15) Building on the principles and policies of the European Green Deal and the European Pillar of Social Rights in particular, there is scope to enhance design of policies in a comprehensive and cross cutting manner, and ensure coherence of the spending efforts, at the EU and national levels. In its assessment of the final NECPs 85 , while recognising that they provide some indicators and policies on energy poverty, the Commission concluded that they do not always provide a clear prioritisation of funding needs for a fair transition, nor for reskilling and upskilling or for supporting labour market adjustments. The TJTPs should focus on selected territories and thus are not expected to lay out an overall strategy and policies for a fair transition at the national level.

(16) A fair transition towards climate neutrality in the Union by 2050 will ensure that no one is left behind, in particular workers and households most affected by the green transition, and notably those already in vulnerable situations. To this end, as set out in this Recommendation, Member States should put in place comprehensive policy packages 86 , strengthen cross-cutting elements that promote fair green transition, and make optimal use of public and private funding. The policy packages should consider those people and households that are most affected by the green transition, notably by job losses but also by changing working conditions and/or new task requirements on the job, as well as those subject to adverse impacts on disposable incomes, expenditure, and access to essential services. As part of the most affected groups, policy packages should in particular - but not only - consider people and households in vulnerable situations, notably people furthest away from the labour market, for instance due to their skills, territorial labour market conditions, or other characteristics, such as sex, racial or ethnic origin, religion or belief, disability, age or sexual orientation. Moreover, people and households in vulnerable situations may include those living in or at risk of poverty and/or energy poverty, facing barriers to mobility, or an overburden of housing costs. Policy packages should be adapted to local circumstances, taking into account the needs of the most vulnerable and remote parts of the EU, including the outermost regions. (17) Active support to quality employment should focus on helping workers, job seekers, people not in employment, education or training (NEETs) and the self-employed most affected by the green transition. In particular, underrepresented people such as women or people with comparatively low capacities to adapt to changes on the labour market require support to improve their employability and for finding employment, in line with the Commission Recommendation for Effective Active Support to Employment following the COVID-19 crisis (EASE) 87 . Building on previous policy guidance 88 , policy packages should thus include tailored measures to support hiring and transition incentives, entrepreneurship support and quality job creation measures, in particular for micro, small and medium-sized enterprises and in most affected territories. They should also foster the effective implementation and enforcement of existing rules on working conditions and support to socially responsible restructuring in line with existing rules and standards. Social partners have a vital role to play to contribute to addressing, through dialogue, the employment and social consequences of the challenges of the green transition. (18) Access to quality and inclusive education, training and life-long learning for all is essential for ensuring that the workforce has the skills required to deliver on the green transition. Fair transition aspects should thus be integrated in the development and implementation of national skills strategies, in line with the European Skills Agenda 86 In particular the Annual Sustainable Growth Strategies (ASGS) 2021 and 2022, the Euro area recommendations 2021, and Country-Specific Recommendations. 87 Commission Recommendation (2021) 402 of 4 March 2021 on Effective Active Support to employment following the Covid-19 crisis (EASE), (OJ L 80, 8.3.2021, p. 1). 88 In particular the EASE Recommendation and the guidelines for the employment policies of the Member States adopted in October 2020 and reconfirmed in October 2021.

Up-to-date labour market and skills intelligence and foresight, including at regional, sectoral and occupational levels allows for the identification and forecasting of relevant occupation-specific and transversal skills needs, also as a basis for adapting curricula to meet the skills needs for the green transition. VET should equip young people and adults, in particular women, with the skills needed to master the green transition 90 . Apprenticeships and paid traineeships, including strong training components, in particular for young people, contribute to labour market transitions, notably towards activities contributing to climate and environmental objectives, and sectors facing particular skills shortages. Increasing adult participation in lifelong learning should be promoted to meet upskilling and reskilling needs, inter alia by empowering individuals to seek training that is tailored to their needs and via short, quality-assured courses on skills for the green transition, building on the European approach to micro-credentials, which will also make it easier to value and recognise the outcomes of such courses. (19) The composition of tax-benefit systems and social protection systems should be reviewed against the specific needs stemming from the green transition, reflecting also the \u2018polluter pays principle\u2019 and the need that accompanying policies will not introduce subsidies to fossil fuels consumption, will not lock in consumers to a specific technology and will not decrease incentives for building renovations, thermal energy system substitutions and in general energy efficiency measures. A combination of various policies can support the most vulnerable households and workers most affected by the green transition. Depending on the national and individual situation, this could for instance involve a shift of taxation away from labour and towards climate and environmental objectives in line with the proposal for revision of the Energy Taxation Directive 91 , a review of unemployment schemes and/or temporary and targeted direct income support, where necessary. Social protection and social inclusion systems can be assessed and, where applicable, adapted in light of the green transition, in particular to provide for income security, notably during job-to-job transitions, and to provide adequate social, health and care services through adequate social infrastructure, notably in most affected territories (e.g. rural and remote areas) in order to prevent social exclusion, and address health risks. To build physical and financial resilience to the irreversible impacts of climate change in an inclusive manner, risk-awareness, risk reduction and risk-transfer solutions need to be promoted, in particular by increasing the availability of insurance solutions and by investing in disaster risk management and adaptation to reduce the physical impacts of climate change and thereby reducing losses as well as the climate protection gap, taking into account micro, small and medium-sized enterprises, as well as rural and remote areas. Disaster risk management including civil protection systems at the national and EU level should be reinforced to better prevent, prepare for and respond to climate related shocks. 89 Communication from the Commission \u2018Updating the 2020 New Industrial Strategy: Building a stronger Single Mar ket for Europe\u2019s recovery\u2019, COM(2021) 350 final. 90 Council Recommendation of 24 November 2020 on vocational education and training (VET) for sustainable competitiveness, social fairness and resilience (OJ C 417, 2.12.2020, p. 1). 91 Proposal for a Council Directive restructuring the Union framework for the taxation of energy products and electricity (recast), COM(2021) 563 final.

In addition, low and medium income households, vulnerable customers, including final users, people facing or risking energy poverty and people living in social housing can benefit from the application of the \u2018e nergy efficiency first principle \u2019 . In addition to protecting and empowering energy consumers, specific measures are needed to prevent and tackle the root causes of energy poverty, in particular by promoting investments targeted at energy efficiency improvements, notably in the social housing sector, in line with the proposal on the Energy Efficiency Directive 94 recast adopted on 14 July 2021, as well as the proposal for the Energy Performance of Buildings Directive 95 adopted on 14 December 2021, which also tackles the main non-economic barriers to renovation such as split incentives, including owner-tenant settings, and co-ownership structures. In this context, specific attention should be paid to particular groups which are more at risk of being affected by energy poverty, such as women, persons with disabilities, elderly people, children, and persons with a minority racial or ethnic background. Pre-existing and emerging mobility challenges can be tackled through support measures and the development of the necessary infrastructure, such as public transport. The affordability, accessibility and safety of sustainable mobility and different modes of transport, including private and public transport are key to ensure everyone benefits from and is part of the green transition. Urban mobility plays a significant role in this context, as also reflected by the European Urban Mobility Framework 96 adopted on 14 December 2021. (21) A whole-of-economy approach to the fair transition should support policy action, based on the coordination of policy-making and strengthened operational capacities at all levels and across all relevant policy areas, giving also an active role to regional and local authorities, the involvement of social partners at all levels and stages, as well as effective and impactful participation of civil society and stakeholders. Such coordination and engagement could ensure that the European Green Deal principles of fairness and solidarity are integrated in policy design, implementation and monitoring from the outset, providing the basis for broad and long-term support for inclusive policies advancing the green transition. (22) A strong evidence base is key to put in place sound social and labour market policies that ensure a fair and inclusive transition.

In turn, exchanges with the public in all its diversity and with key stakeholders, for instance on the outcomes of evaluations, foresight and monitoring exercises, can contribute to policy-making and ownership. (23) Appropriate granular and high quality data and indicators are needed in particular to assess employment, social and distributional impacts of climate change policies. Such data and indicators are currently not fully available. For instance, while some progress has been made on the measurement of energy poverty, indicators to assess transport poverty could be developed. Monitoring and evaluation can be strengthened via a number of actions, focussing on indicators, scoreboards as well as small-scale pilot projects and policy experimentation. Actions can build on, or draw from, existing scoreboards such as the Social Scoreboard and the European Green Deal dashboard, which contain relevant information on specific aspects of fair transition policies (24) Finally, the optimal and efficient use of public and private funding and the mobilisation of all available resources and their effective deployment, is of particular importance in light of the significant investment needs stemming from the green transition.

In addition, promote further the full involvement of social partners in the design and implementation of transition pathways for industrial ecosystems under the EU\u2019s updated New Industrial Strategy. (d) Empower and enable people, civil society and stakeholders, including organisations representing people in vulnerable situations, including women, people with disabilities, youth and children calling for urgent climate action, and social economy actors including through European Climate Pact 116 , with a view to their participation in policy design and implementation, also by making use of new participatory models involving people in vulnerable situations. (e) Strengthen the operational capacities of the relevant public services to provide effective guidance and support for implementing fair transition policies. In particular, strengthen public employment services to support labour market transitions and skills intelligence, as well as labour inspectorates to safeguard working conditions. In addition, mobilise social and health services where appropriate, notably to support labour market transitions and address energy poverty. (9) To ensure the availability and quality of the data and evidence that are needed to put in place sound social and labour market policies for a fair transition to climate neutrality, Member States are invited to: (a) Strengthen the evidence base on fair transition policies by inter alia advancing the gradual harmonisation and consistency of definitions, concepts and methodologies, including on the basis of Commission Recommendation (EU) 2020/1563 on energy poverty and follow-up actions in the Energy Poverty and Vulnerable Consumers Coordination Group, and using available methods for policy impact evaluations. Include also evaluation and data collection strategies in the preparation and design of relevant policy measures and legislative initiatives. (b) Develop and mainstream the use of robust and transparent employment, social and distributional (ex-ante) impact assessments as part of national climate, energy and environmental reforms and measures. (c) Ensure effective and transparent monitoring and independent (ex-post) evaluation of the employment, social and distributional effects of national reforms and measures contributing to climate and environmental objectives, involving social partners and other stakeholders in the identification of evaluation questions and, as relevant, in the design and implementation of evaluation and consultation strategies. (d) Strengthen research and innovation actions at national and EU levels including through funding from the Horizon Europe programme, to enhance the modelling and assessment of the macroeconomic, employment and social 116 Communication from the Commission \u2018European Climate Pact\u2019, COM(2020) 788 final.

(e) Present the outcomes of evaluations, foresight and monitoring exercises to the public at regular intervals, and organise exchanges with social partners, civil society and other stakeholders on the main outcomes and possible adjustments. OPTIMAL USE OF PUBLIC AND PRIVATE FUNDING (10) To provide cost-effective investment and financial support in line with the state aid framework to address the social and labour markets aspects of a fair green transition, while exploiting synergies across available programmes and instruments, and focusing on regions and industrial ecosystems most affected, Member States are invited to: (a) Implement fully the relevant reforms and investments under the Recovery and Resilience Plans, ensuring complementarity with other funds. (b) Mobilise, and ensure a coherent and optimal use of existing instruments and funding options, including technical assistance, at Member States and EU level, to support relevant actions and investments. EU funding instruments comprise, in particular, the Cohesion Policy funds, the Just Transition Mechanism, InvestEU, the Technical Support Instrument, ERASMUS+, the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund for Displaced Workers (EGF), the LIFE programme, and the Modernisation Fund. (c) Commit and deploy adequate national resources to contribute to the implementation of comprehensive sets of measures delivering a fair green transition. These measures should be adequately financed, including by improving the quality of public expenditure, mobilising further private financing, and/or using additional public revenues, also drawing on increasing revenues from emissions trading. Take into account employment, social and distributional aspects in the development of green budgeting practices. (d) Design a balanced mix of measures in the national Social Climate Plans under the proposed Social Climate Fund, including by complementing green investments, where needed pending the impact of investments on reducing emissions and energy bills, with temporary and targeted income support measures to compensate vulnerable households and households that are transport users, taking also into account as appropriate relevant country- specific challenges identified and recommendations issued in the context of the European Semester. FUTURE ACTIONS FOR A FAIR GREEN TRANSITION ",
        "EN 33 EN (11) To pursue useful follow-up actions to this Council Recommendation, the Council of the European Union welcomes the Commission\u2019s intention to : (a) Further enhance the exchanges with key stakeholders, people and communities concerned as well as exchanges of best practices, including in the context of industrial ecosystems' transition pathways 117 , notably in a cross border context and with a focus on the regions and sectors most affected. (b) Support the enhancement of the adequacy, consistency and effectiveness of Member States\u2019 fair transition policies, including for the employment, social and distributional aspects to be considered in the design, implementation, monitoring and assessment of the national plans and long-term strategies, possibly also in the context of the future review of the Governance Regulation as appropriate. (c) Strengthen the database, notably by accessing administrative data sources and, where relevant data from social partners, industries, civil society, and public opinion surveys, and update methodological guidance for assessing employment, social and distributional impacts of fair transition and climate and energy policies including in the context of the European Semester as appropriate. (d) Enhance its regular monitoring and foresight analysis on energy poverty developments and risks in the EU, including social and distributional aspects, also to inform the work of the Energy Poverty and Vulnerable Consumers Coordination Group and other relevant expert groups.
