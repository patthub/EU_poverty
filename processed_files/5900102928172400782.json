Referring to the expulsion from Israel of 400 Palestinians, he told MEPs the Hamas organisation posed a threat to Israel and it was necessary to deal with it. He em phasised, however, that deporta tions were the exception rather than the rule. Appealing for European help to create a \"new Middle East,\" he expressed the hope that peace negotiations would start again towards the end of April. Israel was prepared to com promise and accept UN resolu tions, including the return of \u2022 Shimon Peres \u2014 Israel is prepared to compromise. \u2022 The European Investment Bank is making available two new global loans totalling 40m ECU to the Industrial Development Bank of Israel for promoting industry, tourism and environmental protection projects. Some 30m ECU are earmarked for industry and tourism and 10m for environmental protection. territory, as a basis for negotia tions with both Syria and the Palestinians, he said. One possibility was a Jordan/Palesti nian confederation. European leaders had an im portant role to play in the peace negotiations, he said, and this was emphasised by President-in-Office of Council, Mr Petersen, who said, the Middle East was a high priority area for the Community. The current peace process prr>- vided a unique opportunity for stability in the area with UN resolutions acting as a basis for moving forward. It was important to ensure respect for human rights and start confidence-building measures. Growth package sought as unemployment climbs towards 17m U R G E N CY AS unemployment in the European Community climbs towards 17 million, MEPs called on the Commission and Council to put together an economic growth package as a matter of urgency. Economic affairs committee spokes- Investment fund to pump in 2bn ECU THE European Council agreed at the December Edinburgh summit to set up a European Investment Fund with a view to stimulating Europe's economy by financing major new projects. Emphasis is placed on telecommunications, energy and transport, with priority given to small firms and programmes benefiting the regions. The fund will take the form of 2bn ECU of financial guarantees from the Community's budget together with extra guarantees from the European Investment Bank and other financial institutions. The intention is to generate some 20bn ECU of projects which would be self-financing. The fund will be managed by the European Invest ment Bank, which has announced the first 14 projects, ranging from an 115m ECU scheme to develop electricity plants in central Spain to a 15m ECU modernisation plan for Turin airport. Much-needed In addition, the new 15bn ECU Cohesion Fund, set to provide much-needed capital and bring down unemployment in the Community's four poorest countries \u2014 Ireland, Spain, Portugal and Greece \u2014 was formally approved this week by Parliament. The intention is for it to be up and running on 1 April and it will provide 80-85% of EC grant aid to the cost of individual projects on condition that the countries concerned take measures to curb national public spending with a view to meeting the Maastricht economic convergence criteria. man Alman Metten (NI, Soc) told the House that a Commission forecast for economic growth this year of just .75% would do little to stem the tide. A figure nearer 3% was needed, he said, if the rise in unemployment was to be halted, yet the member states were pursuing restrictive policies in the interests of monetary stability. _ Mr Metten recognised that, faced with increasing public expenditure following the recession, there was not much room for manoeuvre on the part of some national governments. Yet a co ordinated European strategy, based on reducing interest rates, tax incentives for business and increasing spending by the stronger economies could lead the way out of recession. At the same time MEPs believe the rigid convergence criteria on budget deficit envisaged in the Maastricht Treaty as a pre-condition to economic and monetary union could be relaxed in the short-term. Indeed, this point was accepted by Commissioner Henning Christophersen, who recognised the need for flexibility. Alan Donnelly (Tyne and Wear, Soc) emphasised the need for flanking measures by the national governments to complement the Community's 2bn ECU growth initiative which takes the form of financial guarantees and is expected to generate self-financing infrastructure projects worth a total of 20bn ECU. German-style training schemes are also seen as a model for other EC countries to follow. For Ben Patterson (Kent West, EPP) the main priority was to ensure that the single market was working properly. In addition, member states should resist the temptation to slip back into the old way of subsidising uncompetitive industries and resorting to protectionism. He also emphasised the need to keep industry's costs down. But Des Geraghty (Dublin, Ind) drew attention to the realities of accepting the strict Maastricht convergence criteria, which meant cuts in social services and rein suffering for less well-off members of the population. Excessively high interests, as recently seen in Ireland did not, he said, reflect real economic indicators. Instead, they should be linked to inflation. An act of political will was needed to bring this about. Unemployment in the Community Luxembourg , 7 2 1 Germany 42 49 Portugal 43 49 Netherlands, Belgium 7.8 Italy The Twelve Denmark \u00a1 \u20221 8,7 6,7 2,1 1991 9.5 22 1992 9,2 France UK 10,1 11,6 Ireland Spain 16,9 16,7 3 M H B H B HH 19,4 1 Highest increases in 1992 The week in Strasbourg \u2022 The Maastricht Treaty was very much on MEPs' minds this week, even though it was not on the agenda. The delay in ratification is acting as a brake on decision-making and, said Commissioner Henning Christophersen, did not help to create a mood of confidence in Europe's economy as unemployment increases throughout the Twelve. \u2022 Closer to home, MEPs approved a uniform electoral system for European Parliament elections to be based on proportional representation, although a majority of British members voted against. \u2022 The use of colorants in foods such as jams, jellies and sausages provoked a split in the House, with Parliament coming down in favour of outlawing the colouring used in Blackpool rock. \u2022 Israel's Foreign Minister Shimon Peres came before the external economic relations and foreign affairs committees to express his commitment to further negotiations on the Middle East question Mel Read (Leicester, Soc), called into question the decision to allow the new Central Bank complete independence. In reply, Commissioner Christophersen defended both the EMU timetable and the Edinburgh growth package. He acknow ledged the need for complementary measures to stimulate growth, beginning with a cut in German interest rates. Ratification of the Maastricht treaty would, he said, restore confidence in Europe's economy and act as a boost to further investment. This point was endorsed by Sir Christopher Prout (Shropshire and Stafford, EPP) who, commenting on the recent British government defeat on a Maastricht amendment, said: \"The effect of this vote was to damage Britain's standing in Europe, and raise further doubts about Britain's attractiveness in the minds of job-creating foreign investors.\" THE House voted 2 07 to 79 with 19 abstentions in favour of a uniform electoral system for European elections to be based on proportional representation. But while there was support for PR for European elections from British Labour Group leader Glyn Ford (Greater Manchester East, Soc), who felt a more representative Parliament was essential to Parliament's desires for increased powers, and also Derek Prag (Hertfordshire, EPP), a majority of British members totalling 37 voted against with just 14 in favour and 7 abstentions. Irish members voted three in favour with eight against. One bone of contention for the members of smaller groups, such as Winnie Ewing (Highlands and Islands. RBW) and Neil Blaney (Connacht/Ulster, RBW), was the intention to lay down a minimum threshold to ensure representation, which, if applied at a national level, would virtually exclude minorities and independents. In the end MEPs voted to leave this question to the member states. \u2022 Election Options \u2014 see page 2. ",
        "European Parliament \u2014 EP News SWeAef\u00ec It's just the job ... W ITH unemployment in the UK now topping three-million and the rate in Ireland standing at 18%, it is perhaps hardly surprising to find a recent opinion poll revealing that almost half of Britons polled are ready to consider emigration. Disenchanted citizens looking for new opportunities on the other side of the water would do well to scan the columns of Overseas Jobs Express a fortnightly publication containing features and articles on seeking employment in both EC countries and further afield. There is also a useful section on pitfalls to be avoided and requirements of specific countries, as well as plenty of advertisements on where those elusive jobs arc. Two other useful publications on the same theme emanate from Brent Irish Advisory Service and deal with practicalities such as housing, social welfare, health and education as well as how to go about finding a job. One is entitled Moving within the European Community and the other Moving to Ireland and can be obtained from Brent Irish Advisory Service, Electric House, 296 Willcsden Lane, London NW2 5HW. Overseas Jobs Express is available on subscription from PO Box 22, Brighton BNI 6HX. \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022\u2022 Voice for the world W HEN the speaker of the Italian Parliament wanted to air his views on corruption and Italian politics, he chose the BBC's World Service as his platform. So did Swedish Defence Minister Anders Bj\u00f6rck, threatening a \"shoot to kill\" policy against intruding submarines, and Vaclav Klaus, outlining his new role as Prime Minister of an independent Czech Republic. In each case the programme was Europe Today, the weekday current affairs magazine, whose success has led BBC World Service to give it another edition every weekday \u2014 at 7.30 in the morning European time, on 648 kHZ medium wave. The earlier edition, at 6.30 on the long wave Radio 4 frequency 198 kHz, and the evening edition, at 21.30 on 648, continue as normal. Bosnia, Maastricht, Ukrainian nuclear weapons \u2014 all the major topics of European concern have found their place in the schedules over the past few months. The list of guests who have been on the programme since it began in September 1991 reads like a roll-call of influential European leaders from both east and west. But it is not only the eminent who make the airwaves. \"We have consciously moved away from experts towards those who have direct experience of major events or social trends. For example, who better to describe the real effects of Poland's change from communist to capitalism than Polish housewives?\" said a spokesman. Another recent item looked at two towns on the Dutch-German border where inhabitants were working out some form of joint administration. \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022\u2022 Politically thinking R EADERS leaning to the Left and seeking an in-depth approach to issues facing the European Community today will find food for thought in the latest edition of European Labour Forum, edited by MEP Ken Coates (Nottingham, Soc). It contains a feature outlining a European strategy to stimulate the economy and reduce unemployment. Other articles examine the Maastricht Treaty, European Social Policy and third countries. Meanwhile, at the opposite end of the political spectrum the right- wing think tank, the International Freedom Foundation, takes a critical view of EC aid policy. In the third of a series of papers entitled Commissioners of Poverty it argues that much EC aid is wasted and goes towards propping up undesirable regimes. The solution \u2014 the suspension of economic assistance to countries refusing to respect democracy and human rights clauses and opening up EC aid projects to competitive tendering.

The cross-party group was launched following an initiative by the late Basil de Ferranti and was instrumental in securing support for the single market programme. EP NEWS SPECIAL REPORT ON PR ELECTIONS Pressure for change as UK With MEPs this month voting in favour of a com mon electoral system for European elections based on some form of propor tional representation, this month's EP News looks at the different ways each country elects its represen tatives and considers op tions for the UK. WITH the exception of the UK, all the other member states use some form of proportional representation for electing their MEPs, although the single transferable vote system in Ireland, where the electorate votes for a candidate rather than a party, can produce a result that is not necessarily proportional to the first preference vote. Applicant member states such as Austria, Sweden and Finland also use some form of propor tional representation for national elections. Systems vary from national lists with seats allocated according to the number of votes received by the party, usually according to the d'Hondt rule, to multi-member regional constituencies as in Italy. In some countries, such as Spain and France, the parties decide on the order of candidates to be elected from the list while in others, such as Italy, the voter can indicate his or her preference for the candidate. In Luxembourg, where each elector has six votes, the votes can even cross party lines. The list system has, however, come in for a considerable amount of criticism on the grounds that too much power is handed to a cen tralised party bureaucracy with the result that the elected member is not directly responsible to the voter in the same way as under a constituency system. Efforts to combat this are made by ensuring the list contains a broad regional balance, as in France, or introducing a consti tuency element, as in Belgium and Italy, but this does not provide a guarantee of accountability, and it stays 'odd man out' Parliament's resolution favouring a uniform electoral system for European elections advocated: \u2022 the allocation of seats in the member states shall be determined in accordance with a system of proportional representation to take account of the total number of votes cast in each country \u2022 voting should be based on national or regional lists or multi-member constituencies \u2022 if a single member constituency system is used, as in the UK, then not more than two thirds of the seats should be allocated in this way. The remainder should be distributed so that the final number of seats per party reflects the total votes cast throughout the country \u2022 preferential voting may be used, as in Ireland \u2022 the member states should be left to decide on whether to introduce a minimum 3% \u2014 5% threshold for parties to gain representation with special arrangements, if necessary, to accommodate regional parties such as the Scottish and Welsh nationalists \u2022 existing voting rights of third country nationals, such as Commonwealth citizens in the UK, should be preserved. would seem that the postbag of British and Irish members, with constituencies, is larger than that of continental MEPs. A more proportional result will be obtained from the widest possi ble area, i.e. where the entire country is a single electoral district, although this does not take account of regional parties only standing in some areas. It also means that the constituency ele ment is at its weakest. On the other hand, the smaller the electoral district the less pro portional the result. The case for introducing PR in the UK is that the constituency \"first past the post\" system leads to massive distortions brought about by a small swing in total votes, and that parties such as the Liberals or the Greens, despite ob taining up to 15% of the total vote, remain unrepresented. For example, in 1979 the Con servatives obtained 60 seats, or 21 more than under a proportional system from less than 50 % of the votes, while Labour, by increas ing its share of the vote by just 3 % between 1984 and 1989, secured an extra 13, or 16%, of seats. Another argument is that the system affects the total balance in the Parliament. It is also argued that it is unhealthy for the South of England to be represented only by Conser vatives, while at the same time Conservatives are left without representation in Scotland or Wales. Moreover, the three MEPs from Northern Ireland are already elected by PR. Suggestions put forward for combining PR with constituencies include multi-member constituen cies of between 5 and 15 members or separate regional lists for England, Scotland and Wales. Another possibility now recommended by Parliament is to follow the German system used in national elections with two-thirds of the members elected on a con stituency basis and the rest on the basis of lists, with the final result reflecting the total number of votes per party. In other words, if the Labour Party obtains 38.8% of the vote, as last time, it would be en titled to that proportion of the total number of 84 seats \u2014 i.e. 32 seats. Assuming it takes 25 of the constituency seats, Labour would then receive a top up of seven seats from the list system to bring it up to 32. Similarly, Liberals or Greens not winning a constituen cy seat would receive their alloca tion from the list element. Nevertheless, it is for the member states to decide unanimously on Parliament's pro posal and this may well be too radical an approach for 1994. OPTIONS FACING THE EC'S VOTERS . .. Belgium An electorate of 7 million sends 24 members to the European Parliament. The country is divided into two districts, with Flanders choosing 13 members and Wallonia II, including one representative from the German-speaking region. Brussels residents can opt for cither area. The extra seat allocated to Belgium for the 1994 elections will be for the German speakers. Each party puts forward a list of candidates in recommended order for the two constituencies and the scats arc allocated proportionately under the d'Hondt system according to the number of votes received with vacant seats filled by substitutes from candidates on the list. Each voter has one vote, which he can give either to the list or to a candidate on the list, thus allowing him an opportunity to influence the order on the list. All votes count towards a party's total and scats are allocated in proportion to that total. The head of the list has first claim to the list votes, with any list votes left over going to the second candidate and so on. However, if the number of votes is insufficient to meet the quota, but a candidate lower on the list has enough personal votes then he or she will be elected instead. Denmark Almost 4 million Danes are responsible for the election of 16 MEPs, according to proportional representation and the d'Hondt system. There is just one national list and like Belgium the parties decide on the order on the list with the voters allowed to influence the ranking by voting either for the list or the candidate of his choice. Vacant seats are filled by the next on the list. France An electorate of 38 million chooses 81 MEPs to be increased to 87 in 1994, under a single national list system. Seats arc allocated proportionately under the d'Hondt system with the parties controlling the order on the list. There is a 5% threshold, which each list must achieve to secure representation, and vacancies are filled by the next candidate on the list. In 1984 the Centre Right fielded a single list of candidates but disagreement between the parties and personalities meant there were two lists in 1979 and 1989. Germany Some 46 million Germans sent 81 deputies to the European Parliament in 1989, with the three seats for West Berlin chosen by the Berlin Chamber of Deputies. German unification will increase the electorate to 60.3m and the number of MEPs in 1994 will rise to 99. At present MEPs are elected through a combination of national lists and regional lists based on the ten Lander, with representation varying according to the size of population of each Land. The order of names on the list is fixed by the parties and the voter does not have an opportunity to change this in the ballot box. There is a 5% threshold for both the regional and national list, and vacancies can be filled by substitutes from candidates on the list or be named as such at the time of the election. Seats are distributed according to the Hare-Niemeyer principle of proportional representation, which tends to favour smaller parties. Greece There is just one single national list system for electing 24 MEPs to represent an electorate of just over 8 million. The number is to be increased to 25 in 1994. Seats are allocated according to the d'Hondt system of proportional representation. Vacancies are filled by the next candidate on the list and the parties control the order of names on the list. Ireland The 15 Irish MEPs representing Ireland's 2 Vi million voters are elected from four constituencies, one with five members, one with four and two with three. The single transferable vote system is used and candidates are listed in alphabetical order on the ballot paper with the name of the party following. Each voter is permitted to indicate his order of preference for as many candidates as he likes in running number order. Once a candidate is elected by reaching the quota (for example, securing one vote more than a quarter of the total in a three-member constituency), his surplus votes are reallocated to the voters' second choice and so on. Subsequently, the votes of candidates at the bottom of the poll are transferred according to the voters' preference until the required number of candidates is elected. It differs from continental systems in that all candidates appear on a single list, not separated by party. Voters may discriminate between candidates from the same party, and those from other parties. When applied at a European level, it can result in parties being over or under-represented, such as in 1979 when the Labour Party secured the same number of seats as Fine Gael with less than half of the number of votes, but subsequently failed to retain a single seat in the 1984 elections despite obtaining 8% of the vote. Italy An electorate of 47 million returns 81 MEPs and, like France and the UK, this figure is to be increased to 87 for the next elections. A regional list system operates, with the country divided into five constituencies returning between seven and 25 members each, which results in the number of votes required to elect a member varying according to regions. Candidates arc elected according to pure proportional representation with no quota or threshold. Voters can change the order on the list by indicating their preference for three or two candidates depending on the region. Candidates are allowed to stand in more than one area with the result that, for example, Radical Party leader Marco Pannclla was elected in three different constituencies; his seat in two of them passed to other members of the party. Vacancies are filled by the next candidate on the list and independents require the nomination of 30,000 electors. The Italian electoral system is, however, facing a complete overhaul following general disenchantment with politicians and the political system. Pressure is mounting for adopting the British system. Luxembourg Luxembourg's six members, representing just 219,000 voters, arc chosen according to the d'Hondt system of proportional representation in just one single national constituency. Each voter has up to six votes and he can distribute these among the candidates on one list or choose between the parties. Vacancies are filled by the next candidate on the list and there is no threshold. The Netherlands Twenty-five members are elected on the basis of a single national list system according to the d'Hondt system of proportional representation. This will be increased to 31. members at the next elections. ",
        "European Parliament \u2014 EP News The Threshold THIS is the minimum share of the national vote for parties to be elected. Parliament opted to leave this for the member states to decide at between 3 and 5%. In addition, there should be special arrange\u00ad ments for regional parties only standing in certain parts of the country, such as, for example, the Scottish National Party in the UK. It is intended to avoid a proliferation of smaller parties, as happens in Italy, where at present there is not a threshold and a system of pure PR without a quota applies. But, if adopted, it would also effectively eliminate independents in constituency\u00adbased systems like Ireland. Substitutes THIS is another contentious issue. Of the original 518 members elected in June 1989 some 50 have left to be replaced by substitutes from a party list. The system enables parties to place well\u00adknown national political leaders, such as former French Prime Minister Laurens Fabius, at the head of the list in the knowledge that he can later resign. But it has been criticised on the grounds that it enables the parties to manipulate representation and, unlike the constituency system, widens the gap between the voter and his representative with the result that the MEP is less accountable. In the UK, where MEPs can only be replaced through a by\u00adelection, the original 81 MEPs elected in 1989 are still in place, while in Ireland there has been just one change. The lists are drawn up by the parties, but voters can change the order by voting either for the list or the candidate of their choice and there is no threshold. Vacancies are filled by the next candidate on the lists. Portugal An electorate of 8 million is represented by 24 MEPs to be increased to 25 in 1994. A single national list system operates according to the d'Hondt system of proportional representation. The parties decide on the order of candidates on the list and vacancies are allocated to the next candidate on the list. Spain An electorate of 29 million sends 60 members to the European Parliament, to be increased to 64 in the next election. Members are elected under the d'Hondt system of proportional representation and a national list system operates. The parties control the order of names on the list. Vacancies are filled by the next candidate or substitute on the list and there is a 3% threshold, with regional parties combining to secure representation. UK As one of the 'big four' the UK, too, has 81 MEPs, with 78 elected under the traditional \"first past the post\" system of constituencies and three members from Northern Ireland elected under the single transferable vote system of proportional representation that is used in Ireland. With an electorate of 42'/2 million and an extra 1.1 million voters in Northern Ireland, representation is increased to 87 for the 1994 elections, although just how these scats are to be allocated has yet to be decided. One possibility is to increase Scotland's representation from eight to nine, Wales' from four to five with the remaining four going to England to make a new total of 70,Howcver, redrawing the constituency boundaries is fraught with difficulties and likely to lead to accusations of gerrymandering if, for example, chunks of Devon arc added to Cornwall. An alternative would be for the six extra seats to be allocated on a separate list system based on PR. \u2022 More information on different electoral systems can be found in: Twelve democracies: Electoral systems in the European Community, Enid Lakcman, 4th ed. 1991. The Arthur Macdougall Fund. \u00a35. Outlaw racial bias-demand WITH incidents of racial violence widespread around Europe and racial attacks against immigrants in Germany giving cause for mounting concern, a call for EC legislation to outlaw racial discrimination was made by Sir Michael Day, chairman of the UK commission for racial equality, at a special hearing organised by the civil liberties committee. Sir Michael warned against complacency in Britain by pointing out that overt racism or attacks on foreigners was not confined to Germany. While there were few prosecutions for the offence of incitement to racial hatred in the UK, the number of racial incidents reported to London police stations amounted to 2,000 over a year. Moreover, attackers were frequently not charged and the police behaviour in dealing with incidents was also crucial. It was, he said, vital to investigate any complaints against police officers and act accordingly. On the positive side, there were useful liaison groups between ethnic minorities and local police forces. He did, however, feel there was a need for an EC directive to outlaw racial discrimination. This should provide basic protection throughout the Community and offer a means of redress for victims of discrimination. He felt the pressure of immigration and refugees across Europe was leading to a climate where racism flourished. As far as France is concerned, Anne\u00adMarie Duranton\u00adCabrol, the author of a book tracing the history of the extreme right in France, said the success of the movement was due to an identity crisis in the country and the use of populist slogans by the extreme right advocating a return to traditional moral values based on the family and a rejection of the immigrant. The situation was exacerbated by increasing urban deprivation, the housing crisis, rising unemployment and poverty. Another speaker, J\u00f6rg Ueltzh\u00f6ffer, from the Sinus Institut, Heidelberg, pointed out that racist attacks in Germany had increased dramatically from just six in 1990 to more than 1,000 in 1992. There was, he said, a steady 10% support for extreme right wing political parties expressing xenophobic views, with foreigners blamed for the rising crime rate and drug trafficking. Yet, he added, recent studies of attitudes towards immigrants revealed a marked difference between West Germans and citizens from the former East Germany, where as many as 40% of those surveyed were opposed to the presence of foreigners. The figure for West Germans was 25%. At the same time, he added, there was a strong counter\u00adreaction by Germans opposed to nationalist views. The committee will now be drawing conclusions from the hearing and putting forward a list of recommend\u00ad ations for action for consideration by the full House. EC system 'needed to protect human rights' WITH its first report on human rights in the EC, Parliament has concluded that, given increasing free movement of people and growing inter\u00adgovernmental co\u00ad operation in areas such as policing and immigration, there is a need for an EC system for protecting human rights. MEPs agreed to hold emergency debates on alleged human rights abuses in the Community. Drawn up for the civil liberties committee by Belgian Liberal, Karel de Gucht, the report \u2022 Motorists in the UK now face new pollution control tests like this one in Luxembourg. Without any new initiatives CO, emissions will rise by 11% before the end of the century. 'Greenhouse' gas checks the green MEPs have given the green light to a Commission proposal to set up a system for monitoring carbon dioxide (C0 2 ) emissions and other gases contribut\u00ad ing to the greenhouse effect. This would entail each member state drawing up a national programme and the Commission carrying out checks to see if the EC's target of stabilising C0 2 emissions by the year 2000 at their 1990 level is being met. The EC currently produces some 2.7bn tonnes of CO, calls on the Commission to draw up a White Paper, and the EC is urged to sign up to the European Convention on Human Rights, which dates from I950. The basic approach is to ensure protection not only for the rights of EC citizens but also for third country nationals. But the House split, with the European People's Party taking the view that the report was too wide in scope by straying into social and economic issues such as poverty, which distracted from the positive elements, said Pat Cooney (Leinster, EPP). Also, many MEPs were unhappy with the report's suggestion that human rights were being systematically violated throughout the EC. The resolution was passed by I12 votes for to 51 against with 7 abstentions. ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^^ Christopher Beazley (Cornwall and Plymouth, EPP) disagreed with the report's criticism of Europe's police forces, but Claudia Roth (G), for the Greens, felt nothing should be swept under the carpet. The resolution says the EC must ensure that human rights are respected in the member states in order to lend maximum credibility to its commitment to human rights in the rest of the world. As Paddy Lalor (Leinster, EDA) said: \"What right have we to criticise others if we are not prepared to judge similar offences in our own backyard?\" A particular concern for MEPs is the rise in racial attacks, and there is an appeal to EC governments to guarantee the protection of foreign communities against such violence. Parliament also wants the A EC to launch \"a European f\u00dff^T media campaign\" against ^^ ^\" \u00b7* intolerance. \u2014 \u03a6 \u00ab Disquiet is also expressed \u0399 | / \u03c4 \u0399 |\u0393 about the use of emergency m m.m\u00bfL m. I ffs laws to deal with terrorism, *\u2014* and infringements of trade union rights are condemned, including the removal of trade union rights from workers at GCHQ. The UK is asked to sign up to the social chapter in Maastricht and there is a call for privacy legislation. Tragedy of mass rapes FOLLOWING a public hearing involving representatives from the UN High Commission for Refugees, the Red Cross, Amnesty International and from communities in the former Yugoslavia, Parliament called for a renewed effort to end the systematic rape of women caught up in the Yugoslav conflict. Christine Crawley (Birmingham East, Soc), who chaired the hearing organised by the women's rights committee, told Parliament the rapes had scarred the continent of Europe for the last 12 months. Only with an end to the war would it be possible to get lasting help to the traumatised women and children, she added. MEPs heard that perhaps as many as 20,000 women, mainly Muslim, had been raped, including many young girls and elderly women. Such abuses, together with reports of torture and killings, had led to many thousands of people fleeing their homes, the hearing was told. Some thought the rapes were part of a strategy to terrorise the Muslim community, in order to achieve ethnic cleansing. The resolution adopted condemns the detention and systematic rape of women in former Yugoslavia and calls for the offence to be made a war crime. It also backs the rapid establishment of a special tribunal to bring to trial those thought to be guilty. A UN Commission on War Crimes is being set up. MEPs want to see proper medical and counselling support for rape victims, including abortion for those who want it. Help for those women keeping children resulting from rape is also urged so that international adoption can be viewed as a last resort. EC member states are urged to offer a \"haven\" for women and children fleeing atrocities where it is impossible for them to remain in their own community. Speeding up visa procedures, granting temporary entry to women needing medical treatment and recognising rape as a legitimate reason for asylum are other measures backed by MEPs. with power generation accounting for 31% and transport for 25%, largely from cars. But there is growing concern that the Community is likely to miss its target for stabilising CO, by at least 4%. While welcoming the monitoring system, which is part of an overall strategy, including increasing energy efficiency, and promoting renewable sources such as wind power, Anita Pollack (London South West, Soc) said clearly more needed to be done to counter the threat of global warming and climatic change. \u2022 Another resolution adopted by Parliament dealt with human rights in the world. MEPs want the UN to establish a High Commissioner for Human Rights as a way of promoting human rights. The continued use of torture in many countries, the increase in summary executions and cases of missing people are among the major concerns voiced by Parliament. Safer seas aim FOLLOWING recent major oil tanker accidents off the Shetland Islands and northern Spain, the Commission has made proposals to make EC waters safer. The basic approach will be to improve safety and prevent pollution at sea by taking steps to stop substandard ships and poorly trained crews, irrespective of the flag of the ships, from operating in Community waters. The Commission is backing stricter implementation of international rules on safety at sea. Also, it is to bring forward legislation this year on technical safety standards for ships and minimum training requirements for crews. The Commission's communication on achieving \"safe seas\" will now be considered by Parliament and the Council of Ministers. ",
        "European Parliament \u2014 EP News 'Get tougher' on safety FACED with the grim statistics of 5 0 , 0 00 deaths and 1.7 million people injured on Europe's roads every year. Parliament believes it is time for the EC and the member states to make a fresh effort to improve road safety and is suggesting measures ranging from better vehicle design to tougher driving laws. The UK has one of the best records for road safety in Europe with 94 road acci\u00ad dent deaths per million population, a figure bettered only by the Netherlands, Norway and Sweden. On the other hand, Belgium and Portugal have come out the worst, with twice as many road deaths. So far EC policy has been confined to legislation on seat belts and tests on cars, but the Maastricht treaty adds to the com\u00ad mon transport policy the need for \"measures to improve transport safety.\" MEPs want tougher driving laws to in\u00ad fluence the behaviour of drivers. They are proposing legislation on speed limits and on drinking and driving, banning the use by drivers of Walkmans, and tougher rules on coach and bus transport. But while promising a new initiative. Commissioner Raniero Vanni d'Archirafi was sceptical of reaching agreement on a Euro-wide speed limit, especially as there are no limits on German motorways. Food for thought in colourants row 'No threat ' to mushy peas or brown kippers \u2022 Tom Spencer, Caroline Jackson and Anthony Simpson display a selection of foods containing the disputed colourants. Cash help for losers COLLAPSE of the Bank of Credit and Commerce Inter\u00ad national has led to a new EC proposal to protect deposit holders. MEPs voted to increase to 20,000 ECU the minimum amount eligible for compensa\u00ad tion in the event of a banking collapse, as seen at the Bank of Credit and Commerce Inter\u00ad national. As banks now have branches in numerous countries and the rules on guarantees vary \u2014 there are none in Greece and Portugal \u2014 the Commission has come forward with a proposal for legislation to provide protec\u00ad tion for customers throughout the EC. And, said Commissioner Padraig Flynn, he could agree with Parliament's wish to see the figure raised from 15,000 to 20,000 ECU.

Under the proposed rules ex\u00ad isting incinerators of toxic waste will have three years to come into line, and the public will have a right to information about ap\u00ad plications for licences and how plants are run. Some MEPs have been unhap\u00ad py about incineration as a long- term means of dealing with dangerous waste and, indeed in December, Parliament postponed its vote because it felt that the pro\u00ad posal did not do enough to con\u00ad trol the emission of dioxins. Limit But after further discussions with the Commission, MEPs agreed to set a limit on dioxin emissions and also to ban waste water discharges, although the Greens took the view the proposal is still not stringent enough. The proposal will return to Parliament for a second reading once the EC Environment Ministers agree a position. CAROLINE JACKSON (Wiltshire, EPP) accused British Labour members of seeking to ban foods such as Red Leicester cheese, sausages and cocktail cherries during a debate on a Commission proposal to lay down EC- wide rules on permitted food colourants. At one point her bench resembled a grocery store as she displayed all the products under threat. Michael Welsh (Lancashire Central, EPP) got in on the act when he pulled out a stick of Blackpool rock which he said faced extinction if the offending colouring E127 erythrosine was outlawed. Pauline Green (London North, Soc) retorted that she merely wanted to take unnecessary colourings with a potential health hazard out of foods, not to ban the products as such. It was up to manufacturers to seek alternatives that were not harmful, she said. Jams The potential danger of substances such as tartrazine and erythrosine to hyperactive children have been well documented. Jim Fitzsimons (Leinster, EDA) was particularly unhappy about the threat to certain colourings, such as those used in red lemonade, cordials, cider, marmalade and strawberry jam. For instance, he said, a ban would have serious consequences in the \"sunny south-east\" of Ireland, where there were 1,700 jobs in the harvesting and processing of strawberries for jam. Commissioner Antonio Ruberti emphasised his intention was not to pose a threat to traditional foods such as green peas and brown kippers, but rather to lay down minimum standards following the advice of scientific experts. The House voted to exclude colourings such as erythrosine and red 2G used in sausages, but to permit the use of other colours used, for example, to achieve the green colour in mushy peas and the brown in kippers.The amended proposal, which is tabled under the Single European Act, now goes to Council, which can take a decision by majority vote, before coming back to Parliament for a second reading. Heartbreak of the love-tug children THE tragedy of broken marriages between couples of mixed nationalities was highlighted in Strasbourg when MEPs heard there are now 6,000 European children who have disap\u00ad peared without trace with one of the disaffected partners. And the situation is bound to get worse as the internal market will make it easier for people to move around, said Margarida Salema O. Martins (\u03a1, LDR), reporting for the legal committee. Present procedures where\u00ad by cases are handled under two international conventions were too cumbersome, slow and ex\u00ad pensive, while it was not always possible to obtain legal aid, she said. Besides, not all EC countries had ratified the relevant conventions and there was the additional problem when one of the partners was from a non-EC country. Lord Inglewood (Cumbria and Lancashire North, EPP) described present procedures as a disgrace, while Karel Dillen (\u0392, ER) raised a few eyebrows when he said there was a need for young couples from different cultural backgrounds to err on the side of caution before entering into relationships. There was general support for EC legislation to deal with the problem but this was effec\u00ad tively ruled out by Commis\u00ad sioner Padraig Flynn, who said it was outside the competence of the EC. Nuclear ban blocked AS doubts continue to surround the opening of the new Thorp reprocessing plant at Sellafield in Cumbria, MEPs unsuccessfully sought to persuade the Commission to agree to a ban on the air transport of nuclear materials. A Commission proposal to regulate the flow of nuclear products in a single market without border checL\u00b7 was referred back to committee for further discussion after the Commission declined to accept amendments proposed by the environment committee. Split over 'fair' wage THE House split on Left/Right lines when it came to debating a Commission document outlining its commitment to a \"fair\" wage, defined according to the different situations in the member states. While the Commission deliberately steered clear of interfering in this sensitive area and is not proposing EC legislation, a majority of MEPs voted to call for EC action should the member states fail to introduce a national minimum wage by the end of 1994. High-speed progress WELCOMING the approval of a two \u2014 year transport programme, transport committee spokesman Derek Prag (Hertfordshire, EPP) said the emphasis would be on improving rail networks between EC countries. The new high speed rail link from London to the Continent could expect to benefit from the 185m ECU to be allocated this year. In addition, the House stipulated there should be due respect for environmental impact and safety factors, and that the new regulation should be extended to include air and sea transport. Concern for animals PEOPLE may continue to be subject to passport checks at frontiers but controls on animals have been removed, with the unfortunate consequence that young calves and other animals now face journey times of seven hours or more without a break. This practice has been condemned by MEPs who want limits on journey times and arrangements to provide food and water. A proposal from the Commission is expected shortly. Cities pressing for aid HARD on the heels of Liverpool being proposed for priority status in the granting of EC regional aid programmes, several other cities faced with similar problems of urban decline and social deprivation are pushing the Commission for more help. Thirty-nine cities have clubbed together to form a grouping known as Eurocities to press their claims. "
