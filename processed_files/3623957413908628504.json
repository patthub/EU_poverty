        "STRIVE for Development 2 1 Introduction T hE woRld is becoming less peaceful: global incidents of conflict, homicides, terrorist incidents and violent crime are all rising, some quite significantly. Yet the drivers of this insecurity are becoming increasingly challenging to understand and respond to, as the perpetrators range from internet-enabled virtual attacks, to lone wolves, insurgent conflict, ideology-related violence as well as a return to inter-state conflict. The impact is felt in chronic humanitarian needs, unprecedented levels of migration flows, and growing inequality, which then exacerbate the root causes and drivers of insecurity. Violent extremist ideologies are gaining an unprecedented level of traction across the globe, taking root in local communities and controlling territory in a number of fragile states, as well as attracting a growing number of disenfranchised citizens in other states. Their messages that incite hate, perpetuate violence and invoke terror should have no place in a modern and civilised world. It is important to emphasise that violent extremism is a global problem, which can manifest itself in all cultures and all religions but with different specific characteristics. Radicalisers work by pointing to social, political and economic injustice around their followers. They promote a belief that these injustices result from a corrupt system of politics or ideology. To be persuasive, many of these arguments are based on facts and truths but are selective and incomplete in the way they employ reality. More importantly, the means by which they seek to redress this injustice is through violence, greater oppression and victimisation. Thus, the challenge for policy-makers has arguably never been greater as the international community needs to bring all of its tools to the table both to resolve on-going crises and prevent their re-occurrence. The European Union, with its Member States, is the world\u2019s largest development actor, with a comprehensive global reach and a range of instruments that engage on continental, regional and national levels. Our approaches span from long-term preventive engagements on trade, infrastructure and development-orientated service delivery, to short-term stabilisation instruments that can deliver targeted humanitarian relief and recovery measures.

        "Strengthening Resilience to Violence and Extremism Jerome Delay/AP/Press Association Images Addressing both the manifestations of violent extremism and the conditions conducive to violent extremism is a developmental challenge. It will require strengthening the fundamental building blocks of equitable development, human rights, governance and the rule of law. A diverse range of stakeholders need to be brought to the table and empowered, including not only state actors and security institutions, but also key members of local communities and civil society who can speak courageously and compellingly about truth, tolerance and acceptance. Thus, while a strong response to violent extremism is required, it should be based on civil liberties and address insecurity, inequality and marginalisation. The EU is committed to working with partners across the globe to achieve this in the interests of all citizens. Over the last decade, the Commission has invested much in combatting this threat by addressing the conditions conducive to extremism, and building capacity to reinforce the rule of law and promote development. The Commission aims to achieve the strengthening of vulnerable communities through capacity building. This brochure highlights some of the Commission-funded or -supported approaches throughout the world that contribute to this effort. \u2018A diverse range of stakeholders need to be brought to the table and empowered\u2019 \u2018Violent extremist ideologies are gaining an unprecedented level of traction across the globe, taking root in local communities and controlling territory in a number of fragile states\u2019 3 ",
        "STRIVE for Development 4 2 Concepts & Definitions T ERRORISM, RAdICAlISATIOn and extremism are subjective concepts that have different meanings for different people. Furthermore, their meaning is constantly evolving as they manifest themselves in different ways in various parts of the world, exploiting new vulnerabilities and utilitising new technologies and approaches. When engaging in specific programmes and initiatives, it is important to understand and be sensitive to the local nuances and perceptions in the way such terminology is used. However, at the level of global policy, in order for the EU and its partners to work effectively together, it is vital to develop common definitions. This lexicon, dealing with very sensitive issues, has to remain neutral and non-emotive in order to avoid negative consequences such as prejudice, stigmatisation or pre-emptive conclusions. This chapter provides a brief, standardised outline of the most important concepts at hand. Defining Terrorism T HE UnITEd nations (Un) has been unable to get all Member States to agree on a definition because it is invariably political in part and because it cannot be framed in a manner that excludes the state. However, there are numerous Un Conventions on terrorist acts that provide for global definitions for specific terrorism-related offences. In addition, whilst there is no general Un definition on terrorism, the Un General Assembly adopted in 2006 the Un Global Counterterrorism Strategy which reflects that there is global consensus on addressing the issue of terrorism. Many Member States have developed their own, tailored definitions of terrorism from which they have developed laws to deal with terrorists. The important point to remember is that terrorism is a complex and contested issue as are the associated labels of extremism, violent extremism and radicalisation. Under the Treaties under which it was established, the EU has the competence to establish minimum rules concerning the definition of criminal offences in cross-border \u2018Defining terrorism is an emotive issue\u2019 ",
        "5 Strengthening Resilience to Violence and Extremism serious crime such as terrorism. This led to the Framework decision of 2002 and its subsequent 2008 amendment through which the EU established a list of terrorist offences which sets out the minimum standards across the EU. Other regional organisations such as the Council of Europe and the African Union have also adopted their own counterterrorism conventions such as the Council of Europe Convention on the Prevention of Terrorism and the Organization of African Unity Convention on the Prevention and Combating of Terrorism which also provide common definitions of terrorism. despite the lack of a universal definition, the following encompasses the way many countries understand terrorism: Violence or threat of action aimed at influencing a government or an international organisation or to intimidate the public, or a section of the public, for the purposes of a political, religious, racial or ideological cause. Within the definitions of terrorism, those who are perceived to have facilitated an act of terrorism, even if they did not participate in the violent act itself, are still considered to be culpable. Thus, non-violent behaviour such as financing of terrorism, extremist incitement or terrorist facilitation are all criminal offenses. Extremism and Violent Extremism Extremism is generally understood as constituting views that are far from those of the majority of the population. Extremist views are not necessarily illegal and do not automatically lead to violence or harm; indeed those who chose to observe extreme practices with no impact on the civil liberties of fellow citizens are rightly protected under fundamental freedoms and human rights norms. Extremism becomes of concern when those ideologies threaten democratic and tolerant societal ideas, or promote the use of violence to coerce their followers or to achieve their objectives. When violence is thus employed, this violent extremism is a menace to societies and has the potential to lead to terrorism and instability. While current news is dominated by extremists identifying themselves with an anomalous form of Islamism, it is important to recognise that both extremism and violent extremism can occur in all traditions around the world . It is therefore important to understand them as generic global problems with particular regional characteristics. Violent extremism includes terrorism, but also other forms of political motivated violence (such as anarchism), and some forms of communal violence. Consequently, \u2018Not all extremists adopt or support terrorism; but all terrorists are considered to be extremists in their thinking\u2019 ",
        "6 \u2018Radicalisers work by pointing to social, political and economic injustice around their followers\u2019 while there can be significant overlap, violent extremism is not the same as terrorism. Violent extremism does not generally include, for example, non-violent behaviour such as extremist incitement or terrorist facilitation. Moreover, the process of radicalisation to terrorism can be different than that of radicalisation to violent extremism. Radicalisation Radicalisation is the process by which people adopt extremist views. This normally involves indoctrination directly by charismatic leaders or indirectly by socialising with other extremists. Radicalisation can occur through reading extremist literature or by accessing material on the Internet; but this rarely occurs without personal contact with other extremists. Radicalisers work by pointing to social, political and economic injustice around their followers. They promote a belief that these injustices result from a corrupt system of politics or religion. To be persuasive, many of their arguments are based on facts and truths, and they tend to find particular traction in communities where poverty or inequality is widespread, or who have a history of marginalisation or persecution by the central state or other groups. Radicalisers are, however, selective and incomplete in the way they employ reality. They are highly persuasive and aim to arouse anger, hatred and other emotions to inspire individuals to action, which can escalate to violence. The process of radicalisation can also be abusive and coercive, using tactics of fear, violence and extortion to compel individuals to act. ",
        "7 CVE Concepts The primary aim of the Commission\u2019s directorate-General for International development and Cooperation assistance is to promote sustainable development. But many parts of the world cannot achieve basic development goals because of the insecurity caused by violent extremists. Similarly, violent extremist ideologies have found fertile ground in fragile communities characterised by little access to development. That is why the EU is promoting development approaches that will strengthen the resilience of communities to extremism around the world. \u2018Countering Violent Extremism, or CVE, constitutes all actions that strengthen the resilience of individuals and communities to the appeal of radicalisers and extremism\u2019 Susan Schulman \u2018Violent extremist ideologies have found fertile ground in fragile communities characterised by little access to development\u2019 ",
        "8 The overarching objective is for individuals and communities to become resilient to extremism and radicalisation by developing certain capabilities: enhancing critical thinking through education and self-expression, being empowered to communicate their ideas, and having a greater stake in their social and economic system. At a wider level, it is necessary to strengthen community cohesion, develop good governance and have an open mechanism for addressing past injustices. Countering Violent Extremism, or CVE, constitutes all actions that strengthen the resilience of individuals and communities to the appeal of radicalisers and extremism. The Commission\u2019s projects span eight themes that can be employed in CVE: development of education; media awareness; empowerment of women; youth work; socio-economic inclusion; governance capacity building; transitional justice; and inter\u2013 communal activities including sport and inter-faith dialogue. While the majority of the Commission\u2019s development projects are not specifically focused on CVE, many can provide collateral benefits in strengthening community resilience to violent extremism and addressing its root causes. A training programme aimed at those delivering, planning and resourcing development activities to make them more sensitive to CVE-specific issues has been developed and is being delivered progressively to a number of regions. Susan Schulman \u2018The overarching objective is for individuals and communities to become resilient to extremism and radicalisation\u2019 ",
        "9 Strengthening Resilience to Violence and Extremism 3 EU Counter-Terrorism and CVE Policy T HE EUROpEAn Union has long recognised the need to address the threat of terrorism, both at home and abroad. In 2003, the European Security Strategy was adopted as the overarching security policy framework and reference document for European Security. 1 This Strategy identified terrorism as one of the key threats facing the EU, and recognised that insecurity threatened development. Building on this, the EU Counter-Terrorism (CT) Strategy was adopted in 2005. It aims \u2018to reduce terrorism globally, whilst respecting human rights.\u2019 It is based on four pillars: \u2022 Respond : to prepare for and minimise the consequences of a successful terrorist attack. \u2022 Protect : to protect citizens and infrastructure, and reduce vulnerability to an attack. \u2022 Pursue : to pursue terrorists, bring them to justice, and build local capacity to do so. \u2022 Prevent : to prevent people turning to terrorism by tackling the factors which can lead to radicalisation and recruitment. Under the prevent pillar, the EU has been developing policy frameworks and implementation measures both inside the EU and in key strategic locations worldwide. \u2018Hard\u2019 CT measures from the pursue and Respond streams alone cannot address the complex nature of terrorism and violent extremism. nor do such approaches address the enabling environment for violent extremism. proactive prevention, therefore, is vital. 1 Council of the EU, \u2018A Secure Europe in a Better World \u2013 European Security Strategy\u2019, 12 december 2003. \u2018The European Union has long recognised the need to address the threat of terrorism, both at home and abroad\u2019 ",

        "Susan Schulman 11 The basis of the EU\u2019s prevent work is the EU Strategy for Combating Radicalisation and Recruitment to Terrorism , which was most recently revised in May 2014. 2 The Revised Strategy approaches CVE in a comprehensive manner and identifies priority areas for EU action both internally and externally. These include the promotion of equal opportunities, community-level efforts, counter-narratives and capacity-building. The Revised Strategy encourages collaboration between governments, communities, civil society, non-governmental organisations (nGO) and the private sector. It calls for a joint effort at local, regional, national and international levels to support vulnerable countries to counter the pull of terrorist recruitment and build the resilience of communities to radicalisation. The Revised Strategy, moreover, encourages the EU to raise awareness of counter- radicalisation work as part of development programming, as well as to take into account radicalisation in programming. The Commission has long recognised the so-called \u2018security-development nexus\u2019 \u2013 that there can be no security without development and vice versa. Fragile states, weak governance, and socio-economic and socio- political grievances provide uninhibited operating spaces for violent extremists and fertile grounds for recruitment and radicalisation. Armed conflicts also offer compelling images and narratives that can be used to radicalise. CVE, and the stabilising impact it can have, is therefore both directly and indirectly relevant to improving the delivery of EU assistance and development aid in vulnerable countries. 2 Council of the EU, \u2018The European Union Strategy for Combating Radicalisation and Recruitment to Terrorism\u2019, 24 november 2005; Council of the EU, \u2018Revised EU Strategy for Combating Radicalisation and Recruitment to Terrorism\u2019, 19 May 2014 (adopted June 2014). \u2018The Revised Strategy approaches CVE in a comprehensive manner\u2019 ",
        "PA Images 12 The Commission\u2019s CVE programming allows for variation in the local nature of radicalisation to violent extremism but follows a few general principles: \u2022 It must be evidence-based. \u2022 The local context must be taken into account for tailored programming. \u2022 A multidisciplinary approach must be adopted involving many actors beyond traditional law enforcement and military services, including health, educational, good-governance and human-rights agencies, and civil society. Internally focused initiatives are an important component of the EU\u2019s CVE work. There has long been recognition that internal CVE work needs to be aligned and coherent with its external initiatives. A number of EU member states also maintain their own internal and external CVE policies and programmes with similar principles and objectives, and have increasingly sought to draw on each other\u2019s experiences. programmes that contribute to CVE are drawn from the full range of the EU\u2019s different thematic and geographic instruments, such as the European development Fund (EdF), at a national level, sub-regional and regional instruments, thematic funds on governance and justice, as well as the Instrument Contributing to Stability and peace (IcSp) dealing with transnational and cross border challenges. \u2018Programmes that contribute to CVE are drawn from the full range of the EU\u2019s different thematic and geographic instruments\u2019 ",
        "13 Strengthening Resilience to Violence and Extremism 4 EU Actions on Countering Violent Extremism R ECOGnISInG THE nature of violent extremism as a global challenge, this chapter showcases a non-exhaustive list of examples of projects from different regions around the world that the EU is currently undertaking that are CVE-relevant or CVE- specific. The Commission\u2019s CVE activities have a wide and expanding geographic coverage, including West, north and East Africa; the Middle East; and South and Southeast Asia. CVE initiatives in these regions generally fall under three broad categories across eight thematic areas. First is public engagement , which, for example, includes reaching broad audiences and messaging through media campaigns and intercommunal cultural activities. The second category involves more targeted interventions when vulnerable communities or individuals have been identified; these include improving socio- economic inclusion and services, educational programmes, developing women and youth leaders, or transitional justice and disarmament, demobilisation and reintegration (ddR) initiatives. The third category involves enhancing CVE capacities of relevant government or non-governmental actors. This governance capacity-building includes police, civil society and the media, conflict mitigation or peace-building experts, and policy-makers. Under the Instrument contributing to Stability and peace, a number of CVE-specific actions have been launched around the world under the STRIVE programme. STRIVE stands for Strengthening Resilience to Violent Extremism. The STRIVE actions aim to be innovative CVE projects working with local communities to create conditions conducive to development and resilient towards violent extremism. Several of these actions have been included. \u2018The Commission\u2019s CVE activities have a wide and expanding geographic coverage\u2019 ",

        "Strengthening Resilience to Violence and Extremism contributing to Stability and peace for \u20ac2 million and implemented by the Royal United Services Institute for defence and Security Studies (RUSI), the programme aims to understand the drivers of violent extremism through evidence-based analysis, to develop best practices around CVE programming in the Horn of Africa based on short pilot activities, and to provide recommendations allowing for increased impact and more focused interventions. Running from January 2014 to January 2017, the programme comprises three thematic priorities - Youth Engagement, Investing in Women and Capacity-Building \u2013 and four main work streams, outlined below. Methods and Activities Building the regional capacity of security-sector and law-enforcement authorities to engage with civil society in fighting violent extremism law-enforcement authorities are key stakeholders in CVE, yet currently within the HoA they play only a marginal role in CVE efforts. Government counter-terrorism policies can often lead to grievances and encourage the spread of violent extremism; it is therefore crucial for law-enforcement agencies to engage in structured prevent-type activities and build partnerships with relevant civil-society organisations. STRIVE is helping to develop CVE best practice in the HoA through education, training and capacity-building with both law-enforcement agencies and civil society actors.

STRIVE engages with women\u2019s organisations to contribute to building greater resilience in communities vulnerable to radicalisation. This includes conducting training workshops, which provide guidance to women\u2019s organisations on how to increase engagement with security providers at both the state and clan level, in order to establish or improve de-radicalisation initiatives. Increasing understanding of the challenges faced by EU-born Somali youth in Somaliland When the programme was initiated, it was assumed that European-born Somali youth faced many challenges on their return to Somaliland, including alienation from the local community, which was believed to contribute to vulnerability to radicalisation to violent extremism. However, research by the STRIVE team has, to an extent, inverted such assumptions, with diaspora youth more inclined than often more conservative local youth to encourage the use of violence as a means of expressing ideological values. Based on these findings, STRIVE has identified key civil society actors able to facilitate dialogue between diaspora and local youth, aimed at strengthening resilience to violent extremism. Identifying and tackling the drivers for violent extremism among youth in Kenya While macro-factors such as limited education, political participation and the absence of rule of law are drivers of youth radicalisation and violent extremism in the HoA, local and regional factors are equally important; including narratives of historic injustice, local identity issues and pressures from families and communities. STRIVE aims to develop a greater understanding of these drivers in two areas afflicted by violent conflict: Eastleigh and its environs in nairobi; and the coastal region of Kenya. STRIVE will use this analysis to identify and support best practice by actors working with youth in those communities to deal with violent extremism. 20 ",

As such, a number of STRIVE\u2019s pilot projects include workshops to educate and inform local partners about CVE, the differences between non-violent and violent extremism, and the process of radicalisation. Similarly, very little monitoring and evaluation of CVE initiatives have occurred, and evidence of the impact of previous and ongoing programmes is limited.

The region faces simultaneous challenges of weak governance, corruption, unresolved internal tensions, and the risk of violent extremism, radicalisation and terrorism. This is an area where human insecurity is prevalent, where the freedom from want and the freedom from fear are both missing due to a complex set of factors primarily involving food insecurity, environmental vulnerabilities, lack of development and opportunities, and inter-ethnic tensions \u2013 amongst others. All these have contributed to the creation of an environment conducive to the spread of radicalisation, which has allowed certain terrorist groups to take advantage of these vulnerabilities and establish themselves in some parts of the region.

It will be run by the United nations Interregional Crime and Justice Research Institute (UnICRI) in cooperation with the Hedayah Center and the GCTF Working Groups. The aim of this programme is to launch, implement and evaluate innovative CVE projects and disseminate lessons learned and best practices, with implementation through civil society and non-state actors. Harnessing the efforts of civil society and non-state actors is crucial for both CVE and broader development. Triangular cooperation (South-South) will be encouraged and facilitated.

This project will consequently provide an inventory of existing/previous programmes to better understand and learn identified lessons. By producing a qualitative and quantitative mapping study, this will result in a comprehensive report with greater insight into recent and ongoing CVE activities. To optimise access to information, project leaders will facilitate information sessions and workshops with EU delegations in several countries in order to mobilise a maximum of potential applicants.

Recent political transitions, instability and conflict in the MEnA region have created power vacuums, where highly organised extremist groups have used openings to spread their messages. In addition, it has been recognised that a heavy-handed approach to counter-terrorism, confession-based prosecutions and other methods at odds with the EU\u2019s approach to criminal justice, human rights and the rule of law can exacerbate radicalisation. lack of oversight of the security sector can also create conditions conducive to radicalisation and violent extremism. The European Commission has therefore implemented two programmes of Criminal Justice Support for \u20ac600,000 to aid criminal-justice reform focused on counter- terrorism measures, the rule of law and human rights, specifically in transition countries in the Middle East and north Africa. One of the programmes focuses on the judiciary and will produce an analytical framework based on priorities and challenges identified by judges, the European Court of Human Rights and the European Court of Justice. Expert advice based on past experience of terrorism cases will enhance the capacity and regional cooperation of judges in transition countries.

The meetings will provide all participating judges with an opportunity to reflect on strategic outcomes that are responsive to the various challenges and opportunities identified. The meetings will establish a professional network of judicial officials engaged in terrorism cases in and across the target regions and Europe. The second programme focuses on parliamentarians, whereby a forum of exchange for parliamentarians will target the specific regions to form appropriate associations with counterparts from EU member states. This element will implement and support a sustainable, non-political forum for the exchange of good practices by and for national parliamentarians engaged in the development and oversight of counter-terrorism legislation and policy. Meetings in the Euro-Med and MEnA regions will facilitate discussions providing opportunities to develop policy and legislation responsive to the key challenges identified by those engaged in counter-terrorism policy. Two final analytical studies will be based on both of these actions, utilising the expert advice and specialist committees gathered from the national and regional workshops. The study will reflect the fundamental priorities, challenges and recommendations for the development of terrorism legislation, policy and oversight.

These bespoke training courses are designed and delivered to enable participants to better recognize the warning signs of radicalisation, and to orientate their programmes to address vulnerable communities and counter incipient violent extremism. The objectives are to increase understanding of CVE concepts, language and policy, as well as to provide methods, tools and approaches to design and implement CVE programming. The training is based on international development and CVE best practice and has a distinct operational focus. The outputs are user-friendly guidelines on, and constructive ideas for, programming and implementation issues pertaining to how third countries could be effectively supported in their own efforts. Region-specific three-day workshops for practitioners in East, West and north Africa, the Middle East, South and South-East Asia, and Central Asia have been and will be held from 2013 to 2015. One-day courses for EU policy and strategy staff in Brussels and half-day briefings for EU senior staff in Brussels are also planned. The workshops consider what kinds of CVE engagement may be suitable in each country or region, how existing development programming in different areas may contribute to addressing this challenge, and what specific interventions can reduce the appeal and recruiting potential of violent extremists. Each is tailored to the region it is conducted in. They map activities already being carried out and address issues such as strengthening the rule of law, promoting youth engagement and the roles of media, women and civil society in addressing violent extremism.

While this brochure has an external focus, it is useful to keep in mind the internal actions the EU is undertaking in CVE. This chapter will therefore present two successful actions undertaken internally within the EU. Terrorism and Radicalisation, Europe Aims and Objectives The objective of Terrorism and Radicalisation in Europe (TerRa) is to reinforce the positive impact victims and former terrorists can have in preventing radicalisation through the provision of practical guidance to specific targeted and vulnerable groups. description of Activities TerRa is a European programme supported by the European Commission directorate- General for Migration and Home Affairs and comprises a European network-based prevention and learning programme. The initial stage of the programme is a research phase to build upon accumulated knowledge of radicalisation. The objective is that I n t e r n a l E U P r o g r a m m e s TerRa and RAN ",
        "47 Strengthening Resilience to Violence and Extremism once research has been gathered it can be utilised to enhance existing prevention and de-radicalisation programmes, as well as developing new ones. Utilising the experience of victims and former terrorists provides a fruitful basis upon which practical guidance can be provided to the specific targeted groups. The targeted groups include victims, potential terrorists, EU member states and frontline workers in the fields of rehabilitation, welfare and social workers, journalists, policy-makers, law- enforcement and religious leaders. TerRa aims to realise a broad platform to exchange available materials, lessons and experiences between all member states and to provide practical tools, advice and policy input to all involved stakeholders. The intended results are: network coverage in all member states in close cooperation with the network of Associations of Victims (nAVT) and the Radicalisation Awareness network (RAn); an overview and description of methods and approaches to screen victims and recognise signs of radicalisation; a manual with recommendations for a broad group of front-liners; guidance for journalists and policy-makers; and education packages for schools. Key Points/lessons learned \u2022 Activities are based on an initial research phase that builds upon accumulated knowledge of radicalisation and aims to develop new prevention and de- radicalisation programmes. \u2022 The programme provides target groups with practical guidance, advocating the positive role that victims and former terrorists can play in improving and establishing EXIT programmes. \u2022 Results of the programme will be network coverage, guidance, education packages, manuals for frontline workers, and an overview of approaches to recognise signs of radicalisation. \u2018The objective of TerRa is to reinforce the positive impact victims and former terrorists can have in preventing radicalisation through the provision of practical guidance to specific targeted and vulnerable groups.\u2019 ",
        "STRIVE for Development 48 RAN Working Group on the Internet and Social Media (RAN@), European Union Aims and Objectives The European Commission\u2019s directorate-General for Migration and Home Affairs continues to run several significant internally focused CVE programmes, one of which is the Radicalisation Awareness network (RAn) with the objective of systematising the exchange of best practices and expert knowledge knowledge of practitioners. These focus, amongst others, on counter-messaging in a quest to support practitioners with the tools to develop new, innovative campaigning strategies to counter the narratives of violent extremism. description of Activities Established by the European Commission in 2011, RAn acts as an inclusive network for local actors concerned with countering violent radicalisation within the EU. The RAn@ Working Group on the Internet and Social Media (RAn@) is focused specifically on the issue of online radicalisation. Co-chaired by Google Ideas and the Institute for Strategic dialogue, the working group aims to exchange experiences, knowledge and best practices in countering violent extremism online, and to inform European and member-state policy-development. The RAn Working Group explores new positive civil-society responses to counter the allure of violent-extremist messaging. In order to achieve this goal, the group is engaged in several activities. These include the exchange of good practices relating to counter-narratives on the Internet and social media, addressing questions such as why they work, how they can be replicated and how they can be scaled up. The group further identifies and addresses the challenges faced by civil-society campaigners, and the partnerships required between community groups, policy-makers and private-sector organisations to enable effective campaigns. ",
        "49 Strengthening Resilience to Violence and Extremism By marrying practitioner needs with private-sector technical solutions, the intention is to facilitate the formulation and dissemination of more effective counter\u2013 and alternative-narrative strategies. In doing so, the group has produced and released original, targeted audio-visual content. The working group is also working with the private-sector to develop innovative tools to disrupt extremist messengers on social media. This includes the development of a \u2018crowd-out\u2019 strategy, designed to galvanise the silent majority of moderates against hate speech.

        "STRIVE for Development 50 5 Glossary and Policy Documents The Value of a CVE Lexicon C VE IS a field in which partners \u2013 often with widely differing backgrounds \u2013 work together and need to use a common, non-emotive vocabulary. It is important to clarify and refine the language employed and to give it a harmonious, common basis. This lexicon of key terms in CVE programming has been developed in order to facilitate and improve dialogue, understanding and coordination among all those involved. It should serve as a valuable reference guide in training and in practical CVE work. It will also enable more effectively targeted programmes whose impact can be more easily and rigorously monitored and evaluated. This chapter presents a glossary of terms in CVE to act as a ready reference for practitioners and those engaged in the CVE policy-making process. It also offers a non-exhaustive list of key policy and good-practice documents in the field of CVE. ",
        "51 Strengthening Resilience to Violence and Extremism CVE Glossary Conditions conducive to the spread of terrorism and violent extremism This refers to the broader contexts in which radicalisation occurs. These are sometimes described as \u2018underlying drivers\u2019 or \u2018root causes\u2019, although the EU prefers not to use the term \u2018root causes\u2019 since it is open to misinterpretation. The word \u2018causes\u2019 in particular can be misused or abused by those who would like to imply that some terrorist acts could be excused or justified, by seeking to establish an automatic link between circumstances and, as a direct result of them, terrorism. There are, of course, numerous other paths and channels. For this reason, while recognising the need to address the broader context, the EU avoids any term that could imply a direct causal link between, for example, socio-economic conditions and terrorist acts. Counter-terrorism Actions taken directly against terrorist networks, and indirectly to influence and render global and regional environments inhospitable to terrorist networks. Also called CT. This includes both military and non-military methods such as deradicalisation, surveillance and intelligence gathering. Countering violent extremism Actions taken to increase the resilience of individuals and communities to the appeal of radicalisers and violent extremists. De-radicalisation The social and psychological process whereby an individual\u2019s commitment to, and involvement in, violent radicalisation is reduced to the extent that they are no longer at risk of involvement and engagement in violent activity. de- radicalisation may also refer to any initiative that tries to achieve a reduction of risk of re-offending through addressing the specific and relevant disengagement issues. de-radicalisation implies a cognitive shift \u2013 a fundamental change in understanding. Disengagement The process whereby an individual experiences a change in role or function that is usually associated with a reduced participation in violent activity. It may not necessarily involve leaving a terrorist or extremist movement, but is most frequently associated with significant temporary or permanent role change. It is, therefore, a behavioural shift. Additionally, while disengagement may stem from role change, that role change may be influenced by psychological factors such as disillusionment, burnout or the failure to reach the expectations that influenced initial involvement. disengagement diff ers from de-radicalisation because it does not entail a full psychological withdrawal or change in values and ideals, but requires relinquishing the objective of achieving change through violence. ",
        "STRIVE for Development 52 Extremism Any political theory favouring immoderate, uncompromising policies, often entailing a tendency or disposition to go to extremes or an instance of going to extremes, especially in political matters. In terms of terrorist actors, this will often involve the premeditation of violence and undermining of the state to further the aims of a hard- line ideology. One, however, can have extremist views and not undertake an act of violence or terrorism; the level of extremism comes from the individual\u2019s commitment to the fundamental ideology. Impact The measurable effect a programme has on its target audience, to help assess an intervention\u2019s success. Impact can be qualitative or quantitative. Impact in CVE is extremely difficult to measure as selecting accurate indicators is extremely challenging. Impact is affected by temporal limitations and availability of data. There tends to be a lack of a counterfactual or control group or effective means of attribution. Moreover, it is challenging to measure attitudes and behaviours and multiple factors may contribute to radicalisation. Indicators Measurements of different aspects of the programme to see how they are functioning and whether the programme is meeting targets. Indicators vary between the short to long term of an evaluation. Measuring a decrease in terrorist incidents or recidivism is hard to attribute and can only be evidenced in the long term. Realistic and well defined indicators are needed that data can be collected on. Insurgent An individual or group who fights against a government or an occupying force with the aim of overthrowing it. Interventions In the CVE context, these comprise projects intended to divert people who are being drawn into violent extremist activity. Interventions can include mentoring, counseling, theological support, encouraging civic engagement, developing support networks (family and peer structures) or providing mainstream services (education, employment, health, finance or housing). Multiculturalism The preservation and proactive inclusion of a diverse range of cultures, religious practices and ethnicities within a unified society, region or state. This can be an overall policy aim or encouraged by local authorities and citizens. It can be seen as both a practice and a normative target. Prevent The branch of the EU\u2019s Counter-Terrorism Strategy with the main focus on CVE. It is aimed at reducing or eliminating the risk of individuals becoming involved in terrorism. prevention involves the identification and referral of those susceptible to violent ",
        "53 Strengthening Resilience to Violence and Extremism extremism into appropriate interventions. These interventions aim to divert susceptible individuals from embarking on the path to radicalisation. Protect The branch of the EU\u2019s Counter-Terrorism Strategy with the goal of protecting citizens and infrastructure, and reducing their vulnerability to an attack. Pursue The branch of the EU\u2019s Counter-Terrorism Strategy with the objective of pursuing terrorists, bringing them to justice, and building local capacity to do so. Preventing Violent Extremism Synonym of countering violent extremism. Radicalisation There are many definitions of radicalisation, which is in essence the social and psychological process of incrementally experienced commitment from mainstream to extremist political or religious ideology. It does not necessarily mean that those affected will become violent, and so represents the precursor to violent extremism. But when a decision is made, as part of this process, that fear, terror and violence are justified to achieve ideological, political, or social change, radicalisation to violent extremism and terrorism occurs. Since radicalisation is a process, the term reflects a certain complexity as to how persons come to accept and support the use of terrorist means to achieve a cause. It is judged by some experts that it is possible for violent extremist and terrorist actors to \u2018self-radicalise\u2019: that is, become an extremist based on their own undertaking and interpretation of radical materials outside the influence of formal terrorist or violent extremist organisations. Recruitment Often used in conjunction with \u2018radicalisation\u2019. However, the two terms are not always interchangeable. Recruitment implies that there is some external agent or influence that draws individuals into engaging in terrorism or violent extremism. Involvement in these, however, is not merely the result of recruiters looking out for potential recruits. Although terrorist organisations engage in the practice of \u2018recruiting\u2019, the way in which people take the path of terrorism or violent extremism is often far more complex. It is best, therefore, to use \u2018recruitment\u2019 in conjunction with, rather than as a substitute for, \u2018radicalisation\u2019. Recidivism In CVE this relates to the return or relapse of an individual back into old patterns of extremist or radical behaviour usually associated with violence or terrorist activity. ",
        "STRIVE for Development 54 Rehabilitation A purposeful, planned intervention, which aims to change the characteristics of an offender (attitudes, cognitive skills and processes, and social, educational or vocational skills) that are believed to be the cause of the individual\u2019s violent/criminal behavior, with the intention of reducing the chance that the individual will reoffend. Rehabilitation efforts can include religious (re-)education by respected clerics, psychological counseling, community and family involvement, vocational training and engagement after the trainee has been released. Reintegration A safe transition to the community, by which the individual proceeds to live a law- abiding life following his or her release and acquires attitudes and behaviours that generally lead to productive functioning in society. Resilience The capability of people, groups and communities to rebut and reject proponents of terrorism and the ideology they promote. Respond The branch of the EU\u2019s Counter-Terrorism Strategy aiming to prepare for and minimise the consequences of a successful terrorist attack. Social Cohesion The communal integration of societies with different ethnic, religious or national backgrounds in a local area. It is one of the attributes of a multicultural society in which ethnic or community tensions are resolved via effective local initiatives, good police practice and removal of rigorously enforced social boundaries that aggravate community relationships. Terrorism The calculated use of violence (or the threat of violence) against civilians in order to attain goals that are political, religious or ideological in nature; this is done through intimidation, coercion or instilling fear amongst the general public. Terrorist activity can be conducted by a group or an individual, and can be inspired by another act. Violent Extremism The beliefs and actions of people who support or use violence to achieve ideological, religious or political goals. This includes terrorism, but also other forms of politically motivated violence (such as anarchism), and some forms of communal violence. Consequently, while there can be significant overlap, violent extremism is not the same as terrorism. It does not include, for example, non-violent behaviour such as extremist incitement or terrorist facilitation. Moreover, the process of radicalisation to terrorism can be different than that of radicalisation to violent extremism. Vulnerability The condition of being capable of being injured; difficult to defend; open to moral or ideological attack. Within CVE, the word describes factors and characteristics associated with being susceptible to radicalisation. ",
        "55 Strengthening Resilience to Violence and Extremism Key EU Policy Documents European Union Counter-Terrorism Strategy The official objective of the strategy, first developed in 2005, is \u2018to reduce terrorism globally, whilst respecting human rights.\u2019 It is based on four pillars that aim to reduce both the threat of and vulnerability to terrorism: Respond (prepare for the consequences of a terrorist attack); protect (reduce the vulnerability of civilians and infrastructure to terrorist attack); pursue (bring terrorists to justice); and prevent (stop people turning to terrorism by tackling underlying drivers). The EU aims to add value in all these fields to member and external state efforts. European Union Strategy for Combating Radicalisation and Recruitment to Terrorism The EU\u2019s Strategy focused on countering violent extremism (the \u2018prevent\u2019 pillar of its CT Strategy) was first drawn up in 2005 and subsequently revised twice, with the latest version produced in 2014. While it has a predominantly internal security focus, it also forms the basis of the EU\u2019s external \u2018 prevent\u2019 actions and addresses the external dimension of CVE. Its aim is to prevent radicalisation to all forms of terrorism and violent extremism. The strategy acknowledges that much radical ideology stems from groups which operate within the law. It also recognises the need for an all-inclusive counter-approach across a number of sectors and stakeholders that includes disrupting existing networks and preventing new recruits from joining the cause. The strategy is designed to help states develop, where relevant, their own programmes and policies, which take into account the specific needs, objectives and capabilities of each. Preventing Radicalisation to Terrorism and Violent Extremism: Strengthening the EU\u2019s Response An official Communication from the Commission from January 2014. This policy paper sets out how the Commission, in collaboration with the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security policy and with the support of the EU Counter-Terrorism Coordinator, can support member states in preventing radicalisation. It identified ten areas in which member states and the Commission could work together, from consolidating expertise and training practitioners to cooperating with civil society and the private sector. While mainly a document focused on internal CVE efforts within the EU, it does identify the need to align internal and external aspects of preventing radicalisation and identifies areas for further work. Key International Policy and Good Practices Documents The UN Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy This Strategy and its Action plan were adopted by the Un General Assembly in 2006 and represent the first time Un member states adopted a common strategic approach to countering terrorism. It has four key areas of action: addressing conditions conducive to the spread of terrorism, preventing and combating terrorism, building capacity to prevent and combat terrorism and strengthen the role of the Un system, ",

Ankara Memorandum on Good Practices for a Multi-Sectoral Approach to Countering Violent Extremism Under the auspices of the Global Counterterrorism Forum (GCTF) and specifically its dedicated Working Group on Countering Violent Extremism, this document was produced in September 2013 and draws upon the experiences of GCTF Members. It aims to promote a comprehensive approach to CVE by setting out the possible roles that governments, agencies and civil society can play. It divides these into the following sections: Identifying the problem; Multi-Agency Approaches within the State; public- private partnerships; Socio-economic Approaches; and The Role of law Enforcement Agencies. It also identifies areas similar to the eight themes mentioned earlier in this brochure, including the role of women, the promotion of economic opportunity, education, intercommunal efforts, and working with youth. Abu Dhabi Memorandum on Good Practices for Education and Countering Violent Extremism This is another document produced under the auspices of the GCTF Working Group on CVE, and was drafted and developed in cooperation with the Hedayah Center in September 2014. This document focuses on how CVE policies and programmes can be developed at primary and secondary school levels as well as in higher education. The purpose is to provide concrete options for how education can be used positively without securitising the education sector. Good Practices on Community Engagement and Community-Oriented Policing as Tools to Counter Violent Extremism This good practices document, produced in August 2013 under the GCTF Working Group on CVE, focuses on the importance of locally relevant CVE initiatives and two key CVE tools in particular: community engagement and community-oriented policing. These are tools that focus on building trust with local communities and engaging them as partners through raising community awareness of the threat of violent extremism, building resilience, and providing them with the tools to prevent radicalisation and violence. It sets out a number of good practices while stressing that context-sensitive and tailored actions are essential. Rome Memorandum on Good Practices for Rehabilitation and Reintegration of Violent Extremist Offenders This document, produced under the GCTF framework from May 2012, recognises the incubating effect that prisons and other civilian incarceration facilities may have in terms of radicalisation and violent extremism and suggests good practices to counter this. The aim is to suggest methods designed to rehabilitate violent extremists and reintegrate them back into society with a reduced risk of recidivism. ",
