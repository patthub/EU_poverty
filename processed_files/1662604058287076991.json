        "Employment and social affairs Responsibility for employment policies and social affairs is shared between the EU and its Member States. The European Commission has made jobs, growth and investment its top priority, backed up by the Investment Plan for Europe . The EU contributes to the creation of more and better jobs across Europe, and aims for decent social standards for all its citizens, including through the \u20ac86.4 billion European Social Fund. What the EU does The EU\u2019s employment and social affairs policies are designed to: \u25cf create quality jobs throughout the EU; \u25cf help workers to find jobs in their own or another EU country; \u25cf promote skills and entrepreneurship; \u25cf coordinate and modernise social secu- rity schemes; \u25cf create better working conditions through common minimum standards; \u25cf support social inclusion and combat poverty; and \u25cf protect the rights of people with disa- bilities. These policies contribute to achieving the Europe 2020 tar- gets in employment, social in- clusion and education. The EU provides and coordinates funding to help Member States invest in people (in areas like childcare, healthcare, training, accessi- ble infrastructure and help with finding a job) and to reform their social security systems. The Eu- ropean Social Fund is investing \u20ac86.4 billion to help millions of Europe- ans acquire new skills and find better jobs. The youth guarantee (\u20ac8.8 billion) supports youth employment by ensuring that all young people under 25 receive a good-quality, concrete offer of a job, ap- prenticeship, traineeship or continued ed- ucation within 4 months of leaving formal education or becoming unemployed. The upskilling pathways initiative helps adults to master basic skills such as reading, writ- ing or using a computer. Through this initi- ative, the EU helps Member States to give people a second chance to build their skills. While social security remains the responsi- bility of each Member State, the EU creates bridges between national systems for citi- zens moving across borders. The EU rules on social security coordination do not replace national systems, but protect the social security rights of people when they move within the EU (and Iceland, Liech- tenstein, Norway and Switzerland). The EU also protects people through laws to limit working hours, tackle workplace discrimi- nation, make working conditions safer and ensure that they receive compensation for work injuries. To deliver new and more effective rights for citizens, the European pillar of social rights enshrines principles and rights in the areas of equal opportunities on the labour market, fair working conditions and social protection. EURES , the European Job Mobili- ty Portal, also helps connect job- seekers and companies offering a job.
