        "2 EU regions worst-hit by COVID-19 Higher negative sensitivity Medium negative sensitivity Lower negative sensitivity Key fact Source: IPSOS Results of the survey Source: CoR study, 2021 In 2020 local and regional authorities (LRAs) across Europe experienced an increase in expenditure of around 125 billion EUR \u2013 due to pandemic related measures - and a fall in revenues of 55 billion EUR - largely due to decreased economic activity, tax, tariff and fee income. This ''scissors effect'' translates into a gap of around 180 billion EUR in our finances, with 130 billion lost by regional and intermediate levels, and 50 billion lost at municipal level. German LRAs are by far the most hit in absolute terms (-111 billions), followed by Italian (-22,7) and Spanish (-12,3) ones. The losses as percentage of total revenues were highest for LRAs in Cyprus (-25%), Bulgaria (-15,3%) and Luxembourg (-13,5%). Chapter 1 A 180 billion budget cut is putting at risk regional and local finances Local and regional politicians believe it is important to increase regions' and cities' access to EU funds.

        "EU annual regional and local 3 Key fact Source: IPSOS Results of the survey The Barometer highlights deep differences in how the pandemic affected the health of our communities. Severov\u00fdchod was the region with the highest number of cases, but Valle d'Aosta recorded the highest death toll per 100.000 inhabitants. The Comunidad de Madrid was the region with the highest share of 2020 excess mortality compared to the average number of deaths over the previous four years. In general, in 2020 it was safer to live in the countryside than in the city. Urban centres are better endowed when it comes to healthcare, but rural regions recorded lower rates of excess deaths and demonstrated a higher level of adaptation to change. Ignoring the territorial dimension of the health crisis puts lives at risk Chapter 2 Local and regional politicians want regions and cities become more influential in EU policy-making on health issues. Regions are a cornerstone of health systems and must be involved in the design of the European Health Union. The EU should invest more in resilience of regional systems and coordinate capacity- stress tests to assess their crisis preparedness.

Within this minority, only some of them saw their contribution taken into account in the relevant NRRP. While Germany, Belgium and Poland had an inclusive approach towards LRAs, Italy, Spain, France and Croatia did not perform as well. In some countries, the overall budgetary allocations on green policies and the green transition is absorbing on average 41% of the budget in the NRRPs. But a broader analysis of the national plans shows that they should be better aligned with the European Green Deal, as many of them are in danger of missing the 37% climate spending target. The poor consultation of cities \u2013 one of the driving forces in fighting climate change \u2013 raises major concerns on the plans' ability to tackle the most urgent problems on the ground.

Employment among young people declined particularly strongly in 2020. Youth unemployment is 10 percentage points higher than the general population. Temporary employment and part time employment also registered significant decrease. People living in poor conditions, persons with disabilities and the elderly suffered of worsening in their living conditions. The pandemic further highlighted longstanding gender inequalities and gender-related occupational risks. Source: Eurostat Chapter 5 COVID poverty is becoming a reality.

        "The European Committee of the Regions (CoR) is the EU\u2019s political assembly of 329 regional and local representatives from all 27 Member States. Our members are elected presidents of regions, regional councillors, mayors and local councillors - democratically accountable to more than 446 million European citizens. The CoR\u2019s main objectives are to involve regional and local authorities and the communities they represent in the EU\u2019s decision-making process and to inform them about EU policies. The European Commission, the European Parliament and the Council have to consult the Committee in policy areas affecting regions and cities. It can appeal to the Court of Justice of the European Union as a means of upholding EU law where there are breaches to the subsidiarity principle or failures to respect regional or local authorities.
