        "Foreword Despite slow improvements in the economic situa- tion of some of the EU Member States, high unem- ployment and increased poverty rates remain the core challenges for the coming years. Political deci- sions and the implementation of EU programmes are needed to address the lack of economic growth, to be implemented together with strong social poli- cies and to advance a strong case for the EU added value of the Commission\u2019s action. The EU programme for employment and social innovation \u2014 EaSI \u2014 has been established to contribute to the implementation of the Europe 2020 strategy targets, by providing financial support for the Union\u2019s objectives in terms of promoting a high level of qual- ity and sustainable employment, guarantee- ing adequate and decent social protection, combating social exclusion and poverty and improving working conditions. The EaSI incorporates three existing programmes and extends their coverage: Progress (programme for employment and social solidarity), EURES (European Employment Services) and the European Progress Microfinance Facility. The EaSI will enable the Commission to increase the policy coherence and impact of its instru- ments, which have common objectives. During 2014 the EaSI helped to generate evidence to make a significant contribution to EU policy initia- tives launched in the field of employment and social affairs. It also supported policy coordination, the sharing of best practice, capacity building and test- ing of innovative policies. The EaSI (via its EURES axis) contributed to a better functioning of the labour markets by facilitating geographical mobility of workers, providing greater transparency on the labour market and ensuring the clearance of vacan- cies and applications for employment at European level. Similarly to what is being achieved under the Progress microfinance, the EaSI aims to increase the availability of and access to microfinance for vulnerable groups and micro-enterprises that will take the form of financial instruments to support microcredit providers reaching out to these groups. Every year since 2007, the Commission has reported on the performance of the implementa- tion of the activities funded by Progress (2007\u201313) in line with the results-based management. The EaSI (2014\u201320) continues this approach, trying to make its activities always more effective and its results more tangible. With this report the Commission responds to a need of accountability and greater visibility of its activities. It monitors the performance of its actions and incorporates the stakeholders\u2019 views on the programme\u2019s operations in 2014. While we are confident that this report will meet readers\u2019 expectations, we are always keen to improve. We therefore welcome any feedback, sug- gestions, comments or questions.

        "I. Introduction 1. EASI PROGRAMME AND ITS POLICY CONTEXT The European Union Programme for Employment and Social Innovation (EaSI), which was adopted in December 2013 (1) , is one of the four financial instruments in the area of employment and social affairs for the period 2014-2020, together with the European Social Fund (ESF), the Fund for European Aid for the most Deprived and the European Glo- balisation Adjustment Fund. EaSI provides financial support to promote a high level of quality and sustainable employment, guarantee adequate and decent social protection, combat social exclusion and poverty and improve working conditions. It is structured into three axes: \u2022 Progress axis focuses on providing sup- port to the policy-making and implementa- tion process through production of policy evidence, organisation of information shar- ing and mutual learning activities, funding social policy experimentation projects and providing capacity-building support to EU and national organisations. \u2022 EURES axis aims to improve geographical mobility in the EU through making information on placements more transparent and acces- sible as well as funding the actual services for jobseekers and employers. \u2022 Microfinance and social entrepreneurship axis aims to improve access to finance for vul- nerable people, micro- and social enterprises by providing funding for financial intermediar- ies and capacity building of relevant actors. The EaSI is framed by the Europe 2020 Strategy for smart, sustainable and inclusive growth. The Strategy sets out an overarching policy frame- work for reforming labour markets, modernising social Europe, creating job opportunities, ensuring adequate and sustainable social protection sys- tems and social inclusion, and fostering economic competitiveness. The EaSI programme provides financial support to contribute to the implementa- tion of Europe 2020, including its headline targets, (1) REGULATION (EU) No 1296/2013. Integrated Guidelines and flagship initiatives. Since the end of 2014 and establishment of the new Commission, the Agenda for Jobs, Growth, Fairness and Democratic Change (Political Guidelines of the new Commission) has put a focus on ensuring that the jobs\u2019 creation dimension and more generally the social dimension of the EU is taken into considera- tion in the process governing the implementation of the EU 2020 Strategy, the European Semester. President Juncker\u2019s Political Guidelines include sev- eral initiatives in relation to employment and social issues. One of the key strategies for the years to come is to enhance convergence of labour mar- kets across the Eurozone. In addition, stepping up policy reforms in the direction of social investment is needed to modernise social protection systems. The EaSI programme is managed directly by the Commission (Directorate-General for Employ- ment, Social Affairs and Inclusion); assisted by a Committee, composed of representatives of Member States. The Programme is implemented on the basis of a work programme adopted every year. With a view to the regular monitoring of the Pro- gramme, the EaSI Regulation foresees that \u2018the Commission shall draw up an initial qualitative and quantitative monitoring report covering the first year, followed by three reports covering consecu- tive two-year periods (2) . This report is the monitor- ing report covering the year 2014. It presents the actions taken to launch the Programme as well as the first results for 2014. A series of actions have been achieved in order to launch the EaSI Programme in 2014, mainly: \u2022 preparation of the work programme 2014 and the launch of its implementation; \u2022 establishment of the EaSI Committee; \u2022 promotion and dissemination of information about the new programme; \u2022 setting up the monitoring system of the EaSI programme.

        "2. LAUNCH OF THE PROGRAMME 2.1. Work Programme 2014 The preparation of the 2014 work programme took place in the context of the post-crisis situa- tion. The financial and economic crisis continued to severely affect the employment and social situ- ation across the EU. Young people in particular have felt the full force of the economic downturn: in December 2012 the youth unemployment rate was 23.4 % in the EU, and over 50 % in some Mem- ber States. Those at risk of poverty or social exclu- sion accounted for nearly 24 % of the population, with wide disparities between countries. The EU was struggling with many challenges that needed to be addressed: \u2022 high unemployment has already led to all- time high long-term unemployment; \u2022 large job destruction has aggravated low employment; \u2022 at the same time precarious employment has increased and labour mismatches occurred with the rise of structural unemployment; \u2022 the impact of the crisis has seen rising ine- quality, with the lower income groups hardest hit by job losses; \u2022 the number of young people not in education, employment and training (NEET) expanded; \u2022 poverty and social exclusion has increased, following the rise in jobless households and rise in in-work poverty; household incomes have declined. The EaSI Work Programme 2014 reacted to the above-mentioned policy challenges. It included a description of the policy context and main activities, a list of activities and the annex to the Commission Decision (3) , which was adopted in March 2014. (3) Commission Decision C (2014)1429 of 12 March 2014. 2.2. EaSI Committee Three meetings of the EaSI Committee took place in 2014. The rule of procedure was adopted and the Committee discussed a series of issues including the setting up of the monitoring system, which is described in detail below. 2.3. Promotion and dissemination A new website on EUROPA (4) was created to provide information to the relevant stakeholders and the gen- eral public. A brochure was published in order to explain the main aims and novelties of the programme. 3. DEFINITION OF THE MONITORING SYSTEM A contractor was appointed to assist the Com- mission in delivering the monitoring report and in improving the dissemination of good practices. This process started with a definition of a logical framework for the EaSI programme and estab- lishment of the system to measure EaSI per- formance, including qualitative and quantitative key performance indicators (KPIs), as well as a description of the baseline situation. The reconstruction of the EaSI logical frame- work (see Figure 1) was based on the interpreta- tion of legal and policy documents governing the programme. It aims to operationalise the ways in which the programme will contribute to the achievement of its general policy goals (5) . EaSI aims to both improve the policy-mak- ing process in the fields of employment, social protection and social inclusion and working con- ditions, as well as to make a direct impact in the areas of labour mobility and microfinance/ social entrepreneurship. As a result of the close inter-linkages and spill- overs between EU-28 economies and societies, especially in the euro area, adequate policy measures to tackle pressing social and economic (4) http://ec.europa.eu/social/main. jsp?langId=en&catId=1081 (5) Regulation 1296/2013, Article 4. 8 EASI PERFORMANCE MONITORING REPORT 2014 ",
        "challenges in one country affect the perfor- mance of other countries, as do the lack of such measures. Common actions taken by the EU as a response to the crisis (6) proved to be effec- tive. This indicates that coordinated actions at the EU level are often more effective in addressing common challenges than indi- vidual actions of Member States. The key issue for the EU social and employment policy, within the EU\u2019s limits of competence, is therefore that of ensuring collective action and effective policy coordination among the EU Member States. While actions to tackle the current socioeconomic problems are still primarily the responsibility of the Member States and regions and have to be taken closest to the citizens at national and sub-national levels, the EU has a role to play in putting the need for specific reforms on the agenda, informing about barriers to change and opportunities to overcome them, ensuring that existing European level rules are complied with, stimulating sharing of good practices and mutual learning, and, especially, support- ing social policy innovation and Europe-wide approaches, where there is a clear value added for EU-level intervention. Figure 1 provides a graphical presentation of the EaSI logical framework. It follows the expected effects approach, where objectives stated in the EaSI Regulation (general and specific ones) are translated into expected effects (intermediate and immediate outcomes) before being presented as a logical model. Achievement of the immediate outcomes contributes to achievement of one or more intermediate outcomes, while achievement of the latter subsequently contributes to achieve- ment of the ultimate outcome. In line with the logical framework, the EaSI pro- gramme will aim to achieve the following nine immediate (short-term) outcomes : Progress axis: 1. evidence-based EU policies and legislation; (6) For instance, through the adoption of the European Economic Recovery Plan and common action to stabilise the banking system. 2. effective and inclusive information sharing, mutual learning and dialogue; 3. better conditions for social policy innovation; 4. greater capacities of national and EU organisations; EURES axis: 5. transparent labour market information; 6. effective provision of services for recruitment and placing of workers; Microfinance and Social Entrepreneurship axis: 7. better access to, and availability of, microfinance; 8. better access to finance for social enterprises; 9. stronger institutional capacity of micro- credit providers. These immediate outcomes are expected to con- tribute to the achievements of five intermediate (long-term) outcomes : 1. stronger ownership of EU objectives; 2. facilitation of policy reforms, convergence and capacities for social innovation and mutual learning; 3. modernisation and effective application of EU law; 4. high quality and inclusive EU labour markets, which are open and accessible to all; 5. increased access to finance for vulnerable per- sons, micro- and social enterprises. When implementing all of its actions, EaSI also aims to: \u2022 pay particular attention to vulnerable groups, such as young people; \u2022 promote equality between women and men; 9 EASI PERFORMANCE MONITORING REPORT 2014 ",
        "\u2022 combat discrimination based on sex, racial or ethnic origin, religion or belief, disability or sexual orientation; \u2022 promote a high level of quality and sustain- able employment, guarantee adequate and decent social protection, combat long-term unemployment and fight against poverty and social exclusion. The EaSI performance monitoring sys- tem establishes: \u2022 performance expectations , i.e. explanation what does it mean to achieve a given outcome, which the programme is expected to contribute to. Performance expectations are presented in the text of this report as short statements about the impact which is expected from the programme under each outcome; \u2022 a limited number of key performance indica- tors for each of the outcomes to measure the programme\u2019s performance. The proposed indica- tors are consistent with the SMART and RACER principles for defining objectives and indicators; \u2022 the baseline values of the proposed indicators; \u2022 description of the system to gather and store information. Among other methods, the collection of information for this report involved two surveys: 1. The Stakeholder Survey aimed to collect overall opinions of EaSI stakeholders (including EU and national policy and decision-makers, civil society, independent experts and other relevant groups) regarding the operation of the programme and usefulness of its outputs. Overall, 10 737 invi- tations were sent to participate in the Stake- holder Survey under all three axes (7) . In total, 1 662 responses were received. The response rate of the EaSI Stakeholder Survey was around 17,3 %. (7) 1121 invitations did not reach the final recipients (i.e. resulted in bounced emails). 2. A survey of participants in EaSI-supported events aimed to assess the value of these events and the usability of their results. Overall, 3 670 invitations were sent to participate in the survey (8) . In total, 863 responses were received. The response rate of the survey was around 24,2 %. This EaSI Performance Monitoring Report presents the results achieved by the programme in 2014; it focuses on the delivered products (outputs) and the benefits they brought in 2014, i.e. on the achieve- ment of the immediate (Chapter 2) and intermediate (Chapter 3) outcomes. Chapter 4 provides consolidated information on financial inputs (planned and actual commitments). In addition: Annex 1: presents the EaSI performance moni- toring framework; Annex 2: provides the catalogue of outputs delivered in 2014 under each axis of the EaSI programme and indicates the contribution of these outputs to policy and legislative initiatives; It is important to note that 2014 is the first year of the programme implementation. Therefore, while many planned activities have been launched in 2014, only a moderate number of them have actually fin- ished. In most cases an activity launched in the year \u2018n\u2019 is only ending one, two or more years after it has started. Mainly events or publications of studies are taking place in the year on which the financial commitment is done. A project implemented under a call for proposals could take several years to be finalised. All the ongoing activities will be reported in the future EaSI performance monitoring reports once they are finished. As a result, this report, where relevant, also reviews activities implemented in 2014 under the predecessor programmes PROGRESS, EURES and Progress Microfi- nance Facility, and thereby show a connection between those programmes and their successor EaSI (this is always clearly indicated in the text). (8) 103 invitations did not reach final recipients (i.e. resulted in bounced emails). 10 EASI PERFORMANCE MONITORING REPORT 2014 ",
        "In comparison to annual performance monitoring reports prepared previously for the PROGRESS pro- gramme (2007-2013), this very first report on the EaSI programme contains financial information on planned and actual commitments for all three axes of the EaSI programme. The main objective has been to establish as direct as possible a link between the inputs (in terms of funding), outputs (activities funded), immediate outcomes (9 spe- cific objectives of EaSI) and intermediate outcomes (5 general objectives of EaSI) for the purpose of per- formance monitoring. The reader should be aware that certain limitations have been encountered with regard to the financial data included. While the report presents the planned and actual commitments for 2014, it also describes activities/outputs (9) for which the commitments were taken in 2014 or in the years before due to the multi-annual character of the EaSI-funded actions. Therefore, the reader should have in mind the difficulty in establishing a precise link and a possible mismatch between, on the one hand, the 2014 commitments indicated in the report (i.e. input) and, on the other hand, the activities funded (i.e. outputs). (9) For a list of outputs reported for 2014, please see Annex 2. 11 EASI PERFORMANCE MONITORING REPORT 2014 ",

        "II. Performance of the Programme This section of the report is structured around the three axes of EaSI and nine immediate (short-term) outcomes to which the EaSI programme is aim- ing to contribute. It aims in particular to compare the EaSI Work Programme funding priorities for 2014 with the actual implementation. Each chap- ter in this section reviews the rationale as well as planned and actual commitments under three EaSI axes in brief, whereas each sub-chapter addresses a specific immediate outcome; first by present- ing detailed information on activities and outputs delivered under the programme, which is necessary to understand their contribution to the outcomes, and, secondly by reviewing the programme\u2019s per- formance against the predefined key performance indicators (see Annex 1). 1. PROGRESS AXIS The Progress axis aims to support the policy-making process in the area of employment and social affairs by funding analytical outputs, information sharing and mutual learning activities, providing funding to various EU and national organisations as well supporting social policy experimentation projects to foster social innovation. It funds actions in one or more of the following thematic sections . The EaSI Regulation foresees over the entire period of the Pro- gramme indicative breakdown of the allocation (10) : \u2022 employment, in particular to fight youth unemployment (minimum 20 %); \u2022 social protection, social inclusion and the reduction and prevention of poverty (min- imum 50 %); \u2022 working conditions, including labour law and health and safety at work (minimum 10 %). 1.1. Financial implementation Table 1 provides an overview of planned and actual (individual) commitments under the (10) Any remainder shall be allocated to one or more of the thematic sections referred to above or to a combination of them (cross-cutting issues). Progress axis per thematic section and specific objective (immediate outcome). It must be noted that 2014 was the first year of EaSI implemen- tation and not all the planned activities have yet gained momentum. The shares of planned and committed amounts in the overall funding per thematic section largely corresponded to those foreseen in the EaSI Reg- ulation. However, the employment policy area was given more attention than initially planned, while the share of funding committed to all other policy areas was somewhat lower than provided in the Regulation. This might be partially due to the fact that the highest amount of funding planned was actually committed in the employ- ment policy area (71 %), whereas other thematic sections committed 39-44 % of planned expendi- ture. Overall, 50 % of planned funds were actu- ally committed in 2014 under the Progress axis, which constituted around EUR 36.2 million. In addition to these individual commitments made in 2014, implementation of global commitments worth around EUR 29.1 million has been post- poned for future years. This means that 92 % of the expenditure planned in 2014 will be actually committed in the coming year. When it comes to specific objectives (immedi- ate outcomes), the largest share of funding was committed to supporting effective and inclusive information sharing, mutual learning and dia- logue (38 %) and increasing the capacity of national and EU organisations (35 %) A signifi- cant share of funding (25 %) was also committed to producing policy evidence. Commitments in all aforementioned areas largely corresponded to initial plans. Finally, 1 % of the overall budget was committed in 2014 to support social policy experimentation/innovation projects. A call for proposals was launched in this area in 2014, however, the assessment period of the projects is still ongoing and therefore a significant amount of the planned commitments were postponed to the upcoming years. 13 EASI PERFORMANCE MONITORING REPORT 2014 ",

        "1.2. Achievement of the first outputs and key performance indicators Below the report reviews the performance of the programme under the Progress axis in terms of the short-term (immediate) outcomes that it is expected to achieve. 1.2.1. Evidence-based EU policies and legislation The EaSI programme supports the development and dissemination of high-quality comparative ana- lytical knowledge in order to ensure that EU poli- cies in the field of employment and social affairs are based on sound evidence and are relevant to the needs, challenges and conditions in individual Member States and other countries participating in the programme. EaSI is expected to contribute to this goal to the extent that: \u2022 EU policy initiatives launched in the field of employment and social affairs (including its various sub-fields) are informed by evidence generated with the support of the programme; \u2022 EaSI-funded analytical outputs are deemed relevant for policy-making and advocacy pur- poses by national, regional and local policy- makers as well as other stakeholders; \u2022 EaSI-funded analytical activities are well dis- seminated and all interested parties are aware of their availability. In 2014, the EaSI programme funded different types of analytical outputs, including studies and other reports, ad hoc analyses, periodicals, data- bases, methodologies and classifications, online platforms, monitoring systems, evaluations and various other ad-hoc outputs. EUR 9 200 048 were committed in 2014 for producing policy evidence under EaSI, which constituted 25 % of overall commitments under the Progress axis. EaSI analytical outputs have a primary purpose to respond directly to the evidence needs of the Commission in the fields of employment, social protection social inclusion and working conditions. Such evidence is either contracted directly by the Commission (procurement), funded through grants notably with international organisations carrying out research in the relevant fields (such as OECD and ILO), or developed by the networks of independent experts (such as European Employment Policy Observatory and European Social Policy Network). EaSI maintains and develops an evidence base necessary for EU employment, social and equality policies and legislation by financing five specific types of activities: qualitative and quantitative databases; methodologies, clas- sifications, micro-simulations, indicators and benchmarks; surveys, studies, analyses and reports; monitoring and assessment reports on the transposition and application of EU law; and evaluations and impact assessments. For a comprehensive list of outputs produced in 2014 please refer to Annex 2. Below the report provides an overview of the largest (and therefore of key importance) ana- lytical outputs funded in each of the thematic sections under the Progress axis. In the area of employment , the largest effort was put into improving anticipation of skills needs, analysis of skills supply and labour market needs. Under this thematic section, the largest amount of funding (EUR 7 073 611) in 2014 was committed to develop the Classification of Euro- pean Skills, Competences, Qualifications and Occupations (ESCO). This was also the largest overall analytical output funded by EaSI in 2014. Furthermore, following the adoption of the Youth Employment Package, a comprehensive set of analytical activities was launched in 2014. The latter activities will be continued in the future, as more than EUR 300 000 were globally committed in this area for the upcoming year. Furthermore, around EUR 400 000 are globally committed to monitoring labour market developments in the EU (i.e. such outputs as the regular European Vacancy Monitor, European Vacancy and Recruit- ment Report and European Job Mobility Bulletin). 15 EASI PERFORMANCE MONITORING REPORT 2014 ",
        "A report on Mapping and Analysing Bot- tleneck Vacancies in EU Labour Markets was prepared with financial support from EaSI in September 2014. The aim of the study was to identify the top-20 bottleneck occupations in the EU labour markets (per country). Bottle- neck occupations were understood as occupa- tions where there is evidence of recruitment difficulties, i.e. employers have problems find- ing and hiring staff to meet their needs. The study concluded that EU action in the field of mobility should address barriers to free movement and reduction of transaction costs. EU action could also be feasible concerning training and education, for instance through dedicated actions funded by the European Social Fund (including accompanying rules concerning target groups). Under the thematic section of social protec- tion and social inclusion , in 2014 the Com- mission mostly focused on preparatory works for the upcoming year. Around EUR 1.5 million were globally committed to improving the capacity to assess the impact of policy measures through EUROMOD (tax-benefit micro-simulation model), while around EUR 1 million were set aside for cooperation with OECD on promoting efficiency in health care. EUROMOD is a tax-benefit micro-simulation model for the EU that enables researchers and policy analysts to calculate, in a comparable manner, the effects of taxes and benefits on household incomes and work incentives for the population of each country and for the EU as a whole. In addition to calculating the effects of actual policies it is also used to evaluate the effects of tax-benefit policy reforms and other changes on poverty, inequality, incentives and government budgets. EUROMOD is a unique resource for cross-national research, designed to produce results that are comparable across countries and meaningful when aggregated to the EU level. Under the thematic section of working con- ditions in 2014 EaSI mainly contributed to strengthening the knowledge base in the area of occupational health and safety through sup- porting the work of the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) in the development of their monographs programme and the Inter- national Commission on Non-Ionizing Radia- tion Protection. When it comes to cross-cutting issues , in 2014 around EUR 400 000 were committed to producing a study on the assessment of labour provisions in trade and investment arrangements, while around EUR 250 000 were committed to the development and updating of the Labour Market Policy database. Compendium Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR): National Public Policies in the European Union was published with support from EaSI in September 2014. This compendium was one of the outcomes of the Peer Reviews on CSR which took place throughout 2013. Seven Peer Reviews bringing together four countries at each event were held to enable Member States to better understand the CSR policies of each other. This exercise was also a chance for the Commis- sion to update its own records in relation to the development of national CSR policies, and to look at common and country-specific themes. The compendium brings together the most up- to-date information arising from country pres- entations and discussions at the Peer Reviews, as well as from existing National Action Plans on CSR and on Business and Human Rights (includ- ing those under preparation). Table 2 presents information on the number of overall and monthly downloads of policy evidence outputs provided on the DG EMPL website of Europa. eu, which were funded by EaSI in 2014. The table presents the data up to February 2015. Please note that the overall number of downloads is not very high due to the fact that many outputs were pro- duced in late 2014. However, some relevant insights can be made. First, people tend to download out- puts that are very concise and present only the key information on specific topics (especially if they are high on the policy agenda), e.g. leaflet on the EU measures to tackle youth unemployment, guide and leaflet on Your first EURES Job initiative. Second, stakeholders are also interested in outputs which are periodical and are known to provide a good summary of the Commission\u2019s official approach, such as the Employment and Social Developments in Europe and Social Europe Guide . 16 EASI PERFORMANCE MONITORING REPORT 2014 ",

Below the report reviews the contribution of the EaSI analytical outputs to evidence-based EU pol- icies and legislation in terms of the key perfor- mance indicators. KPI 1. Coverage of the thematic sections by EaSI-funded analytical activities Information on the coverage of thematic sections by EaSI-funded analytical activities is provided in Table 3, which describes the number of analytical outputs produced as a result of direct funding from the Commission (procurement). The table includes outputs produced both in cases when one specific output was developed under a service contract as well as when a few or more outputs were produced under more complex contracts (e.g. those establish- ing European-level observatories). Surveys, studies, analyses and reports were the most common analytical activities in all thematic sections. The number of other types of outputs was rather low in 2014, since it was the first year of the programme\u2019s implementation. 17 EASI PERFORMANCE MONITORING REPORT 2014 ",

KPI 2. Policy initiatives being informed by the programme- supported analytical outputs There are many instances in which EaSI-funded policy evidence has contributed to the development and implementation of policy initiatives in the areas covered by DG EMPL. For more detailed information on this please refer to the second part of Annex 2, which lists EaSI outputs that contributed to policy and legislative initiatives during the year. In the area of employment , EaSI-funded analyt- ical outputs were instrumental in preparing coun- try-specific recommendations (CSRs) 2014/2015 in the framework of the European Semester, in partic- ular through the analytical works of the European Employment Policy Observatory (EPPO). Studies, such as the identification of the top-20 bottleneck occupations on the EU labour markets (11) , have contributed to the implementation of the Employ- ment Package. Implementation of the Employment Package was also facilitated by continuous support to the development of the ESCO database (12) , which identifies and categorises skills, competences, qual- ifications and occupations in a standard way, using standard terminology in all EU languages and an open format that can be used by third party soft- ware. It enables users to exchange CVs and job (11) http://ec.europa.eu/social/BlobServlet?docId=12625 &langId=en (12) http://ec.europa.eu/social/main.jsp?catId=1042&langId=en vacancies stored in different IT systems. The EU Skills Panorama website also contributed in this regard by presenting quantitative and qualitative information on short- and medium-term skills needs, skills supply and skills mismatches. Several analytical activities have supported the implementation of the Youth Employment Package and the Youth Guarantee. In particular, the analysis of the role of PES in implementing the Youth Guarantee has confirmed their central role in the implementa- tion of this initiative in almost all EU countries. In the area of social protection and social inclusion , EaSI-funded policy evidence was mostly useful to support the implementation of the Social Investment Package as well as to prepare CSRs 2014/2015 in the framework of the Euro- pean Semester. The EU\u2019s Mutual Information System on Social Pro- tection (MISSOC) was instrumental in the frame- work of the European Semester. It provided detailed, comparable and regularly updated information about national social protection systems and pub- lished comparative information covering 12 main areas of social protection: financing, health care, sickness, maternity, invalidity, old-age, survivors, employment injuries and occupational diseases, family, unemployment, guaranteed minimum resources and long-term care. Ad-hoc reports devel- oped by the European Social Policy Network (ESPN) 18 EASI PERFORMANCE MONITORING REPORT 2014 ",
        "were also highly relevant in preparing the CSRs 2014/2015. For example, in 2014 ESPN provided an assessment of progress towards the Europe 2020 social inclusion objectives as well as a the- matic report on investing in children. Several publications in this area have focused on the analysis of the consequences of the crisis: Investing in people: EU funding for employment and social inclusion, Social Europe guide ; Facing the crisis: The coping strategies of unemployed people in Europe , and the Belgian Platform against Poverty and Social Exclusion, Synthesis report . These publi- cations were mostly instrumental in implementing the Social Investment Package. In the area of working conditions , most of the analytical outputs contributed to policy and legisla- tion developments in the area of health and safety at work, while a number of outputs also focused on labour law issues. Flash Eurobarometer 398 on Working Conditions (published in April 2014) was highly useful in terms of collecting reliable information on the opinions of Europeans about such topics as working conditions and their evolution in the last 5 years, satisfac- tion with working conditions, employees\u2019 views on working conditions set by employers, and health and safety at work. This Eurobarometer was instru- mental for policy-makers in order to understand the situation as seen by the general public and inform the policy-making process with public opinion. Work of the European Labour Law Network (ELLN) was very helpful in improving the quality of leg- islation in the area of working conditions and monitoring its application. In this regard, ELLN has published various ad-hoc and quarterly reports on labour law in the Member States as well as Annual Report New Forms of Employment and EU Law . In the area of cross-cutting issues (i.e. issues important across the policy areas covered by EaSI), programme-funded policy evidence outputs mostly focused on reflecting the most recent employment and social developments in activities related to the European Semester. The Labour Market Policy (LMP) database was an important output funded in 2014. It was developed and maintained by Eurostat until 2013. From 2014, development and maintenance of the database is the responsibility of DG EMPL, while LMP data is disseminated by Eurostat. LMP statistics are one of the data sources for moni- toring the Employment Guidelines (part II of the Europe 2020 Integrated Guidelines) through the Europe 2020 Joint Assessment Framework (JAF). The guidelines specifically refer to the provision of active labour market policies, which cover LMP measures and LMP services, and adequate social security systems, which include LMP supports. Also, significant attention in 2014 was paid to labour mobility issues, e.g. development of the labour mobility package and monitoring of the transitional free movement arrangements related to Croatia. A joint OECD and EU publication on matching economic migration with labour market needs in Europe was very helpful in this regard. The publication has shed light on the following key ques- tions: What policies and practices are needed to ensure that economic migration and free movement contribute to meeting the labour market shortages that are expected to arise over the medium term? How to ensure a better use of migrants\u2019 skills? What are the lessons learnt from non-European OECD countries, particularly in the management of labour migration? In their responses to the EaSI survey, the stake- holders tend to agree with the statement that EU employment and social policy and legislation is based on evidence (on average, 71 % of respon- dents to the EaSI Stakeholder Survey acknowledged this). Labour mobility (EURES) is a policy area with the largest share of stakeholders agreeing with this statement. On the other hand, the lowest share of stakeholders with such opinion work in the policy areas of social protection and social inclusion as well as microfinance. 19 EASI PERFORMANCE MONITORING REPORT 2014 ",

All types of stakeholders are rather positive about the usability of EaSI-funded evidence (around 77-80 %). Furthermore, around 46 % of decision-makers and other stakeholders (e.g. independent experts, public employment services) indicated that they have already used familiar EaSI-funded evidence or are very likely to do this in the future. 20 EASI PERFORMANCE MONITORING REPORT 2014 ",

Table 4 provides a list of EaSI-funded analytical out- puts which were judged as most helpful by persons responding to the EaSI Stakeholder Survey. The table also indicates percentages of stakeholders who said that they are not aware of the listed outputs. Overall, the most helpful tool, which is inter alia providing policy evidence on the European labour market, is the EURES Job Mobility Portal. Almost 94 % of stake- holders assessed it as helpful. The EaSI-supported Labour Market Policy database was also judged as very helpful by 87 % of stakeholders. ESCO classi- fication was judged as the most helpful analytical output in the policy area of employment. In the area of social protection and social inclusion, studies on adequate social protection for long-term care needs in an ageing society and coping strategies for unem- ployed persons as well as the MISSOC database were seen as most helpful. Flash Eurobarometer carried out in the area of working conditions was seen as most helpful in the latter policy area. The general trend is that outputs receiving continuous funding and updated each year (especially various databases and methodologies) are seen as most helpful by the stakeholders. ESCO is a multilingual classification of European Skills, Competences, Qualifications and Occupa- tions and is part of the Europe 2020 strategy. ESCO was launched by the Commission in 2010. DG EMPL, DG EAC and Cedefop jointly coordinate its development. ESCO classification identifies and categorises skills, competences, qualifica- tions and occupations relevant for the EU labour market as well as education and training. It sys- tematically shows the relationships between the different concepts. ESCO, which has been devel- oped in an open IT format, is available for use free of charge by everyone and can be accessed via the ESCO portal. The first version of ESCO was published on 23 October 2013. This release marked the beginning of the pilot and testing phase, including the ESCO mapping pilot. The classification will be completely revised by 2017. The final product will be launched as ESCO v1. The table below also shows that a relatively large share (around 40-45 %) of stakeholders is not aware of such important EaSI-funded analytical outputs as EUROMOD, EESSI and the database on transnational company agreements. 21 EASI PERFORMANCE MONITORING REPORT 2014 ",

A few notable examples are provided below: \u2022 Members of the Employment Committee (EMCO) use EaSI-funded policy evidence in the context of multilateral surveillance exercises. \u2022 EaSI-funded analytical outputs were noted by national policy-makers as useful for comparing the situation, differences, good and best experiences between EU countries. This helps to suggest better solutions, give appropriate suggestions and exchange views and experiences with other players at the national level. 22 EASI PERFORMANCE MONITORING REPORT 2014 ",
        "\u2022 University lecturers indicated that analytical outputs are useful for research work and gen- eral academic work, as well as in preparing papers for conferences, publishing, using in lectures on labour market policy. \u2022 EaSI-funded evidence helped to gain an overall picture of the main innovations that emerge from the new context of the crisis in the labour market and to monitor the new tools available in this area. \u2022 A country expert from Ireland noted that EaSI-funded evidence was useful for drafting policy papers on skills and on Public Employ- ment Services. \u2022 The information provided in the Mutual Infor- mation System on Social Protection (MISSOC) tables regularly helps national policy-makers to compare their country with other Mem- ber States and to formulate alternatives. The EU\u2019s Mutual Information System on Social Pro- tection (MISSOC) provides detailed, comparable and regularly updated information about national social protections systems in English, French and German. MISSOC publishes and regularly updates comparative tables on social protection covering 32 countries, 12 main areas of social protection and more than 300 detailed categories. In addi- tion, the cross-cutting introductions to the com- parative tables provide a transnational approach to the main concepts and principles of each social protection branch. As from 2011, MISSOC is also in charge of updating a series of guides to national social security systems, more specifically designed to inform citizens moving within Europe. MISSOC also produces the MISSOC Analysis, an annual information bulletin and other specialised publications. The newly established EaSI-funded European Social Policy Network (ESPN) will act as a secretariat to MISSOC as of 2014. \u2022 The information from the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) monographs was found useful for prepar- ing grant applications as well as training programmes for inspectors of safety and health, and experiments. 1.2.2. Effective and inclusive information sharing, mutual learning and dialogue The EaSI programme facilitates effective and inclusive information sharing, mutual learning and dialogue on EU policies in the fields of employment, social protec- tion, social inclusion and working conditions at the EU, national and international level in order to assist the Member States and other countries participating in the programme in developing their policies and the Member States in implementing the Union\u2019s law. EaSI is expected to contribute to this outcome to the extent that: \u2022 EaSI-funded events contribute to improved understanding of participants of EU poli- cies and objectives in their respective the- matic sections; \u2022 debate on EU employment and social policy and law at European and domestic levels includes all relevant stakeholders and meets other minimum standards for consultation (e.g. clarity of issues, adequacy of time to contribute); \u2022 information acquired during events is actu- ally used by participants for policy-making or advocacy. To satisfy these expectations, in 2014 EaSI has funded five main types of activities: exchanges of good practice, peer reviews, mutual learning and trainings; Council Presidency events, conferences and seminars; guides, reports and educational material; information and communication activities; and information systems to exchange and dissemi- nate information. In 2014, EUR 13 916 953 or 38 % of the overall budget under the Progress axis was committed to funding activities in this area. Information-sharing and mutual-learning activ- ities were produced in three major ways: direct 23 EASI PERFORMANCE MONITORING REPORT 2014 ",
        "funding by the Commission (procurement); proj- ects/conferences organised under projects funded through action grants; and the key EU-level NGO networks supported through operating grants. This section considers activities produced directly by the Commission. Below the report provides an overview of the largest (and therefore of key importance) information-sharing and mutual-learning outputs funded in each of the thematic sections under the Progress axis. Employment In 2014, the largest amount of funding (over EUR 3.1 million) in the area of employment was committed to setting up and first meetings of the European Network of Public Employment Services, which was established following a Decision by the Council and the European Parliament to maximise efficiency of Public Employment Services (PES). The network comprises all 28 EU countries and the European Commission. It aims to: \u2022 compare PES performance through bench marking; \u2022 identify evidence-based good practices and fos- ter mutual learning; \u2022 promote the modernisation and strengthen- ing of PES service delivery, including of the Youth Guarantee; \u2022 prepare inputs to the European Employment Strategy and the corresponding national labour market policies. One of the immediate tasks of this network will be to exchange knowledge and successful prac- tices on the implementation of the Youth Guaran- tee, as most public employment services are the designated national contact points for this crucial reform. In 2014, the European Network of PES already contributed to a number of outputs related to the implementation of the Youth Guarantee. The second self-assessment report on PES capacity to implement the Youth Guarantee was published by the network in November 2014. The report is based on a questionnaire through which public employment services critically self- assessed different aspects of their capacity to implement the Youth Guarantee. It updated a similar assessment completed by PES in 2013. The report showed that across the four areas of service delivery assessed, capacity has improved year on year between 2013 and 2014 in two areas: services for employers (+9 %) and acti- vation and placement (+14 %). PES capacity in providing transparency of supply and demand has fallen (-5 %), while average PES capacity to provide a comprehensive range of services for young jobseekers (based on a series of new questions introduced in the 2014 questionnaire) scored 3.4. On average, PES assess their capac- ity as \u2018medium\u2019 in all four main areas of the survey with the highest average score in the area of services for employers. In addition to the report presented in the box above, in 2014 the network also contributed to the development of the Catalogue of Measures for implementation of the Youth Guarantee and report on the role of PES within the delivery of the Youth Guarantee. Furthermore, around EUR 1.7 million in the area of employment were committed to establish a Euro- pean employment policy observatory (EEPO) and to fund its activities in 2014. This observatory aims to improve European and national policy-making by providing information, analysis and insights on the design, implementation, monitoring and eval- uation of policies in the field of employment. The main purpose of EEPO is to produce high-quality research papers on the labour market and employ- ment, which can be accessed through EEPO\u2019s library. In developing its research, EEPO brings together a network of experts from across the EU. They spe- cialise in a range of topics relating to the labour market and employment, such as unemployment, work-life balance, education systems, skills supply, and wages. 24 EASI PERFORMANCE MONITORING REPORT 2014 ",
        "Efforts to bridge the \u2018communication gap\u2019 between the EU and its citizens and to increase awareness of the wider public and stakeholders about EU policies and legislation in the area of youth employment have been made through the EaSI-supported communication campaign \u2018Youth on the Move\u2019 (over EUR 840 000 were committed to this activity), which in 2014 included two events (one in Greece and another \u2018Euroskills 2014\u2019 event in France), electronic publications, production of audio-visual material, websites and other mechanisms. The main goal of the \u2018Youth on the Move\u2019 (YoM) information campaign is to engage young people in open dialogue on mobility experiences with their peers, stakeholders and mobility prescribers. It sup- ports a comprehensive package of policy initiatives on education and employment for young people in Europe adopted in 2010 as part of the Europe 2020 strategy for smart, sustainable and inclusive growth. YoM campaign was implemented through large-scale events in European capitals and other cities. The events are created as 2 or 3-day festivals that gather together associations and organisa- tions active in mobility. Performance artists, debate leaders and other main actors involved in mobility issues at European and national levels are often among the participants. In addition to the activities described above, EaSI is providing continuous support to the organisation of peer reviews and other mutual learning events in the area of employment (Mutual Learning Programme). In 2014, the Mutual Learning Programme (MLP) in the area of employment included a range of activities: thematic events (seminars) on a specific policy theme, peer reviews for government representatives sup- ported by independent academic expertise, learning exchanges for a small group of national representa- tives, the annual dissemination seminar and a data- base of labour market practices. These activities aim to support, coordinate and encourage mutual learn- ing between EU Member States in order to assist progress towards achieving the goals of the Europe 2020 strategy, encourage mutual learning opportuni- ties resulting in policy influence at the EU and national levels, and disseminate the results of the MLP and their contribution to implementing policy objectives to wider audiences. EaSI-funded Learning Exchange on Cooperation at Local Level in the Fight against Youth Unem- ployment was organised on 28 October 2014 in Dordrecht (Netherlands). The aim of this Learning Exchange was to explore how to build the capacity of municipalities to deliver services for young peo- ple. It offered the opportunity to explore examples of strong local partnerships in the Netherlands and coordination where local actors are given responsi- bility for the design and delivery of youth policies. In the Netherlands, the local level is regarded as best placed to understand the immediate labour market situation, identify young people who need support and to develop individualised reintegration plans. In 2014, EaSI funded eight mutual learning events on employment policy issues, including one thematic event, four peer reviews two learning exchanges, as well as an annual dissemination seminar.

        "Of the Member States, 22 plus Montenegro and Nor- way participated in at least one event (see Table 6). Main issues covered by the mutual learning programme in 2014 included fighting youth unemployment, flexi- curity issues, job creation incentives, minimum wages, and tackling labour market segmentation.

The overall purpose of this call is to encourage new forms of collab- oration between public and private actors on the labour market (such as social partners, training and education providers, labour mar- ket intelligence entities, companies including SME\u2019s, chambers of commerce, public and pri- vate employment services) to address persistent skills shortages and mismatches and thus help fill the gap between labour supply and demand in the EU. Planned commitments for this call are EUR 600 000. However, no actual commitments were made in 2014. Activities supported under the call should aim to achieve the following technical objectives: 1. provide more and better sectoral skills intelli- gence, based on the synthesis and compilation of existing national sources on employment trends and skills demand and supply in the sector; 2. contribute to the development of skills gov- ernance at sectoral level and of national skills policies by facilitating capacity build- ing and peer learning amongst national skill observatories or equivalent organisations and by creating a European platform of exchange and development of joint sectoral skills projects. Social protection and social inclusion In 2014, the largest amount of funding (around EUR 2.2 million) in the area of social protection and social inclusion was committed to the establishment and activities of the European Social Policy Network (ESPN). The network was established in 2014 to pro- vide the Commission with independent information, analysis and expertise on social policies. In particular, ESPN supports the Commission in monitoring progress towards the EU social protection and social inclusion objectives set out in the Europe 2020 strategy, includ- ing lifting at least 20 million people out of poverty and social exclusion, and in the European Semester. ESPN provides the Commission with: (1) a comprehen- sive overview of policies addressing key challenges in the areas of social protection (such as pensions, health care and long-term care) and social inclusion in the countries covered, including their strengths and weaknesses; (2) assessments on whether the policies reflect the social investment approach. The ESPN brings together into a single network the work previously carried out by the European Network of Independent Experts on Social Inclusion and the net- work responsible for the Analytical Support on the Socio-Economic Impact of Social Protection Reforms (ASISP). It also acts as the secretariat to MISSOC. A large amount of funding in the area of social protection and social inclusion was also committed to the organisation of the Convention of the Euro- pean Platform against Poverty and Social Exclusion ( around EUR 670 000) and the related seminars (over EUR 220 000). 26 EASI PERFORMANCE MONITORING REPORT 2014 ",
        "Fourth Annual Convention of the European Platform against Poverty and Social Exclusion took place in Brussels on 20-21 November 2014. The Convention focused on social innovation and how new creative ideas can contribute to addressing social needs and to improving people\u2019s lives as well as on the results of the recent public consultation on the 2020 strategy, including the poverty reduction target and the flagship initiative. Special emphasis was put on implementation of the reforms needed to modernise the social protection systems. It looked at different aspects of poverty and prior- ity areas for action, such as homelessness, child poverty and health care, as well as issues of gender, discrimination, energy poverty and financial inclusion. Through presentations, speed dating sessions and workshops, it aimed at stimulating debate, encouraging alliance building between all stakeholders, and enhancing mutual accountability for the implementation of social policy reforms in the context of the European Semester. Furthermore, EaSI provides continuous support to the organisation of peer reviews in social protec- tion and social inclusion. In 2014, EaSI supported seven peer reviews in the area of social protec- tion and social inclusion. Table 7.

        "Peer review \u2018 Harnessing ICT for social action, a digital volunteering programme \u2019 was organised in Santiago de Compostela (Spain) on 25 March 2014. The key points that emerged from the discussions were as follows: \u2022 Digital inclusion policies are strictly con- nected to social inclusion. As such, they are relevant to the targets specified in the Europe 2020 strategy and supported by the social investment package (SIP). \u2022 Inequalities in terms of ICT skills have scarcely narrowed in the last decade. \u2022 Digitally excluded people often cumulate dis- advantages e.g. both low education level and being unemployed. These disadvantages need to be tackled simultaneously. \u2022 A \u2018one size fits all\u2019 approach is not feasi- ble and different solutions are therefore to be encouraged. \u2022 Robust methodologies and adequate data collection would support a more accurate assessment of the social outcomes of digital inclusion programmes. \u2022 The impact of the programme on the desired outcome should always be assessed and valuable lessons, particularly as for proof of failures, must be shared. Working conditions In 2014, in the area of working conditions DG EMPL continued to provide support to various activ- ities of the European Labour Law Network (ELLN). The network consists of a team of non-govern- mental legal experts including all European Mem- ber States and EEA countries, and of a Scientific Committee. The ELLN is entirely independent and has no affiliation with either trade unions, employ- ers\u2019 associations or individual employers. The initial concept for the ELLN was to establish a platform for dialogue between labour law experts from across Europe and to facilitate the comparison of the different existing national labour law systems. The ELLN\u2019s objective is to provide a framework in which future developments in labour law through- out Europe can be debated. Since 2007, ELLN has been working as the European Commission\u2019s official advisory board on issues relating to developments in individual and collective labour law. A significant amount of funds in the area of work- ing conditions was also committed to meetings of various policy related bodies, e.g. group of Directors General for Industrial Relations and expert groups in the field of labour law. In 2014, EaSI also funded the development of non-binding good practice guides, handbooks and other material for information sharing and learning, which provided practical assistance to the Mem- ber States in transposing and applying EU law effectively as well as in better understanding the EU policies. The following guides were produced in the area of working conditions: \u2022 non-binding modular guide to good practice with a view to improving the application of the Community Directives on protecting the health and safety of workers by reducing work related vehicle risk (final report received in December 2014); \u2022 non-binding guide to good practice on the min- imum health and safety requirements regard- ing the exposure of workers to the risks arising from physical agents (electromagnetic fields) (final report received in November 2014). Cross-cutting issues In terms of cross-cutting issues, the largest amount of funding in 2014 (over EUR 1 million) was com- mitted to information and communication activities in order to raise awareness on priority policy issues, e.g. communication activities centred around growth and jobs events and conferences (including those organised by the Presidencies) allowed reinforcing dialogue and mutual learning at regional, national, European and international level and mobilise key policy/decision-makers and stakeholders with a view to creating the necessary support for meeting EU objectives and priorities. Furthermore, over EUR 700 000 were committed to the organisation of policy, bilateral, international and regional conferences. In this regard, high- level conferences on economic shock absorbers for the Eurozone, employment and social devel- opments in Europe, quality apprenticeships, and tackling joblessness among newly arrived migrants were supported. 28 EASI PERFORMANCE MONITORING REPORT 2014 ",

Please note that EURES activities are presented separately in the dedicated chapters. Below the report reviews the contribution of the above-mentioned EaSI outputs to effective and inclusive information sharing, mutual learning and dialogue in terms of the key performance indicators. KPI 4. Declared gain of better understanding of EU policies and legislation This indicator aims to identify the added value of EaSI-funded policy debate (especially, through the organisation of events and other information shar- ing activities) as judged by stakeholders in terms of gains in understanding EU policies and legislation. Evidence coming from the survey of participants in EaSI-funded events shows that stakeholders par- ticipating in events are very positive in this regard. On average, more than 91 % of respondents to the survey agree that they have gained a better understanding of EU policies and objectives by participating in EaSI-funded events. This holds for each different type of stakeholder: decision-makers, stakeholders representing civil society, social part- ners and other stakeholders. It is important to note that assessment of events organised by DG EMPL did not change from the previous period (around 92 % of stakeholders positively assessed events funded by the predecessor PROGRESS programme in 2013). KPI 5. Inclusive policy-making Analysis of respondents to the survey of participants in EaSI-funded events can be used as a proxy indicator to understand the profile of target audiences who partici- pated in these events (in 2014 surveys were carried out only for conferences and other large events). Analysis shows that a majority of participants were officials from national, regional or local government institutions (around a third), whereas other notable target audi- ences included representatives of civil society and social partners (around 20 %), researchers, university teachers and independent experts (around 15 %) and officials of EU institutions (14 %). Proportions of stakeholders from different groups participating in EaSI-funded events remained very similar to those from the previous period. Figure 7 and Figure 8 show the extent to which dif- ferent types of stakeholders acknowledged that the relevant policy/decision-makers as well as other stake- holders were indeed involved in the policy debate on EU employment and social policies and legislation. All types of stakeholders were more positive about the involvement of relevant policy-makers than involve- ment of other stakeholders. The data also shows that policy/decision-makers are often most positive about the involvement of all relevant parties, while stakehold- ers representing civil society (including social partners) are most sceptical about this issue. 29 EASI PERFORMANCE MONITORING REPORT 2014 ",

        "Figure 9 demonstrates that participants in EaSI- funded events are more positive regarding the involvement of both policy-makers and other stake- holders, when asked about a specific event that they participated in. Of those who attended EaSI events 91 % of respondents of the survey were of this opin- ion. While almost all participants of EaSI-funded events also stated that issues discussed were clear, they were mostly concerned with the dissemina- tion of results achieved during an event; 79 % of stakeholders agreed that dissemination of results was adequate. Stakeholders also saw this feature of events as most problematic during implementation of the predecessor programme PROGRESS. Figure 9.

KPI 6. Use of acquired knowledge A large majority (around 89 %) of stakeholders who participated in EaSI-funded events say that they have already used (32 %) or intend to use informa- tion acquired during the events for policy-making or advocacy purposes. This is very similar to (and even larger than) the share of respondents stating this in 2013, which is used as a baseline value (86 %). The following are examples indicated by partici- pants themselves of the actual use of informa- tion acquired during events for policy-making and advocacy: \u2022 A participant in the Workshop on delivering longer working lives and higher retirement ages (12-13 November 2014, Brussels) reported the results of the event to the Min- ister of Labour. To the best of his knowledge, the information will be taken into account dur- ing the preparation of the new pension reform. \u2022 Several participants in the Conference Moving beyond GDP in European economic governance (10 October 2014, Brussels) claimed that they have promoted the use of non-GDP-based indicators among the relevant national actors. \u2022 A participant in the Conference on Social Policy Innovation (19-20 May 2014, Brussels) indi- cated that she has advocated for creating a playground for children with disabilities who also cannot afford to pay for any other simi- lar activities. \u2022 A participant from Slovenia used ideas from the Expert conference: Employment and Social Developments in Europe Review 2013 (18 Feb- ruary 2014, Brussels) to write a national report on the social situation in Slovenia. \u2022 A number of participants in the Presidency con- ference Occupational safety and health (OSH) \u2013 OSH policy in the future (16-17 June 2014, 31 EASI PERFORMANCE MONITORING REPORT 2014 ",
        "Athens) claimed that the event was very use- ful for their day-to-day work. For example, a participant from France said that the German example of their national OSH strategy was very useful in order to inform the develop- ment of a similar strategy in his country. He also claimed that the following information was useful: information on positions of vari- ous stakeholders on questions such as REFIT, new European OSH strategic framework used in order to adapt national positions. He also noticed that the Belgian example of new psy- chosocial risk legislation has triggered further exchange with Belgian officials on the topic. \u2022 Many participants in the Conference on Social Policy Innovation claimed to have used the information received during an event to either design operations to be co-funded by ESF or to prepare the application for the EaSI social policy experimentation project. Some of the respondents claimed that they have already submitted applications for projects to be co- funded by EaSI. Furthermore, there are many instances in which EaSI-funded events have contributed to the devel- opment and implementation of policy initiatives in the areas covered by DG EMPL. For more detailed information please refer to the second part of Annex 2 listing EaSI outputs that contributed to policy and legislative initiatives during the year. For example, in the area of employment , EaSI- funded events were instrumental in preparing coun- try-specific recommendations (CSRs) 2014/2015 in the framework of the European Semester, and contributing to the implementation of the Youth Employment Package and the Youth Guarantee. The conference Labour economics after the crisis: what theoretical lessons to draw from policy expe- rience? was instrumental in the framework of the European Semester. One of the key questions dis- cussed during the conference was how academic experts and advisers can continue to help the EU in designing and implementing the right policies in the area of employment. Several events focused on discussing ways to best implement the Youth Guarantee. For example, the conference Youth Guarantee: Making It Happen, attended by over 370 key practitioners, experts and political figures involved in the implementa- tion of the Council Recommendation on estab- lishing a Youth Guarantee, supported the view that concerted effort is necessary in Europe to implement the Youth Guarantee in order to ensure that quality employment for young people is part of this economic recovery. In the area of social protection and social inclusion , EaSI-funded events were mostly instrumental in supporting the implementation of the Social Investment Package as well as to prepare CSRs 2014/2015 in the framework of the European Semester. Peer reviews in social protection and social inclu- sion were especially helpful in the framework of both the European Semester and the Social Investment Package. Their specific content is reviewed above). In this regard, EaSI funding was also instrumental in supporting regular meetings of the Expert Group on Social Investment for Growth and Cohesion as well as meetings of the Social Protection Committee, its sub-groups and ad-hoc working groups. Implementation of the Social Investment Package also benefited from such large-scale events as the conference on Social Policy Innovation (19- 20 May 2014) and the Fourth Annual Convention of the EU Platform against Poverty and Social Exclusion (20-21 November 2014). This year\u2019s Convention also focused on social innovation and how new creative ideas can contribute to address- ing social needs and to improving people\u2019s lives. In the area of working conditions , EaSI-funded events contributed to policy and legislation devel- opments in the area of health and safety at work and labour law. Support for various meetings of policy-related bodies were instrumental in this regard. For example, the 66 th and 67 th meetings of Senior Labour Inspectors Committee (SLIC) were organised during the Greek and Italian Presidencies to support the policy-making process in the area of health and safety at work, while two meetings of Directors General for Industrial Relations were instrumental in the area of work- ing conditions. 32 EASI PERFORMANCE MONITORING REPORT 2014 ",
        "The High-level Conference on Working Conditions (28 April 2014) was one of the key events sup- ported by EaSI in the area of working conditions in 2014. The conference had two main objectives. First, to disseminate and obtain feedback from key stakeholders about forthcoming initiatives and/ or recent policy evaluations by the Commission. Second, to engage stakeholders in an open public debate about future priorities of the Commission in the field of working conditions. In the area of cross-cutting issues (i.e. issues important across the policy areas covered by EaSI), programme-funded events contributed to the implementation of the Communication on Strengthening the social dimension of Economic and Monetary Union, ensuring proper reflection of employment and social challenges in the European Semester and other policy initiatives in the areas of youth employment, sustainable recovery and international labour standards. The conference Economic shock absorbers for the Eurozone. Deepening the debate on automatic stabilisers and the expert conference on employ- ment and social developments in Europe were instrumental in implementing the Communication on strengthening the social dimension of EMU. For example, the former conference focused on the dif- ferent forms of fiscal capacity for the EMU, which are conceivable, and what are the necessary condi- tions for them to be more or less feasible. KPI 7. Accessibility of EaSI-funded knowledge and information Figure 10 indicates data sources that are con- sulted most often to learn about the informa- tion and knowledge produced by EaSI. Referrals from colleagues and partners (more than 60 % of respondents rely on this data source very often or often) as well as the European Commission web- site (around 56 %) are among the most consulted sources. The Performance Monitoring Report of the predecessor PROGRESS programme, although used less than other relevant sources, was also a rela- tively common data source among the stakeholders (around 75 % of stakeholders claimed to use it at least sometimes) to learn about EaSI-funded out- puts. This can serve as a baseline value to judge the usability of this EaSI Performance Monitoring Report in the future. Figure 10.

Better conditions for social policy innovation The EaSI programme provides financial support to test social and labour market policy innovations, and, where necessary, contributes to building up the main actors\u2019 capacity to design and implement social policy experimentation, and to make the rel- evant knowledge and expertise available. While a social policy innovation can be described as a change in a social policy that \u2018simultane- ously meets social needs and creates new social relationships or collaborations, thereby benefiting society and boosting its capacity to act (14) , social policy experimentation is a method to test social policy interventions on a small scale, which allows determining the impact of changes in the social policy. This allows policy-makers and other rel- evant actors to gather robust evidence on the effects of a given policy or programme, and to determine what does and does not work. Produc- ing objective empirical evidence on the impact/ outcomes of a policy or programme is important in view of taking decisions on whether or not to pursue or scale up these policies. Therefore social policy experimentation is a means to develop social policy innovations. (14) For full definition please see: Regulation, 243. 34 EASI PERFORMANCE MONITORING REPORT 2014 ",
        "EaSI is expected to contribute to enabling conditions for social policy experimentation to the extent that: \u2022 social and labour market policy innova- tions are increasingly tested via social pol- icy experimentations; \u2022 necessary know-how and expertise on social policy experimentations is available and eas- ily accessible, and is being up-scaled through funding from ESF or other national measures as well as used in other ways. EaSI funds two major types of outputs in order to satisfy the expectations listed above. First, the programme supports the preparation and imple- mentation of social policy experimentation as a method for testing and evaluating innovative solu- tions with a view to up-scaling them. This is being done through provision of funding for projects via action grants. Second, EaSI also provides funding for building up the main actors\u2019 capacity to design and implement social policy experimentation. In 2014, EUR 508 710 or 1 % of the overall bud- get under the Progress axis were committed to the implementation of activities under this specific objective, making it the smallest funding item under the axis. As previously mentioned above, only 4 % of planned funding for 2014 was actually committed. The largest share of this funding was committed for the provision of support services for social policy experimentation in the EU (to train the relevant offi- cials; around EUR 450 000) and creating methodol- ogy for financial and societal return on investment on social investment policies (around EUR 60 000). Under EaSI, special attention will be paid to ensure the link between the newly tested measures and their transferability and mainstreaming via other EU instruments (such as the ESF) and national/regional policies. A large share of financial support allo- cated to support social policy experimentation will be disbursed via action grant agreements, but also via funding the production of evidence, information sharing events, and capacity building activities such as training and seminars. The first call for proposals for social policy inno- vations was published in April 2014 (reference number VP/2014/008; total amount EUR 11 mil- lion). The call has two objectives: 1. using social policy innovations for under- taking structural reforms in the context of the Europe 2020 Strategy, in particular the Country Specific Recommendations received by the Member States as part of the Euro- pean Semester; 2. strengthening partnerships between public, private and civil society sectors to involve them in awareness-raising activities about the use and benefits of social policy innovation. This call was open to consortiums of stakeholders active in the field of social services planning and/or delivery. The focus was on reforms in social services, including \u2018 one- stop shop\u2019 approaches, personal- ised approaches to social services and innovative strengthened partnerships between public, private and civil society sectors. The evaluation process is ongoing and the selected projects will be awarded in the first semester of 2015. As very few activities were actually implemented under this immediate outcome in 2014, it is not yet possible to assess their contribution to creating adequate conditions for social policy innovations and social policy experimentation (KPI 8 foreseen in the Annex 1) in this report. This indicator will be estimated in the future reports after more activities have started under this outcome. KPI 9. Awareness of social policy innovation In 2014, the EaSI Stakeholder Survey asked whether stakeholders in the policy areas covered by EaSI are aware of social policy innovations funded by the programme. It must be noted that EaSI-funded social policy experimentation projects will only start in 2015; therefore, responses to this question are more related to awareness of social policy inno- vations produced by the predecessor programme PROGRESS. As is demonstrated by Figure 11, stake- holders in the policy area of social protection and social inclusion are quite familiar with social policy innovations supported by DG EMPL (68 % of respon- dents are familiar). 35 EASI PERFORMANCE MONITORING REPORT 2014 ",

Greater capacity of national and EU organisations EaSI provides EU and national organisations with financial support to increase their capacity to develop, promote and support the implementa- tion of EU instruments and policies in the area of employment, social protection and social inclusion and working conditions and relevant EU law. Actions funded in order to achieve this objective will enable key EU-level NGO networks and other EU as well as national organisations (including national administrations) to participate in and influence pol- icy-making and implementation at EU and national level in support of EU objectives and priorities by strategically investing in their capacity building. In 2014, EUR 12 562 354 or 35 % of overall budget under the Progress axis was committed to improv- ing the capacity of EU and national organisations. EaSI is expected to contribute to improving the capacities of national and EU organisations to the extent that: \u2022 supported organisations (private and public bodies) increase their capacity to develop, promote and support the implementa- tion of EU employment and social policy and legislation; \u2022 supported key EU-level NGO networks develop, and are acknowledged as a source of, useful information/knowledge to the policy decision- makers as well as other stakeholders at EU and MS level; \u2022 there is a growing collaboration among institu- tions and other relevant organisations (including civil society organisations, social partners, micro- credit providers and organisations representing interests of final beneficiaries) at EU and MS level in the field of employment and social policy. In order to satisfy the above-mentioned expecta- tions, the EaSI programme notably finances the operational costs of the key EU-level NGO networks (over EUR 10.3 million were committed to funding this output). Key EU-level NGO networks The EaSI programme has a crucial role to play in promoting the involvement of civil society, in partic- ular through financial support for the key EU-level NGO networks. The programme supports these net- works with the aim of boosting their capacity to par- ticipate in and influence decision-making and policy implementation at both EU and national levels. Fur- thermore, such involvement fosters accountability and transparency and increases the relevance of policy responses. 36 EASI PERFORMANCE MONITORING REPORT 2014 ",
        "To these ends, in 2014 EaSI supported a number of activities of key EU-level NGO networks in the fields of social protection and social inclusion and microfinance and social entrepreneurship. Table 11 presents all key EU-level NGO networks supported in 2014 together with more detail on the specific policy areas in which they are working. The table lists the networks in the order reflecting the extent to which EaSI stakeholders are aware of their work (according to the EaSI Stakeholder Survey 2014). It is important to note that awareness raising is one of the key activities in order to carry out effective advocacy work, therefore, familiarity of stakeholders with activities of these networks is of key importance.

        "On 9-10 October 2014, the European Association of Service Providers for Persons with Disabili- ties (EASPD) with partners organised an international conference A Home for All on the development of homes and housing services for persons with disabilities, persons with mental health problems, homeless people and people in need of housing support. The conference took stock of good practice models and experiences, and discussed future challenges and strategies to promote full participation and inclusion of persons with disabilities in municipalities and local communities in Europe. Special attention was given to cross-sectoral cooperation between housing and support service providers for people with support needs. Overall, EaSI-supported key EU-level NGO networks produced 273 reports aimed at providing policy advice, research and analysis, 230 reports aimed at identifying good practices and 237 reports aimed at monitoring/assessment. They also organised 257 trainings, peer reviews and other mutual learning events, as well as 136 informa- tion and communication events, with a total of 12 062 participants, of whom 55 % were women (see Table 12).

The policy brief provided a number of examples \u2013 from Belgium, Germany, Italy, Spain, and Sweden \u2013 where local and regional authorities have used their capacities as policy-makers or service providers, often in cooperation with civil society organisations, to increase the level of services provided to undocumented migrants in their localities, and tackle practical barriers to improve access. In the policy brief PICUM suggests recommendations for policy improvements at local, national and European levels. 38 EASI PERFORMANCE MONITORING REPORT 2014 ",
        "In addition to these key EU-level NGO networks described above, EaSI also funds the following activities in order to improve the capacity of EU and national organisations: \u2022 Capacity building of national administrations and specialist services responsible for pro- moting geographical mobility designated by the Member States and microcredit providers. This activity is discussed in more detail in the chapters on EURES and the Microfinance and Social Entrepreneurship axes. In 2014, EaSI supported the development of Elec- tronic Exchange of Social Security Informa- tion (EESSI) , an IT system that will help social security bodies across the EU exchange informa- tion more rapidly and securely \u2013 as required by EU regulations on social security coordination. At the moment there is no EU-wide system and most exchanges are still paper-based. All com- munication between national bodies on cross- border social security files will take place using structured electronic documents. These docu- ments will be routed through the EESSI (hosted centrally by the European Commission) to the correct destination in another EU country. Staff in social security bodies will be able to find the correct destination in another EU country using a directory of national bodies. \u2022 Organisation of working groups of national officials to monitor the implementation of EU law. \u2022 Exchange of personnel between national administrations. Furthermore, three calls for proposals were issued in 2014 with the objective to improve the capacity of national and EU organisations. First, a call for proposals to support social protec- tion reforms was issued with a planned funding of EUR 2.5 million (reference number VP/2014/006). However, no funding was actually committed under this call in 2014. Projects funded under the call are expected to generate knowledge and evidence that would help steer national reforms, either by facilitating access to expertise from other Mem- ber States and/or international organisations, or by obtaining the empirical evidence needed for inter- national comparisons and mutual learning. There will be particular focus on major challenges that have been, or might become, the subject of coun- try-specific recommendations, as well as reforms that could strengthen the social investment dimen- sion of social protection schemes. Second, a call for a proposal entitled \u2018Posting of workers: enhancing administrative cooperation and access to information\u2019 was issued with a planned funding of EUR 2.7 million (reference number VP/2014/007). The general aim of this call is to fund initiatives in order to enhance the implemen- tation, application and enforcement of Directive 96/71/EC2 concerning the posting of workers in the framework of the provision of services in practice. Projects funded under this call aim to: \u2022 Promote transnational cooperation among stakeholders and dissemination of best prac- tices, including the promotion of the use of the Internal Market Information System (IMI) and sharing experiences and best practices in this respect. \u2022 Increase the accessibility and transparency of information concerning the terms and condi- tions of employment to be respected, including the use of websites, bodies and authorities to which posted workers and undertakings can turn to for information as well as the use of relevant initiatives by competent authorities and/or social partners aimed at improving the provision of the relevant information. \u2022 Increase the knowledge about, and the trans- parency of the existing practices in the Mem- ber States, to monitor and enforce the terms and conditions of employment to be respected, such as the use of appropriate measures taken to ensure compliance with these terms and conditions in subcontracting chains. \u2022 Promote exchange and training of relevant officials and social partners. \u2022 Promote exchange of information and best practices, such as developing or updating websites containing general or sector-specific information concerning terms and conditions 39 EASI PERFORMANCE MONITORING REPORT 2014 ",
        "of employment to be respected, including the development of a single official national web- site as envisaged in the enforcement directive, among the stakeholders. A project entitled \u2018ENACTING \u2013 Enable coopera- tion and mutual learning for a fair posting of workers\u2019 is coordinated by Fondazione Istituto Guglielmo Tagliacarne from Italy together with partners from Belgium, Germany, and Romania. Its overall aim is to strengthen practical coop- eration and mutual learning among control authorities and social partners engaged in the enforcement of Directive 96/71/EC and in the new challenges settled by Directive 2014/67/EU and related transposition by Member States into national laws. To pursue this strategic aim, the action will be carried out by a multi-stakeholder and multidisciplinary partnership promoting a tripartite transnational cooperation among Con- trol Authorities, Trade Unions and Employers\u2019 Organisations from the above-mentioned Mem- ber States. The actual activities under the project will include mutual learning events, exchanges between responsible authorities and social part- ners, administrative cooperation, a transnational workshop and a final conference in Brussels. Third, a call for proposals to promote the contri- bution of private savings to pension adequacy (reference number VP/2014/014) was issued with a planned funding of EUR 1 million. No actual com- mitments were made under this call in 2014. The overall purpose of this call is to support cross-bor- der cooperation of pension and financial service providers as well as relevant stakeholders with a view to raising the quality of supplementary pension schemes and their contribution to secure incomes in retirement. Two strands of work will be supported under this call. First, it will support one project aimed at developing a voluntary quality label for occupa- tional pension schemes. The voluntary quality label should be developed and managed by stakeholder organisations or their associations. Aiming to con- tribute to adequate retirement incomes through promoting quality supplementary pension provision. It could address, among other aspects of pension schemes, such issues as coverage of employees, cost effectiveness, mitigation and sharing of risk, portability of pension products and shock-absorp- tion. Second, the call will support one or two trans- national pilot projects on the conversion of pension schemes and other (notably housing) assets into secure retirement income flows. The project(s) may focus either on asset conversion products, such as equity release, or the design of pensions scheme- based retirement income flows. Below the report reviews the contribution of the above-mentioned EaSI outputs to improve the capacity of national and EU organisations to develop, promote and support the implementa- tion of EU instruments and policies in the area of employment and social affairs and relevant EU law in terms of the key performance indicators. KPI 10. Capacity of the key EU-level NGO networks to further develop, promote and support the implementation of EU employment and social policy and legislation As could be expected, Figure 12 shows that stake- holders representing civil society are the first to acknowledge key EU-level NGO networks as a source of useful information on EU employment and social policy (76 % of them agree with this statement). A majority of decision-makers (66,7 %) and other stake- holders (62,5 %) also see the networks as useful. It is relevant to note that the appreciation of networks is lower than that reported by the Annual Stakeholder Survey of the predecessor programme PROGRESS in 2013 (84 %). However, this is mostly due to the case that PROGRESS also funded networks in the areas of non-discrimination and gender equality, which were greatly appreciated by their stakeholders. 40 EASI PERFORMANCE MONITORING REPORT 2014 ",

Below the report provides a few examples on the actual contribution of the key EU-level NGO networks to EU policy deliberations and policy-making in 2014: \u2022 Caritas Europa published a Crisis Monitoring Report 2015 (delivered in 2014) called Pov- erty and Inequalities on the Rise. The report presents evidence suggesting that six years after the crisis began in 2008 the economic crisis is still leaving its marks on residents and EU economies. In addition to enormous debt levels with very little economic growth, there are huge numbers of unemployed people and millions of people living in poverty or at risk of poverty. The report provides concrete examples and testimonies of Caritas member organisa- tions in Cyprus, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Portugal, Romania and Spain on the lasting impact of the crisis on individuals in these countries. \u2022 Eurocities established a Task Force on the Social Investment Package (SIP) to work spe- cifically on the implementation of SIP priorities at the local level. \u2022 ERGO has published a study which formulated recommendations for LEADER and Housing interventions for 2014\u20132020 based on the case studies of 5 EU Member States with focus on Roma inclusion at rural level. \u2022 Eurodiaconia has published a policy brief outlining the main challenges for ensuring that older people have access to quality in the long term as well as recommendations for national and EU authorities regarding how to meet those challenges. \u2022 European Venture Philanthropy Association (EVPA) launched EU Webinar Series , dedicated to addressing European topics of interest to the venture philanthropy/social investment commu- nity. These EU webinars offer learning and sharing opportunities and foster a community of practi- tioners interested or active in EU-related policies. KPI 11. Declared effectiveness of capacity building According to evidence provided by the survey of participants in EaSI-funded events, on average 88 % of participants declare a change in the capacity of their organisations to further develop, promote and support the implementation of EU employment and social policy and legislation as a result of EaSI-funded activity. The share of persons declaring the change in capacity does not vary significantly among different stakeholder groups. Around the same per cent of stakeholders agreed with this statement in the framework of the predecessor PROGRESS programme in 2013. 41 EASI PERFORMANCE MONITORING REPORT 2014 ",
        "KPI 12. Active collaboration and partnership between government institutions of the EU and Member States as well as relevant EU and national organisations Active collaboration between various organisations formulating, promoting and implementing EU policy and legislation is of key importance in reaching Europe 2020 policy objectives. Figure 13 provides information on the share of stakeholders from various institutions who agree that there is a sense of collaboration between their organisation and the EU institutions. The figure shows that 86 % of officials from national, regional or local government institutions who responded to the EaSI Stakeholder Survey agree that they collaborate with the EU insti- tutions. This number has decreased slightly since 2013 (it was at 91 %). Employees/representatives from national NGOs are least positive in this regard (58 % of them say that they feel a sense of collab- oration with the EU institutions). Figure 13.

EURES AXIS The EURES axis of the programme supports actions in the following thematic sections : \u2022 transparency of job vacancies, applications and any related information for applicants and employers; \u2022 development of services for the recruitment and placing of workers in employment through the clearance of job vacancies and applica- tions at Union level, in particular targeted mobility schemes; \u2022 cross-border partnerships (15) . (15) Any remainder shall be allocated to one or more of the thematic sections referred to above or to a combination of them (cross-cutting issues). 2.1. Financial implementation Table 13 provides a review of planned and actual commitments under the EURES axis per thematic section and specific objective (immediate outcome). As previously mentioned, when interpreting these data the reader must have in mind that 2014 was the first year of EaSI implementation and not all the planned activities have yet been implemented (many of them were postponed to the upcoming years). Overall, EUR 15.9 million were actually committed in 2014, which constituted 74 % of the planned commitments for this axis. The 74 % represents actual contracts and agreements entered into by the Commission in 2014. In addition to these individual commitments made in 2014, implementation of global commitments worth EUR 5 560 000 (26 % of the overall budget in 2014) has been postponed to upcoming years under the EURES axis. This means 42 EASI PERFORMANCE MONITORING REPORT 2014 ",
        "that 100 % of the expenditure planned in 2014 will be actually committed in the coming year. As can be seen from the table, in 2014 the actual commit- ments under the EURES axis made up a larger share of the overall EaSI budget than initially foreseen in the EaSI Regulation (30 % instead of 18 %). Regarding thematic sections, the commitments planned for development of EURES services took up a larger share than initially foreseen in the EaSI Regulation (42 % instead of 30 %). In terms of the actual commitments, development of EURES ser- vices was the largest funding item (55 % of overall actual commitments under the EURES axis), while 43 % of actual commitments contributed towards the transparency of job vacancies. The actual com- mitments in these areas corresponded to the plans rather well. Of the planned expenditure 97 % was actually committed for developing EURES services, whereas 90 % of the planned expenditure was actually committed towards making job vacancies transparent. No actual commitments were made for establishing cross-border partnerships in 2014. When it comes to specific objectives (immediate outcomes), two thirds of the actual commitments went to effective provision of services for recruit- ment and placing of workers, while the rest (around one third) contributed to making labour market information more transparent .

        "2.2. Achievement of the first outputs and key performance indicators Below the report reviews the performance of the programme under the EURES axis in terms of the short-term outcomes that it is expected to achieve. 2.2.1. Transparent labour market information EaSI aims to ensure that job vacancies and appli- cations and corresponding information and advice, as well as any related information such as that concerning living and working conditions, are made transparent for the potential applicants and the employers. Actions funded in order to achieve this will contribute to promoting voluntary geographical mobility and, subsequently, to boosting employment opportunities throughout Europe. Transparency of labour market information is being achieved through exchange and dissemination of available vacancies and applications at transna- tional, interregional and cross-border level, through the use of standard interoperability forms for job vacancies and applications and through other suita- ble means, such as individual counselling and men- toring, especially for the low skilled. An important instrument to achieve this goal is the maintenance, hosting, translation and help desk of the EURES Job Mobility Portal for the clearance of job vacancies and applications. Also, trainings on EURES services to be offered to both jobseekers and employers are being organised for EURES advisers. It should be noted that the degree to which labour market information is made available will also be dependent on the outcome of the negotiations on the proposal for a Regulation on a European network of Employment Services, workers\u2019 access to mobility services and the further integration of labour markets (COM(2014) 6 final). The Regulation will set the framework for EURES and define the activities to be carried out by the Member States: the information to be collected and shared with other Member States through the Job Mobility Por- tal, the services to be provided to employers and jobseekers, and the data to be collected for the purpose of common indicators. The Commission proposal for a Regulation builds on existing data collection mechanisms and arrangements, but the decision will be with the Union legislator, i.e. the Council and the European Parliament. At the time of finalising this report, the negotiations, which started in the first quarter of 2014, were still ongoing. The outcome of the negotiations may therefore impact on the means (the data) and scope of the indicators to be collected for EURES in the future. EaSI is expected to contribute to making labour market information more transparent across the EU to the extent that: \u2022 EURES Job Mobility Portal is an increasingly relevant instrument not only for ensuring transparency of information, but also for recruitment and placement; \u2022 EaSI-funded mutual learning events, training activities and policy evidence are improving the understanding of key actors and other stakeholders of EU policies, objectives and legislation related to geographical mobil- ity as well as awareness about successful new practices. In order to fulfil these expectations, the following actions were funded by the Programme in 2014: \u2022 development of the multilingual digital EURES Job Mobility Platform for the clearance of job vacancies and applications; \u2022 information and communication activities to raise awareness of the benefits of geographi- cal and occupational mobility in general and of the activities and services provided by EURES; \u2022 mutual learning among EURES actors and training of EURES advisors, including EURES cross-border partnerships advisors. In 2014, EUR 5 233 023 or 33 % of the over- all budget under the EURES axis was committed to improving the transparency of labour mar- ket information. Below the report assesses the extent to which the above-mentioned outputs have contributed to making labour market information more trans- parent at the EU level in terms of the key perfor- mance indicators. 44 EASI PERFORMANCE MONITORING REPORT 2014 ",

The overall conclusion from these tables is that while the situation in terms of each category pre- sented above has not changed significantly since 2013, the EURES Job Mobility Portal has clearly expanded several times as a tool for matching job- seekers and employers. KPI 15. Customer satisfaction with EURES Job Mobility Portal The EURES Job Mobility Portal database provides information on the satisfaction of users with the portal (per each page). The following are pages of the EURES Job Mobility Portal with which the users are most satisfied: Table 22.

        "The data shows that users tend to be more satis- fied with pages providing general information, for example, on the EURES Network, tips on search- ing for a job, whereas pages on job opportuni- ties in specific countries are assessed by users as less valuable. KPI 16. Inflow of vacancies The EURES Job Vacancy Index is a measure used to assess the inflow of vacancies to the EURES Job Mobility Portal. This index is calculated as a percentage of the inflow of job posts in January 2013 (this date is used as a reference point). This allows to compare the current situation against a reference point (end of the technical enhancement of the EURES Portal). In January 2014, the value of this index was 108 %. More recent data is not yet available. Figure 14 shows how the value of the EURES Job Vacancy index has changed since January 2013. It should be noted that the evolution of this indicator in particular will also depend on the outcome of the negotiations on the above-men- tioned proposal for a EURES Regulation as it pro- vides for a definition of the scope and nature of the job vacancies to be shared on the Job Mobility Por- tal. The definition in the proposal aims to increase the vacancy pool. Figure 14.

Effectiveness of learning The total number of participants attending EURES trainings in 2014 was 897 . Three main types of training activities were organised for EURES advis- ers in 2014: \u2022 Initial training , which provided partici- pants with the knowledge and skills needed for acting within the EURES network and to increase and promote the service within their own country, developing useful and perma- nent interactions with employers, institutions, other EURES advisers in European countries and social and economic partners in Europe. This type of training aimed at building up competences using learning methodologies and tools which foster a positive interaction between formal training sessions, work experi- ences and a stimulating organisational context such as that provided by the EURES network at the European level. In 2014, 125 EURES advisers attended initial training. \u2022 Advanced training is specific training addressed to experienced EURES advisers who have been working in the EURES network for at least 2 years. This type of training is very spe- cialised, focused on technical issues related to EURES activities and is structured in short units aimed at transferring and developing significant skills and knowledge as well as facilitating the 49 EASI PERFORMANCE MONITORING REPORT 2014 ",
        "use of new tools and instruments. In 2014, 13 sessions of advanced training involv- ing 325 advisers were planned. In the end, 298 advisers participated in these sessions. Issues covered by the training included services to employers, multicultural issues, social secu- rity schemes and taxation, key skills for dealing with EURES stakeholders, geographical and job mobility in Europe, EU resources for job mobility, communication tools, tools and strategies for matching and placement. \u2022 Virtual training is strictly connected with the Advanced Training and allows EURES advis- ers to keep on the right training path even when they cannot follow Advanced Training sessions during a certain period of their career. Six virtual training editions were planned in 2014 involving 360 EURES advisers. Finally, 318 persons attended these training sessions. Topics of the virtual training included services to employers, strategies and tools for match- ing skills, practical tools for EURES actors, EU resources for job mobility, EURES communica- tion tools and multicultural issues. In addition to these three main types, trainings on ad hoc issues were provided to 156 EURES advisers. 2.2.2. Effective provision of services for recruitment and placing of workers The EaSI programme supports the provision of EURES services for recruitment and placing of workers in quality and sustainable employment through the clearance of job vacancies and applications. Sup- port for EURES services extends to various phases of placement, ranging from pre-recruitment prepa- ration to post-placement assistance with a view to the applicant\u2019s successful integration into the labour market. Such support services may include targeted mobility schemes to fill job vacancies in a certain sector, occupation, country or a group of countries or for particular groups of workers, such as young people, with a propensity to be mobile, where a clear economic need has been identified. In 2014, EUR 10 624 988 or 67 % of the overall budget under the EURES axis was committed to the effective provision of services for recruitment and placing of workers. A targeted mobility scheme was initiated in 2014 by a consortium of 11 organisa- tions (Italian Ministry for Employment \u2013 IT, International Placement Services \u2013 DE, P\u00f4le emploi \u2013 FR, Instituto do Emprego e Forma\u00e7\u00e3o Profissional, I.P. \u2013 PT, Department of Social Protection \u2013 IE, Department of Labour \u2013 CY, Czech Public Employment Service \u2013 CZ, SEPE (Spanish Public Employment Service) \u2013 ES, Croatian Employment Service (CES) - HR) and 18 associated partners (representing public and private organisations). The overall goal of the scheme is to assist youth in making suc- cessful transitions into the EU labour market, thereby resulting in increased employment, filled bottleneck vacancies and in sustained freedom of movement for workers. The scheme is testing a new way of providing EU- wide, result-oriented customised job mobil- ity services to young people and employers focused on recruitment, matching and place- ment (experimentation and innovation). The project builds upon the experiences gathered with the three previous calls launched at EU level in the framework of the preparatory action \u2018Your first EURES job\u2019. Ensuring effective provision of services for recruit- ment and placing of workers is of key importance in order to develop high quality and inclusive EU labour markets via supporting voluntary geographi- cal mobility. Subsequently, this will contribute to improving the employment situation across Europe and to achieving other relevant objectives of Europe 2020 (especially in contributing to \u2018Youth on the Move\u2019 and \u2018Agenda for New Skills and Jobs Flag- ship\u2019 initiatives). EaSI aims to contribute to effective provision of services for recruitment and placing of workers in quality and sustainable employment to the extent that: \u2022 EURES as an overall instrument (incl. its infor- mation and counselling services) is helpful in facilitating transnational placements; \u2022 EURES services are accessible to every person in need. As part of the Youth on the Move package and the Youth Opportunities Initiative, Your first Eures job 50 EASI PERFORMANCE MONITORING REPORT 2014 ",
        "(YfEj) scheme was started in 2012. It is a mobility scheme to help young Europeans find jobs, train- eeships or apprenticeships in other EU countries. It supports EU nationals between 18 and 30 years of age and living in any EU country as well as all legally established employers in EU countries offering contracts of at least 6 months\u2019 duration to employees. To date, 15 projects were financed through 3 calls for proposals and 8 of the projects have been con- cluded under the predecessor EURES programme until 2014. The 8 finalised projects resulted in 2 892 placements, i.e. around 90 % of their com- bined target (3 200). During the course of the initiative, the aim is to facilitate 5 000 job place- ments and 64 % of this goal has been achieved. The top 3 countries in terms of mobility flows in the third quarter were the UK, Germany and Spain (inflow) and Germany, Italy and Spain (out- flow). For the first time since the YfEj scheme was launched, DE and UK had a significant number of outgoing job finders although their actual nation- ality cannot be identified from the data available. Also, UK remains the main country of destination for jobseekers. Below the report assesses the extent to which the above-mentioned outputs have contributed to making provision of services for recruitment and placing of workers more effective in terms of the key performance indicators. KPI 18. Number of individual personal contacts of EURES advisers with jobseekers and employers According to EURES Advisers\u2019 Monthly Reports, in 2014 EURES advisors across Europe had 947 489 personal contacts, 852 842 (90 %) of which were with workers/jobseekers, whereas 94 647 (10 %) of them were with employers. Most of these consultations were on transnational issues (88 %), while in 12 % of cases cross-border issues were discussed. The following topics were mostly discussed during these consultations: job search (38 % of cases), general information on EURES (22 %), recruitment (12 %), living and working con- ditions (9 %), social security (8 %), education and training (5 %). KPI 19. Inclusiveness of EURES services Among the persons targeted by Your First EURES Job initiative, the share of male and female job-finders was equal in the third quarter of 2014. Amongst these young job-finders, 77 % were over 23 years of age. More specifically, 50 % were between 23 and 26 years and 27 % between 27 and 30 years. The majority of job-finders had finished at least sec- ondary education or higher education (with at least ISCED level 3) which corresponds to the data from the previous years. As in previous quarters, service workers and shop and market sales workers (ISCO 1D-08) was the most popular occupational group. In addition, manual and lower skilled occupations remain at a significant share of all vacancies filled. Infor- mation and Communication, Administrative and Support Service Activities and Human Health and Social Work Activities are the top 3 sectors (NACE) attracting most of the placements. KPI 20. Effectiveness of targeted mobility schemes Among the most recurrent and useful support measures that facilitated success of YfEj and were applied under the targeted mobility schemes were the following: \u2022 stability and solidity of partnerships; \u2022 active cooperation with other labour mar- ket stakeholders; \u2022 public awareness raising activities. The reported hindering factors were: \u2022 the short duration of projects; \u2022 the failure of some project partnerships; \u2022 the inadequacy between the offer and the demand sides of the labour market. The average cost per placement in quarter 3 of 2014 was around EUR 1 650 which is slightly lower than the average cost (EUR 1 660) in quarter 3 in 51 EASI PERFORMANCE MONITORING REPORT 2014 ",
        "2013. The average cost of placement from the start of the programme until 2013 Q3 was EUR 1 350 due to significantly lower expenditures on jobseeker training and SME training within the second call projects. In the box below an example of a targeted mobility scheme funded in 2014 is presented. A targeted mobility scheme is being imple- mented by 7 EURES organisations from Sweden, Finland, Ireland, Portugal, Romania and Slove- nia and the PES organisation of the Azores as well as PES of Madeira as an affiliated entity. The priority of the scheme is placed on hard to fill vacancies for SMEs and graduates/persons with academic background. The action first and foremost is a tool to match young jobseekers to sustainable work in other EU28 and EFTA/ EEA-countries and to provide SMEs with a com- petent young workforce and so help SMEs to maintain their rates of production and operation within Europe. This is being done with online tools and meetings, through social media and through campaigns. 3. MICROFINANCE AND SOCIAL ENTREPRENEURSHIP AXIS In addition to supporting the policy formulation and implementation process in the area of employ- ment and social affairs (Progress axis) and labour mobility (EURES axis), the EaSI Programme also aims to \u2018promote employment and social inclusion by increasing the availability and accessibility of microfinance for vulnerable people who wish to start up a micro-enterprise as well as for exist- ing micro-enterprises, and by increasing access to finance for social enterprises (17) . Building on this provision of the EaSI Regulation, Microfinance and (17) General objective e) from the EaSI Regulation. Social Entrepreneurship Axis (MF/SE) of the EaSI Programme aims to improve access to finance for vulnerable groups of people, micro-enterprises and social enterprises. Activities under the MF/SE axis did not start in 2014. However, a predecessor pro- gramme European Progress Microfinance Facility (Progress Microfinance) is still ongoing and will con- tinue its activities until 2016. One of the aims of this report is to describe the performance of the predecessor programme Progress Microfi- nance in 2014 . Such information will be useful in order to set the expectations for the microfinance part of the EaSI Programme, which will use a similar scheme to the one used by Progress Microfinance. Second, it presents up-to-date information regard- ing the development of new funding instruments to be implemented under EaSI in the areas of micro- finance and social entrepreneurship. 3.1. Financial implementation Table 23 provides a review of planned and actual commitments under the Microfinance and Social Entrepreneurship axis per thematic section. As previously mentioned, when interpreting these data the reader must have in mind that 2014 was the first year of EaSI implementation and only a small number of budget activities were actually implemented in 2014 under this axis. However, in 2014 the Commission put a lot of effort into negotiating the design of the new funding instru- ments with the European Investment Fund. In addi- tion to the individual commitments made in 2014, implementation of global commitments worth EUR 28 400 200 was postponed to the upcom- ing years under the MF/SE axis. This means that 108 % of the expenditure planned in 2014 will be actually committed in the coming year (i.e. more than initially planned). 52 EASI PERFORMANCE MONITORING REPORT 2014 ",

Better access to, and the availability of, microfinance Actions funded by the programme under the Microfi- nance branch of MF/SE axis will contribute to increasing overall availability and access to finance for vulnerable people who wish to start up a micro-enterprise and who do not have access to a conventional credit mar- ket as well as to micro-enterprises who employ such vulnerable persons. The overall aim of such actions is to improve the employment situation of socially disad- vantaged people and to promote their social inclusion. The EaSI programme is expected to contribute to this goal to the extent that: \u2022 Funding from EaSI creates a leverage effect. Such effect is created by co-investment either at the level of the Commission (e.g. by the EIB) or at the level of financial intermediaries. \u2022 Vulnerable persons, who have lost or are at risk of losing their job, or have difficulty in entering or re-entering the labour market, or are at risk of social exclusion, or are socially excluded, and are in a disadvantaged position with regard to access to the conventional credit market and who wish to start up or develop their own micro-enterprises, as well as micro-enterprises in both start-up and development phase, especially micro-enterprises (18) Table 23 reflects the situation as initially planned. For Microfinance (Access to Microfinance) another EUR 2 million were added from an EPPA to a global commitment. In addition contributions from non-EU Member States were taken into account. Microfinance now amounts to EUR 14 087917. A Global Commitment of EUR 28 400 200 was created for Microfinance and Social Entrepreneurship axis on 11/12/2014. Individual commitments are expected in 2015. which employ persons as referred to above, have an increasingly equal access to finance. This will be achieved (as it is currently being done under the European Progress Microfinance Facility) by providing funding to microcredit providers through financial instruments. These may include: \u2022 Guarantees . Negotiations between the Com- mission and the European Investment Fund (EIF) are currently ongoing regarding the guarantees scheme (that will enable funding for both micro- and social enterprises); \u2022 Funded instruments (debt instruments, equity investments or funded risk-sharing instruments), may include: \u2022 senior loans; \u2022 junior loans; \u2022 equity or quasi-equity participations. While financial instruments under EaSI will be mod- elled upon the previous experience with Progress Microfinance, they will also differ from it. The follow- ing main elements have been changed: \u2022 Funding for capacity building will be provided. \u2022 Microfinance intermediaries will need to comply with the European Code of Good Conduct for Microcredit Provision. \u2022 Reporting requirements were updated. \u2022 Terms for guarantees were modified. Under Progress Microfinance, guarantees have been subject to a guarantee rate which cannot exceed 53 EASI PERFORMANCE MONITORING REPORT 2014 ",
        "75 % and a cap of 20 %. Under EaSI, this will become 80 % and 30 %, giving intermediaries a greater flexibility and ability to reach out to more vulnerable groups. \u2022 Intermediaries shall provide or sub-contract mentoring and training programmes to the final recipients. Intermediaries shall ensure a sufficient follow-up of recipients both before and after the creation of the micro-enterprise. 3.2.1. European Progress Microfinance Facility Activities under the MF/SE axis of EaSI have not started in 2014; below the report reviews the contribution of the European Progress Microfinance Facility to improving access to, and the availability of, microfinance in 2014 in terms of the pre-defined key performance indi- cators. The tables below provide information on the microcredit intermediaries supported through the Progress Microfinance Facility in 2010-2014. Table 24 indicates intermediaries that benefited from the guarantees scheme, including infor- mation on the size and rate of the guarantee provided. Table 25 lists intermediaries that ben- efited from the funded instruments scheme as well as the amount of funding that they received. While, as in the past, formal rejections did not take place in 2014, some transactions have been abandoned throughout the year. Table 24.

Availability and size of microloans provided By September 2014, microfinance intermedi- aries have provided the final beneficiaries with 31 895 microloans. Overall, EUR 280,78 million were disbursed. Over the course of the programme, 16 922 micro credit agreements were signed by the intermedi- aries under the funded instruments portfolio. The total commitments under the funded instruments portfolio amounted to EUR 133,667 million. The total number of microcredits included in the guar- antee portfolio was 14 973 and amounted to EUR 147,11 million. Microloans provided tend to be for smaller amounts. The most popular microloans were for less than EUR 5 000 (30 % under the guarantee portfolio and 51 % under the funded instruments portfolio), fol- lowed by up to EUR 10 000 (40 % under guarantees and 70 % under funded instruments). In compari- son, in 2014 the smallest loan (EUR 5 000 or less) attracted 22 % of beneficiaries under the guarantee portfolio and 61 % under the funded instruments portfolio. A total of 44 % of beneficiaries received more than EUR 10 000 under guarantees and 17 % under funded instruments. KPI 22. Availability of mentoring and training services In order to ensure the highest effectiveness of the microloans, microfinance intermediaries are regu- larly providing mentoring and training services to the final beneficiaries. Financial intermediaries are contractually bound to cooperate with organisations providing training and 55 EASI PERFORMANCE MONITORING REPORT 2014 ",
        "mentoring. Annual monitoring reports of Progress Microfinance have regularly observed that there is still room for improvement when it comes to the mentoring and training currently offered in combi- nation with support under Progress Microfinance. This requirement will be strengthened under EaSI. As this represents a top priority for the Commis- sion, the European Investment Fund (EIF) will aim to improve the way all the supported providers imple- ment this requirement under EaSI. In particular, the EIF is expected to have a closer look at the num- ber and quality of contracts between providers and organisations providing training and mentoring and enforce better cooperation, especially with schemes supported by the European Social Fund (ESF). All microcredit providers are required to work with entities providing training and mentoring services, particularly those supported by the ESF. According to the most recent data on the implementation of Progress Microfinance in 2014, 39 % of microcredit intermediaries are deemed to provide full mento- ring services, 41 % of intermediaries are deemed to provide basic mentoring services, while 20 % of intermediaries do not provide any form of mento- ring service. KPI 23. Types of supported micro-enterprises Over the course of the predecessor Progress Microfinance programme, the predominant sec- tors receiving loans were agriculture, hunting and related service activities; wholesale and retail trade; repair of motor vehicles, motorcycles and personal and household goods; storage and communication. In terms of regional distribution, the largest number of final beneficiaries was from France (6 256 or 32.1 %) and Romania (4 626 or 28.9 %) under the funded instruments portfolio; and France (3 741 or 25.9 %), the Netherlands (3 085 or 21.4 %) and Poland (2 107 or 14.6 %) under the guaran- tee portfolio. 3.3. Better access to finance for social enterprises Under the Social Entrepreneurship branch of the MF/ SE axis EaSI will fund actions aimed at increasing the overall availability and access to finance for social enterprises and thus support the develop- ment of the European social investment market. Subsequently this will contribute to achieving the ultimate outcome of EaSI by improving the employment situation and including vulnerable people in society. The latter aim will be achieved not only through potential employment of vulner- able persons, but also via pursuit of other measur- able positive social impacts, which according to the Regulation must be the primary objective of a social enterprise. EaSI is expected to contribute to improving access to finance for social enterprises to the extent that: \u2022 funding from EaSI enables increasing financial support (in terms of number and volume of financial support) to social enterprises; \u2022 supported social enterprises pursue an increasing variety of social goals (there is a widening coverage of needs that the social investment market aims to satisfy). This will be achieved by providing financial support to investors in social enterprises through various financial instruments, which may include guaran- tees; debt instruments; equity; quasi-equity. 3.4. Stronger institutional capacity of microcredit providers In order to support microfinance in Europe, EaSI will aim to build up the institutional capacity of microcredit providers. Experience with the Pro- gress Microfinance Facility and JASMINE so far showed that in order to provide quality services to final beneficiaries, microcredit providers need to improve their institutional capacities. This in turn contributes to increasing access to finance for vulnerable people and micro-enterprises through, for instance, better-qualified staff (loan officers), ability to hire new people, and modernised internal working procedures (e.g. new IT system). Actions funded to achieve this objective will not concen- trate on mutual learning, training and similar activities (as was the case under JASMINE), but on support for improvement of the microcredit provid- ers\u2019 infrastructure. Technical assistance activities will however be offered to microcredit providers under the first axis of EaSI. 56 EASI PERFORMANCE MONITORING REPORT 2014 ",
        "EaSI is expected to contribute to stronger insti- tutional capacity of microcredit providers to the extent that: \u2022 the institutional capacity of microcredit provid- ers in terms of funding (which can be received from EaSI financial instruments), human resources, operational management as well as systems and infrastructure is adequate; \u2022 microcredit providers comply with the Euro- pean-level standards in terms of their insti- tutional capacity (specifically, to the European Code of Good Conduct for Microcredit Provision). These activities were not yet funded in 2014. They are expected to begin in 2015. Therefore no infor- mation on such activities can be presented in this report. Below we review the key performance indi- cators to be estimated in the next performance monitoring report. KPI 28. Change in institutional capacity of microcredit providers This indicator aims to assess the level of institu- tional capacity of microcredit providers in terms of funding, human resources, operational manage- ment as well as systems and infrastructure and its change over time. At the moment it is difficult to set a clear baseline value, as this will be a new activ- ity under EaSI. However, from the previous annual implementation reports it can be concluded that the institutional capacity of microcredit providers is seen as insufficient. The annual reports of the predecessor programme Progress Microfinance noted that the issue of providers\u2019 institutional capacity was acknowledged to be a bottleneck that slows down the disbursement of loans (19) . KPI 29. Compliance to EU-level code of good conduct This indicator concerns the estimated level of compliance of participating microcredit providers\u2019 governance, management and customer protec- tion procedures with the European Code of Good Conduct for Microcredit Provision (especially in terms of preventing over-indebtedness). Annual implementation reports of the Progress Microfi- nance noted that this Code has not been a pre- condition for funding from Progress Microfinance, however, under the new EaSI programme financial intermediaries will need to sign-up and comply or endorse the Code in order to become eligible for funding. Table 26 provides a list of financial intermediaries who have signed up to or endorsed the Code in 2014.

        "III. Contribution to Programme\u2019s long-term objectives This section of the report reviews the extent to which EaSI has contributed to the achievement of its long-term objectives (intermediate outcomes): 1. stronger ownership of EU objectives; 2. facilitation of policy reforms, convergence and capacities for social innovation and mutual learning; 3. modernisation and effective application of EU law; 4. high quality and inclusive EU labour markets that are open and accessible to all; 5. increased access to finance for vulnerable per- sons, micro- and social enterprises. Each chapter starts with a short presentation of the rationale for each of the intermediate outcomes and reviewing their links to EaSI-funded activities and outputs, which were discussed in the previous section. Also, this section provides some real-life examples of EaSI contribution to specific EU policy initiatives in 2014. 1. STRONGER OWNERSHIP OF EU OBJECTIVES In order to produce concrete, coordinated and innovative actions and to sustain their implemen- tation, policy-makers at all levels should agree on the common EU objectives in the social and employment policy fields and be willing to take action to implement them. Thus ownership of objectives implies not only a good understanding of those objectives (which is also shared with other stakeholders in the field), but also readi- ness to act in order to achieve them. Improved shared understanding and stronger ownership requires timely collection and analysis of relevant and accurate evidence and policy advice capa- ble of withstanding detailed scrutiny and rally- ing EU-wide support as well as organisation of peer reviews, mutual learning activities and other types of events, which respond to the needs, con- cerns and expectations of EU and national policy- makers and other stakeholders. It is also very important that the process in which EU objectives are defined is inclusive, i.e. social partners, civil society organisations and all other relevant pub- lic and private bodies must be involved. Such organisations must also possess a capacity to transmit the views of the societal groups that they represent. EaSI is expected to contribute to strengthening ownership of EU objectives among policy-makers at all levels to the extent that: \u2022 Member States\u2019 policy choices and priori- ties as defined in the national strategic and other official documents (especially as part of the European Semester) duly take into account EU objectives; \u2022 stakeholders are aware of the EU priorities in the field of employment, social affairs and inclusion and relevance of the EU actions in addressing the socioeconomic challenges/ advancing selected policy areas; \u2022 horizontal issues, such as gender equal- ity, non-discrimination and inclusion of vulnerable groups, are regularly taken into account when designing policies in the field of employment and social affairs both at EU and Member States levels. Making sure that policy-makers at all levels feel stronger ownership of EU objectives therefore chiefly depends on the availability of compara- ble policy evidence, effective information shar- ing, mutual learning and dialogue as well as on the capacities of national and EU organisations to advocate for common actions and to support policy implementation, i.e. outputs supported by the EaSI programme. Below the report assesses the contribution of EaSI to creating stronger ownership of EU objec- tives in terms of the key performance indicators. KPI 31. Stakeholder awareness of major issues and objectives Table 27 indicates issues which EaSI stakeholders are most and least familiar with in the policy areas of employment, social protection, social inclusion and working conditions. This data is based on the 59 EASI PERFORMANCE MONITORING REPORT 2014 ",
        "EaSI Stakeholder Survey. In the area of employ- ment, stakeholders feel most familiar with rather general issues, such as key challenges and prob- lems for the EU labour market and the governance process related to policy-making in this field. Least familiar issues in this area include tackling unde- clared work, using financial instruments to fund employment policies and harnessing the potential of job-rich sectors. In the area of social protection, social inclusion, stakeholders claimed to be most aware of the issues related to fighting poverty and promoting social inclusion, whereas pensions, Social OMC and tackling homelessness issues are rather poorly understood. In the area of working conditions, a large major- ity of stakeholders are familiar with working time issues, the EU Occupational Safety and Health Strategic Framework for 2014-2020 and equal treatment of women and men at work. As in pre- vious years, stakeholders would like to get more information on reacting to restructuring processes, modernisation of work organisation and data pro- tection at work. Table 27.

KPIs 32-34. Extent to which EaSI outputs take into account horizontal issues In pursuing all the objectives, the EaSI programme also aims to account of the horizontal issues indicated in the Article 4(2) of the EaSI Regulation 1296/2013: \u2022 pay particular attention to vulnerable groups, such as young people; \u2022 promote equality between women and men; \u2022 combat discrimination based on sex, racial or ethnic origin, religion or belief, disability or sexual orientation; \u2022 promote a high level of quality and sustain- able employment, guarantee adequate and decent social protection, combat long-term unemployment and fight against poverty and social exclusion. The two figures presented below aim to assess the extent to which horizontal issues were integrated into the overall policy debate and taken into account in EaSI-funded events. Such data is provided by the EaSI Stakeholder Survey as well as the survey of participants in EaSI-funded events. Figure 15 shows that, according to stakeholders, some issues are clearly better integrated into the overall 60 EASI PERFORMANCE MONITORING REPORT 2014 ",
        "policy debate than others. First, this can be concluded about issues that were supported by the predecessor programme PROGRESS as well as often included as the most important in an overall EU policy discourse, i.e. promoting equality between women and men and combating discrimination. In addition, paying particular attention to vulnerable groups (such as young people) was mentioned by the stakeholders as one of the issues that was taken into account in the majority of policy fields. This might be related to the recent key EU policy objective to fight the unemployment of young people and to mitigate its consequences. Horizontal issues that should be given more attention include taking into account disability and accessibility mat- ters as well as combating long-term unemployment. The figure also shows that the extent to which spe- cific horizontal issues were integrated into the policy debate varies across policy fields. Figure 15.

        "Figure 16 shows that participants in EaSI-funded events have a very similar opinion to that held by EaSI stakeholders as a whole, however, with a few notable differences. Paying particular atten- tion to vulnerable groups is mentioned among horizontal issues that were most often taken into account during events, whereas disability and accessibility matters received the least amount of attention. It should be noted that gender equality and non-discrimination issues were less notable during events than in the overall policy debate. Figure 16.

FACILITATION OF POLICY REFORMS, CONVERGENCE AND CAPACITIES FOR SOCIAL INNOVATION AND MUTUAL LEARNING Innovative actions are needed in order to provide solutions for challenges that the EU is currently fac- ing. High unemployment rates (especially, for youth), increasingly fragmented labour markets, shrinking workforce and increasing pressure on social protec- tion systems as well as the increase in the number of people living in poverty and social exclusion are problems specific to the current situation in the EU (and especially the Eurozone), which need new and tailor-made policy answers. Improved capacities of the Member States for social policy innovations would contribute to developing adequate, accessible and efficient social protection systems and labour markets and facilitate policy reforms. Social policy innovations are described in the EaSI Regulation as \u2018innovations that are social both as to their ends and their means and in particular those which relate to the development and implementation of new ideas (concerning products, services and models), that simultaneously meet social needs and create new social relationships or collaborations, thereby ben- efiting society and boosting its capacity to act\u2019 (20) . Focusing on social policy innovation is not just doing things in new ways, but essentially means applying the range of lessons learnt on how to introduce these ways most effectively. It is about a perspective that connects social innovation to recent strategic policy packages and mainstreams social innovation in the implementation of Mem- ber States\u2019 reforms. EaSI is facilitating policy reform and improving capacities for social policy innovation and mutual learning to the extent that: \u2022 learning among the EU Member States is enhanced; (20) EaSI Regulation, 243. 62 EASI PERFORMANCE MONITORING REPORT 2014 ",
        "\u2022 EaSI-funded policy innovations contribute to facilitation of policy reforms. To this end, EaSI supports activities that test social and employment policy innovations on the ground before the possible dissemination and/or scaling-up of the most successful, including via the ESF (21) . Therefore, creating better conditions for social policy innovations will be of key importance in order to test and implement innovative policy solutions, which will in turn lead to policy reforms, in particular as concerns innovations at the sys- temic level relevant for strategic welfare reforms. Moreover, it is very important that the relevant knowledge and expertise gained through social policy experimentation activities are available and easily accessible, so that the Member States can apply the new policy interventions, which prove to be the most effective, as widely as possible. This is mainly being achieved through information shar- ing and mutual learning, but also via dissemina- tion of the relevant policy evidence supported by EaSI. Achievement of this goal also depends on the capacities of the main actors to carry out social policy experimentations in order to develop social policy innovations. As previously mentioned in the report, EaSI-funded social policy experimentation projects will start in 2015. However, EaSI made a contribution to disseminating social policy innova- tions through mutual learning and other events as well as analytical outputs. (21) Notably, such action was supported by the public consultation with the stakeholders before the launch of the Programme: see Impact Assessment of the ESF and related instruments, SEC(2011) 1130 final, Brussels, 6 October 2011, 7. KPI 35. Declared use of social and labour market policy innovation in the implementation of social CSRs and the results of social policy experimentation for policy-making Figure 17 shows the share of respondents to the EaSI Stakeholder Survey (per policy area) who said that they are likely to use social policy innovations developed at the EU level (espe- cially by EaSI and the predecessor PROGRESS programme) or have already used them. This figure concerns only stakeholders who said that they are familiar with such social policy innova- tions and chose to provide their answer to this question (i.e. 232 persons, or around 21 % of sur- vey respondents under the Progress axis). While stakeholders in the area of social protection and social inclusion are better aware of social policy innovations than stakeholders in other areas (as demonstrated by Figure 11 earlier in the report), they are slightly less likely to use them (around 59 % of the respondents claimed that they are likely to do this). In the areas of employment and working conditions, around 64 % of stakeholders claimed that they have used or are likely to use EU-supported social policy innovations. Overall, around 62 % of those familiar with EU-funded social policy innovations from all policy areas have already used them or are likely to do so in the future. 63 EASI PERFORMANCE MONITORING REPORT 2014 ",

KPI 36. Scale-up, transferability and/or dissemination of policy innovations (actual and expected) EaSI Stakeholder Survey respondents provided some evidence about the actual use of EU-sup- ported social policy innovations (under the prede- cessor PROGRESS programme, since EaSI-funded projects will start in 2015): \u2022 Many respondents mentioned that they are try- ing to apply the Housing First approach, which was supported by the predecessor programme PROGRESS through funding provided to a pro- ject related to this approach. The project has tested and evaluated Housing First projects in five European cities, leading to greater clarity on the potential and the limits of the approach, as well as the essential elements of Housing First projects. It also facilitated mutual learn- ing with additional partners in five \u2018peer sites\u2019 cities where further Housing First projects are planned or are being implemented and with a steering group including FEANTSA and HAB- ITACT as European stakeholders, experienced researchers, and representatives of national homelessness programmes. \u2022 By building on the experience tested by one of the social policy experimentation projects, a respondent from Cyprus claimed that he is advocating for integrated support functions to be set up, by volunteers, for young people with multiple problems. \u2022 Some of the respondents claimed to have designed networks in their countries for managing a process of social policy inno- vation in the field of social inclusion and social protection. 3. MODERNISATION AND EFFECTIVE APPLICATION OF EU LAW In order to create a level playing field and guarantee a common level of EU legal protection to all peo- ple and organisations, effective application of EU law throughout the EU must be ensured. Through funding various activities EaSI supports monitor- ing, effective application and enforcement of EU legislation developed in the fields of employment, social protection and social inclusion and, especially, working conditions (in the areas of labour law and health and safety at work). 64 EASI PERFORMANCE MONITORING REPORT 2014 ",
        "The effectiveness of EU law is largely determined by its implementation at national, regional and local levels. A substantial number of infringement cases and complaints of non-compliance with EU law illustrates that problems with the application and enforcement of EU law persist. The need for better implementation of EU law has therefore been repeatedly recognised as a key priority. Also, many respondents of the public online consultation organised before the launch of EaSI (in particular, public authorities) emphasised the importance of monitoring the application of EU legislation in the Member States and underlined that this objective should be a key priority for EaSI (22) . While the primary aim of EaSI in this area is to ensure that the EU law is effectively applied, actions funded by the programme also seek to improve its quality. Better law making and the need to ensure implementation, application and enforcement are closely linked: a good law (23) is an enforceable and enforced law. Previous experience shows that only a limited number of Member States experience delays in the timely transposition of directives, while appli- cation problems for the Member States are more common and arise primarily as a result of the politi- cal will of national administrations to invest them- selves in the EU\u2019s decisions (24) . This implies that improvements are necessary in specific areas, such as guaranteeing administrative capacity, screen- ing domestic rules and procedures, a systematic discussion between relevant authorities across the EU, ex-post evaluations and accountability of national administrations towards their counter- part authorities in other Member States, involve- ment of sub-national authorities with autonomous legislative powers, supporting networks of public authorities and NGOs, systematic assessment of their performance and the identification and spread of best practices, as well as extension of training programmes for judges and public administrations. To address these challenges, a \u2018cultural\u2019 change is also required, which includes a shift from increasing new EU law to an emphasis on effective application.

EaSI aims to contribute to the modernisation and effective application of EU law to the extent that: \u2022 legal proposals and the new legislation are of high quality, i.e. implementation and interpre- tation of rules are clear for public authorities, citizens and businesses, legislation responds to, inter alia , the emergence of new risks for human health and safety in the workplace, and unnecessary administrative burden is reduced; \u2022 EU law in the areas of a) labour law and b) health and safety at work is correctly trans- posed into national law and effectively applied by the Member States; \u2022 the European Commission acts as an effective and efficient guardian of the EU law, effec- tively monitoring its transposition and imple- mentation in all Member States. KPI 37. Programme\u2019s contribution to improvement of the EU legislative acquis In 2014, EaSI-supported outputs were instru- mental in contributing to improvement and better application of EU law in the area of work- ing conditions. Various studies and data-gathering exercises were funded by the programme in the area of health and safety at work. For example, a Non- binding guide to good practice on the minimum health and safety requirements regarding the exposure of workers to the risks arising from physical agents (electromagnetic fields) was fin- ished in November 2014. It will help the relevant national actors to practically implement the pro- visions of Directive 2013/35/EU on the minimum health and safety requirements regarding the exposure of workers to the risks arising from physical agents (electromagnetic fields) (20 th individual Directive within the meaning of Arti- cle 16(1) of Directive 89/391/EEC) and repealing Directive 2004/40/EC. An EaSI-supported ad-hoc module of the Labour Force Survey on accidents at work and work-related health problems was also instrumental in this regard. 65 EASI PERFORMANCE MONITORING REPORT 2014 ",
        "Furthermore, EaSI-supported networking activi- ties helped the relevant stakeholders to exchange views ad discuss relevant issues in the area of health and safety at work as well as more gen- eral issues in the area of working conditions. As examples, the 66 th and 67 th meetings of the Senior Labour Inspectors Committee (SLIC) and Thematic days could be mentioned. They were organised as Council Presidency activities. The first event focused on workers\u2019 involvement in the management of Occupational Safety and Health (OHS) in small enterprises (SEs) by highlighting what works and its implications for the strategies and practices of labour inspection. The second meeting discussed non-standard work and its effect on occupational safety and health. EaSI-supported activities were also instrumental in contributing to the improvement and application of EU labour law. First and foremost, the contribution of the European Labour Law Network (ELLN) was very important in this regard. Its 7 th Annual Legal Seminar discussed new forms of employment and their impact on the EU labour law. The discus- sions focused on the need and feasibility of leg- islating on new forms of employment at EU level. While some participants warned against lumping together all new forms of employment, others offered the view that a higher degree of regula- tion may only lead to more advanced attempts of evasion. Some participants advocated undertak- ing further empirical as well as legal studies in order to develop a clearer picture of new forms of employment and their pervasiveness in the Member States. Legal uncertainties with regard to identifying an employment relationship were men- tioned as constituting a major problem in many national systems. In 2014, ELLN also developed quarterly and ad-hoc flash reports on labour law in the Member States. In addition to ELLN activities, EaSI also provided financial support to the organisation of meet- ings of working groups and experts groups in the field of labour law. Furthermore, a Social Europe Guide on labour law and working conditions was issued in February 2014. The key objective of the guide was to provide an exhaustive overview of EU labour law and initiatives taken in the area of working. It also explained the rationale for EU involvement in this area. 4. HIGH QUALITY AND INCLUSIVE EU LABOUR MARKETS THAT ARE OPEN AND ACCESSIBLE TO ALL Free movement of workers is one of the four free- doms established in the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). One of the ideas behind Articles 45 and 46 of TFEU is to enable workers from Member States with a high level of unemployment to move to other states where there is a demand for jobs, i.e. geographical labour mobil- ity should contribute to promoting a high level of quality and sustainable employment throughout Europe. However, geographical mobility in Europe is limited due to a number of obstacles. Aside from uncertainty over the advantages of being mobile, individuals face a number of other hurdles to free movement. These can range from legal and admin- istrative obstacles, housing costs and availability, employment of spouses and partners, and portabil- ity of pensions to linguistic barriers and issues on transparency of job vacancies, and missing support from the employment services for matching CVs with job offers (25) . Through its various activities under the PROGRES and EURES axes described earlier in this report, EaSI aimed to contribute to the development of high quality and inclusive EU labour markets to the extent that: \u2022 adequate information, advice and services are available for workers and employers wishing to benefit from the principle of the free move- ment of workers; \u2022 EU citizens are aware of their rights (such as how they can benefit from EU social security coordination rules while moving within Europe), which are being defended and promoted. In order to promote voluntary geographical labour mobility, decrease the fragmentation of the EU labour market, lower the unemployment rates and thus to contribute to the implementation of the relevant Europe 2020 policy goals, the EaSI Programme funded various actions described ear- lier that contributed to the development of a high (25) Ex-ante evaluation of the EU Programme for Employment and Social Innovation (EaSI), SEC(2011) 1134 final, Brussels, 6 October 2011, 10. 66 EASI PERFORMANCE MONITORING REPORT 2014 ",
        "quality and inclusive EU labour market. Above all, such actions included: \u2022 Under the EURES axis: ensuring that job vacancies and applications, and correspond- ing information and advice, as well as any related information, such as that concerning living and working conditions, are transparent for the potential applicants and employers. Contribution to this goal was made through exchange and dissemination of information at transnational, interregional and cross-border levels (chiefly through the development of the multilingual digital EURES Portal for clearance of job vacancies and applications, but also via EURES Advisers). \u2022 Supporting the provision of EURES services for the recruitment and placing of workers in quality and sustainable employment through the clearance of job vacancies and applica- tions. Such support services included targeted mobility schemes to fill job vacancies in a certain sector, occupation, country or a group of countries or for particular groups, such as young people; and cross-border partnerships. \u2022 Actions funded under the Progress axis have also contributed to some extent in 2014 to the development of high quality and inclu- sive labour markets by producing relevant evidence and organising information sharing and mutual learning activities (especially those implemented by the European Network of PES). Such activities as cooperation between the heads of public employment services, funding of the European Employment Policy Observatory, ESCO, studies and statistics on matching skills and jobs have also contrib- uted to achieving policy objectives in this area in 2014. KPI 38. Number of placements facilitated In 2014, the EURES axis contributed to the imple- mentation of Articles 45 and 46 of TFEU, i.e. ena- bling workers from Member States with a high level of unemployment to move to other states where there is a demand for jobs. This was done mainly through the work of EURES advisers, but also via targeted mobility schemes. According to the Monthly Reports of EURES advisers, in 2014 there were 31 056 placements resulting from their consultations with jobseekers, includ- ing 22 823 (73 %) for outgoing jobseekers and 8 242 (27 %) for incoming jobseekers. This includes reports from advisors working on both transnational and cross-border issues. This means that around 3 % of personal contacts resulted in actual place- ment in 2014. In addition, the predecessor programme Your First EURES Job initiative (targeted mobility schemes) has supported 3 188 placements of young people by the end of 2014. KPI 39. Effectiveness of learning in the area of labour mobility This year the survey of participants in EaSI-funded events did not target participants in EaSI-funded training and mutual learning activities, since lists of respondents were only collected/provided for con- ferences and other large-scale events. As previously mentioned in the report, EaSI supported three types of training for EURES advisers: initial, advanced and virtual training. For more detail on this please refer to section 2.2.2.1. of this report. KPI 40. Coverage of EURES cross-border partnerships Services provided by the cross-border partner- ships contribute to fair mobility in the cross-border regions, the identification of mobility obstacles and the better functioning of cross-border labour markets, thus contributing to economic growth. They are of key importance in increasing the cover- age of the EU labour market and making it acces- sible to all. In 2014, 17 grants were awarded to establish EURES cross-border partnerships, spread geographically throughout Europe and involv- ing 11 countries (26) . Overall, there are currently 19 operating cross-border partnerships, involving 13 countries (see Figure 18). Aiming to meet the need for information and coordination connected with labour mobility in the border regions, these partnerships bring together public employment and vocational training services, employers and (26) Please note than these grants were awarded under the predecessor EURES programme. No funding for cross- border partnerships has been committed from the EaSI programme yet. 67 EASI PERFORMANCE MONITORING REPORT 2014 ",
        "trade union organisations, local authorities and other institutions dealing with employment and vocational training. In addition, EURES cross-bor- der partnerships serve as valuable contact points among employment administrations, both regional and national, and the social partners. They are also an important means of monitoring these cross- border employment areas, which are a key ele- ment in the development of a genuine European labour market.

        "5. INCREASED ACCESS TO FINANCE FOR VULNERABLE PERSONS, MICRO- AND SOCIAL ENTERPRISES Boosting jobs, growth and investment is one of the main priorities of the new Commission. In line with this goal, entrepreneurship and self-employment can be powerful tools in getting Europe growing again and increasing the number of jobs without creating new debt. A significant share of new jobs in the EU is created by newly established firms and almost 85 % of these jobs are created by micro- enterprises. Access to finance, however, remains one of the most important problems faced by busi- ness starters across Europe, in particular those established by vulnerable groups of people. In order to contribute to these objectives, the EaSI programme aims to increase access to finance for vulnerable persons as well as micro- and social enterprises through provision of support to micro- credit providers and investors in social enterprises in the form of guarantees, funded instruments, equity, quasi-equity as well as support for capacity building of microcredit intermediaries. Achievement of this goal is also supported by activities funded under the Progress axis, namely, policy evidence produced in the areas of microfinance and social entrepreneurship, information sharing and mutual learning activities in the latter thematic areas as well as support for the main actors operating in the field (European Microfinance Network, European Venture Philanthropy Association and the Microfinance Centre) presented in the sections above. EaSI is expected to contribute to the increased access to finance for vulnerable persons, micro- and social enterprises to the extent that: \u2022 beneficiaries who are unemployed or belong to vulnerable groups (as well as micro-enter- prises, which may employ such persons) are being reached by programme-supported fund- ing mechanisms; \u2022 unemployed and otherwise socially and eco- nomically vulnerable persons are able to cre- ate or further develop their businesses as a result of the Programme support; \u2022 impact of the EU microfinance and social entrepreneurship support is sustainable, i.e. the supported enterprises are economically active for an unlimited duration after receiving the EU support; \u2022 access to finance for social enterprises is increasing. 5.1. European Progress Microfinance Facility Following the same approach described earlier in the report, since no activities were funded under the microfinance branch in 2014, below the report reviews the contribution of the predecessor programme European Progress Microfinance Facility (Progress Microfinance) to increased access to finance for vulnerable persons and micro- enterprises in terms of the key performance indi- cators. This exercise will help set expectations for the Microfinance and Social Entrepreneurship axis under the EaSI programme (27) KPI 41. Proportion of beneficiaries that have created or further developed a business with EU microfinance support that are unemployed or belonging to vulnerable groups This indicator aims to assess the extent to which EU microfinance and social entrepreneurship support reaches persons who are in a disadvantaged posi- tion to access the conventional credit market. Such vulnerable persons include women, unemployed, those with no or only primary education, young and older people. Out of 10 013 natural persons benefiting from loans over the whole duration of the Progress Microfinance, 36.5 % were women . Analysis of the annual data shows that the gender pattern remained similar across the years. There were a number of intermediaries which focused on pro- viding loans specifically to female entrepreneurs (i.e. proportion of women beneficiaries was much higher than achieved by other providers) including Credito Agricola (PT) (100 %), Fundacion Pinnae (ES) (27) Data used for this report were provided by the participating microcredit intermediaries to the European Investment Fund (EIF) as part of the social impact reporting exercise at the end of year 2014. 69 EASI PERFORMANCE MONITORING REPORT 2014 ",
        "(75 %), Libra Bank (RO) (60 %) and Siauliu Bankas (LT) (60 %) over the course of the programme. In year 2014 Millenium bcp (PT) and Credito Agricola (PT) had 100 % of female among their beneficiaries, Fundacion Pinnae had 75 % and Credal (BE) had 62 % of female beneficiaries (28) In terms of the employment situation, aggregated data show that almost 58 % of individual micro- borrowers under Progress Microfinance were unemployed . The proportion of unemployed in 2014 was slightly lower, 56 %, and in 2013 it was 64,2 %. Regarding education, the majority of the micro- loan beneficiaries were educated to a sec- ondary level or higher . There were 2,8 % of beneficiaries that had no formal education and almost 16 % had primary education. These two categories comprised 20,8 % of beneficiaries in the year 2014 and 18,2 % in 2013. The intermediaries that provided the high proportions of loans in par- ticular to people with lower education levels were Banca Popolare di Milano (IT) (56,25 %), Colonya Pollen\u00e7a (ES) (55,13 %) and Cajamar (ES) (38,83 %). In 2014 the biggest share of loans to people of lower education levels were provided by Banca Popolare di Milano (IT) (56,3 %), Colonya Pollenca (ES) (55,1 %) and Millenium (PT) (50 %). The majority of persons receiving loans were between 25 and 54 years of age. Overall, 6 % of beneficiaries were under 25 years and 10,3 % were more than 55 years during the course of the programme. The figures for the year 2014 were almost the same as the aggregated data, 6,1 % and 10,7 % respectively. The trend was similar in 2013 as well with 6,1 % of final beneficiaries being under 25 and 9,5 % of beneficiaries being over 55. Finmolise (IT) provided 30,3 % of loans and Erste Bank (AT) 20 % of loans to younger ben- eficiaries. Strong outreach towards beneficiaries above the age of 55 came from Banca Popolare di Milano (IT) (53,3 %), EZBOB (UK) (17,4 %) and Inicijatywa Mikro (PL) (17,1 %). A majority of peo- ple employed at micro-enterprises were between (28) It should be noted that the total number of loans granted by these intermediaries differs greatly. For example, Credito Agricola provided 2 microloans in total whereas Fundacion Pinnae provided 24. 25 and 54 (65,1 %), with a quarter being under 25 and 9 % above 55. A total of 1,6 % of micro-borrowers across Progress Microfinance have reported them- selves as belonging to a minority (147) or disabled (6) during the years of the programme. This indicates a moderate impact at facility level to these groups. At the intermediary level 87,5 % of people receiving a loan from Fundacion Pinnae (ES) and 57,7 % from Almi (SE) self-identified as belonging to a minority group. There were less than 25 % of people self-identifying as belonging to a minority among the beneficiaries in other inter- mediaries. However, to date, 74,4 % of individu- als receiving microloans under the Facility did not provide any indication of minority status or dis- ability. Based on the survey design, it is unclear whether this pattern is because individuals truly do not identify themselves as such or whether certain individuals refrained from providing information altogether. Also, in countries such as France where collecting statistics on minority status is not per- mitted under the national legal framework, no such information is provided. Therefore, actual statistics on outreach to disadvantaged groups could be sig- nificantly different. KPI 42. Number of businesses created or consolidated that have benefited from EU support By 2014, overall 30 473 final beneficiaries had received a microloan and, hence, this could be regarded as a proxy number of businesses that were created or consolidated. KPI 43. Number of jobs created or maintained For 61,2 % of natural persons benefiting from loans under Progress Microfinance to date, a move out of a situation of unemployment or inactivity was facilitated through establishment of a start-up business. In addition, almost 40 % of people who received a microloan were employed, which could mean that the loan has helped them to sustain their businesses or employment. Data provided by microcredit intermediaries also provide information regarding the number of 70 EASI PERFORMANCE MONITORING REPORT 2014 ",
        "start-ups that were supported by Progress Micro- finance. The incidence of microloans under Progress Microfinance granted to existing micro-enterprises established up to one year before the inclusion date of the microloan under Progress Microfinance was 14,2 %. More than 60 % of loans were provided to enterprises established no more than three years earlier. The support provided by Progress Microfinance contributed to overcoming the initial obstacles of funding availability during the start-up phase of a new business. Over the course of the programme, 25 347 per- sons were employed at micro-enterprises under the funded instruments portfolio and 21 939 employees under the guarantees portfolio at the signature date of the microcredit agreement. The number, however, varies greatly across the countries from 18 employ- ees in Denmark to over 8 000 in Romania. KPI 44. Sustainability of the impact of EU support Over the course of the programme, 16 922 micro- credit agreements were signed by intermediaries under the funded instruments portfolio. Of these, 391 have defaulted which accounts for around 2,3 %. This can be considered as a proxy indica- tor for estimating sustainability of the impact of EU support. 71 EASI PERFORMANCE MONITORING REPORT 2014 ",
        "IV. Consolidated information on financial inputs Table 28 presents financial information in respect to performance of the EaSI programme in terms of planned and actual commitments per EaSI axes, thematic sections and immediate outcomes. The planned expenditure indicated in the Annual Work Programme 2014 was EUR 118,10 million. How- ever, after several revisions of the Annual Work Programme (i.e. adding several new activities and cancelling others), the final amount of planned commitments was EUR 119,53 million. The actual commitments in 2014 were around EUR 52 million, which constituted around 44 % of the planned commitments. In addition to the individual com- mitments made in 2014, implementation of global commitments worth EUR 63 042 200 were postponed to the upcoming years under the EaSI programme. This means that 97 % of the expendi- ture planned in 2014 will be actually committed in the coming year. As the 2014 budget was not fully executed, around EUR 4,4 million of the planned commitments will not be used for the EaSI programme. Table 28.

        "Annex 1. Performance Monitoring Framework of the European Union PROGRAMME FOR EMPLOYMENT AND SOCIAL INNOVATION (EaSI) The Performance Monitoring Report of the EU Pro- gramme for Employment and Social Innovation (EaSI) 2014 monitors and reports on immediate and intermediate outcomes achieved and outputs produced by EaSI in 2014 (i.e. from 1 January 2014 until 31 December 2014) as well as financial inputs (planned and actual commitments). The first part of this Annex presents the practical steps taken to collect the monitoring information on inputs, out- puts and outcomes. The second part of the annex reviews outcome, output and input indicators esti- mated in the Performance Monitoring Report 2014. 1. COLLECTING THE MONITORING INFORMATION 1.1. Collecting information on inputs The following steps were taken to collect the moni- toring data on (financial) inputs: 1. Planned commitments : the EaSI programming table (Annual Work Programme) was analysed in order to produce a full list of activities that it is planned to fund (including the EUR amount planned to be committed to each activity); 2. Actual commitments : An updated EaSI pro- gramming table, including additional informa- tion on the actual commitments (in EUR), was analysed after the end of the funding period. 3. A table based on the Annual Work Programme 2014 representing both planned and actual commitments was produced as an Annex to the EaSI Performance Monitoring Report. 1.2. Collecting information on outputs The following steps were taken to collect the moni- toring data on outputs: 1. A number of monitoring data on outputs were collected via the common monitor- ing template (final technical implemen- tation reports) attached to action grant agreements, operating grant agreements and contracts. Since 2014 was the first year of EaSI implementation, only a few final techni- cal implementation reports were available on the implementation of EaSI activities. Some illustrative data was also collected from the final technical implementation reports of the predecessor PROGRESS programme. 2. Beneficiaries of the action grant agree- ments completed the final technical imple- mentation reports (including quantitative monitoring data) online, with data being directly stored in the DEFIS database. Then the aggregate data was extracted from the DEFIS database by the IT unit of DG EMPL and provided to the external contractor (PPMI) in PDF (qualitative information) and Excel (quantitative information) formats. Together with this information, the external contrac- tor also received an updated summary on the beneficiaries of grants awarded under EaSI in 2014 from the DEFIS database, including the list of call owners. 3. The external contractor collected the data on the outputs produced by the beneficiaries of the operating grant agreements from the final technical implementation reports that the beneficiaries submitted to the Commission. The external contractor extracted the data from the templates and created a database containing the aggregated monitoring data on the outputs produced by the operating grant beneficiaries. 4. Monitoring data on the outputs produced by the contractors was first indicated in the Commission\u2019s COLI database (and EaSI Annual Work Programme) and then collected via the desk research carried out by the external contractor. For this, a catalogue of outputs produced during 2014 was produced and submitted by PPMI to the Commission for cross-check. In addition, final technical imple- mentation reports produced by the contrac- tors were collected by the operational units 74 EASI PERFORMANCE MONITORING REPORT 2014 ",
        "of the Commission and provided to the exter- nal contractor. 5. Regarding the conferences , final technical implementation reports attached to the con- tracts foresee that organisers must provide DG EMPL with the lists of participants. These lists of participants were collected and forwarded to the external contractor in order to carry out the survey of participants in EaSI-funded events in 2014. 6. Other sources used to collect information on outputs included the implementation reports of EaSI-supported financial instruments, reports from EURES advisers and an internal EURES Job Mobility Portal database. 7. Additionally, the external contractor carried out desk research in other relevant sources in order to collect the exhaustive amount of information on EaSI outputs. Such sources included the DG EMPL programming table as well as publicly accessible information (e.g. Europa.eu website, websites of the key EU- level NGO networks, European-level observa- tories and other relevant bodies). All specific sources for each of the output indicators are specified below in the second part of this Annex. 1.3. Collecting information on immediate and intermediate outcomes (key performance indicators) At the level of immediate and intermediate out- come indicators, the following data collection tools were employed: \u2022 gathering of the data collected via the tem- plates and other reporting means attached to the contracts and grant agreements (often such data was stored in the official DG EMPL databases, e.g. DEFIS, COLI, but in some cases it was also extracted directly from the tem- plates; such a situation arose in the case of contracts and operating grants, as this data is not currently entered into the databases mentioned above), including reports on the implementation of the EaSI-funded financial instruments (provided by the entrusted entity), EURES advisers\u2019 reports as well as information from the EURES Job Mobility Platform (pro- vided by the DG EMPL IT unit); \u2022 desk research in other primary and secondary sources. Among the key primary sources for the desk research were the legal documents governing the implementation of the EaSI programme, official websites of the Commis- sion, other EU institutions, EU-level NGO net- works, Commission staff working documents, communications from the Commission, pro- posals for Directives, Impact Assessment Reports, etc. As data from primary sources is not always sufficient for estimating all performance indicators, some secondary sources were used, e.g. data collected by other outside organisations and reports by independent experts; \u2022 EaSI Stakeholder Survey and survey of par- ticipants in EaSI-funded events. The EaSI Stakeholder Survey was launched in Janu- ary 2015, whereas the survey of participants in events was carried out twice a year, i.e. approxi- mately 2-3 months after each event. Stakeholders surveyed under the EaSI Stakeholder Survey included the following groups: a) EU and national-level policy and decision-makers, who work in the employment and social policy fields; b) civil society organisations (NGOs), including social part- ners; c) other relevant participants and stakeholders involved in the programme design and implemen- tation (including employees in public and private employment services; employees in public or private organisations providing microfinance and/or fund- ing for social enterprises; researchers, university teachers or independent experts; journalists). Respondents of the EaSI Stakeholder Survey were invited to answer the questionnaire using one of two methods: \u2022 Direct email invitations to participate in the survey were sent to the lists of respondents. Separate lists for each of the EaSI axes were compiled. Double use of respondents\u2019 email addresses was avoided; 75 EASI PERFORMANCE MONITORING REPORT 2014 ",
        "\u2022 Respondents were also able to reach the questionnaire via the survey gateway website (hosted by PPMI). In the gateway, respondents were able to identify the axis and thematic area he/she is involved in. Several minutes after visiting the gateway respondents received direct email invitation to participate in the survey of the specific axis/thematic area. Survey gateway was advertised through DG EMPL website and social media tools (Face- book and Twitter) in order to attract additional respondents to the survey. Respondents of the events questionnaire were invited to the survey with direct email invitations. The list of respondents was compiled using lists of participants in the events provided by the relevant staff of DG EMPL to the external contractor. All questionnaires were available in three languages \u2013 English, French and German. The results of both surveys are presented as Annexes to the Perfor- mance Monitoring Report in the detailed informa- tion notes. 2. PERFORMANCE INDICATORS 2.1.

It also supported policy coordination, the sharing of best practice, capacity building and testing of innovative policies.
