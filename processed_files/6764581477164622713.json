        "The EU has a wide range of external policies: on trade, co-operation with developing countries, defence and security, foreign policy, humanitarian and financial aid. Other instruments cover the external aspects of policies on energy, environment, transport, justice and home affairs (e.g. instruments to handle terrorism, migration and organised crime). The Joint Research Centre (DG JRC) is increasingly providing support to Commission services and to European and international organisations, including: \u2022 Contributing to global stability and security by supporting initiatives for non- military assistance throughout the world (e.g. support to the tsunami relief and reconstruction); also foreign policy and security issues (the Israeli wall), and relations with the EU\u2019s neighbours in Eastern and Southern Europe (migration and border security); \u2022 Implementing and monitoring co-operation programmes and policies in developing countries (e.g. food security, sustainable forest management, monitoring of fires, desertification, biodiversity, air quality and climate change); and \u2022 Monitoring the threat from chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear weapons, and illicit trafficking in these and in conventional weapons (including goods that may be used for either military or civilian purposes). DG JRC supports the EU\u2019s quest for global security 03 Global security 15/03/05 14:44 Page 1 ",
        "Responding to the new security agenda DG JRC is increasingly being asked for global security services and products by other Commission Directorates-General (DGs), including External Relations, Environment, Justice, Freedom and Security, and the three DGs responsible for development, poverty and humanitarian aid. With its understanding of EU policies and expertise in fields ranging from remote-sensing and IT, to systems engineering and analysis, DG JRC is well able to address the research and technology aspects of security. It can also provide science and technology back-up for the security needs of individual Member States (e.g. law enforcement agencies) and international organisations. Tapping the potential of internet news for security intelligence monitoring DG JRC has developed a system for automatically monitoring news on internet websites in real time. The system identifies on-line news stories on subjects specified by users as soon as they are published by major European newspaper and television websites in all EU languages. The software can analyse 25 000 articles per day, against 10 000 keywords on 600 subject areas in 0.1 seconds. Part of the system is used by 7 000 Commission officials every day through European Media Monitoring 1 . The system also tracks bio-terrorist, chemical or nuclear threats and incidents for the Health and Consumer Protection DG, provides input to the External Relations DG\u2019s crisis room, and is used to mine open sources to detect illicit nuclear activities. In addition, this system has now been made available to law enforcement and intelligence agencies in the Member States. Support to external aspects of internal security Sensors, information and space technologies will also be crucial to support areas of external assistance policy, including those related to external aspects of internal security (including trans-border challenges such as non-proliferation, terrorism, and organised crime), and European neighbourhood policies. In co-operation with EUROPOL (European Police Office), DG JRC provides training activities for police and border control services on the detection of nuclear materials. It also supports the IAEA (International Atomic Energy Agency) in the analysis of samples of material taken during inspection missions in the framework of non- proliferation, and in the development and implementation of nuclear safeguard surveillance techniques. Disaster alert and management systems DG JRC has developed systems for real-time disaster alert 2 and damage analysis which have been applied to earthquakes, floods, forest fires, tropical storms and more recently the tsunami in Asia 3 . These services are being used in humanitarian aid and crisis management operations both in the Commission (the DGs for External Relations, humanitarian and development aid, Environment, and Regional Policy), and in relevant UN agencies: the UN Office for Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) and the satellite earth observation project UNOSAT. Decision-making and information management systems have been developed to integrate information from different sources to support crisis management in a coherent manner 4 . New systems will be offered to assist reconstruction activities after major crises, ensuring that aid covers real needs and is not diverted. Advanced techniques to provide policy support in remote areas Satellite-derived information is being used to provide intelligence on zones which are important but inaccessible. For example, novel image analysis and geospatial imaging techniques have been developed to control the effectiveness of EU-funded programmes to convert illicit coca plantations to cultivation of conventional crops in South America; to report illegal logging of forests in Russia; and to count the number of refugees in African refugee camps. DG JRC has also analysed the situation of the Israeli security wall in the West Bank, in partnership with the EU Satellite Centre in Torrejon, the UN and non-governmental organisations, determining the impact of the wall on the West Bank population (settlements, villages, agriculture, water supply, education, etc.). Maps and aggregate data provided by DG JRC are supporting EU external policy with respect to Iraq. 1 - http://emm.jrc.org/NewsBrief/worldedition/en/en.html 2 - http://dma.jrc.it/Services/gdas/ 3 - http://tsunami.jrc.it/ 4 - http://139.191.142.28/Services/Global_Atlas/main.htm DG JRC developed image-processing techniques to identify illicit coca crops in Colombia S .
