        "2 SUMMER 2018 / No. 65 PANOR AMA In this issue \u2026 The summer issue of Panorama magazine, looks to the future and considers the European Commission\u2019s proposed budget for the 2021-2027 funding period. As well as an introductory article presenting the proposals and how they hope to reform Cohesion Policy, we have an exclusive interview with Commis- sioner Cre\u0163u outlining the main developments and their rea- soning, and we feature initial reactions from a variety of stakeholders across Europe. Our focus this time is on Ireland, which is currently celebrating 45 years of EU membership. In an interview with Minister for Public Expenditure Paschal Donohoe, and through a selection of projects, we show how ERDF funding has helped Ireland become more innovative and competitive. We reveal the 21 finalists for this year\u2019s RegioStars awards, and preview the themes and details of the next European Week of Regions and Cities, taking place in Brussels in early October. We also explore a variety of cultural heritage pro- jects supported by the ERDF, to celebrate the European Year of Cultural Heritage, and our Captured on Camera section highlights innovation in Poland. We report on the recent good governance conference, look at the variety of initia- tives helping administrative capacity-building across the EU, and follow the continuing adventures of our young Euro- pean social media stars crossing the continent as part of the EU Road Trip project. The projects section visits Italy, France and Bulgaria.

        "3 PANORAMA / SUMMER 2018 / No. 65 With the presentation of its proposals on 29 May, the Commission laid the foundations of a new Cohesion Policy. With a budget of EUR 373 billion over seven years, Cohesion Policy remains Europe's strongest investment policy, despite the budgetary gap left by Brexit and the emergence of new challenges. I am glad to say that Cohesion Policy investments will flow to all EU regions. It will empower them to deliver our common EU prior- ities, bringing EU solidarity to each and every corner of Europe and allowing every region, every town, every border region to seize the opportunities raised by the largest internal market in the world. Tomorrow\u2019s Cohesion Policy will focus on a smarter, stronger and more caring Europe: modern investments that prioritise a smart industrial transition to meet the challenges of our global economy, as well as green growth and the transition to a low-carbon economy. In parallel, we remain faithful to our commitment to a more social and more connected Europe that is closer to citizens. The new Cohesion Policy's priorities are those areas where our investments are most needed: those regions still strug- gling with low income or high unemployment, especially among young people, and those confronted with the migration issue. Finally, on opportunities, we will go one step further to overcome borders within the Union by promoting interregional innovative investments, focusing more on institutional cooperation, and investing in joint services of public interest. At the same time, cities will stay at the heart of Cohesion Policy, with a new European Urban Initiative and a minimum earmarking of 6 % of European Regional Development Fund resources for urban areas. Our proposals strike a delicate balance between continuity and the need for reform. We have kept what has been working, while making it simpler and more operational. In fact, with simpler programming and territorial tools, no more designation pro- cedure, a single audit principle and no specific procedure for major projects we will be able to start delivering much earlier. It is about trusting authorities\u2019 experience, and cutting red tape, not responsibilities. In brief, it is about increasing results and ownership. Nevertheless, Cohesion Policy, with its millions of projects across our continent, with its concrete results in terms of jobs, faster internet or safer drinking water, is also the best way to ensure that our citizens feel part of the European project. In the face of new challenges and with the economic recovery gaining momentum, we must invest in our common future, for the benefit of our regions and our children.

        "4 European Week of Regions and Cities 2018 This year, the 16 th European Week of Regions and Cities will take place from 8 to 11 October in Brussels, Belgium and is expected to attract some 6 000 partici- pants, plus speakers and journalists. In addition to the Brussels-based workshops, 150 working sessions, exhibitions and networking activities, the EWRC features local events taking place from September to December 2018 across Europe. T he European Week of Regions and Cities is the key annual event for regional and local authorities. Organised by the European Committee of the Regions (CoR) and the Euro- pean Commission's Directorate-General for Regional and Urban Policy (DG REGIO), it has become a unique stakeholders' com- munication and networking platform for regional policy, attracting regions and cities from all over Europe and beyond. The event aims to bring together political representatives, decision-makers, experts and practitioners of regional policy, as well as stakeholders and the media, to discuss common challenges for European regions and cities and to identify possible solutions. Figuring out the future In 2018, Cohesion Policy will celebrate its 30 th anniversary against the backdrop of intense discussion on the EU\u2019s future priorities \u2013 and its next multiannual budget, covering the period 2021-2027. By providing a platform for capacity-build- ing, cooperation, exchange of experience and good practice for those implementing EU Cohesion Policy and managing its financial instruments, the EWRC will consider the policy\u2019s future in a wider context, including recent research and views from third countries and international organisations. This year, discussions during the Week will focus on key polit- ical issues in the EU: the proposal for the next Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF) and the underlying legislative instruments, which the Commission put forward in May 2018, and the European Parliament elections. ",
        "5 PANORAMA / SUMMER 2018 / No. 65 The European Committee of the Regions will adopt its opinion on the Future of Europe and its President will deliver a State of the Union address during the same week. Under the main theme ' For a strong EU Cohesion Policy beyond 2020 ', the EWRC will provide a platform for the regions and cities to share their views on both the EU's multi- annual budget and the subsequent legislative proposals \u2013 namely, Cohesion Policy and rural development, and the future of Europe in a regional and local perspective. This annual event is the opportunity to clearly demonstrate that Cohesion Policy has delivered real and tangible improvements for Europeans, and to reiterate that a strong Cohesion Policy is needed. Investing in Cohesion Policy post-2020 Discussions during the week-long event will examine the need for a strong Cohesion Policy beyond 2020 to overcome structural barriers, boost human capital and improve the quality of life. Growth and regional development, under- standing and managing the territorial impacts of globalisa- tion and digital transformation, the regional dimension of climate change and energy transition, and integrated terri- torial development will be considered together with effective regional and local strategies on youth, integration of migrants and social exclusion. In view of the EU reform debate, the governance challenges for Cohesion Policy should also be taken into account.

        "10 Taking up the challenge: to make Europe smarter and greener Corina Cre\u0163u, European Commissioner for Regional Policy, tells Panorama how the proposed changes to create a new, more flexible Cohesion Policy will deliver faster and better results and greater ownership. Can you tell us about the new Cohesion Policy? What changes? Well, first of all, we are modernising the policy. Our world is changing and the policy must change with it. All regions today face the challenge of the digital economy, of increasing global competi- tion and economic transformation. This is why we created the new policy object- ive \u2018A smarter Europe \u2013 innovative and smart economic transformation\u2019 which brings together innovation, research and SME support. Everything that is needed for regions to thrive and survive in our digital age! We must not forget either that, in ad dition to economic transformation, regions must be ready for the transition to the low-carbon economy and circular economy. We brought these two envi- ronmental objectives together in the policy objective \u2018A greener, low-carbon Europe\u2019. We are investing the lion's share of the ERDF in these two key objectives. Between 65 % (in the least-developed regions) and 85 % (in the most-devel- oped regions) will go to making Europe smarter and greener. In fact, a key feature of the reform is policy focus. Together with the other three objectives \u2013 infrastructure, social and local development \u2013 we have a set of five policy objectives which are tighter but more flexible than the 11 they replace. What about urban areas? Urban areas become more prominent in our proposals. Urban and local develop- ment appears for the first time as a specific policy objective. Moreover, we have ring-fenced 6 % of the money for investment in urban areas, delivered through local development partnerships. This could be via policy objective 5 or any of the other objectives, as appropri- ate. The strategic basis is a key precon- dition for programming to enhance the effectiveness of the planned actions. This new cross-cutting policy objective will help deal with technical difficulties experi- enced in programming in 2014-2020 (indicators, enabling conditions, multiple applicable thematic objectives, etc.). ",
        "11 PANORAMA / SUMMER 2018 / No. 65 The European Urban Initiative brings a new coherent approach to cities as all urban tools are combined in a single programme under the indirect man- agement of the Commission, similar to the current arrangements for the Urban Innovative Actions. The pro- gramme covers capacity building, inno- vative actions, knowledge and policy development and communication. What happens to Interreg? This is another key change in our pro- posals. Interreg is being revamped con- siderably: cross-border programmes will become more strategic, there is a new interregional innovation instru- ment and a new cross-border legal tool. There will also be the possibility to allow Interreg programme authorities to cooperate across borders with coun- tries outside the EU, using resources from the Instrument for Pre-accession Assistance and the European Neigh- bourhood Instrument. In addition, there is a real incentive in mainstream pro- grammes to support cooperation through actions undertaken under any specific objectives. The greatest request from stake- holders is always simpli fication. Have you done anything to reduce the administrative burden of the policy? The new legislative package strikes a delicate balance between continuity and the need for reform. We have kept what was working while making it simpler and more operational. The rulebook has been reduced to almost half of what it was. Simpler programming and territorial tools, fewer enabling conditions and assessment criteria, the elimination of designation procedures, the single audit principle, and no specific procedure for major projects will all result in a quicker start for programmes and a faster delivery of results. We also show that we trust our partners while maintaining safeguards to protect taxpayers' money. It is about cutting the red tape but not the responsibilities. It is about building on the experience of author- ities and trusting them, rather than regulating for worst-case scenarios. It is also about increasing results and ownership. The proposal will answer concerns of beneficiaries and authorities: more possibilities to use simplified cost options, payments not linked to costs, no complexity for revenue-generating projects, simplified rules for financial instruments and their alignment with grants whenever possible, and no more lengthy reporting. The new Cohesion Policy is less about collecting bills and procedures and more about delivering better and faster results. We are taking flexibility and perform- ance-orientation one step further by proposing a mid-term review of all pro- grammes in 2025. This will allow us to programme allocations for 2026 and 2027 based on their performance, but also on the challenges identified within the European Semester process and the socio-economic situation. This will bring us the necessary flexibility over the next 10 years, while still allowing for a stable investment framework. What about the money? Can you explain why fund allocation methods have been modified to include new criteria? The method used to allocate Cohesion Policy resources has been calibrated to provide a balanced and fair distribution of the funds. The relative per-capita gross domestic product will remain the predominant criterion for allocating funds while other factors, such as unemployment, climate change and immigration, will also be taken into account. The allocation method works bottom up not top down \u2013 and is based on objective indicators reflecting devel- opment levels, needs and challenges, with amounts calculated region by region then added together to provide national allocations. Most Central and Eastern European Member States have seen significant growth over the last seven years which feeds into the results of the calcula- tions. The richer you become, the less funding that flows from Cohesion Policy. That\u2019s how the system should \u2013 and does \u2013 work. The natural consequence of getting richer is a gradual decline in Cohesion Policy support \u2013 which, in fact, is a good thing! (cid:101) A key feature of the reform is policy focus. Together with the other three objectives \u2013 infrastructure, social and local development \u2013 we have a set of five policy objectives. ",
        "Proposals for a modernised and reformed Cohesion Policy post-2020 Although the EU economy is bouncing back, additional investment efforts are clearly needed to tackle persistent economic and social gaps between and within Member States. On 2 May, the European Commission proposed to allocate EUR 373 billion to the Cohesion Policy between 2021 and 2027 \u2013 just under 30 % of the global EU budget. On 29 May, the Commission unveiled its proposals for the revised regulations of the policy for the same period. Five investment policies From 11 thematic objectives in the 2014-2020 period, the new Cohesion Policy should focus its resources on 5 policy objectives, where the EU is best placed to deliver: A smarter Europe , through innovation, digitisation, economic transformation and support to small and medium-sized businesses; A greener, low-carbon Europe , implementing the Paris Agreement and investing in energy transition, renewables and the fight against climate change; A more connected Europe , with strategic transport and digital networks; A more social Europe, delivering on the European Pillar of Social Rights and supporting quality employment, education, skills, social inclusion and equal access to health care; A Europe closer to citizens , by supporting locally led development strategies and sustainable urban development across the EU. 12 ",
        "13 PANORAMA / SUMMER 2018 / No. 65 A STRONGER FOCUS ON CITIES Cities are engines of growth and innovation \u2013 but they are also faced with pressing challenges, such as air pollution, unemployment, social exclusion, to name just a few. Thus, the urban dimension of Cohesion Policy should be strengthened, with 6 % of the ERDF being dedicated to sustainable urban development . In addition, the 2021-2027 framework would also create the European Urban Initiative , a new tool for city-to- city cooperation, innovation and capacity-building across all the EU\u2019s Urban Agenda priorities: integrating migrants, housing, air quality, urban poverty and energy transition, among others. FACILITATE INTERREGIONAL AND CROSS(cid:2)BORDER COOPERATION In the 2021-2027 period, the Interreg programmes will continue to help Member States and regions work together across borders to tackle common challenges, with EUR 9.5 billion from the ERDF. Furthermore, the Commission is proposing the Euro- pean Cross Border Mechanism, which is a new instru- ment enabling, on a voluntary basis, the rules of one Member State to apply in a neighbouring Member State for a specific time-limited project or action. For instance, this could help create more cross-border transport infrastructure or health-care facilities. The new Cohesion Policy rules also propose creating Interregional Innovation Investments whereby regions with matching \u2018smart specialisation\u2019 assets would be given more support to work together in priority sectors, such as big data, bioeconomy, resource efficiency or connected mobility. TARGETED SUPPORT FOR THE EU\u2019S OUTERMOST REGIONS In line with the October 2017 Strategy for the Outer- most regions , these regions would be given the means to develop their assets, such as blue growth, space sci- ences and renewables. They would continue to receive additional EU funding of over EUR 1.6 billion from the ERDF and would receive special support under the new Interreg programmes to deepen their integration into their regional space and intensify cooperation either among themselves or with neighbouring countries. According to the Commission\u2019s proposal, the majority of European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) and Cohesion Fund (CF) investments will be geared towards the first two priorities. Depending on their gross national income (GNI) per capita, Member States should invest between 65 % and 85 % of their allocations under the two funds to these priorities. For countries with: minimum % on \u2018smarter Europe\u2019 minimum % on \u2018greener, low-carbon Europe\u2019 GNI below 75 % 35 % 30 % GNI 75-100 % 45 % 30 % GNI above 100 % 60 % PO1 + PO2 min. 85 % (cid:107) ",

Allocations for the remaining two years \u2013 2026 and 2027 \u2013 will be allocated following an in-depth mid-term review .

The Commission is now proposing common provisions regulation (CPR) in one single rulebook for seven EU funds: \u25a0 European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) \u25a0 Cohesion Fund (CF) \u25a0 European Social Fund+ (ESF+) \u25a0 European Maritime and Fisheries Fund (EMFF) \u25a0 Asylum, Migration and Integration Fund (AMIF) \u25a0 Internal Security Fund (ISF) \u25a0 Border Management and Visa Instrument (BMVI) Specific regulations will add certain provisions necessary to respond to the particularities of individual funds in order to take into account their different rationale, target groups and implementation methods. This single rulebook should simplify procedures for both programme managers and beneficiaries. It should also facilitate synergies , for example between the ERDF and the ESF+ in the context of integrated city development plans, for the regeneration of deprived urban areas. The AMIF, together with Cohesion Policy funds, could finance local integration strategies for migrants and asylum seekers: the former would focus on short-term needs upon arrival (reception and health-care, for example), while the CF could support long-term social and professional integration. In addition, new proposed provisions also enable simpler synergies with other instruments from the EU budget toolbox, such as the common agricultural policy , the innovation programme Horizon Europe , the EU instrument for learning mobility Erasmus+ , and LIFE , the programme for environmental and climate action.

        "17 PANORAMA / SUMMER 2018 / No. 65 Link with the European Semester EU investments cannot operate in isolation from the wider macro economic context. The Commission is proposing to strengthen the link between Cohesion Policy interventions and the European Semester of economic policy coordination, to cre- ate a growth and business-friendly environment in Europe. The European Semester's country-specific recommendations will be taken into account twice throughout the 2021-2027 period: (cid:3) (cid:92) First, as a roadmap for programming the funds and the design of Cohesion Policy programmes, at the beginning of 2021-2027; (cid:3) (cid:92) Then, the most recent country-specific recommendations will also guide a mid-term review of the programmes in 2024, to adjust to new or persistent challenges. Macroeconomic conditionality is maintained to ensure EU investments operate in a sound fiscal environment. When a Member State fails to take effective or corrective action in the context of key EU economic governance mechanisms (excessive deficit procedure, excessive imbalance procedure) or fails to implement the measures required by a stability support programme, the Commission will make a proposal to the Council to suspend all or part of the commitments or payments for one or more programmes of a Member State. However, the Commission may, on grounds of exceptional economic circumstances or following a reasoned request by the Member State concerned, recommend that the Council cancels the suspension. NEXT STEPS The proposal for the EU 2021-2027 budget on 2 May and the legislative proposal on 29 May are the first steps in the long negotiations process with the European Parliament and the Member States which should lead to the adoption of the regulation. Enabling conditions The proposed \u2018enabling conditions' continue the approach of the ex-ante conditionalities introduced for the 2014-2020 fund- ing period. Some 20 conditions have been proposed, which correspond to roughly half the number of conditionalities in the current period. They cover similar thematic areas to those in 2014-2020, such as energy efficiency, and also include smart specialisation strategies to guide investments in research and innovation. There are also four horizontal enabling conditions in the area of public procurement , state aid and in relation to the application of the European Union Charter of Funda- mental Rights and the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities . The procedures linked to the enabling conditions are similar but have been made simpler ; for example, there is no obliga- tory action plan to be submitted in case of non-fulfilment. However, Member States will not be able to send payment claims to the Commission for EU-funded projects related to unfulfilled preconditions. Their fulfilment must be respected throughout the period. Less red tape for businesses The proposed regulation allows the use of simplified cost options so that businesses can be reimbursed without having to present every single invoice or pay slip \u2013 they can use fixed costs and estimates for staff, insurance or rent expenses. They can also be reimbursed on the basis of results achieved. All this means a drastic reduction in administrative costs and, of course, less paperwork. More proportionate audit and controls: for those EU funding programmes less at risk, the Commission proposes a lighter system of control based on well-functioning national pro- cedures. The \u201csingle-audit\u201d principle is extended, which means fewer controls for small businesses.

Support for cities as mediators and innovative hubs A s the Mayor of Stockholm, I see that EU-funded projects are often the most visible link between citi- zens and the EU. ESF and ERDF funds have also brought decisions on invest- ments closer to citizens, helping cities and regions all over Europe to tackle pressing challenges and seize untapped opportunities on the ground. This is just one reason why I regret the proposed reduction in Cohesion Policy funds in relation to the overall budget. However, I am hopeful that the new ESF+ can provide a more flexible approach to social cohesion and make it easier for cities to address unex- pected needs and challenges. Creating cohesive and prosperous societies requires a combination of actions on labour market inclusion and social inclusion, and I find it encouraging that the Commission\u2019s proposals reflect this reality. I also welcome the continued and increased funding for research and in novation, both through Horizon Europe and ERDF. As the mayor of one of Europe\u2019s most innovative cities, I know how much added value EU funding for research and innovation can bring to cities like Stockholm. Investments in cit- ies also tend to have significant positive spillover effects on surrounding regions and other parts of Europe. Cities are mediators and hubs where academia, private companies, public administration, and civil society come together, creating test beds for in no vative methods, products and services. To utilise the full potential of cities as drivers of innovation, we need funding programmes focusing on societal chal- lenges with a clear urban dimension. I look forward to a continued dialogue about the cities\u2019 role in implementing the EU budget. https://www.visitstockholm.com/ A reformed and modernised Cohesion Policy post-2020 T he added value of Cohesion Policy stems primarily from its ability to take into account national develop- ment needs along with the needs and spe- cificities of different regions and territories, and to bring the Union closer to its citizens. Cohesion Policy is the European strategic investment policy which contributes to the implementation and complements the main EU policies, such as education, employment, energy, the environment, the single market, research and innovation, etc. I would like to point out that, above all, the Commission's proposal for a modernised, reformed Cohesion Policy, presented on 29 May, has the ambition to improve the policy\u2019s focus and concentration through five thematic objectives. These reflect the major EU policy priorities of achieving a smart Europe, green and circular economy, Karin Wanng\u00e5rd, Mayor of Stockholm Iskra Mihaiylova, Chair of the EP Regional Development Committee ",

The introduction of new criteria, besides gross domestic product, when defining the category of regions, contributes to taking a better account of local specifici- ties of a particular region, such as youth unemployment, a low level of education, climate change, and the reception and integration of migrants. The proposed \u201csingle rulebook\u201d creates the conditions for more effective links with other Community funds, as well as with the InvestEU Fund and financial instruments. This is in line with the Euro- pean Parliament\u2019s adopted resolutions on building blocks for a post-2020 EU Cohe- sion Policy and the 7 th Cohesion Report. The inclusion of a cross-border mechanism regulation is also in line with the EP\u2019s reso- lution on European Territorial Cooperation (Interreg), which called on the Commission to establish a legal tool to address the legal obstacles faced by border regions. The reinforced link between Cohesion Funding and EU values and economic governance will improve the investment environment for the effective imple- mentation of EU funds. In its resolution on the next MFF, adopted in May 2018, the European Parliament reaffirmed its position to have adequate funding for key EU policies to enable them to effectively carry out their tasks and objectives, including preserving Cohesion Policy funding to at least the level of the 2014-2020 budget. http://www.europarl.europa.eu/portal/en Relaunching the European project and agenda A s president of the European Eco- nomic and Social Committee (EESC), I am paying much atten- tion to the debate triggered by the Commission\u2019s proposals on the next multiannual financial framework (MFF) package and the sectoral legislative proposals for spending programmes. The reason is simple: I am utterly con- vinced that the European project and agenda have to be relaunched. Despite some hiccups, the first 60 years of the European Union have been an unpreced- ented success, bringing peace, prosperity and solidarity. That said, if we want \u2013 and this is what the EESC is committed to \u2013 to ensure that the EU can address the challenges of the 21 st century, we must make sure the financial means are able to match its ambitions. On 2 May, I declared that the Commis- sion was right to boost funding in \u201cnew\u201d policies such as migration, defence and climate change, and also to increase financial resources for research, investment and culture. We are all aware that the Commission has to face the departure of the UK, which is currently a net contributor. This is why, like other institutions, I called for an increase of the current ceiling on EU spending from 1 % to 1.3 % of gross national income, rather than 1.13 % as proposed by the Commission. However, I would have expected and welcomed more ambition in the MFF and a much stronger reference to the 2030 Agenda and the Sustainable Development Goals. I also maintain my reservations regard- ing the cuts the Commission is propos- ing to the Cohesion Policy (as well as to the common agricultural policy). In times of crisis, the Cohesion Policy has proved to be efficient in helping the most vulnerable European citizens. Fur- thermore, in many cases, it is the face of Europe in the Member States. In the same vein, and especially after the Proc- lamation of the European Pillar of Social Rights in November 2017, we want to be sure that proper resources aimed at social cohesion are really there. The EESC \u2013 while keeping an eye on how the Member States and the Euro- pean Parliament will further address this crucial file \u2013 will adopt its opinion on the MFF in September as well as a number of opinions relating to the sectoral legislative proposals. https://www.eesc.europa.eu/en Luc Jahier, President of the European Economic and Social Committee European Economic and Social Committee (cid:107) ",
        "Finding a new and dynamic narrative for a strong Cohesion Policy A s President of the European Com- mittee of the Regions, I am often asked whether I view the Euro- pean Commission's recent proposals on the future of Cohesion Policy as a glass half full or half empty. The glass maybe viewed half full if we consider the Commission\u2019s credible attempt to simplify rules, provide more flexibility and strengthen local solutions. Indeed, it is a positive that the focus of Cohesion Policy will continue to remain at the regional level for all regions in Europe. Furthermore, it is positive that it will remain the EU\u2019s main investment policy despite opposing voices from the Commission last year. Nevertheless, I must also agree with those who take a less optimistic view, pointing towards overall cuts in Cohe- sion Policy of 10 % as well as the reduced focus on partnerships, even though the Commission reinstated the principle of multi-level governance in the regulation at the very last minute. Also, the proposed cut for the European Territorial Cooperation objective of more than 12 % and scrapping Interreg Europe are clearly proposals I cannot accept. Interreg is a trademark of EU regional policy and a European success story which cannot be destroyed. My biggest concern is the fall in cohe- sion between the different Structural Funds. The rural development instru- ment is no longer part of the Common Provision Regulation, and the European Social Fund seems set for a future more aligned with the European Semester. Cohesion Policy has lost some of its soul at a time when more togetherness and solidarity are being demanded by the thousands of citizens we have consulted over the past 12 months. Finding a new and dynamic narrative for a strong Cohesion Policy for the future of Europe is therefore of critical importance in the months and years to come. That is why the #CohesionAlliance \u2013 which the European Committee of the Regions launched together with the main European associations of regions and cities \u2013 will continue to push for a strong Cohesion Policy as part of a strong European Union. Throughout EU budget negotiations, it will continue to make the case that Cohesion Policy is the most powerful weapon to fight populism, to promote European integra- tion and create a Europe that is heard and felt in the lives of all citizens. https://cor.europa.eu/en/Pages/default. aspx Creating synergies and better addressing societal challenges T he Assembly of European Regions (AER) welcomes the Commission\u2019s proposal of a Cohesion Policy for all. It includes well-needed simplifica- tions and a more flexible framework. However, the EU cohesion budget is less ambitious than we had hoped. The proposed cuts to Cohesion Policy show a lack of commitment to scale up a budget that works towards eco- nomic, social and territorial cohesion across the EU. It is a policy that has delivered development in all of Europe\u2019s regions. Moves to centralise Cohesion Policy and use it for structural reforms without involvement of the regions is worrying. The success of the policy lies in its closeness to the local and regional level and Europe\u2019s citizens. Furthermore, proposing of European Social Fund as a standalone fund con- cerns us as it indicates a distinction between the regional and social fund. Such decisions are likely to undermine the Union\u2019s ability to achieve sustainable, inclusive and smart growth outcomes in the future.

        "In my home region, Region V\u00e4stra G\u00f6taland (Sweden), we have coord- inated calls to pool the regional fund and social fund to create synergies and efficiently address societal chal- lenges. I hope the new legislation will take these successful methods into account. Regions must remain as cen- tral actors in the management and implementation of the fund. As a member of the Cohesion Alliance, AER will work resolutely to make sure that Cohesion Policy remains a true regional policy that builds on the prin- ciples of multi-level governance and subsidiarity. The policy is one of our most powerful tools to improve the quality of life for Europe\u2019s citizens while also creating European added value. AER believes a strong renewed Cohe- sion Policy for all regions is essential for the future of Europe. https://aer.eu/ A stronger partnership for Europe and its citizens A s we scrutinise the Commission\u2019s new proposals to understand what Cohesion Policy might look like post-2020, let\u2019s keep the overall picture in mind: a Europe that badly needs to deliver results that matter to people. The Commission proposes an explicit focus in the next funding period on a Europe closer to its citizens. While this is positive, the question is how to make it work in practice? 75 % of the EU\u2019s population live in urban areas, where European chal- lenges related to sustainable, inclusive and smar t developments come together. The success of the next round of Structural Funds will depend on how it is geared to tackle these challenges in cities. To deliver effect- ive results, it will be crucial to ensure that cities are at the table when pro- gramme priorities are negotiated, and policy instruments facilitate joined-up approaches locally. The partnership principle is strong in the new proposals. However, we want to make sure that it moves from prin- ciple to practice. When the level of gov- ernment closest to the citizens \u2013 the city \u2013 is fully involved in setting priorities, it is clear that programmes stand a better chance of matching the local realities they are designed to support. In cities, challenges do not come in pol- icy sectors \u2013 they are complex and often linked to places. We are very concerned about the new proposals isolating funding for social inclusion, employment and skills. This undermines cities\u2019 ability to deliver joined-up solu- tions locally. Cohesion Policy post-2020 must strengthen the means for urban strategies to combine support from both the ERDF and ESF+, not weaken them. Cohesion Policy is a strong symbol of European solidarity and unity. It is the glue that can hold Europe together, with unique possibilities to make a dif- ference to citizens. If we get the condi- tions right to bring cities fully on-board and provide the policy tool that works locally, we can set Europe off on the path to a stronger future. http://www.eurocities.eu/eurocities/ about_us/staff Anna Lisa Boni, secretary general of EUROCITIES 21 PANORAMA / SUMMER 2018 / No. 65 (cid:107) ",
        "Contributing to the sustainable developments of the territories T he European Commission\u2019s pro- posal is a step in the right direc- tion, although it does not provide a truly integrated approach of all relevant funds. The Emilia-Romagna Region welcomes the European Commission\u2019s proposal for the new regional development and Cohesion Policy beyond 2020, recognis- ing that a number of key issues, expressed in our position paper, were taken into consideration. However, some elements remain for discussion with the European Parliament and the central governments in the coming months of negotiations. We appreciate that all regions will remain eligible to receive funding \u2013 less-devel- oped, transition and more-developed regions \u2013 and that within its five policy objectives the Commission includes one on \u201ca Europe closer to its citizens by fos- tering the sustainable and integrated development of urban, rural and coastal areas and local initiatives\u201d. Nevertheless, CEMR believes that all policy objectives must contribute to sustainable develop- ment of the territories, taking into account their specificities and particular needs. The CEMR also welcomes the wider focus of urban sustainable development, which now foresee 6 % for community-led local development and integrated territorial investments and also covers small and medium-sized cities and towns. On the other hand, we regret there is no substantive reference to the Sus- tainable Development Goals, either in the General Provision Regulation or in the ERDF. CEMR has been promoting the SDGs as an overarching strategy for the future Cohesion Policy. We also deplore that there will be no single rule- book for all funds \u2013 this only amounts to harmonised guidance, which in prac- tice will not have the same effect as integrated common rules for the ERDF, ESF and EAFRD. We acknowledge that the European Commission had a difficult time pre- paring this proposal against competing demands when Cohesion Policy and its budget were put in serious doubt. We will ensure that the new 2021-2027 proposals work for the local and regional levels. http://www.ccre.org/en Protecting the core principles of Cohesion Policy T he European Commission\u2019s pro- posal for the post-2020 EU budget contains some positive steps but does not fully realise the long- term ambition required to shape Europe\u2019s future. The proposal to introduce new own resources is a welcome move, and the proposed budget is at roughly the same level as the current one, despite the financial gap that Brexit will leave. But the budget does not reflect the greater number of priorities that need to be tackled at the European level. Instead, funding has been redistributed away from traditional policies, such as Cohesion Policy, to new priorities, like migration and security. If the budget is to work for its citizens then shared management pro- grammes, such as those falling under Cohesion Policy, must be at the heart of reforms. In terms of the Cohesion Policy pro- posal on 29 May, the Commission\u2019s DG REGIO has produced a balanced pack- age covering all European regions, con- firming that Cohesion policy remains Eleni Marianou, secretary general of the Conference of Peripheral Maritime Regions Stefano Bonacini, President of the Emilia-Romagna Region and the Council of European Municipalities and Regions 22 ",

However, there are concerns about cutting Cohesion policy by 10 % in real terms; using Cohesion Policy to serve the European Semester more directly, particularly the European Social Fund (ESF); cutting the Interreg budget by 12 % and eliminating cross-border maritime programmes; and undermin- ing the shared management approach by introducing possibilities to transfer funds. The onus is now on the European Parlia- ment and the Council to protect and strengthen Cohesion Policy\u2019s core prin- ciples. The CPMR will ensure that it con- tributes to the building blocks for a policy that is able to reinforce economic, social and territorial cohesion in all regions. https://cpmr.org/ Protecting those at risk of poverty or our defence and security industries? I n recent weeks, we have seen a host of proposals from the Commission for the next MFF. We should never forget that setting the EU budget is an inherently political process, with long- lasting implications for the 118 million Europeans living at risk of poverty. The Commission has proposed \u201ca budget that protects and empowers\u201d. But who, or what, does it protect and empower? We argue that a 7 % cut in Cohesion Funds, coupled with a 22-fold increase in the defence budget and large increases for border management, funding 10 000 bor- der guards, means that this is a budget which protects and empowers our security, borders and defence industries, rather than the almost 25 % of Europeans living at risk of poverty. This is not the political message we should be sending to our citizens, to people experiencing poverty. Poverty eradication and social inclusion are pub- lic goods, and the MFF must recognise this. Adequate funding for social pol- icies, social protection and public ser- vices is vital to the implementation of the Pillar of Social Rights and the SDGs, to fight inequality, poverty and social exclusion \u2013 and this means that 30 % of the proposed \u2018ESF+\u2019 fund must be dedicated to this fight. Cutting the Cohesion Funds is unaccept- able \u2013 we must resist the \u2018TINA\u2019 (There Is No Alternative) narrative with alterna- tive political options. Social investment should never be considered as excess spending \u2013 it is good for all Europeans and a prerequisite for tackling poverty and social exclusion. Early investments in this fight mean less money is needed to counteract the out- comes of poverty and social exclusion. The Council and Parliament must rise to the challenge and ensure a budget which prioritises people over defence \u2013 not a cent less for social, not a cent less for Cohesion Policy. https://www.eapn.eu/ Leo Williams, director, European Anti-Poverty Network Vito Telesca, executive committee member, European Anti-Poverty Network 23 PANORAMA / SUMMER 2018 / No. 65 (cid:107) ",
        "Pushing for a more socially sustainable Europe F or the Social Platform, the next multiannual financial framework (MFF) is an opportunity to shift the balance of the EU budget towards people-centred policies. Investing in social cohesion and inclusive policies is a prerequisite to more resilient economies, safer societies and upward convergence across the Union. As the EU\u2019s main investment instrument, a Cohesion Policy that strongly promotes social objectives is key to this endeavour. In this respect, we enthusiastically note that the Commission\u2019s sectoral budget proposals make a valuable contribution to a more social Europe. The future European Social Fund (ESF+) is of particular relevance in this context. The proposal sets clear investment objectives to support the implementation of the European Pillar of Social Rights with its key principles to promote quality employment, education and social inclusion. This is supported by an enabling regulatory framework which strongly promotes sustainable development through local initiatives \u2013 an encouraging push towards a more socially, environmentally and economically sustainable Europe. Delivering on these objectives together with the European Pillar of Social Rights will require strong and equitable partnerships between public author- ities, social partners and civil society. Together with our members, represent- ing 49 civil society umbrella organisa- tions working in the social sector across the EU, we will closely monitor the MFF interinstitutional negotiations and advocate for an ambitious Cohe- sion Policy which can deliver social progress for all. http://www.socialplatform.org/ European funds for all \u2013 investing in people There is no doubt that Cohesion Policy is essential to create a Europe for every- body. Over the years, the Cohesion Policy and funds have made an important contribution to the inclusion of people with disabilities, even in Europe\u2019s most remote regions. However, the post-2020 proposal con- cerns me. The proposed budget cut will affect Europe\u2019s most disadvan- taged, especially in regions where they are most vulnerable. At a time when anti-European sentiment is growing, this reduced budget risks stoking those flames. Furthermore, it risks creating two Europes \u2013 those who are prospering and the socially excluded who will be driven further away from the European project. That said, we acknowledge the Commis- sion\u2019s efforts to simplify the funds. We hope that this simplification will ensure more people with disabilities can access funding and see a real, positive differ- ence in their daily lives. To make this a reality, it is essential that regulations guarantee civil society organisations are meaningfully involved from the very beginning of the process.

I am also pleased to see that the Com- mission has kept ex-ante conditional- ities and references to the Pillar of Social Rights, the European Social Charter and, of course, the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD). This year, we finally have universal ratification of the CRPD by the EU and its Member States. Yet, 10 years of austerity have led to a lack of invest- ment in inclusion and poverty reduction. It is estimated that more than 1 million Europeans are living in institutions. We must turn this around. It is also very worrying that references to accessibility, which were in the last regulations, are absent. Years of effort and progress from the Commission and the disability movement risk being lost. Accessibility is essential for our partici- pation in society. I trust European policymakers will listen to our call and add accessibility in the horizontal principle promoting equality and non- discrimination, and throughout the regulation. I want a Europe that includes me. We need a strong Cohesion Policy to make it happen. http://www.edf-feph.org/ Focus on long-term growth and competitiveness Businesses believe that the EU\u2019s budget post-2020 should reflect its future priorities and concentrate efforts on enhancing our competitiveness, par- ticularly in areas where the EU can deliver concrete benefits and help to prepare industry for megatrends, such as digitalisation or energy transition. We would like to see a reform-oriented budget which supports the involve- ment of social partners in delivering labour market reforms, notably through an improved European Social Fund. Furthermore, the EU should boost the success of Cohesion Policy by turning it into an integral part of a European investment strategy, with an adequate financial framework to support a cohesive Europe. We welcome the fact that the Commis- sion\u2019s proposal clearly reflects new prior- ities in the areas of migration, security and defence, where action at EU level can lead to more efficient spending and bet- ter results. Whilst we acknowledge its greater focus on future-oriented invest- ment in its recent MFF proposal, more ambition is needed to foster long-term growth and competitiveness in the EU. We urge all political decision-makers to prioritise and build on the Commission\u2019s increased emphasis on EU competitive- ness, especially research and innovation, in the forthcoming negotiations. It is essential that all parties work towards reaching a swift agreement on the MFF post-2020 before the European Parliament elections in May 2019.

The Commission\u2019s recent MFF pro- posals intimated reduced funding of approximately 7 % for the post-2020 Cohesion Policy. As negotiations com- mence, this cut could deepen. This has not prevented an acceleration in the Policy\u2019s ambition \u2013 stronger links to the European Semester and condition- alities, more focus on delivering struc- tural reforms and boosting EMU resilience. At the same time, the request for more simplification and greater flexibility in implementation has been acknowledged. A balancing act has been carefully crafted to offer something for everyone, but at a price: (cid:3) (cid:92) A hands-off and proportionate manage- ment approach while proposing stronger centralisation (e.g. of social policy); (cid:3) (cid:92) The continued quest for improved economic and innovation performance but no underpinning of the EU growth strategy; (cid:3) (cid:92) More spending flexibility but tighter surveillance under the European Semester; (cid:3) (cid:92) A renewed focus on lagging, rural and cross-border regions while con- tinuing the territorially-blind approach to facilitating agglomer- ation effects; and (cid:3) (cid:92) Commitment to economic conver- gence while conditioning funds with adherence to the rule of law. Will these trade-offs diminish the Pol- icy\u2019s ethos? Stronger political leader- ship could significantly improve the tone of the debate \u2013 at EU, Member State and local levels \u2013 in the months to come. This will also require all part- ners across the Cohesion Policy com- munity to acknowledge what is feasible within the bigger picture of a more constrained MFF budget with more priorities to serve. Member States should look beyond pro- nouncing a budgetary victory on their home ground. At the same time, regions should combine renewed scope to carve out tailored solutions, with greater own- ership of the Policy\u2019s performance. In the coming months, there is a strong chance that Cohesion Policy\u2019s role (in both pro- moting the value of the EU project and targeting support for greater regional/ local resilience) will play second fiddle to this political agenda. This would be an own goal for all partners. There is still much to deliver for the EU\u2019s cohesion agenda (socially, economically and territorially).

        "Bolder response needed to combat climate change For nearly three decades, Cohesion Policy has been an expression of economic, social and territorial solidarity across the differ- ent regions of the EU. It has also proven to be a catalyst in the fight against climate change and the transition to a low-carbon energy system, by providing public invest- ments in sectors like transport, energy and construction, which are major sources of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe. On 29 May, the Commission unveiled its proposal regarding the future Cohesion Policy after 2020, revealing renewed ambition with a smaller number of pol- icy objectives, higher earmarking of funds to combat climate change, and reinforced links with the EU\u2019s 2030 energy and climate targets. But the next EU budget and its subsequent regulations come at a time when the cli- mate imperative has never been more pressing. At this point, the aforementioned improvements around policy objectives fall short of the bold action needed to avoid catastrophic climate change. While drastic action is needed to steer the energy transformation, some simple steps can be taken: an even higher earmarking, backed by an improved climate-tracking methodology is needed, as advised by the European Court of Auditors. At the same time, elements within Cohesion Policy that support the involvement of local actors like the Partnership Principle and the Commu- nity-Led Local Development approach are still too dependent on the discretion of Member States. Clarification around these elements, as well as new, specific ex-ante conditionalities regarding public participation are crucial to ensure that Cohesion Policy properly supports a bottom-up energy transformation. The Commission\u2019s proposal on Cohesion Policy is a welcomed first step. The ball is now in the court of Member States and the European Parliament, which must demonstrate a commitment to fight climate change by unlocking the full potential of the EU\u2019s most successful policies in this area. https://bankwatch.org/ Raphael Hanoteaux, EU policy officer, CEE Bankwatch Network 27 PANORAMA / SUMMER 2018 / No. 65 ",
        "28 On the road with Europe\u2019s youth The Road Trip Project, launched this spring by the European Commission\u2019s Directorate-General for Regional and Urban Policy, is first and foremost a human adventure. Young people from different backgrounds embark on a journey throughout Europe to explore a variety of projects and initiatives funded and enabled by the European Union. T he aim is to provide young Europeans with a fresh opportunity to experience first-hand what the EU stands for and what it does on the ground. Four teams of two young people set off on a month-long European road trip along pre-defined routes. On the way, locals join the travellers on the road for a while and intro- duce them to their local life and scenery. The journeys stretch across the continent, from the Mediterranean coast to the Baltic Sea, and along the Atlantic Ocean and the River Danube. Regular brief updates including short videos are posted on Instagram and Facebook, as well as longer videos at the end of each week. Of the four routes, two (the Mediterranean and Atlantic) have already been completed; below you can read the participants\u2019 thoughts on what they learnt from their road trip experience.

        "PANORAMA / SUMMER 2018 / No. 65 29 \u201cWhen I thought about the European Commission before, I did not know a thing about what they were doing, and I assumed that what they were doing would be very boring. This month I learned a lot. I got the chance to visit projects funded by the EU and I must say that really surprised me in a good way. It was not boring at all and all the projects we visited are very important for us to get a better future. For example, our water: in the Netherlands, our drinking water is very good, so I just use it and I don't think about any problems regard- ing that. In Spain, they told me that in a few years drinking water can become a big problem in the world. That\u2019s why they designed a way to recycle the water we use in the shower to flush the toilet, because it is really wasteful to use clean drinking water for that. I think it is very important to have initiatives like this. And next to having these initiatives, I think it is important that people know about them. The Road Trip Project gives young Europeans an insight and I am really happy about that. I hope, just like me, they will have a better idea of what is happening now.\u201d YLDAU (24, Netherlands, Atlantic route) \u201cI have been living in Europe for almost five years. In some ways, I felt part of Europe but during the Road Trip Project I had the chance to become more involved in European culture, meeting different people every day and each one of them unique in their own way. I see Europe as one big country thanks to the European Union principle of avoiding borders and being united. Apart from all the experiences and places we visited during this month on the road, what I value the most is the people with whom I spent every single day (Yldau, Ynke, Frank and Sidney). Now they are my friends and friendship is priceless for me.\u201d FABIAN (25, Ecuadorian living in Vilnius, Lithuania, Atlantic route) \u201cWhen I ask myself where do I come from, Europe feels like the right answer. In 2016, I went on an Erasmus ex change and met people from all over the con- tinent. Since then I was 100 % sure that my values and my view on the world are not German but European. While being on the road with my four new friends, I did not only learn about Belgium and its slightly different culture (compared to my country) but also recognised how similar we all felt about our European adventures. No matter how far we travelled, the people we met laughed about the same jokes and worried about the same things as we do. They made us feel and understand the meaning of the European Union. It connects us, the European people, for the sake of a supportive and peaceful community. I also realised that the EU is not only taking place in Brussels \u2013 it is also people who recognise problems in their regions and who get active to make a change, and it is them who really make the EU alive. And although I didn't only hear positive things about the EU, I think nowadays it is more crucial than ever to connect countries and to focus on similarities instead of differences.\u201d LOUISA (26, Germany, Mediterranean route) \u201cI\u2019ve now been back in my home country for a while and I still have not fully pro- cessed the road trip. This is because it's left such an impression on me \u2013 all those different countries, people and cultures; it has completely changed my idea of what Europe is like! And I am immensely grateful for the project! But it is not just my impression of the EU countries that has changed, but also my impression of the EU itself. I have seen how some of the projects provide support and help growth and this gave me a warm feeling. It is perhaps a little stereotypical, but when I thought about the EU I thought of men in tailored suits, sitting around a large round table and making decisions about the world. This is the case, but they also work very closely with small local projects that are doing their best to create a good future for both people and nature. Basic- ally, after the road trip, I had a much broader idea of what it is all about and I am extremely proud to be a part of this and to be able to call myself European.\u201d LOUIS (21, Belgium, Mediterranean route) 29 (cid:107) ",

        "Irish inroads into innovation Cohesion Policy was long known for paving Ireland\u2019s motorways but is now increasingly fuelling its economic growth engine with support for innovation and SMEs. New competitiveness is especially important as the country braces for potential fallout from Brexit. S ituated in the North Atlantic to the west of the United Kingdom, Ireland spans some 70 000 km 2 and has a population of 4.76 million, a third of whom are is aged under 25. It joined the European Economic Community in 1973 and has been part of the euro area since 1999. Following a period of rapid economic growth from the mid- 1990s to the late 2000s that earned it the \u2018Celtic Tiger\u2019 moniker, Ireland was hit hard by the global financial crisis beginning in 2008 that ultimately required an EU and International Monetary Fund-led bailout followed by years of fiscal austerity. Fast forward to 2018. Ireland\u2019s strong economic perform- ance gives little hint of the past crisis and is among the best in Europe. Its GDP expanded by 7.8 % last year, mak- ing it the EU\u2019s fastest-growing economy in 2017. And its unemployment rate, at 5.9 % in April 2018, is well below the EU average. With the low-tax environment attracting a large number of multinationals, the industrial sector dominates Ireland\u2019s economy, totalling 38.9 % in 2016. Wholesale and retail trade, transport, accommodation and food-service activities are also important contributors. For example, Ireland\u2019s agri-food exports exceeded EUR 1 billion per month for the first time in 2017, according to the Irish Food Board, with the UK being its most valuable market. Overall, intra-EU trade accounts for 51 % of Ireland\u2019s exports, with the UK and Belgium tied as top partners at 13 % each. As for imports, 68 % come from within the EU, with the UK ranked first at 29 %. Given the volume of trade between the two countries and their geographical proximity, Ireland is among those EU nations most affected by the UK\u2019s decision to leave the Euro- pean Union \u2013 and is therefore overshadowed by uncertainties regarding the ramifications of Brexit. Investing in innovation and competitiveness Cohesion funding continues to play an important role in the development of Ireland\u2019s economy. For the 2014-2020 period, the country will receive up to EUR 3.4 billion in support from European Structural and Investment (ESI) Funds and an esti- mated EUR 2.6 billion \u2013 or 79 % of the total \u2013 had already been allocated to projects by the end of last year. These ESI Funds, in particular the European Regional Develop- ment Fund (ERDF), are helping Ireland address key challenges to inclusive growth and convergence. This includes prioritising 32 Samuel Beckett bridge, Dublin ",
        "public and private investment in innovation \u2013 especially in small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) seen as lagging behind Ireland-based multinationals \u2013 as well as fostering the development of new products and services by supporting cooper ation between Irish companies and research institutes. This is particularly pertinent amid Brexit ambiguity and risks since boosting the competitiveness of businesses could lead to new, alternative markets for Irish products. Against this backdrop, 35 % \u2013 the largest allocation \u2013 of ERDF co-investment for Ireland is going towards research, technological development and innovation (RTDI). This focus has already paid off on multiple fronts. Results include the creation of 3 400 new jobs in ERDF-supported businesses and financial co-investment support for 35 000 businesses. Seventy new start-ups and spin-offs were founded following the active involvement of 900 businesses with co-funding strategic research centres. Meanwhile, some 860 new researchers are working towards innovations that have led to 250 new business licences. Furthermore, the Northern and Western region covered by the ERDF\u2019s BMW programme was chosen as a European Entrepreneurial Region for 2018. The Commission\u2019s 2018 Country Specific Recommendations for Ireland suggested action be taken to foster the produc- tivity growth of Irish firms, in particular that of SMEs, by \u201cstimulating research and innovation with targeted policies, more direct forms of funding and more strategic cooperation with foreign multinationals, public research centres and universities\". These actions would expand on the previous year\u2019s recommendations. The ERDF investments for the 2021-27 funding period would be closely linked to the Euro- pean Semester and Country-Specific Recommendations. The Commission proposal for the 2021-2027 period allows more developed member states like Ireland to invest 85% -100 % of their ERDF allocation to innovation. This would enable a member state who will decide to do so to have a big leap to the future competitiveness.

        "The roll-out of superfast broadband is also an area seeing ERDF co-investment. Once fully in place, the National Broad- band Plan will help overcome connectivity challenges both for SMEs and private citizens by spreading internet access at European Gigabit Society-targeted speeds across some 90 % of the country, which is especially important for the more isolated rural regions. Irish businesses are awaiting access to such a state-of-the- art network since swift and reliable internet is a lifeline and key to growth and international sales via e-Commerce. Cohesion funding is also helping Ireland's transition to a low- carbon economy, with over EUR 120 million in ERDF support. Projects aimed at energy efficiency and cutting greenhouse gases have already progressed well. Furthermore, support is focusing on boosting the Irish working population\u2019s digital skills so as to make them more market- able, a shortfall singled out in the 2018 Country Report for Ireland and in a scoreboard linked to the European Pillar of Social Rights.

Ireland covers 5/6 th of the island and Norther Ireland (part of the United Kingdom) covers the rest. Dublin is the capital and largest city in Ireland with an urban population of 1.11 million. Economy According to new European Commission estimates, Ireland\u2019s economy grew by 7.8 % in 2017, three times faster than the wider euro area. Its economic prospects remain bright, although risks have heightened: real GDP rose by 7.4 % year on year and is expected to further increase by 4.4 % in 2018 and 3.1 % in 2019. In its latest quarterly outlook, the business and employers\u2019 group (IBEC) predicts growth of 4.2 % in 2018, considered strong enough to withstand any negative effects from Brexit-related uncertainty. Labour market Hitting 5.9 % in April 2018, Ireland\u2019s unemployment rate is well below the EU average. In January 2018, the government announced reforms to link funding of higher education insti- tutions to delivering key national priorities, including better alignment to skills needs in the economy, higher levels of performance and innovation, expansion of research; particu- larly with enterprise partners, better access for students at a disadvantage, and improving lifelong and flexible learning opportunities. These measures will further back ERDF and ESF 2014-2020 policies and targets in the country. 34 ",
        "35 PANORAMA / SUMMER 2018 / No. 65 Key sectors The export sector, led by machinery and equipment, com- puters, chemicals, medical devices, pharmaceuticals, foodstuffs and animal products, is dominated by foreign multinationals which are an important component of the economy. Ireland's agri-food sector is very dependent on the UK market, with over 43 % of Irish agri-food products going to the UK in 2015. Ireland's agri-food exports exceeded EUR 1 billion per month for the first time in 2017. When non-edible products such as forestry are included, total agri-food exports hit EUR 13.5bn in 2017. The dairy sector was the strongest performer with a 19 % surge bringing dairy exports to over EUR 4bn. The beef sector also performed well with export sales up by 5 % to almost EUR 2.5bn. Smart specialisation, research and innovation Ireland is a strong innovator with smart specialisation priorities in: manufacturing and industry; information and communication technologies; energy production and dis- tribution; human health and social work; and key enabling technologies. Further public expenditure in RTDI is still needed to make indigenous Irish-owned firms more dynamic and innovative and thus more competitive in the global market place. Fur- thermore, they must identify alternative new markets to compensate for the Brexit fallout. The ERDF OPs are currently co-investing 35 % in RTDI, its largest share of allocation from its total 2014-2020 co-investment in Ireland. (cid:107) PANORAMA / SUMMER 2018 / No. 65 ! !! ! !

        "39 In 2018, Ireland celebrates 45 years of EU membership. How has the country evolved over this time, and what role have the ERDF and ESF played in that development? Ireland is an extremely proud and very committed member of the European Union. When we joined the EU on 1 Janu- ary 1973, our GDP was just 67 % of the EU average. It is now almost 180 % and we have moved from being a net benefi- ciary to a net contributor to the EU budget. At the time of joining the EU, Ireland\u2019s trade and industry policy had, for dec- ades, been predicated on protectionism and self-sufficiency. These inward- looking policies resulted in poor eco- nomic growth, high unemployment and mass emigration. Ireland is now very outward looking. The UK is still one of our most important trading partners, accounting for over 13 % of goods exported with 52 % of exports going to the other EU Member States and nearly 27 % of our exports going to the USA. Ireland is the fourth largest exporter of financial services in the EU, 15 of the top 20 global banks are based in Ireland, and Irish-based aviation lessors manage the equivalent of 26 % of the world\u2019s global air fleet here. While we have certainly experienced challenges in the past decade, with the banking crisis and associated reces- sion, the Irish economy is now in a strong position. We have the highest GDP growth in Europe at 7.8 % for 2017, and our unemployment rate is now 5.9 % (April 2018). Of course, all of this is not solely due to EU membership. However, membership, including Cohesion Policy\u2019s important contribution over the years, has brought many opportunities to Ireland and has been a major contributory factor to our economic and social progress. Building on the past to prepare for challenges in the future Paschal Donohoe, Irish Minister for Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform, tells Panorama how Ireland has benefited from its EU membership and is ready to make further commitments to show EU citizens how the Union is bringing added value and working for them.

        "40 This economic metamorphosis has trans- lated into better lives for our citizens. They enjoy a higher standard of living, our workers are protected by robust employ- ment laws, food safety regulation pro- tects our families, and we are improving and protecting the environment for future generations. The latest Eurobarometer figures (May 2018) show that 81 % of Irish people believe Ireland\u2019s membership of the EU is a good thing, compared to the 60 % EU average. And 74 % of people in Ireland are satisfied with how democ- racy works in the EU, while 62 % believe things in the EU are going in the right direction (32 % EU average). Structural Funds have played an import ant role in Ireland, as they now do in our newer Member States. For example, EU funding has been crucial for upgrading critical physical infra- structure, and has also underpinned investment in education and training and research, development and innova- tion, which we have always prioritised. The EU has played a very significant political role in the Peace Process in Northern Ireland. Since 1995, successive PEACE Programmes have collectively contributed EUR 2.26 billion to the econ- omies of Northern Ireland and the Bor- der Counties of Ireland (Cavan, Donegal Leitrim, Louth, Monaghan and Sligo). This programme supports projects which help to reconcile communities and build a shared future. Since 1991, suc- cessive Interreg programmes have col- lectively contributed EUR 1.13 billion to the econ omies of Northern Ireland, the Border Region of Ireland and, since 2007, Western Scotland. Both of these programmes are important drivers of regional development in a cross-border context. Structural Funds support for the two programmes is not only an important source of funding but is also a key element of the EU\u2019s continuing commitment to building peace and reconciliation. In what ways has Ireland\u2019s use of EU funds changed in response to changes in your economy and society? In the past, Ireland benefited signifi- cantly from the Structural Funds but these have been steadily declining as our economy has grown: for example, from EUR 5.4 billion for the 1994-1999 programming period to EUR 1.2 billion in the 2014-2020 round. Previously, this investment was heavily weighted towards physical infrastructure and helped fund major projects such as five major inter-urban motorways, the Dub- lin Port Tunnel, completion of the M50 orbital route, and support for several large-scale public transport projects, including Dublin\u2019s suburban rail and tram systems. However, alongside this spending on physical capital, substantial investment was also directed towards developing human capital through edu- cation and training, upskilling workers and promoting research capabilities. Reflecting the changing nature of both the Irish and the global economy, Ireland\u2019s ERDF co-investment spending for 2014- 2020 is now focused on projects primarily in the area of research and innovation, ICT, the digital economy, support for SME competitiveness, and the transition to a low-carbon economy, while the ESF is continuing to invest in people through education and training. These invest- ments will help create sustainable jobs, stimulate global exports and underpin economic growth. Additional funding opportunities will continue to arise under the Horizon 2020 and its successor programme, Erasmus, Connecting Europe, COSME EU-level programmes and a number of other smaller programmes. Ireland is perceived to have benefited greatly from EU funding in the past and, in recent years, from ERDF co-investment in research and innovation and SME competitiveness. Are the results from such investments in line with your expectations? Does this need still exist? What are the main opportunities for Ireland? Over the years, Ireland has benefited substantially from EU support, and has used the funds efficiently and effectively. In terms of areas of spending, the focus has moved away from support for phys- ical, infrastructural investments to sup- porting research, innovation and the development of SMEs, reflecting greater global competitiveness and the rapid rate of change. Ireland's current research target is to raise gross (public and private) investment in research and innovation (R&I) to 2.5 % of GNP by 2020. Notwithstanding increases in both public and private spending in recent years, including support from EU co- investments, we have yet to reach this target. This is partly due to the strength of our economic performance and sub- sequent increases in GNP growth rates year-on-year in recent years. Both the IMF and the EU have highlighted the level of public investment in R&I as part of their Country Specific Recommenda- tions which means that ongoing and increased support remains a key priority post-2020. Scientific and technological progress is accelerating, and we are competing in an ever-changing and intensely competitive global environment. Keeping pace with the relentless nature of change will necessitate greater R&I funding and support to ensure that Irish businesses are at the cutting edge.

        "41 PANORAMA / SUMMER 2018 / No. 65 global players, anticipating and leading the next-generation technologies and scientific breakthroughs. For Ireland, there are real opportunities. In terms of our performance in pharma- ceuticals, ICT, or financial services we are building on a solid foundation. We are focusing on capability building for the next generation of disruptive change, leveraging artificial intelligence, assisting firms to identify and target new market opportunities, and keeping our research and technology centres at the leading edge of change. In this area, ERDF support will remain an important funding component going forward. EU Member States are not competing with each other now, but rather are all oper- ating in an intensely competitive and mobile global market place. What are your hopes for the next ESIF funding period 2021-2027, and what do you see as the main challenges for Ireland? There can be no doubt that the next round of Cohesion Policy is being formu- lated during a period of significant challenges for Ireland and Europe as a whole, including matters such as Brexit, migration, security and terrorism. Ireland believes that the level of expend- iture at EU level will need to be proportion- ate and appropriate to the overall levels of available funding and that the post- 2020 MFF priorities and objectives need to be framed in this context. As I said ear- lier, Ireland recognises and greatly values our EU membership. As a net contributor, Ireland is open to paying more into the EU budget. However, I believe that while we must be prepared to adapt to the EU\u2019s evolving priorities and challenges, we must not lose sight of the value and con- tribution of traditional policies, including agriculture and cohesion. With regard to the challenges facing Ireland, Brexit is a significant issue, as acknowledged by our colleagues in Europe. We are very grateful for their support in the negotiations, a tangible demonstration of the ongoing strength and unity of the EU-27. Apart from the very important issues of trade, and the phys ical challenges, we also have unique and sensitive historical ties with our nearest neighbour. This is reflected in the complexity of the negotiations on the border between Ireland and Northern Ireland. Therefore, it is very important that there is a continuation of investment pro- grammes such as ERDF, but also PEACE and INTERREG post-Brexit. I believe that no Member State should be dispropor- tionately disadvantaged by the impact of the decision taken by the UK to leave the EU. It is important that the EU uses all the tools available, including Cohesion Policy, to demonstrate practical solidarity and support for all regions that are espe- cially affected by externally imposed challenges, including Brexit. As a small, open economy. Ireland is somewhat vulnerable to external eco- nomic shocks. But the threats and opportunities are perhaps two sides of the same coin. By anticipating and responding to the next generation of innovations, meeting sophisticated and diverse consumer needs, continu- ing to penetrate new, emerging markets and remaining competitive, we can better weather a downturn in one of our trading areas. For the next period of ESIF funding, I sin- cerely hope that everything practical is done to ensure that the delivery of the policy on the ground is made as simple and as easy as possible. In so doing, we will help to deliver greater efficiencies for EU taxpayers and generate more posi- tive outcomes on the ground. This dem- onstrates real European added value in a very visible way, and shows EU citizens that the Union is working for them. Recognising the value of our EU member- ship, Ireland is open to paying more into the EU budget \u2013 as long as this brings additional European value. I look forward to working closely with colleagues in other Member States and in the Euro- pean Commission and Parliament to improve policies and ensure adequate resource allocations in the coming years. This is a collective effort in which Ireland, mindful of our history of successful membership of the EU, stands ready and eager to fully play our part.

The 1998 reform saw an important shift from project-based financing to the programming approach, with a stronger role for national and regional authorities. Since 1988, there have been important advances in the construction of the European Union. Under the four multiannual EU budget cycles (programming periods), the scope and scale of EU funding dedicated to addressing economic, social and territorial disparities has also evolved. I n April 2018, the Commission published the most compre- hensive historical record of the EU budget payments from the European Regional Development Fund and Cohesion Fund to the Member States and NUTS-2 regions. What questions does the information answer and how can it be used? First and foremost, the data provides the answer to that deceptively simple question: \u201cHow much has my region/ country received under regional policy?\u201d The answer is now available thanks to the harmonised presentation of annualised EU payments made by NUTS-2 regions since 1988.

        "44 Good governance for Cohesion Policy How important is good governance for Cohesion Policy investments? What are the main challenges Member States and regions are facing in this area and how can they tackle them better? T hese were the main questions asked of politicians, deci- sion-makers, researchers and practitioners during the conference \u2018Good governance for Cohesion Policy\u2019, organ- ised by the Commission\u2019s Directorate-General for Regional and Urban Policy in Brussels on 24 May 2018. All the speakers agreed that good governance, strong and well-performing administrations and a positive business environment are essen- tial ingredients for every successful public policy. This is also evidenced by recent studies and reports, ranging from the Commission\u2019s 7 th Cohesion Report to the latest World Bank and OECD studies. Good administration and sound management are also key to the success of Cohesion Policy as the EU\u2019s main investment policy. In her keynote speech, the OECD\u2019s Deputy Secretary General Mari Kiviniemi said: \u201cGetting this investment right, at a time of reduced public investment in the European Union, is particularly critical\u201d. Speaking on behalf of the Bulgarian Presidency of the Council of the EU, Deputy Prime Minister Tomislav Donchev highlighted the transfer of knowledge between the EU and the national administrations, as well as among the administrations them- selves. \u201cCohesion Policy changes everyone for the better. It is not only an investment process; it is a learning process for administrations at all levels, as the management of the EU funds brings about a new mentality, culture and habits.\u201d The Commission plays an important role as a promoter and facilitator. At the start of the conference, Commissioner for Environment, Maritime Affairs and Fisheries Karmenu Vella mentioned the initiatives already under way to improve governance and accountability in EU funds. All other speakers, including Slovakia\u2019s Deputy Prime Minister Richard Ra\u0161i, Portugal\u2019s Minister of Planning and Infrastruc- ture Pedro Marques, Poland\u2019s Minister for Investment and Development Jerzy Kwieci\u0144ski, President of the Committee of the Regions Karl-Heinz Lambertz and European Parliament Member Constanze Krehl agreed that for Cohesion Policy to be effective, it should rely even more on transparency and citizen engagement, highly skilled professionals, led by strong and forward-looking leadership and working in a stable insti- tutional and regulatory environment. A further priority is to include and empower all actors involved: social partners, education and research institutions, public companies and civil society organisations. In his closing remarks, Director-General of DG REGIO Marc Lemaitre set out the Commission\u2019s vision for the central role of good governance and sound administrative capacity, and anticipated some of the important new initiatives in the newly proposed framework aimed at incentivising Member States and regions to step up their efforts. These include simplified and targeted use of technical assistance, strategic ",
        "45 and comprehensive roadmaps with financial incentives linked to the results achieved, and lighter controls for those programmes where management and control works well. To test and develop solutions for the post-2020 framework, the Commission has also selected five Cohesion Policy pro- grammes to take part in a new pilot action on administrative capacity. The Transport Infrastructure, environment and sus- tainable development programme in Greece, the Lubelskie regional programme in Poland, the Extremadura regional programme in Spain, the Competitiveness and cohesion programme in Croatia, and the Regions in Growth programme in Bulgaria will receive tailored support from the Commission and the OECD to improve the management of EU-funded programmes in the new budget framework. Below we have selected three other initiatives with exam- ples showing how TAIEX-REGIO PEER 2 PEER, Integrity Pacts and the EU Competency Framework are contributing towards better governance and effective investments on the ground.

        "46 LEARNING TO SHARE KNOWLEDGE AND GOOD PRACTICE The TAIEX-REGIO PEER 2 PEER expert exchange system provides a platform for administrations in EU Member States to exchange experiences on Cohesion Policy. It helps public officials responsible for European Regional Develop- ment Fund (ERDF) and Cohesion Fund (CF) investments to share knowledge and good practice with their Member State counterparts during expert missions, study visits and workshops. National or regional administrations can request support on any topic directly related to ERDF/CF. Areas covered in previous exchanges range from urban development, waste manage- ment, and energy efficiency to topics such as innovation and fraud prevention. TAIEX-REGIO PEER 2 PEER is open to public administrations managing ERDF and CF funding, including managing author- ities, intermediate bodies, audit, certifying and coordinating authorities and joint secretariats for European territorial cooperation programmes. Insight into rural revival In May 2017, delegates from the Spanish regions of Aragon, Castile and Leon, and Castilla-La Mancha, Evrytania in Greece and the Croatian County of Lika-Senj visited the Highlands and Islands Enterprise (HIE) in Scotland in the United Kingdom. The aim was to look at solutions found by the Scottish government development agency to reverse depopulation and create sustainable local economic growth in the remote Highlands and Islands region. All the regions participating in the exchange face similar challenges: located in some of the most sparsely populated areas in the EU, and dealing with an ageing population, depopulation and economic stagnation. Overall, the visit gave participants a wealth of experience and tools they can use to improve their economies and quality of life in regions affected by depopulation trends. They are now exploring opportunities for future partnerships and have drafted a report \u2018Successfully Combatting Rural Depopulation through a New Model of Rural Development: The Highlands and Islands Enterprise Experience\u2019, to spark debate across the EU. \u201cThrough TAIEX- REGIO PEER 2 PEER, we received exhaustive information about the daily work of a public organisation responsible for the social and economic development of the Highlands and Islands region which has previously faced the challenges related to depopulation and stagnation. It has, without doubt, made possible a wide range of future joint initiatives between regions with similar demographic challenges.\u201d Joaqu\u00edn Palac\u00edn Eltoro, Director General of Territorial Planning, Government of Aragon Ainsa in the foothills of the Spanish Pyrenees in Aragon ",
        "47 PANORAMA / SUMMER 2018 / No. 65 INTEGRITY PACTS Corruption has important economic and social costs. Public procurement is often perceived as a corruption hot spot. To improve transparency and efficiency in public contracting for EU-funded projects and increase the effectiveness of EU investment on the ground, the Commission and Transpar- ency International (TI) are promoting Integrity Pacts. The initiative, launched in 2015, helps to better protect EU taxpayers' money and enhance accountability and trust in public authorities. The \u2018Integrity Pacts \u2013 Civil Control Mechanism for Safeguard- ing EU Funds\u2019 pilot project brings together public authorities, the private sector and civil society. An IP is a legally binding agreement between a contracting authority, bidders and an independent civil society monitor who oversees its implementation and ensures all parties respect their commitments. It aims to strengthen transpar- ency and accountability, reinforce trust and reputation, save money and intensify competition through better procure- ment. Beyond the obvious benefits, IPs can also trigger institutional changes, such as greater digitalisation, sim- plification of burdensome administrative procedures, a bet- ter regulatory environment and improved governance and administrative services. In total, 17 projects co-financed by the EU were selected to pilot Integrity Pacts in 11 EU Member States. They cover a wide range of sectors from research and innovation to environment and culture, from transport and territorial development to institutional building and healthcare. In addition, TI and the partner civil society organisations are providing training on anti-corruption, transparency and capacity building to those involved in the IPs.

        "48 FRAMEWORK FOR BETTER PERFORMANCE Bodies involved in administering the European Regional Development Fund and Cohesion Fund can now call on a free- to-use resource to help them boost staff performance. The EU Competency Framework can be used to identify the skills and knowledge employees need to successfully manage EU funds. It is available for national coordinating bodies, managing, certifying and audit authorities, joint secretariats and intermediate bodies. A complementary web-based self-assessment tool allows employees to rate their own levels of proficiency and compare them with their supervisor\u2019s assessment and development goals laid down in the Framework. Administrations can also compile the self-assessments to measure their overall performance and identify areas for improvement. Results from the self-assessments are used to inform a learning and development plan to help employees and the institution fill gaps in their competences. Plans could include classroom-based and on-the-job training, seminars and presentations of good practice for staff, and the recruitment of new talent or outsourcing for greater efficiency. Use of the EU Competency Framework is voluntary and the Commission does not see data or benchmark results. Its website is now available with information in English, and other languages to follow. Administrations can contact DG REGIO to access the tool. \u201cOur Integrity Pact seeks to increase transparency of the procurement process and involve affected communities in the monitoring activities. If we manage to achieve both, we are certain to improve the levels of public trust in Slovenia which are among the lowest in the EU. This can have a positive effect on the participatory and democratic processes and on institutions in general. Not knowing enough about public procurement additionally fuels the distrust \u2013 but we are aiming to overcome this by using the Integrity Pact.\u201d Sebastijan Peterka, project coordinator and researcher, Transparency International Slovenia Keeping hospital renovation on track Corruption in public procurement is a serious issue. Slovenia has previously come under scrutiny, particularly in areas such as infrastructure and healthcare, with hospitals that have been poorly built and furnished with equipment costing more than it should. One of the first IPs signed is tackling these issues head on, providing an overview of the introduction of energy- efficiency measures at Trbovlje General Hospital, near Slovenia's capital Ljubljana. Slovenia\u2019s Ministry of Health is partnering with TI Slovenia to ensure that all parties involved in tendering focus on their social responsibilities to provide a safe, good-quality hospital for staff and patients. TI Slovenia is raising public awareness about the IP and developing procedures to ensure safe reporting for whistle-blowers, whilst contractors are expected to buy into the IP ethos by demonstrating honest business practices. The IP is a continuous learning process: the contract- ing authority is improving its capacity to run complex procedures while TI Slovenia is increasing its capacity to monitor public procurement and its ability to identify risks and irregularities.

        "COHESIFY: giving voice to the regions Does Cohesion Policy have an impact on how citizens perceive and identify with the EU? And how effectively is the policy being communicated to the general public? These and related questions formed the basis of the two-year research project COHESIFY, the final results of which were presented to policymakers, other Cohesion Policy stakeholders and academics on 26 April 2018. T he past decade has seen a steep decline \u2013 and only a slow recovery \u2013 in the number of people who have a positive image of the European Union and trust its institutions. Populist and anti-EU parties are on the rise and the UK has voted to leave the EU altogether. The question is what difference do EU policies make, particularly Cohesion Policy which currently accounts for one third of the EU budget and is implemented at both the local and regional levels. Do people think that European Structural and Investment Funds have a major impact on their everyday lives? This question was a starting point for the COHESIFY project which examined how Cohesion Policy is perceived by citizens in general. The project brought together a multi-disciplinary research team \u2013 led by the European Policies Research Centre (University of Strathclyde, Glasgow) \u2013 which included eight universities and two SMEs. The team applied an innovative methodological approach by combining case studies in 17 pilot regions across 12 Member States, stakeholder inter- views and surveys, a large-scale telephone survey of 8 500 citizens, a cross-national media-framing analysis of over 8 000 news articles and more than 110 000 social media posts, as well as 47 focus groups including 240 citizens. According to COHESIFY project director, Professor John Bachtler, of the University of Strathclyde, the main conclusion is that: \u201cCohesion Policy spending and communication make a real dif- ference to how citizens perceive the EU and European integra- tion and the degree to which they identify with the EU. If EU policymakers want to promote regional and local identification with the EU, Cohesion Policy is clearly an effective instrument \u2013 but only if it is properly communicated.\u201d 56 ",
        "57 PANORAMA / SUMMER 2018 / No. 65 What do EU citizens think? The project found clear evidence that Cohesion Policy does have an impact on citizens\u2019 perceptions of the EU and Euro- pean identity. \u201cThe discussions in the focus groups showed that the citizens of the EU have an implicit and cursory know- ledge of Cohesion Policy. Citizens recognise the importance of the Policy for addressing regional disparities and improving the quality of life, but feel they are inadequately informed. They want to have more say on how funds are allocated or governed in their area,\u201d explained Dr Andreja Pegan from Trinity College Dublin during the final event at the European Committee of the Regions in Brussels. While Cohesion Policy often does not have a direct impact on the European identity of EU citizens, many supported the principles of the policy (especially to reduce the differences in economic development). There is also considerable evidence of positive perceptions of the impact of Cohesion Policy on the development of a citizen's region or city. The results of the survey of 8 500 citizens confirms these findings, according to COHESIFY project manager, Dr Carlos Mendez from the University of Strathclyde. \u201cCitizens are aware of the projects funded by the European Regional Development Fund and Cohesion Fund, and the perceived benefits for citizens\u2019 daily lives and for their region\u2019s development contribute significantly to how they identify with the EU.\u201d The project also found that perceptions of the EU and specifically Cohesion Policy are influenced by the scale of funding as well as its performance and good management. Communicating Cohesion Policy The COHESIFY results show the importance of EU spending being regionally and locally differentiated \u2013 and seen by citizens to be addressing the needs and development challenges that really matter to them. At present, citizens feel that they are not suf- ficiently informed about Cohesion Policy, and policy stakeholders acknowledge that communication has not been adequately pri- oritised. Communication strategies should give a higher priority to informing citizens about Cohesion Policy projects so that they appreciate the EU\u2019s contribution to their region\u2019s development. Surprisingly, the researchers found that traditional media (in particular TV) and billboards are among the most-effective communication tools. Social media play a less important role than expected.

        "58 How is Cohesion Policy presented in the media? Another part of the study dealt with the way Cohesion Policy is framed in the media. More than 110 000 media articles as well as posts and comments on social media were analysed. Dr Vasiliki Triga from the Cyprus University of Technology explained: \u201cIndeed, Cohesion Policy frames overall are positive since the two dominant frames describe the positive economic effects of Cohesion Policy for Member States as well as the dominant impact on the citizens\u2019 quality of life.\u201d The analysis also found territorial differences. Regional media frame Cohesion Policy more positively in terms of eco- nomic consequences in particular, while the national media tend to focus more on negative frames that are critical of the way Cohesion Policy is implemented.

The research shows that Cohesion Policy is effect- ive in promoting positive perceptions and identification with the EU, but there is a need to emphasise decentral- isation rather than centralisation in the governance of EU spending. A key COHESIFY proposal is to introduce a more participatory, citizen-focused approach to the programming and commu- nication of EU funds, which would radically transform citizen engagement and appreciation of both the Cohesion Policy and the EU.

        "60 A major flood defence scheme in the Veneto region of north-eastern Italy has been completed with the help of funding from the European Regional Development Fund. The works, which were instigated after disastrous floods hit the region in 2010, will protect the city of Vicenza and surrounding areas. T he project focused on the construction of an expansion basin capable of holding 3 800 000 m 3 of water adja- cent to the River Timonchio in Caldogno. In the past, when the local river system hit peak flow it exposed Vicenza, nearby Padua and inhabitants of the river valley to the risk of serious flooding. The basin temporarily holds the excess water until river capacity returns to normal. Once the peak level has passed, a discharge system enables the reservoir to be emptied by returning the flood water to the Timonchio. Approximately 85 % of the overall flood volume can be emptied in 12 hours and 100 % in 24 hours. The water-retaining basin on the Timonchio is the centre- piece of a series of interventions protecting the region and which alone will reduce the frequency of flood events in Vicenza by 75 %. Going with the flow The expansion basin was constructed by dividing flood flows into two areas, which allowed the height of the riverside banks to be limited. The overall length of the banks bordering the basin and dividing the two collection areas is 5.2 km, while the entire basin covers around 110 hectares. The works included the construction of sluice-gates and conduits to link the two reservoirs and carry the water from the Timonchio towards the upstream basin. Two emergency spillways were installed, one to connect the upstream basin overflow to send water downstream and the other from the downstream basin to the river. Furthermore, various earthworks were built to level the basin flow and reinforce the river bed and its banks. Based on the results of a study carried out by Italy\u2019s University of Padua, work on the reservoir bottom also involved construc- tion of a 200-metre-wide, non-permeable band behind the south and east reservoir banks to limit the seepage of flood water into the water table. Moreover, as one of the project\u2019s aims was to enable parts of the basin to be cultivated when there is no flooding, the bottom of the reservoir has been reclaimed by restoring a 50-cm layer of topsoil. As well as the Torrente Timonchio basin, work on the main local river course and its tributaries included the construction of two flood-containment systems at the town of Malo. This flood- defence project was completed in 2016 and forms part of a wider set of flood-mitigation measures across the Veneto region, including the construction of 10 other expansion basins.

        "61 In 2013, in France, the launch of the OISE THD programme moved the region to the next level in high-speed telecommunications by paving the way for the provision of ultra-high-speed coverage to homes via fibre-optic cables. A s part of the Juncker Plan for growth and jobs, the EU\u2019s Digital Agenda acknowledges that Europe needs widely available and competitively priced fast and ultra-fast internet access. France has committed to covering its entire territory with high-speed broadband by 2023, focusing on FTTH technology. The goal of \u2018fibre to the home technology\u2019 is to enhance digital services for the consumer by installing next-generation fibre-optic networks. The French region of Oise, situated north of Paris in the Hauts- de-France, was one of the first French departments to offer a universal service via the TelOise Broadband Programme (2004- 2012). However, the explosion of social networks, ultra-high- definition TV, video on demand, network games, e-commerce and data exchange in business underlined the pressing need for even faster speeds and efficient network connections. Six years ahead of schedule Fibre optics provide for a single connection, without limitation, able to fully support today\u2019s needs and services as well as those predicted for the future. The FTTH network is based on a new local loop built entirely from fibre optics, and replacing the copper telephone wire loop. Initially, the Oise Ultra-High-Speed, which is part of the territor- ial strategy for digital development, was scheduled to end by 2023. However, following four successive periods of accelerated activity, the fibre-optic deployment will be completed by 2019. Relying on the existing telecommunications infrastructure, an additional 10 000 kilometres of fibre-optic cables will be installed both overhead and underground. Ultimately, this will involve implementing 300 000 connections \u2013 to individuals, com- munities or business \u2013 at an estimated cost of EUR 30 million. Unlike other options, the fibre-optic technology guarantees an identical speed to all subscribers, regardless of their geographical location. It offers very high speeds of 100 Mbps (megabits per second) or more, which is 200 times more efficient than ADSL and 4G technology. With issues remaining over coverage and tariffs, 4G still has a long way to go in rural areas in France. Since 2014, 176 324 phone jacks (connectors) have been deployed in Oise. All but three of the region\u2019s 631 municipal- ities have joined the Oise Ultra-High-Speed Joint Association, which relies on the country\u2019s existing infrastructure, including France T\u00e9l\u00e9com, ERDF and TelOise. It is hoped that by opting for ultra-high-speed fibre optics as the digital standard of the future, the department of Oise will be better equipped to face the challenges of competitiveness and attractiveness and will be able to fully benefit from its proactive response to the digital revolution.

        "62 A state-of-the-art residential complex in the municipality of Vratsa has provided a secure living environment for mentally and physically disabled children and teenagers. The innovative facilities have been designed to meet their everyday needs and to closely resemble a family environment. T he aim of the Innovative Residential Alternatives Complex (CSIAR) project was to promote the better social integration of young people suffering from mental or physical disabilities. As part of Bulgaria\u2019s overall strategic childhood framework and Vratsa\u2019s municipal social services strategy, the project was closely aligned to the fundamental objectives of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child. Thanks to a significant investment from the European Regional Development Fund, CSIAR built three family-type accommodation centres and a safe house in the north- western region of Bulgaria. The centres can house up to 50 residents, providing them with shelter and care in a fam- ily environment designed to help combat the stigmatisation these youngsters often have to face. Located in the most densely populated parts of Vratsa, the designers took great care to ensure that all aspects of the accommodation, including the design of the buildings, the landscaping and the facilities, were well adapted to encourage the residents\u2019 social inclusion and participation in community life. Care and attention The resulting homely and harmonious environment also helped to facilitate the young residents\u2019 access to education, health and social services, all of which are specialised and can be adapted to their individual needs. According to Rozalina Georgieva, the project leader: \u201cThe family-type accommodation centres and the safe house mark a radical change in the social services aimed at children and teenagers with mental or physical disabilities. Both of these residential services are an expression of empa- thy and respect for the dignity of the individual regardless of ethnic origin, gender, disability, age or social status.\u201d CSIAR also addressed the Europe 2020 targets for employ- ment. The project created 39 permanent new jobs in one of Europe\u2019s most underdeveloped regions which, in turn, helped to boost development in the area. In future, it is hoped that financial support for the residential complex will be guaranteed either by the Bulgarian state or from municipal funding.
