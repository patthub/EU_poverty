The Road to COP21 Game Changers for European Climate Strategy Issue 09 / 2015 25 November EPSC Strategic Notes The negotiations ahead of the Paris climate conference enter into a critical phase at a dramatic time \u2013 the immediate aftermath of the terrorist attacks on Paris. The European Union can make a difference in paving the way for an ambitious global deal at the 21 st Conference of the Parties (COP21) and build momentum for a paradigm shift towards a low-carbon economy. Progress is within reach and has the potential to be a win-win situation for advanced and emerging economies alike. Above all, Paris is a time when the European Union can lead by example and turn a global climate strategy into a concrete set of EU actions, thereby accelerating Europe\u2019s transition towards a competitive, low-carbon economy. More Than an Agreement Europe\u2019s aim is to adopt a deal, but not any kind of deal. Only an ambitious, robust and binding global climate agreement with a long-term goal can provide a clear signal to all stakeholders and businesses. This should include a dynamic mechanism to take stock and build momentum over time; a common, unified system for tracking progress of all parties involved; an ambitious adaptation policy; and adequate climate finance. A successful outcome in Paris will be a global bedrock to commit governments, markets and the public to tackling climate change. Economic Benefits, Beyond Environment International action to reverse global warming must go beyond environmental business as usual. It is an economic opportunity and a central element in achieving broader sustainable development goals, as well as major priorities like jobs and growth, investment, innovation and energy transition. The EU, as an economic front runner and dynamic society can demonstrate globally that the overall economic benefits from the low-carbon economy can compensate the costs it incurs in certain sectors. Climate Threats to Security and Prosperity Climate change has a pervasive multiplier effect on an increasing set of cross-cutting threats, including environmentally driven conflicts, political instability, extreme poverty, energy security, migration and the reality of climate refugees. The main parameters of a global solution to climate change are similar to other policy areas, be it the intricate interplay between solidarity and responsibility; collective ambition and unity in diversity; interdependence and cooperation; short-term action and long-term perspectives. Broad Engagement and Shared Responsibility National governments are not capable of meeting the climate challenge on their own. The EU has a key role to play, not the least in activating the climate \u2018foot soldiers\u2019 \u2013 citizens, consumers, SMEs, innovative start- ups and globally competitive industries. Embracing the grassroots initiatives currently in the making, the European Commission is uniquely placed to mainstream the fight against climate change through all sectors and levels of governance. This requires scaling up communication efforts to highlight, in particular, the role of citizens and consumers. ",
        "2 EPSC Strategic Notes EPSC Strategic Notes - The Road to COP21 1. Climate Change is the Central Challenge of the 21 st Century Our One and Only Planet The planet we share can no longer cope with the use mankind is making of it. Its atmosphere and climate are changing in ways that will increasingly have a pervasive negative impact on a global scale. The temperature\u2019s variability has intensified more over the last 100 years than in the past 10,000 years . Future climate reality might be heating the world by four degrees or more. The scientific consensus is clear: an increase of more than 2 degrees Celsius would lead to consequences and costs that are excessively high, unpredictable and very unevenly spread across societies. Nature has already started to present us with the bill. Extreme weather events \u2013 like El-Ni\u00f1o, Patricia and others \u2013 have taken place, disrupting livelihoods, destabilising societies, halting development in its tracks, affecting health, and hitting the poorest hardest. Climate change also inflicts massive damage across a wide range of natural disasters, from acidity of oceans and water shortages, to drought on land use or food access. In some parts of the world, climate change is a source of conflict \u2013 control over the remaining water supply can be more strategic than that over an oil refinery. Climate change is increasingly a root cause of large-scale migration and climate refugees are already a reality. If the world does not act swiftly to contain climate change, natural catastrophes will increase in frequency and intensity, further amplifying the root causes of instability and insecurity. How Did We Get Here? Mankind\u2019s ecological footprint exceeds the earth\u2019s capacity by a record margin. Human activity plays a significant role. Greenhouse gas emissions are mainly due to unsustainable consumption patterns since the beginning of the Industrial Revolution, with the global carbon- and resource-intensive model of economic growth exceeding the maximum capacity of our planet. The way products and services are devised, produced, transported, and consumed is not sustainable. In addition, projected growth in the global population and the rise of a new middle class in emerging economies comes with a strong appetite for economic development Source: http://www.oxfordmartin.ox.ac.uk/downloads/commission/Oxford_ Martin_Now_for_the_Long_Term.pdf Energy Increased demand 50% by 2030 (IEA) Security Increased number of conflicts Droughts / agriculture / malnutrition Mitigation and adaption Increased demand 30% by 2030 (IFPRI) floods Food Water Health Migration Climate change 250 000 additional deaths per year aster 2030 (WHO) 200 million environmental migrants by 2050 (IOM) Figure 1: The \u2018Perfect Storm\u2019 Challenge Source: World Energy Outlook, International Energy Agency. 1 9 7 0 1 9 8 0 1 9 9 0 2 0 0 0 2 0 1 0 2 0 1 4 05 10 15 20 25 30 35 1 9 7 5 1 9 8 5 1 9 9 5 2 0 0 5 -2.4 -2.0 -1.6 -1.2 -0.8 -0.40 0.4 Gigatons GtCO 2 -eq EU target: 40% reduction by 2030 Other Buildings Transport Industry Power generation Other energy Other non-energy 2 0 1 0 2 0 2 0 2 0 3 0 2 0 2 5 2 0 1 5 Global CO 2 Emissions By Sector EU Commitment for Greenhouse Gas Emission Reductions at COP21 Figure 2: Emissions by Sector ",
        "3 EPSC Strategic Notes EPSC Strategic Notes - The Road to COP21 and consumption that adds to the stress. One cannot deny anyone the right to develop, to benefit from social welfare, to have decent jobs and to enjoy the consumer society. At the same time, our planet \u2013 our \u2018global commons\u2019 \u2013 cannot cope with the foreseeable global \u2018perfect storm\u2019. We would need at least four planets to sustain our current lifestyle globally. The more we wait, the more we will pay. Back in 2007, a leading analysis estimated that without immediate action, the overall costs and risks of climate change would be equivalent to losing between 1 and 4% of global GDP each year, now and forever. Climate change has drastically intensified since then. If a wider range of factors is taken into account, the estimated damage could rise to 10% of GDP or more. In contrast, the costs of action can be limited to around 1% of global GDP annually if proper adaptation and mitigation policies are in place. Only if we change course now. How Do We Reverse It? Changing course over climate change is not an easy task. The transition to a low-carbon economy demands a fundamental shift in technology, energy, economics, finance and ultimately in society as a whole. Innovation and new technologies are the best instruments to tackle climate change and bring breakthrough solutions for a new, sustainable economy which is low-carbon, circular, shared and hyperconnected. Energy and other carbon-intensive industrial processes are at the forefront of the challenge. However, innovation in energy systems is delayed or obstructed by massive subsidies in fossil fuels technologies rather than clean ones ($452 billion i.e. \u20ac427 billion in fossil fuel subsidies per year). Reforming countries\u2019 subsidies and tax systems to make investment in carbon-intensive assets less attractive throughout the international value chain plays an important role at global level. Purely working on the energy system will not be enough. The resource intensity of materials, products and services in other sectors also has a major impact on energy use, land use and embedded carbon. Without serious decoupling on the resources side, climate objectives are not realistic. The world economy needs to shift away from the carbon-intensive \u2018take, make, dispose\u2019 model. At the heart of corporate social and environmental responsibility, there is a role for long-term investors in the decarbonisation of the economy, in a sweeping reallocation of resources to green finance . Change also comes in the way society is organised. As citizens and consumers, we have important responsibilities in the way we live, move, consume and work. This calls for our awareness and education on the challenges and opportunities offered by the green society and low-carbon economy. Mobility is another prominent part of the answer, particularly with regards to smart cities, where most people live, work and use most of the energy produced. Decarbonising the transport sector in a holistic way would also amount to a major breakthrough, given that it is a sector where greenhouse gas emissions have been increasing in the past two decades. Rural areas cannot be ignored: agriculture and land use are two promising parts of the solution. 2. Costs and Opportunities of the Low-Carbon Economy Recognising Economic and Social Costs As in all economic transitions, the move towards a low-carbon society will entail costs and benefits, winners and losers. Different segments of society, as well as different socio-economic groups, will be impacted differently now and in the long term, and will have a different capacity to respond and adapt. The climate and energy transition carries economic costs for carbon-intensive business models and modes of production, with new economic standards making them more rapidly outdated and underperforming. It also has social costs for those working in carbon-intensive business models. This can lead to market failures and political obstacles (such as appeals from some Note: 2010 data are reference scenario of existing policies. 2030 data are INDC full implementation.

The adjustment costs of phasing in new socio-economic sectors and phasing out others deserve attention and demand an adaptation of policies. However, in the long run, it might be difficult for carbon-intensive sectors to remain competitive. This is particularly true for the future of oil and coal industries. Other sensitive sectors such as steel, aluminium or cement are more likely to economically adapt to the challenge, under the right policy and market conditions for innovation. Some of the perceived losers are rapidly transforming into major winners. For instance, some of the biggest producers of fossil fuels, such as Texas and Norway, are spearheading the deployment of renewable energy and other innovative low-carbon technologies. Highlighting Benefits from the Transition The costs related to the fight against climate change can to a large extent be compensated by the overall benefits for the economy and society . Markets and investors can ensure a return on their investments in low-carbon solutions because investing in sustainability initiatives helps improve economic performance. It is a no-regret option for global competitiveness and innovation. In the next couple of years, the pace of technological change \u2013 ICT and digital in particular \u2013 will bring major breakthroughs in the low- carbon economy. Low-carbon innovation is an engine of resilient economic growth and job-creation. Benefits can also be felt in more \u2018hands-on\u2019 roles like installation, refurbishment and maintenance. There are enormous potential for new global trade in green technology, and European companies should aim to develop and export their innovation ingenuity and know-how. A Boost for a Resilient Energy Union Renewable energy and energy efficiency can deliver the twin goals of cutting emissions and making energy systems more secure, sustainable, robust and reliable, thereby decreasing import dependency on fossil fuels. They represent a win-win opportunity for sustainable jobs and growth at home and trade abroad. The International Energy Agency, which in previous years was betting on a golden age of oil, then gas, then coal, is now making a strong case for renewable energy as the biggest return on investment . In the EU alone, the renewable energy sector caters for the needs of 78 million Europeans. This means one quarter of electricity consumption in 2015. It employs over one million people and generates \u20ac130 billion in turnover, including \u20ac35 billion worth of exports of renewable equipment. EU companies today have the biggest share (40%) of all patents for renewable technologies. In the coming decade , the EU could achieve much more, with renewable investment amounting to \u20ac500 billion and 1.2 million additional jobs. This does not include areas related to energy efficiency, like refitting buildings, which could alone create two million local jobs by 2020. 3. New Political and Economic Momentum on the Road to Paris The World\u2019s Perception Has Changed In the past, climate action has all too often been treated as an offshoot of environmental policy, sometimes deemed less important than economic or social policies , or dealt with as part of domestic policies. This is no longer the case, thanks to the EU and some pioneering countries and non-state actors, which Source: World Energy Outlook, International Energy Agency, 2015 2001- 2005 2006- 2010 2011- 2015 2016- 2020 2021- 2025 2026- 2030 Carbon Capture Storage Coal and oil Gas Nuclear Other renewables Wind and solar Share of generation from wind and solar in final year of period (right axis) -80 -400 40 80 120 160 0 8 16 24 32 GW % Figure 4: EU Energy Production in Transition 150 Regions 424 Investors 10,773 Total Commitments to Action Figure 5: State and Non-State Actors\u2019 Pledges As of 2 December 2015 Sources: http://climateaction.unfccc.int/, Intended Nationally Determined Contributions, UNFCCC 184 Countries 2255 Cities 2025 Companies 184 countries = 95% of emissions and 94% of world population For a more detailed list of pledges, click the figures.

        "5 EPSC Strategic Notes EPSC Strategic Notes - The Road to COP21 have not waited for Paris to take action or make pledges, either individually or collectively. They have shown that the perception of climate change is rapidly shifting from a concern of activist groups to a major social challenge and a business opportunity. Climate and energy policies are now in essence socio-economic policies framed as a systemic challenge for how we produce and consume. Climate action is now also acknowledged as a major strategic foreign policy concern, with implications on a vast number of interrelated issues ranging from development aid and cooperation, to trade, economic diplomacy and security. The world has understood that if it fails on climate, it will fail on many other foreign policy goals. Climate Negotiations Have Changed Too The parameters of international negotiations at COP21 are not the same as in previous climate talks. The Paris deal will be very different in design and substance from the previous Kyoto-like agreement, which covered only advanced economies, or the failed Copenhagen talks which sought binding emission targets for all participating countries. The new model of agreement will build on a wide range of \u2018bottom-up\u2019, tailor-made pledges that can apply to countries but also cities, regions or companies. These proposals are self-prescribed \u2013 rather than imposed \u2013 thereby giving greater ownership and ultimately better chances for success in achieving ambitious mitigation efforts. Institutionally, the post- 2020 architecture will consist of so-called Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDCs), a true policy innovation in governance that promises to exponentially increase impact. There are very encouraging signs of change from other parties. High levels of political will to fight climate change in a new agreement in Paris is evident . Recent statements by Presidents Obama and Xi Jinping, UN Secretary General Ban-Ki Moon and Pope Francis, as well as by EU leaders as a block, are translating into concrete pledges and commitments. The EU made a clear A Global Deal at COP21, But Not Just Any Kind of Deal The French COP21 presidency together with EU\u2019s chief negotiator at the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), has generated unprecedented support for a high level of ambition in Paris. For all the political pleas and rhetoric at the moment, the outcome of Paris COP21 will have to be not just any deal. Europe\u2019s priority is to adopt an ambitious, robust and binding global climate agreement. For that to happen, key priorities stand out: \u2022 A long-term goal is the only way to provide a clear signal to all stakeholders and businesses about governments\u2019 commitment to the transition to low greenhouse-gas emissions. This goal has to be operational, clear, and in line with science: limiting to 2 degrees Celsius by the end of the century, meaning at least 50% emission reduction by 2050 compared to 2010 levels. And all countries without exception should set out their individual pathways (Intended Nationally Determined Contribution \u2013 INDC) to reduce their own emissions over time. \u2022 A dynamic mechanism to take stock and strengthen ambition over time. The international community must have a clear idea of the aggregate effort and where it stands with regard to the below two degrees Celsius objective compared to pre-industrial levels. There will be a gap between what countries are putting on the table for Paris and what science requires. That is why countries should come together every five years to strengthen emissions targets in light of the latest science to date. INDCs must also be backed by binding multilaterally agreed rules on transparency and accountability and a common, unified system for tracking progress on all Parties\u2019 contributions and emissions targets. \u2022 An ambitious adaptation policy with adequate climate finance . As the climate has already started to change and impacts drastically on some countries, a collective solution must be found to protect societies and help them adapt and develop, in particular those poorer developing countries who have very few emissions and who are the most vulnerable to their effects. Post-industrial countries have to mobilise $100 billion in a Green Climate Fund annually by 2020, both in public and private funding. The international community as a whole should also commit to adequate climate finance as the basis for an ambitious long-term adaptation policy to help vulnerable countries and societies cope with the negative effects of climate change. This might open the door to a wide range of specific requests from various countries who feel the effects of climate change very differently. ",
        "6 EPSC Strategic Notes EPSC Strategic Notes - The Road to COP21 pledge back in March 2015: a binding, economy-wide emissions-reduction target of at least 40% by 2030, compared to 1990 levels. This is the most ambitious contribution to date. The contributions have not just come from the biggest emitters \u2013 including China, the US and the EU \u2013 but also from some of the most vulnerable countries in Africa, the Caribbean and the Pacific. Overall, an increasing number of around 184 countries have made pledges (INDCs), so far covering almost 95% of global emissions. Last but not least, G20 countries, representing 75% of emissions, are committed to strong and effective action. Taken together, this is four times the percentage of global emissions covered by the current second commitment period to the Kyoto Protocol where only 35 industrialised countries have targets . Time is Now Pressing Political momentum is not yet translating into progress among climate change negotiators in the formal United Nations negotiations, where the positions of some countries remain entrenched in particular issues. Overall, there is still a discrepancy between political and technical-only negotiations, which allows some parties to avoid committing too far at political level and others to fill the vacuum and take the political lead. The main firewalls between apparent and non-apparent international coalitions are still the differentiation between emerging and post-industrial nations over the scope of pledges, technology transfer, comprehensive adaptation policies and financing, both public and private. Climate finance could make or break the deal. These issues must be clarified in the final text . Without a strong signal from Heads of States and Governments, and commitments from their negotiating teams, things will not change at the pace and with the scope that is needed now. European leaders, such as Angela Merkel, who was Minister for the Environment at the time of Kyoto, have consistently led the campaign for an ambitious climate deal and should continue to do so following their early commitments. 4. Game Changers for EU Climate Strategy Acting as a Bloc with Solidarity and Responsibility Climate change is one area where European unity can really make a difference \u2013 both for EU action abroad and for EU policies at home. A collective European target and INDC remains the best way for Member States to be protected, encouraged and assisted by the EU in developing their action to fight climate change and invest in the low- carbon economy. The EU and Member States have every interest in consolidating their pledges and aggregating their financial commitments in order to reach critical mass. This is already the practice in the field of development, cooperation and assistance. This is why the EU needs to have a complete, clear and coherent overview of all its commitments and instruments related to climate finance. The Addis Ababa agreement on Finance for Development adopted in July 2015 shows that this is a successful strategy, with the EU remaining the world\u2019s largest aid donor. Where the EU stands united, it delivers. First-Mover Advantage in Low-Carbon Economy Front runners have a decisive advantage in a competitive low-carbon economy.

        "7 EPSC Strategic Notes EPSC Strategic Notes - The Road to COP21 example, based on strong and increasing commitments to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and a unique Energy Union regulatory framework. Politically, the EU has been able to bring about a real and irreversible convergence of the 28 national climate and energy policies, models and systems that is unique worldwide. Economically, the EU carbon market remains the biggest in the world, despite some complexity and inefficiencies in the system. It has built a solid experience and expertise in combatting climate change as a policy entrepreneur, showing the benefits to be gained from early action and leadership in the development and deployment of low-carbon technologies. EU laws and actions have succeeded in decoupling emissions from economic growth. Since 1990, EU GDP increased by 46% while emissions decreased by 23%. The EU\u2019s obligations under the Kyoto Protocol up to 2010 were met and even exceeded (8% promised and 18% reduced). And the European commitment to a 20% emissions reduction by 2020 has already been achieved in 2015. As a consequence, the EU\u2019s role as a major global emitter is declining while emissions from other developed and emerging countries are relatively rising. Mainstreaming Climate Change To retain its comparative advantage in the low-carbon economic competition, the EU needs to do better at home. And in order to address increasing greenhouse gas emissions at their source, it needs to reach out further and extend its global climate action abroad. For the EU to remain the leading continent in the fight against climate change, it needs to intensify the interactions between mutually reinforcing policies, strategies, and instruments that go beyond the scope of climate and energy regulation, internally and externally. The EU will have to show strengthened leadership in mainstreaming climate change in all policies and sectors. As an economic front runner and dynamic society, the EU must focus on efficient methods, pragmatic action and concrete projects around five main areas: \u2022 catalysing the systemic organisation of our societies; \u2022 boosting investments in low-carbon and economic modelling; \u2022 planning budgets and other financial instruments; \u2022 designing markets and new technologies; \u2022 and developing international partnerships. The EU also needs to strike a new balance between its role as a better regulator and a system facilitator for jobs, growth and fairness . Climate Diplomacy The pervasive multiplier effect of climate change on the world\u2019s people, society and economy has deep implications for EU external policy making . The EU\u2019s global climate action needs to engage in an increasing set of cross-cutting issues \u2013 including migration, political instability and energy insecurity \u2013 in an integrated and holistic way. European Climate Diplomacy needs to accelerate engagement with traditional allies from Africa, Least Developed Countries, and small islands. Reassurances of continued but realistic support from the EU would help in forging coalitions with these groups. The EU, which for good reasons remains deeply attached to its tradition of multilateralism, also needs to adapt to the current \u2018bilateralisation\u2019 of relations between other major emitters on climate action such as the US, China, India, Brazil, Saudi Arabia and Russia. International Cooperation Climate action applies to us all. The world needs more unity in the fight against climate change. As a minor emittor in the world, the EU has no alternative but to engage with others. And it is not just about financial support. It is about international cooperation based on common values and articulated around shared interests. Beyond coordination of what everyone is doing in its own backyard, the only way forward is cooperation. A source of inspiration lies in the new spirit of universality put forward in the United Nations Sustainable Development Agenda for 2030. It means fair participation, solidarity and interdependence. It implies that all parties, including the EU, have to accept that other committed actors may have different options and other policy tools at their disposal to achieve their respective climate pledges.

        "8 EPSC Strategic Notes EPSC Strategic Notes - The Road to COP21 Further Engagement with Civil Society The European Union needs to more clearly demonstrate its capacity to directly engage with civil society and business communities . It means calling for a collective answer, rather than fuelling the negative approach of naming and shaming, as well as further embracing many of the grassroots initiatives being taken so far in the civil society. Working with all actors at all levels \u2013 national, regional and local \u2013 is the best way to boost the climate and energy transition on the ground. It would also be worth considering a major EU business initiative on climate. As the example of US companies shows, the business community can move ahead without waiting for the perfect regulatory framework to be in place, either at global or national level. Comprehensive and Tangible Communication The communication challenge ahead for EU leaders over climate change is to explain to all citizens and stakeholders what these negotiations are all about, what is expected from them, and eventually, why Paris and the process it will launch can be a success. The right tone should be found between idealism and realism, given that even with the best deal reached in Paris, serious work will remain afterwards. Ahead of the global competition over announcing the most ambitious pledges, the European Union would need to show in a most compelling way that it has top-level political leadership for future generations. This requires dynamic and interactive ways of communicating, supported by tangible evidence, to show that the EU is not just talking about the issue but also legislating on it. EU leaders should further invest in education and information campaigns for citizens on the scale of the climate challenge and how it affects all of us. Intelligence, Monitoring and Reporting A solid international, European, and national climate policy cannot be built without the necessary economic and technical intelligence to underpin it through shared information, collective monitoring, and common assessment of progress. It is the only way to ensure that INDCs, legislations, strategies and spending programmes perform effectively. It is also the basis for simplification, performance-enhancement and cost- effectiveness of sound economic governance. The EU needs to be better equipped with its own capacity to compile up-to-date accurate climate and energy statistics into one multi-dimensional indicator, to measure both internal and international developments. This would be comparable, for instance, to the way gross domestic product is measured. The EU could take a major initiative on these particular dimensions in full interaction with key international bodies, financial stakeholders, and other non-governmental organisations. Conclusion If Paris delivers after 20 years of UN climate negotiations, humanity will, for the first time, reconcile the economy, society and the environment into one inclusive climate project. It can provide fair and sustainable development for all, improving the quality of life of all citizens, old and young, rich and poor. It is also addressing one of the root threats to security and prosperity. We have but one planet: one common good, one common home. Without it, the world will forgo all benefits from the low-carbon society - ultimately, there would only be losers. The fight against climate change will not be won or lost in diplomatic discussions in Paris. It will be won or lost on the ground, both within and outside the EU. No country or region of the world will succeed alone. All will have to do their job. But even if all Intended Nationally Determined Contributions announced on the road to Paris would be implemented, it is estimated that the planet would be on a three degrees Celsius trajectory.
