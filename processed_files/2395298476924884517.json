        "EN 3 EN In the light of Europe's 2020 energy and climate goals, political leaders committed in 2007 to reduce by 20% 1 the EU's primary energy consumption compared to a projection. 2 Ahead of Member States' political endorsement, the Commission had already tabled in October 2006 an Action Plan for Energy Efficiency (EEAP 2006) 3 as a first major step towards achieving the 20% energy saving potential. A midterm review of this Action Plan was foreseen to assess the progress achieved. The aim of the following report is to present the progress realized with the implementation of the Action Plan until the end of the third quarter of 2010. It will focus on the ten priority actions put forward by the Commission. Emerging strengths and flaws of the Plan and of its measures will be identified and conclusions will be drawn, serving as valuable input for the new European energy efficiency plan. 1. EEAP 2006: S TRUCTURE AND OBJECTIVE Building on the experience gained with a first Energy Efficiency Action Plan 4 adopted in 2000, the Commission tabled in 2006 a more detailed and all encompassing second Energy Efficiency Action Plan for implementation between 2006 and 2012. The objective of the EEAP 2006 was to \"mobilise the general public and policy-makers at all levels of government, together with market actors, and to transform the internal energy market in a way that provides EU citizens with the globally most energy-efficient infrastructure, buildings, appliances, processes, transport means and energy systems\". It also aimed at encouraging citizens to use energy in the most rational manner. The EEAP is structured into six priority areas covering the main energy-using sectors under which 85 (sub-) measures are grouped. Ten priority actions were selected to be initiated immediately and implemented as soon as possible for maximum effect (see table 1). The portfolio of measures proposed is comprehensive although heterogeneous in terms of \u2022 type (e.g. regulatory, market-based, fiscal, support and information as well as voluntary instruments), \u2022 sectors addressed (buildings, products, services, energy transformation and distribution, transport) \u2022 level of implementation (EU, national, regional, city) and \u2022 stakeholders involved (governments, private sector, citizens). 1 This cost-effective saving potential has been previously estimated by the Commission in its 2005 Green Paper on Energy Efficiency. See COM(2005) 265 final. 2 7224/1/07 REV 1: Presidency Conclusions of the European Council of 8/9 March 2007 3 COM(2006) 545 final 4 COM(2000) 247 final ",
        "EN 4 EN In addition to the sectoral approach, cross cutting issues such as energy related behaviour, financing and international cooperation are addressed. This all-encompassing approach of the Action Plan reflects the complexity of tackling energy efficiency through policies and measures.

It is worth noting, that the Action Plan itself does not aim at reducing energy consumption by 20% in 2020. To the contrary, it states that further action would subsequently be required to reach this goal by 2020. 2. A CHIEVEMENTS IN THE TEN PRIORITY ACTIONS EEAP 2006 defined ten priority actions covering the main energy-using sectors and key horizontal issues. As mentioned in the introduction, this assessment of the EEAP will focus mainly on the achievements in these ten priority actions. The findings presented in this report are mainly based on input provided by COM services. 6 The objective is to provide an appraisal of the progress achieved with the implementation of the priority actions. Quantification will be made wherever possible and meaningful, based on expected impacts calculated in impact assessment analysis. Quantifications will be adjusted as best as possible, based on the observed implementation reality. It is important to understand the quantifications provided as rough estimates which cannot simply be added to give an overall impact. It is proposed to look at the progress made in each priority action separately and to provide an overall assessment of the EEAP's impact based on the energy model PRIMES. 5 SEC(2006) 1174, SEC(2006) 1175 6 Interservice Steering Group on Energy Efficiency and Joint Research Center of the Commission ",
        "EN 5 EN A question into which this assessment will not look further is whether the absolute energy savings realised by energy efficiency gains in buildings, products, cars, etc. could be possibly offset by growing disposable incomes translating inter alia into more products and cars owned, and increases in thermal comfort, leisure activities and travelling distances. This is the so-called \"rebound\" effect. It has been assessed that for most consumer energy services in OECD countries, this effect is unlikely to exceed 30%. 7 As this effect would be relevant for every energy efficiency improvement measure and its order of magnitude depends strongly on the end-use sector, policy makers should in general reflect on it when designing policies, but this aspect will not be taken into account in this evaluation exercise. 2.1. Priority action 1: Making products more energy efficient Households consume approximately a quarter of total final energy and 30% of total electricity. Heating systems, cold appliances (refrigerators and freezers), lighting and water heating systems are responsible for more than half of the electricity consumed in households. 8 Energy consumption can be significantly lowered in a cost-effective way through a set of policies transforming the market towards more energy efficient products. The setting of minimum efficiency and labelling requirements is widely recognized as one of the most effective policy tools in the area of energy efficiency. Against this background, the Action Plan defined as its first priority action for the Commission to update the labelling and energy performance standards for appliances and other energy-using products on the basis of the Labelling and Ecodesign Directives. To this end, the Commission committed to: \u2022 Adopt ecodesign requirements for 14 priority product groups 9 with a view to having all of them approved by the end of 2008 (2.1.1); \u2022 Revise the Framework Directive 92/75/EC on Labelling to reinforce its effectiveness and to upgrade the existing Labelling classifications (2.1.2). The labelling and the setting of minimum energy performance standards for products are complementary policies, i.e. products covered by implementing measures adopted under the Ecodesign Directive are generally mirrored in the implementing measures adopted under the Energy Labelling Directive. This leads to reinforced impacts of the two legal instruments since minimum standards drive out poorly performing energy products from the markets, while labels provide transparency and information to consumers, indirectly encouraging innovation and development of best performers. 2.1.1. Selected eco-design requirements for 14 product groups The Ecodesign Directive (2009/125/EC) provides the framework for setting minimum performance requirements for environmental aspects of energy-using and energy-related products that are placed onto the market. Although products are assessed with a lifecycle perspective, energy consumption during use is generally the main environmental impact of the product. The requirements for each product are set by means of implementing measures 7 UK ERC (2008): The Rebound Effect: an assessment of the evidence for economy-wide energy savings from improved energy efficiency. 8 Bertoldi, P. and Atanasiu, B.

        "EN 6 EN adopted by the Commission assisted by a regulatory committee (pre-Lisbon legislation). Implementing measures are Commission regulations which are directly applicable and do not require transposition into national law. National authorities are responsible for market surveillance. These authorities verify that all products (including imports) placed on the market and/or put into service meet the specific ecodesign requirements for that product. The implementing measures seek to target both manufacturers and consumers, by promoting better product design that will result in improved environmental performance, lower energy consumption, and ultimately lower costs. Thus, the individual measures either directly or indirectly affect all EU citizens as well as virtually all EU industry or retail sectors through the design, manufacture, sale and use of products covered by the requirements. The original Ecodesign Directive (2005/32/EC) has been transposed by all Member States and the transposition of its 2009 recast will necessitate a mere adaptation of national law. As it stands today, the implementation of the Ecodesign Directive is progressing well. In line with the requirements defined in priority action 1 of the EEAP, implementing regulations have been adopted in 9 of the selected 14 priority groups, covering domestic, industrial and commercial appliances. The expected savings achieved by the implementation of the Ecodesign Directive and its implementing measures in 2010 are negligible. This is due to the fact that the ecodesign measures are largely starting to enter into effect from 2010 onwards and will then take some years for their effect to be felt fully (as existing products are replaced during their normal life- cycles). Nonetheless, some products meeting ecodesign requirements will already be on the market in advance of mandatory implementation dates, delivering environmental benefits. It should be noted that energy saving gains from the purchasing of energy-efficient appliances will have a cumulative effect and are not simply 'one-off' savings \u2013 thus, earlier implementation of standards by industry is of added value. Certain measures such as requirements for the standby consumption of electric appliances will also have an effect beyond the EU as manufacturers of goods traded worldwide will implement the same technology on all their models irrespective where they will be shipped. The implementation of the nine measures adopted thus far has been estimated to deliver up to 341 terawatt hours (TWh) of energy savings by 2020 (equating to 70 million tonnes of oil equivalent (Mtoe) primary energy savings 10 ) , which is equivalent to circa 12% of the current EU's total electricity consumption. The estimated savings are detailed in table 2. 11 These saving figures include the combined effect of Ecodesign and labelling as well as installation requirements under the Recast Energy Performance of Buildings Directive 12 , where applicable. These energy savings will be supplemented as further implementing measures are adopted. For 2010 and 2011, priority implementing measures covering boilers, water heaters and air conditioners will be adopted, estimated to generate savings of a further 102 Mtoe in 2020, if all are adopted in full. 10 The conversion from final electricity consumption expressed in TWh into primary energy consumption expressed in Mtoe is based on the generally accepted assumption that there is a 40% efficiency rate for the generation and transmission of electricity. 1 TWh electricity consumption = 2,5 TWh primary energy consumption = 0,215 Mtoe. 11 See results of studies carried out at: http://ec.europa.eu/energy/efficiency/studies/ecodesign_en.htm 12 2010/31/EU ",

Implementation and revision of the Labelling Directive The Labelling Directive 92/75/EEC requires manufacturers to declare the energy efficiency class of their product and to have it displayed by means of a label at the point of sale (e.g. shops). With the Labelling Directive, the energy label became a key instrument for fostering energy efficient products. The labelling classes for each type of appliance are set by means of implementing measures adopted by the Commission. The measures seek to target consumers by providing potential purchasers of household appliances with comparable and credible standardised information on the actual efficiency performance of the products when in use. This helps consumers to make an informed purchasing decision. It thus indirectly targets manufacturers who will be influenced by the effects that the labelling has on sales of designs. The framework Directive has applied from July 1993. Implementation of the Labelling Directive has proven to be so successful in stimulating manufacturers to build class A appliances that higher classes are needed for most appliances. Thus, it can be shown that, as a direct result of this legislation, manufacturers have brought onto the market energy-efficient products. 14 The model of labelling has been copied by other countries worldwide, suggesting that the measure is effective. In addition to the implementation of the Labelling Directive, the Commission proposed its recast as a priority for immediate action, with the aim of: \u2022 Extending its scope beyond household appliances to include industrial and commercial equipment; \u2022 Extending its scope to energy-related products (those which do not consume energy but contribute to energy conservation when in use (e.g. insulated windows); 13 The dates are related to the time of application of the first stage requirement. The multiple dates of application, ranging between end 2009 and beginning 2013, allow performance requirements to be raised on an incremental basis and industry to adapt product design. 14 For the successful market transformation towards higher penetration rates of energy efficient cold appliances, washing machines and dishwashers see Bertoldi, P. and Atanasiu, B.

        "EN 8 EN \u2022 Upgrading existing labelling classifications; \u2022 Linking the Directive to public procurement; \u2022 Strengthening provisions linked to advertisement. With the recast Directive 2010/30/EU adopted by the European Parliament in May 2010, the scope of the Energy Labelling Directive has been aligned with the scope of the revised Ecodesign Directive, which was already extended to energy-related products in 2009. In line with the priority action defined by the EEAP, the recast of the Labelling Directive extends the new labelling scheme to a wider range of products in the commercial and industrial sector, including energy-using and energy-related products. It is also the legal basis to extend the scope to other consumer products such as televisions, water heaters and boilers. With the adoption of the revision the existing labelling classification for each product will be upgraded through delegated acts. The revision sets out that the label is to be based on a A to G scale, a maximum of 3 more classes may be added on top of class A and these new classes will be named A+, A++ and A+++. Figure 1 : New label layout for washing machines The following delegated acts for the household sector were adopted by the Commission in September 2010: \u2022 Televisions \u2022 Household electric refrigerators, freezers and their combinations \u2022 Household washing machines and dishwashers In the course of 2011 delegated acts on boilers, air-conditioners, water heaters and laundry dryers will follow. An updated label on lighting will be adopted in 2011. Future products to be legislated in the near future are e.g. commercial refrigerators, vending machines and display cabinets in the commercial sector. It is estimated that the full implementation of the Labelling Directive results in energy savings corresponding to 27 Mtoe annually by 2020. ",
        "EN 9 EN The EU's energy labelling requirements can lead to some increase in operating costs for manufacturers and retailers. However, at least in the case of white goods manufacturing, operations have become more profitable, costs reduced and the efficiency improved with help of technological development and guidance towards more efficient and profitable appliances by the energy label, despite the fears of manufacturers when the policy action was initially introduced in the nineties. 15 2.1.3. Making products more energy efficient: overall assessment of the priority action The first priority action has been initiated and implemented with success, though with some delays regarding the original timeline for the adoption of the ecodesign requirements. This delay was mainly due to an overly ambitious time table given the available resources. It will have a substantial impact by 2020. The impact could be further enhanced with appropriate information on products running costs to consumers inter alia with trained salespersons in retail shops. Two possible issues could reduce the expected impact of European product policies: the rebound effect and the absence of proper enforcement (market surveillance) by Member States (MS) to ensure that products placed on their national markets meet the ecodesign and energy labelling requirements. For the second issue, an administrative cooperation group between MS market surveillance authorities has been set up by the Commission in order to ensure a proper enforcement of this policy. The rebound effect will be difficult to overcome, as it is inherent to any policy measures tackling efficient uses of energy in products and not energy behaviours, i.e. limiting the quantity of products used. Further work will be carried out in the next years to prepare and adopt further ecodesign implementing measures for additional product groups, reflecting inter alia the 2009 revision of the Ecodesign Directive to cover energy-related products, i.e. products which can directly or indirectly affect energy consumption. As a complementary policy, labelling requirements for the same product groups will be adopted in parallel whenever possible and meaningful. 2.1.4. Other product related measures In addition to the measures explicitly mentioned as priority actions, other product related measures were put forward by the EEAP 2006 and implemented: \u2022 The implementation and amendment of the Energy Star Agreement on office equipment has been finalized. A new 5-year Energy Star Agreement was concluded between the EU and the US in the end of 2006. The impact of the Programme has been reinforced by the provisions of Regulation (EC) 106/2008 which obliges central government authorities of Member States and EU institutions to procure equipment not less efficient than Energy Star. Criteria for computers, displays and imaging equipment have been strengthened and are expected to trigger about 30 TWh annual savings by 2020. Criteria for additional product groups, including servers, data storage, and small network equipment are being developed and should become applicable in 2011 and 2012. \u2022 The adoption of voluntary agreements with manufacturers on ecodesign requirements for the product groups of complex set-top boxes, imaging equipment, machine tools and 15 SEC(2008) 2862 ",
        "EN 10 EN medical imaging equipment is on the way. A first agreement on complex set-top boxes is about to be finalized. 2.2. Priority action 2: Making buildings more energy efficient Energy used in residential, commercial and public buildings for space and water heating, cooling, ventilation, lighting, etc. makes up 40% of the EU's final energy consumption. The major Community legislation addressing the energy performance of buildings is the Energy Performance of Buildings Directive (EPBD) of 2002. The Action Plan tackles energy efficiency in buildings by pushing for the full implementation of the EPBD and by putting forward its revision - as the second priority action. To this end, the EEAP included the following measures to make buildings more energy efficient: \u2022 Expanding substantially the scope of the Directive to include the majority of buildings; \u2022 Proposing EU minimum performance requirements for new and renovated buildings; \u2022 Developing in collaboration with the buildings sector a strategy for very low energy or passive houses by the end of 2008; \u2022 Setting a good example by leading the way, as far as the Commission's own buildings are concerned. Before considering progress achieved in the realisation of this second priority action, it is necessary to provide an overview of the implementation status of the 2002 EPBD, as one important measure of the Action Plan and as a logical element leading to its recast. 2.2.1. Implementation status of 2002 Energy Performance of Buildings Directive The Energy Performance of Buildings Directive (2002/91/EC) was adopted in 2002. Its main objective is the promotion of cost-effective improvement in the overall energy performance of buildings, whilst taking into account local conditions and requirements. It covers energy needs for space and water heating, cooling, ventilation and lighting. It does not fix concrete EU-wide minimum energy performance requirements, but obliges MS to define comprehensive methodologies, requirements and inspection and certification regimes to rate the energy performance of buildings at a national/regional level. MS had to transpose the Directive by January 2006. For certain provisions, an additional period of three years could be applied, i.e. until January 2009 16 , which most MS opted for. In practical terms MS thus had effectively up to 7 years to fully implement this legislation. Despite this long period of time, EPBD implementation has to be seen as in continuous progress since not all countries have yet fulfilled all the requirements to their full extent. As a result of a thorough conformity check analysis carried out by the Commission on the transposition of the Directive in national legislation, clarification needs have been identified in 15 MS. When considering impacts achieved, one of the key merits of the EPBD has been to bring the relevance of energy efficiency in buildings onto political agendas, integrate it into building codes and improve its visibility for citizens. Implementing the EPBD has been a major challenge for many MS. Indeed, prior to its adoption in 2002, about ten Member States did 16 Upon notification to the Commission, MS could, because of lack of qualified and/or accredited experts, have an additional period of three years to apply fully the provisions of Articles 7, 8 and 9 (i.e. until 4.1.2009). ",
        "EN 11 EN not have regulations in place addressing energy consumption in buildings. There are several countries with success stories showing a major change in the energy performance of their new building stock as well as regarding market uptake of innovative systems and technologies, where the EPBD regulations have had a catalysing effect. 17 It is very likely that in the absence of the EPBD, the situation would have remained in most MS as it was prior to 2002. 18 The following major achievements have been triggered by the adoption of the EPBD: \u2022 Establishment of a common understanding among all 27 MS on how to set minimum energy performance requirements 19 and on how to calculate the energy performance of buildings; \u2022 Average tightening of energy performance requirements by 15 % to 30%; 20 \u2022 Improved comfort level and indoor air quality in houses; \u2022 Development of 31 building related CEN standards, which can be promoted internationally and facilitate market entrance for European companies in e.g. China, India and the US. The EPBD is perceived as the most ambitious and comprehensive building legislation worldwide; \u2022 Introduction of a Concerted Action 21 to assist MS in their implementation process and facilitate the exchange of best practices and lessons learned in this complex and fragmented area; \u2022 Enhanced data collection on the quality of the EU building stock through the certificate scheme. Alongside the positive developments witnessed in the buildings sector across Europe, it is also important to draw the attention to the main shortcomings identified in the implementation process of the Directive as well as in the legal provisions themselves, which led to delays in transposition: 22 \u2022 Ambiguous formulations of some legal provisions in the Directive lead to different implementation practice in the MS; \u2022 Limited scope of the Directive: in relation to renovation 23 it addresses only 28% of the existing buildings stock; 24 \u2022 Some MS were not well prepared to meet the level of complexity set out in the Directive; this led to limited or insufficient resources foreseen for implementation; \u2022 Low level of ambition in the implementation process; 25 17 For a country specific assessment of EPBD implementation see EC (2008): EPBD Buildings Platform - Country reports 2008. 18 This assessment is confirmed by many stakeholder associations in their reports, e.g. the report of the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (RICS) \"Towards an Energy Efficient European Building Stock\" of December 2009. 19 U-values are now commonly used for building elements and kWh/m\u00b2 values for full refurbishments/new built. 20 INIVE (2010): Stimulating increased energy efficiency and better buildings ventilation, p. 118. 21 It has been initiated in 2005.

However, in a number of Member States, this 1000 m 2 threshold has been lowered or abolished so that all buildings that undergo major renovation have to fulfil certain energy performance requirements. 24 Reference to the building stock of EU-15, as the EPBD was adopted in 2002.

The first of two of these limitations of the EPBD were addressed in the recast proposal tabled by the Commission at the end of 2008. 2.2.2. Recast of the Energy Performance of Buildings Directive The Action Plan identified the recast of the 2002 EPBD as the key priority action in the building sector. The objectives were defined as substantially expanding the Directive's scope, proposing minimum EU performance requirements for new and existing buildings, and developing a deployment strategy for very low energy or passive houses. The Commission tabled the EPBD recast proposal in November 2008. 26 The European Parliament and the Council agreed on a recast Directive in May 2010 and the new legislation entered into force in July 2010. 27 MS must transpose the new Directive from July 2012. The objectives for the recast set out in the EEAP were addressed as follows: \u2022 Scope: The scope has been extended to include basically all existing and new buildings, as the 1000 m\u00b2 threshold was abolished in all relevant articles. However, MS have the possibility not to apply minimum performance requirements for certain categories of buildings such as industrial sites and historical buildings. 28 \u2022 Setting harmonised minimum energy performance requirements at EU level for new and renovated buildings: This proposal of the EEAP 2006 proved to be unfeasible given the important differences in prevailing calculation methods defining the energy performance of a building. 29 In addition, local conditions (e.g. climate, culture, history) shaping the features of the building stock in each country seemed to be too disparate to allow for meaningful harmonized minimum energy performance requirements at EU level. This issue was solved in the recast by introducing an obligation on MS to perform a cost effectiveness assessment in order to set cost-optimal minimum requirements. 30 This minimum performance level is to be calculated based on a comparative methodology framework, which is to be defined in detail under a Comitology process in 2010-2011. In the years up to 2020, a (comparative) benchmarking method will be applied to set standards for all buildings, existing and new ones. From 2020 on, \u2018nearly zero energy 31 standards\u2019 will be applied for new buildings (from 2019 for new public buildings). 25 Experience with certificates shows that some are of very poor quality and do not provide sufficient nor correct information, raising questions about their overall usefulness. Similar limitations results from the inspections schemes for boilers and air-conditioning systems, as their role has not been properly defined in the Directive. Further, the energy performance requirements set by MS do not fully meet expectation with regard to their level of ambition. At present there are many MS that do not have cost-optimal requirements. 26 COM(2008) 780. The original planning foresaw a proposal for 2009. 27 Directive 2010/31/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 19 May 2010. 28 Article 4(2) of Directive 2010/31/EU 29 See INIVE (2010): Stimulating increased energy efficiency and better building ventilation, p.72-75. 30 This means the energy performance level which leads to the lowest cost during the estimated lifecycle. See definition 14 in Article 2 of Directive 2010/31/EU. 31 A nearly zero-energy building has a very high energy performance and the nearly zero or very low amount of energy required should be covered to a very significant extent by energy from renewable sources, including energy from renewable sources produced on-site nearby.

        "EN 13 EN \u2022 Strategy for very low energy or passive houses : The EEAP proposed that the Commission takes \"the necessary steps, in collaboration with the building sector, to develop a deployment strategy, with a view to moving towards this type of house as a standard in new construction in the medium term, as the appropriate technologies become commercially available\". The recast chose a different approach by introducing a provision to ensure that as of January 2021 all new buildings will be nearly zero-energy buildings. 32 In addition, MS will have to draw up national plans on how to increase the number of nearly zero-energy buildings in their country taking into account their relative starting positions and national circumstances. These national plans are to set intermediate targets for 2015. Further information on the policies and financial or other measures adopted to promote nearly zero-energy buildings have to be included. As regards the existing building stock, MS need to develop policies and take measures (e.g. targets) in order to stimulate the transformation of buildings that are refurbished into nearly zero-energy buildings. The plans will be evaluated by the Commission, based on which a report will be published reflecting the progress made by MS in increasing the number of nearly zero-energy buildings. On the basis of this report, the Commission will develop an action plan and, if necessary, propose measures to increase the number of those buildings and encourage best practices as regards the cost-effective transformation of existing buildings into nearly zero- energy buildings. 33 2.2.3. Exemplary role of the public sector to tackle Commission's own buildings The Commission committed itself as a public authority to set a good example by leading the way with its own buildings. The objective was to certify all Commission buildings within the EMAS system and to extend EMAS certification to other EU institutions. As of September 2010, almost 40% of Commission's buildings in Brussels are EMAS registered and the remaining buildings will be gradually certified until 2014. 34 Further, energy efficiency and legal conformity is now integral part of the procurement procedures for new buildings. The European Parliament is EMAS registered for their three sites in Brussels, Luxembourg and Strasburg. The Committee of Regions and the Economic and Social Committee are starting the implementation of an Environmental management system in line with EMAS while the Council has not yet started registration activities of its buildings. In this light, the exemplary role of public authorities has also been explicitly tackled in the recast of the EPBD. Indeed, from 2019, public authorities that occupy and own a new building shall ensure that the building is a nearly zero-energy building. Public authorities should become early adopters of energy efficiency improvements measures and should implement the recommendations included in the energy performance certificate as soon as feasible. 2.2.4. Making buildings more energy efficient: overall assessment The priority action defined for the building sector has been successfully initiated in the course of 2008 and finalized in November 2008 with a recast proposal tabled by the Commission for the 2002 EPBD. The recast EPBD is expected to have a major impact on the future final energy consumption in buildings. Next to reducing energy consumption, the renovation 32 For the public sector this provision needs to be implemented already 2 years earlier. 33 See Article 9 of Directive 2010/31/EU. 34 Nine additional buildings will be registered with EMAS in 2010. ",
        "EN 14 EN process of the existing building stock as well as the construction of nearly zero-energy houses will have significant quantitative and qualitative impacts on employment. The impact assessment accompanying the EBPD recast proposal estimated a positive direct job effect of up to 450,000 new employments in the construction sector. The key benefit of these job creations is that they are benefiting local businesses, many of which are SMEs. In order to deliver the \"deep\" renovations in terms of improved energy performance and the roll out of new nearly zero-energy buildings the qualifications of the involved workforce need to be strongly improved through adequate professional training measures and adapted university curricula. The higher level of qualifications of the workforce as well as the acquired knowledge on state-of-the-art low energy buildings will bring an additional competitive edge to the European building industry. The impacts of the recast EPBD will materialize only in a few years time. However, some factors could further enhance the implementation process in MS, such as the EPBD Concerted Action, dedicated financial incentives (e.g. tax-exemptions, green mortgages) as well as the allocation of European Regional Development Funds 35 for energy-efficiency improvements and renewable energy measures in housing (see 3.6). All in all, energy consumption in the building sector will only be drastically reduced when the building stock of today, which also reflects to a great extend the future building stock in 2050 (renovation rate averaging 1% to 2% across MS) is effectively transformed towards low energy buildings. Increasing the renovation rate of existing building is the key. The recast EPBD is an important step forward, as it sets the legal framework. Beyond all, owners (public commercial and residential) need to be strongly incentivized to invest in improving the energy performance of their buildings. Innovative financing concepts and skilled construction workforce are needed to realise the needed transformation until 2050. In the coming 10 years, the course needs to be set. The public sector could lead by example by starting the renovation process in its own buildings. 2.3. Priority action 3: Making power generation and distribution more efficient The third priority area for action is power generation and distribution. About 30% of the EU's primary energy consumption is consumed by the energy sector, mainly for transforming energy into electricity and heat, and for distributing it. The average transformation efficiency for electricity generation is of around 40%. Further, losses in the transmission and distribution of electricity are referred to be often as high as 10%. Consequently, the EEAP 2006 concluded that this sector had a large potential for energy savings and defined as priority action for immediate initiation to make power generation and distribution more efficient. For this purpose, the Commission intended to: \u2022 Develop minimum binding efficiency requirements for new electricity, heating and cooling capacity lower than 20 MW and consider, if necessary, such requirements for larger production units (2.3.1); 35 Since May 2009, all MS have the opportunity to use up to 4% of their allocation from the European Regional Development Fund for energy-efficiency improvements and renewable energy measures in existing housing so as to support social cohesion, i.e. the EU can co-finance national or regional schemes to promote the installation of double glazing, wall insulation or solar panels. Previous legislation gave only new MS limited possibilities to use support from the ERDF for housing. It however remains to be seen to what extent these new possibilities will be used. ",
        "EN 15 EN \u2022 Develop with the energy supply industry guidelines on good operating practices for existing capacity to raise average generation efficiency for all plants (2.3.2); \u2022 Agree on guidelines on good regulatory practices to reduce transmission and distribution losses (2.3.3); \u2022 Propose a new regulatory framework to promote the connection of decentralised generation (2.3.4). In addition to Priority Action 3 other measures were listed in the Annex to the Communication on the EEAP 2006. These measures could be summarised as actions to implement, amend and improve the Directive 2004/8/EC on the promotion of Cogeneration. 2.3.1. Minimum binding efficiency requirements for new electricity, heating and cooling capacity lower than 20MW and larger production units The threshold of 20 MW was set to address generation which is not covered by the EU emissions trading scheme (ETS). This specific measure requires addressing a large number of different, often custom-made equipments and production units, the efficiency of which to a great extent depends on the system they are part of. Such efficiency measures are costly to develop and create a risk of being too stringent (command and control measure) and not well- adapted to fast changing technical solutions. Since the cost of such measures risk to be larger than the benefits, efforts have been spent on other, more cost-effective energy efficiency measures that should be exploited first. For that reason, the measure has not been concluded, but may become timely at a later stage, when other options have been exploited. Nevertheless, efforts have been made to address energy efficiency in combustion installations. In the context of the Integrated Pollution Prevention and Control Directive 2008/1/EC (IPPC), all installations with a rated thermal input of above 50 MW have to be operated in such a way that energy is used efficiently, and one of the issues to be taken into account in determining Best Available Techniques (BAT) for a process is its energy efficiency. In order to promote the energy efficiency provisions of the IPPC Directive a special horizontal Reference Document on Best Available Techniques addressing generic energy efficiency issues was prepared and adopted in February 2009 (ENE BREF). 36 It aims at improving energy efficiency in industrial installations, including also smaller production units for electricity, heating and cooling. According to the IPPC Directive the competent authorities issuing IPPC permits in Member States are required to determine the permit conditions based on BAT, taking into account certain local considerations. However, ENE BREF does not set minimum energy efficiency requirements and reference documents are not of compulsory nature, as the Member States have also here the discretion to use other references to apply BAT. In addition, for activities prescribed in the ETS Directive, MS may choose not to impose requirements relating to energy efficiency in respect of combustion units emitting carbon dioxide on the site. However, in such cases, energy efficiency requirements still apply to all associated activities on the site (i.e. not directly emitting carbon dioxide within the same installation). A similar BREF for Large Combustion Plants 37 was adopted in July 2006 and includes some useful elements regarding energy efficiency both for heating plants, power plants and CHP, although the main focus is on plants that have a capacity above 50 MW. 36 EC (2009): Reference Document on Best Available Techniques on Energy Efficiency 37 EC (2006): Reference Document on Best Available Techniques on Large Combustion Plants ",
        "EN 16 EN The revised IPPC Directive 38 will strengthen the role of BAT and BREF in setting specific conditions for new industrial installations. The scope will however remain above 50 MW installed capacity and MS will still be able to deviate from the standard for certain technical reasons or local circumstances if they can prove that the costs of implementing the standards would be disproportionate compared to environmental benefits. 2.3.2. Development with supply industry guidelines on good operating practices for existing capacity to raise average generation efficiency for all plants Concerning the second action point to raise generation efficiency in existing plants, no specific guidelines on good operating practices have been developed in cooperation with the supply industry. Nevertheless, both BREF on Large Combustion Plants and on Energy Efficiency can be considered as such guidelines, since they were developed during extensive consultation process with the supply industry and do provide guidelines on good operating practices. The BREF on energy efficiency provides information on techniques to be considered to achieve energy efficiency at the installation level as well as in energy-using systems, processes or activities. These techniques focus on areas such as energy efficiency management systems, planning and establishing objectives and targets, energy efficient design, effective control of processes, maintenance, as well as measurement and monitoring, energy audits and benchmarking. 39 Further, in the context of the Internal Energy Market, the EU has adopted a Third Legislative Package 40 where energy efficiency provisions have been introduced. However, these provisions are vague and do not create strict legal requirements for Member States to make energy efficiency a mandatory condition for the generation (only electricity), transmission, distribution, supply and storage (only gas) of energy (electricity/gas). 2.3.3. Guidelines on good regulatory practices to reduce transmission and distribution losses Concerning the third action point, the Commission committed to work closely with the Council of European Regulators (CEER) and the European Regulators Group for Electricity and Gas (ERGEG) to agree on good regulatory practices to reduce transmission and distribution losses. Preliminary discussions have taken place, but as it stands today no agreement has been reached with CEER and ERGEG. This is however an issue that needs to be kept for future and further discussed with the new Agency for the Cooperation of Energy Regulators (ACER), ERGEG's successor organisation. 2.3.4. A new regulatory framework to promote the connection of decentralized generation In Article 16 of Directive 2009/28/EC, access, transmission and distribution as well as the dispatch of decentralised generating installations using renewable energy sources (RES) is 38 The new Industrial Emission Directive 2010/75/EU combines seven existing air pollution directives, notably the Integrated Pollution Prevention and Control (IPPC) Directive, obliging around 52,000 industrial and agricultural installations to obtain environmental permits. The measurement stick is the implementation of BATs, or the most effective technologies that can provide high levels of environmental protection while balancing cost and benefits. 39 EC (2009): Reference Document on Best Available Techniques on Energy Efficiency, chapter 2 and 3. 40 See Directives 2009/72/EC and 2009/73/EC ",
        "EN 17 EN promoted. Indeed, MS shall provide either priority access or guaranteed access to the grid- system of electricity produced from RES and ensure that when dispatching electricity generating installations, transmission system operators shall give priority to generating installations using renewable energy sources. However, the provision does not foresee that distribution system operators give priority to RES when dispatching generating installations. In the framework of the Third Legislative Package put forward in 2009, Directive 2009/72/EC concerning common rules for the internal market in electricity promotes the priority dispatch of RES in accordance of Article 16 of Directive 2009/28/EC. In the case of the dispatch of generating installations producing combined heat and power, MS only may require the system operator to give priority, i.e. the provision does not impose on MS to make it mandatory to give priority to CHP installations. 41 Such priority dispatched however should be granted by transmission system operators to high efficiency CHP installations in accordance with the CHP directive that makes the grid access and dispatch rules applicable to CHP by reference. This obligation is however not spelled out in a clear unambiguous way as can be seen in the different interpretation by Member States. Overall, a strong framework for distributed generation is still missing, since access and dispatch issues at distribution level are not yet sufficiently addressed in the existing renewable, CHP and internal energy market legislation. As the new regulatory framework of the Third Legislative Package will only enter into force in March 2011, it is yet not possible to assess how MS will transpose the provision promoting the dispatch of decentralised generation into their national laws and how it will evolve in practice. Yet due to soft wording, generating installations producing combined heat and power are in a weaker position compared to those using RES when it comes to prioritising connection and dispatch at the transmission level. In the framework of the EEAP 2006, no other activities are in the pipeline to further promote the connection of decentralised generation, especially when producing combined heat and power. As this is still seen as an important field for action, this issue should be reassessed when elaborating new priority actions in a new Energy Efficiency Plan. 2.3.5. Promotion of cogeneration through the Combined Heat & Power Directive In addition to the priority actions stated above (2.3.1 \u2013 2.3.4) to make power generation and distribution more efficient, other measures related to the implementation of the Combined Heat and Power Directive (CHP - 2004/8/EC) have been listed in the EEAP 2006 as having a scope for reducing losses in distribution networks. A short assessment of the measures related to the implementation of the CHP Directive is therefore provided in this report. The purpose of the CHP Directive is to increase energy efficiency and improve security of supply within the EU by creating a framework for the promotion and development of high- efficiency cogeneration. Regarding the CHP measures listed in the EEAP, most of them have not been completed yet but are ongoing, although with delay. For the time being, the main sources of information regarding the implementation progress with the CHP Directive are the reports submitted with significant delays by most of the MS to the Commission pursuant Article 10 of the Directive. One key aspect of these reports is the analysis of the national potential for the application of 41 Articles 15 (3) and 25 (4) ",
        "EN 18 EN high-efficiency cogeneration, including micro-generation. In the context of this national analysis Member States were asked to identify heat demand suitable for CHP as well as the potential for waste heat. The full assessment of these reports is expected to be finalized early 2011. Based on these reports and in consultation with stakeholders, the Commission will report on the implementation of the Directive including the examination of the various support mechanisms. Work has also been done in the field of minimum efficiency standards. A study has been launched to investigate how to best propose minimum efficiency requirements for district heating based on a new norm. Final results are expected for 2011. Further, minimum efficiency requirements for micro CHP equipment will be addressed under the Ecodesign framework, with a new implementing measure on boilers, for adoption by the Commission in 2011. Next to the ongoing work, the task of harmonising calculation methods for high efficiency CHP has been completed with the adoption of a Commission Decision 42 in November 2008, establishing detailed guidelines for the calculation of electricity from cogeneration. Already in December 2006, another Commission Decision established harmonised efficiency reference values for separate production of electricity and heat. 43 In the lifespan of the EEAP 2006, it was already foreseen to inquire how to amend the CHP Directive to strengthen its impact on the promotion of CHP. This action has already been initiated with the launch of a study which will be looking at different options to strengthen the provisions of the CHP directive and to ensure that the cost-effective economic potential is fully used in the EU. These include stronger support for distributed generation, i.e. specific network rules for connecting CHP to distribution networks, targets for realising national potentials, better integration with heat demand through the support of district heating & cooling, promotion of industrial clusters, better harmonisation of guarantees of origin as the basis of support schemes, etc. In that context, it could also be possible to consider the option to have stricter requirements for market regulators to promote CHP. 44 One of the main achievements of the CHP Directive has been to codify at the EU level the definition of high efficiency cogeneration. 45 The CHP Directive for the first time established a regulatory framework to promote cogeneration. However, the CHP directive proved to be less effective than desired in promoting cogeneration in those MS not already having been active in this area beforehand. When the EEAP was proposed, 10.9% 46 of the electricity consumed in the EU was generated using this technology. Today, the proportion is around 11% 47 , although the potential has been assessed of being 20% in 2020. The share of electricity generated from CHP varies across Member States, ranging from 0.3% in Cyprus to more than 42 Commission Decision (2008/952/EC) establishing detailed guidelines for the implementation and application of Annex II to Directive 2004/8/EC. 43 Commission Decision (2007/74/EC) establishing harmonised efficiency reference values for separate production of electricity and heat in application of Directive 2004/8/EC. 44 ERGEG/ CEER have included the promotion of CHP as one element to be reported on by the national regulatory authorities in their annual contribution to Commission's benchmarking report on the progress in creating the internal gas and electricity market. 45 A saving of a minimum of 10% primary energy compared to separate production of heat and electricity based on the same fuel is now guaranteed by a plant of high efficiency cogeneration. 46 Data for 2006. See Eurostat Data in focus 22/2008 47 Data for 2008. See Eurostat Data in focus 7/2010 ",
        "EN 19 EN 40% in Latvia and in Denmark. This variation is only partially due to differences in potentials and mostly due to the differences in how actively CHP is promoted. The main barriers preventing the uptake of cogeneration in MS are mainly: 48 \u2022 Current legislation does not define any legal obligations for MS to realise their national CHP potential within a certain period of time; \u2022 Implementation has been weak so far: for example many MS completed reporting only six years after the entry into force of the Directive and some are still lagging behind; \u2022 Efforts in the areas of grid connection, regulation and administration, and financing need to be further reinforced; \u2022 MS typically have identified CHP opportunities in either industrial cogeneration or district heating according to their history. Cooling, micro CHP and bio-energy opportunities are in many cases unexplored. 2.3.6. More efficient power generation and distribution: overall assessment The priority action to make power generation and distribution more efficient is one of the ten priority actions of the EEAP 2006 which has not been fully addressed. This is mainly due to the high cost, the complexity, and the strong stringency of the required measures, that made this effort for the time being not proportionate to the foreseeable results in this area, taken into account that it is already partially covered by market instruments with similar goals, e.g. to trigger energy efficiency improvements. Such market instruments are the internal energy market and the EU emission trading scheme. Overall, while there is potentially significant scope for energy efficiency improvements and energy savings in this sector, which cannot be fully exploited via the above mentioned market instruments due to the persistence of specific barriers, priority was given to efforts promoting energy efficiency in areas with higher and more swiftly realisable saving and cost-effective potentials. As a result this priority action was so far only partially implemented under the current EEAP period. A new regulatory framework was established with the Third Legislative Package, introducing voluntary elements for MS to promote connection of decentralised generation. Decentralised generation received further support under the new Renewable Directive, but this also left considerable discretion for MS as regards implementation at distribution level. In addition, although no specific guidelines were developed to raise the average generation efficiency of all plants, the BREF on energy efficiency adopted in 2009 can be seen as following the same objective. 2.4. Priority action 4: Energy efficiency in transport through higher fuel efficiency of cars The transport sector plays a central role in the European economy and as such accounts for a third of final energy consumption. 98% of the energy consumed in this sector is fossil fuel, making it a major source of greenhouse gas emissions and of import dependency. Energy efficiency in transport is addressed in the Action Plan by measures on the fuel efficiency of cars, development of markets for cleaner vehicles, tyre pressure, efficiency of urban, rail, maritime and aviation transport systems, as well as changing transportation behaviour. 48 See also the conclusions drawn by the Code project under http://www.code-project.eu ",
        "EN 20 EN The focus of this report lays on the priority action defined in the EEAP 2006 for the transport sector, namely to achieve fuel efficiency of cars. To this end, the Commission, being determined to address energy efficiency and CO 2 emissions from cars, committed to propose: \u2022 A legislation to ensure that a 120 g CO 2 /km target is achieved by 2012 through a comprehensive and consistent approach, in accordance with the agreed EU objective (2.4.1). \u2022 Propose to strengthen EU requirements of labelling of cars (2.4.2). 2.4.1. Emission performance standards for new passenger cars: 120 g CO2/km by 2012 Achieving higher fuel efficiency in passenger cars addresses over 60% of the fuel consumption in the road transport sector, which accounts for over 80% of the overall energy consumption of the total sector. Despite the economic and financial crisis, the number of new registered vehicles in EU15 in 2009 was 3% higher than in 2000 (also due to scrappage schemes implemented by MS as a response to the crisis). Overall CO 2 emission from road transport (passenger cars and trucks) between 1990 and 2007 increased in the EU27 by 29%. The objective of reducing CO 2 emissions from cars has been on the European political agenda since more than 15 years as shown in table 5. In 1995, the EC adopted its first Community Strategy for reducing CO 2 emissions from cars. At that time, the European average fuel efficiency for new passenger cars was about 186 g CO 2 /km. The Community CO 2 reduction strategy was based on three pillars: voluntary commitments from the car industry to cut emissions, improvements in consumer information and the promotion of fuel-efficient cars by means of fiscal measures. The progress achieved by 2005 with the voluntary commitments was assessed to go towards the 140 g CO 2 /km target by 2008/2009, but in the absence of additional measures, the EU objective of 120 g CO 2 /km would not be met at a 2012 horizon. 49 As an outcome, the Commission considered necessary to resort to a legislative approach. In line with the commitments made in the context of the EEAP 2006, the European Commission adopted in February 2007 a revised strategy to reduce CO 2 emissions from passenger cars and light-commercial vehicles (so called light-duty vehicles) through an integrated approach looking at fuel economy improvements, other technological improvements and use of biofuels. 50 As a next step a Commission proposal 51 for a regulation to reduce CO 2 from passenger cars was put forward in December 2007. The adoption followed in April 2009 as Regulation (EC) No 443/2009, setting emission performance 49 This assessment has proven to be correct, as in 2008, the fuel efficiency average for new passenger cars registered by ACEA was 152,3 gCO 2 /km. In 2009 the averages for JAMA and KAMA were 142.6 and 141.8 respectively. 50 See COM(2007) 19 final (07.02.2007): Communication on the results of the review of the Community Strategy to reduce CO 2 emissions from passenger cars and light-commercial vehicles. 51 See COM(2007) 856 final: Proposal for a regulation on setting emission performance standards for new passenger cars as part of the Community's integrated approach to reduce CO 2 emissions from light-duty vehicles ",

June 2000 EC establishes a scheme to monitor the average specific emissions of CO 2 from new passenger cars in accordance with Decision No 1753/2000/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 June 2000. February 2007 Adoption of two parallel EC Communications: \u2022 Communication setting out the results of the review of the Community Strategy to reduce CO 2 emissions from passenger cars and light-commercial vehicles; \u2022 Communication on a Competitive Automotive Regulatory Framework for the 21st Century (CARS21). The Communications underlined that progress had been made towards the 140 g CO 2 /km target by 2008/2009, but that the Community objective of 120 g CO 2 /km would not be met by 2012 in the absence of additional measures. December 2007 Adoption of Commission proposal (COM(2007) 856) for a Regulation on emission performance standards for new passenger cars to reach an average of 130 gCO 2 /km by 2012. April 2009 Regulation (EC) 443/2009 setting emission performance standards for new passenger cars as part of the Community\u2019s integrated approach to reduce CO 2 emissions from light-duty vehicles. October 2009 Adoption of EC legislative proposal to reduce CO2 emissions from light commercial vehicles (vans) Key elements of the adopted Regulation for new passenger cars are: \u2022 Limited value curve : By means of improvement in vehicle motor technology the fleet average to be achieved by all new cars registered in the EU by 2015 is 130 gCO 2 /km. A so- called limit value curve implies that heavier cars are allowed higher emissions than lighter cars while preserving the overall fleet average. \u2022 Phasing-in of requirements : In 2012, 65% of each manufacturer's newly registered cars must comply on average with the limit value curve set by the legislation. This will rise to 75% in 2013, 80% in 2014 and 100% from 2015 onwards. \u2022 Lower penalty payments for small excess emissions until 2018 : If the average CO 2 emissions of a manufacturer's fleet exceed its limit value in any year from 2012, the manufacturer has to pay an excess emissions premium for each car registered. This premium amounts to \u20ac5 for the first g/km in excess, \u20ac15 for the second g/km, \u20ac25 for the third g/km and \u20ac95 for each subsequent g/km. From 2019, the first g/km will cost \u20ac95. ",
        "EN 22 EN \u2022 Long-term target : A target of 95 gCO 2 /km is specified for the year 2020. The modalities for reaching this target and the aspects of its implementation, including the excess emissions premium, will have to be defined in a review to be completed no later than the beginning of 2013. \u2022 Eco-innovations : Due to the outdated test procedure used for vehicle type approval, certain innovative technologies cannot demonstrate their CO 2 -reducing effects under the type approval test. As an interim procedure until the test procedure is reviewed by 2014, manufacturers can be granted a maximum of 7g/km of emission credits on average for their fleet if they equip vehicles with innovative technologies, based on independently verified data. It becomes evident that it is unlikely that the EEAP objective of an equivalent of 120 gCO 2 /km will be achieved in 2012 when the new regulation delays to 2015 the full entry into force of this target and that many of the additional implementing measures (tyre pressure monitoring systems, tyre rolling resistance limits for new passenger cars, gear shift indicators) have different dates for entry into force, usually later than 2012. This timeframe and the overall ambition have been amended compared to the 2007 proposal from the Commission. The co-legislators decided to delay to 2015 the full entry into force of the regulation to encompass concerns of the industry as to the cost of achieving this target. However, during co-decision an additional 2020 target of 95 g/km was introduced which compensates for this delay of the short-term objective and adds planning certainty to the industry that now can work towards a longer-term perspective. Although an average reduction of 3,3 gCO 2 /km per year over a period of 20 years (1995- 2015, see graph 1) was a rather slow progress, the new regulation will set a much firmer path downwards in terms of gCO 2 /km reduction (starting from 158.7 in 2007 to planned 95 in 2020).

        "EN 23 EN 2.4.2. Strengthening EU requirements for labelling of cars In general, empirical studies show that consumers value the fuel economy and environmental friendliness of cars as one of the lowest priorities in their purchasing decision. Moreover, it is often stated that consumers are relatively short-sighted regarding perceived future fuel savings from buying a fuel-efficient car. Similar to the labelling of products, the availability of running costs information through a car label, reinforces the impact of the regulation on emission standards. The first Directive (1999/EC/EC) relating to the availability of consumer information on fuel economy and CO 2 emissions in respect of the marketing of new passenger cars dates from 1999. Its objective was to ensure that information relating to the fuel economy and CO 2 emissions of new passenger cars offered for sale or lease in the Community is made available for consumers in order to enable consumers to make an informed choice. This choice is to be based on the following type of information that must be provided to the consumers: \u2022 A fuel economy label for all new cars to be displayed at the point of sale; \u2022 A poster (or a display) showing the official fuel consumption and CO 2 emissions data of all new passenger car models displayed or offered for sale or lease at or through the respective point of sale; \u2022 A guide to fuel economy and CO 2 emissions; \u2022 Promotional literature containing official fuel consumption and specific CO 2 emissions data for the passenger car model to which it refers. This fuel efficiency labelling Directive was intended as a tool in raising awareness. However, a study based notably on reports provided by MS has been carried out in 2005 coming to the conclusion that its impact has not been visible with labels varying strongly in quality across MS. 52 That is why the Commission decided to adopt an amending proposal to improve the effectiveness of this Directive and to define it as a priority action for the transport sector in the EEAP 2006. The review has been announced however, the timeline for this adoption is not yet available. Key aspects for consideration will be: \u2022 Extended scope of the labelling scheme to light-commercial vehicles; \u2022 Harmonised design of the label; \u2022 Energy efficiency classes for raising consumer awareness at the time of car purchase; \u2022 Definition of light environmentally enhanced vehicles; \u2022 Indication on the label of the annual running costs; \u2022 Vehicle tax levels as a function of CO 2 emissions and fuel consumption. The review of the fuel efficiency labelling will be put forward again by the upcoming White Paper on transport foreseen for adoption in early 2011. 2.4.3. Higher fuel efficiency of cars and strengthened labelling: overall assessment The priority action of the EEAP for the transport sector has not been fully implemented as the CO 2 emissions standards will come into force with delay in 2015 and the work on the review of the fuel efficiency labelling Directive has been initiated but not finalized yet. However, the Commission has already started targeting emissions from road transport beyond passenger 52 ADAC (2005): Study on the effectiveness of Directive 1999/94/EC relating to the availability of consumer information on fuel economy and CO 2 missions in respect of the marketing of new passenger cars, final report.

To conclude, the progress made in this priority action is not satisfactory and need to be further addressed, inter alia in the new Energy Efficiency Plan as well as in the upcoming White Paper on transport. 2.4.4. Other key measures in the transport sector In addition to the priority action defined, there have been various positive developments as regards the other transport measures proposed in the EEAP 2006. As completed measures are to be mentioned (see also annex 1): \u2022 A Regulation on the labelling of tyres with respect to fuel efficiency and other essential parameters (EC No. 1222/2009) was adopted in November 2009 and will apply to the MS from November 2012. The Regulation requires the provision of information on tyre parameters relating to the rolling resistance (influencing fuel consumption), wet grip (influencing safety) and external rolling noise. It seeks to target consumers by providing potential purchasers of tyres with labels that allows them to make informed choices. It thus indirectly targets manufacturers who will be influenced by the effects that the labelling has on sales of designs. The labelling of tyres will contribute positively to improving the fuel efficiency of cars and is expected to contribute to some 15 Mtoe (cumulated 2012 -2020) primary energy savings by 2020 . \u2022 A new Directive 2009/33/EC on the promotion of clean and energy-efficient road transport vehicles entered into force in May 2009. This directive aims at accelerating the market introduction of clean and energy efficient vehicles through public procurement. In the long term this should contribute to reduce their costs through economies of scale, resulting in a progressive improvement of the whole vehicle fleet. MS need to transpose this directive by 4 December 2010. By December 2012 a first assessment report on the application of the Directive, the actions taken by MS and the possible need of further EU actions will be elaborated. \u2022 Directive 2010/40/EU on the framework for the deployment of intelligent transport systems in the field of road transport and for interfaces with other modes of transport entered into force on 26 August 2010. This Directive establishes a framework in support of the coordinated and coherent deployment and use of Intelligent Transport Systems (ITS) within the EU, in particular across the borders between the MS, and sets out the general conditions necessary for that purpose. This legal instrument will contribute to an acceleration of the deployment and use of ITS in Europe: according to several studies, ITS have a potential up to 10%-15% reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, if they are deployed widely and across all possible applications. 53 EC (2009) Proposal for a Regulation on Setting emission performance standards for new light commercial vehicles as part of the Community's integrated approach to reduce CO 2 emissions from light-duty vehicles, COM(2009) 593, Brussels.

        "EN 25 EN \u2022 In September 2007 the communication of a Green Paper \u201cTowards a new culture for urban mobility \u201d was followed by the adoption in September 2009 of the Action Plan on Urban Mobility with 20 actions in six thematic areas. \u2022 For air transport , which is responsible for 14% of the energy consumption in the sector, political agreement was reached to include it in the EU Emissions Trading Scheme as of 2012. Further, the Sesar Joint Undertaking was established in spring 2007 to promote energy efficiency in this sector. \u2022 In the rail sector , the legal framework for rail transport has been established and MS need to implement it to increase interoperability. The EU railway legislation tackles the negative trend in a modal split in freight transport with the rail sector loosing its market share. Therefore its impact can be seen in terms of modal shift towards more sustainable and energy-efficient mode of transport (railways). Other or related transport measures are in the process of implementation, such as: \u2022 Support of EU-wide deployment of real-time traffic and travel information (RTTI) and traffic management systems and the establishment of guidelines inter alia for the deployment of Intelligent Truck Parking through the EasyWay project, which was supported with \u20ac100 million over the 2007-20 09 period. A follow-up proposal for the period 2010-2011 has been submitted and negotiations on EasyWay II are currently ongoing and should be concluded by the end of the year. Considering all actions together an impact of 5 to 10% reduction in the road transport energy consumption by 2020 has been estimated, representing a total reduction of energy consumption between 1.2 and 2.4% in EU total final energy demand by 2020 . 2.5. Priority action 5: financing energy efficiency investments for SME and Energy Service Companies (ESCOs) As described in the EEAP 2006, although many energy efficiency measures are fully cost effective with very short payback periods, they are not always undertaken due to financial barriers. In this light, the Action Plan defined a priority action aiming at facilitating appropriate financing of energy efficiency investments for SME and Energy ESCOs. For this purpose the Commission committed to: \u2022 Call upon the banking sector to offer finance packages specifically aimed at SMEs and ESCOs to adopt energy efficiency savings identified in energy audits (2.5.1) \u2022 Make access to Community financing, such as Green Investment Funds, available for promoting eco-innovations (2.5.2). 2.5.1. Financial packages for SMEs and ESCOs In cooperation with the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD), the European Investment Bank (EIB) Group, the Council of Europe Development Bank (CEB) and the Kreditanstalt f\u00fcr Wiederaufbau (KfW), several financial packages specifically aiming at SMEs or involving ESCO finance have been created, such as: \u2022 Energy Efficiency Finance Facility (EEFF) In April 2007, the EC established the EEFF in cooperation with three international financial institutions (EBRD, EIB & CEB/KfW). The objective of this facility is to achieve savings in ",
        "EN 26 EN energy consumption and reduction in CO 2 emissions, facilitated through the provision of financing to financial institutions in Beneficiary Countries to increase their investment portfolios in energy efficiency projects. Under the Facility, the financial institutions provide loan financing through participating banks, together with EC grant support. EC funds will be used to provide technical assistance for implementation support and financial incentives to i) sub-borrowers and ii) participating banks. The EBRD model used, in particular in Bulgaria 54 , has demonstrated its ability to create a market for energy efficiency and renewable energy financing with 8 commercial banks involved and with \u20ac225 million of financi ng leveraged by \u20ac55 million of concessional funding in the form of technical assistance grants and incentives. Based on the experience in Bulgaria, and reflecting local conditions, this model has now been rolled out in ten other EBRD countries of operations for a total EBRD financing of \u20ac 1.1 billion. A project has recently been approved which will mobilize \u20ac1 million from EU resources under the EEFF 2006 programme to launch a capacity building and transfer of skills technical cooperation assignment, designed to strengthen the administrative capacity of the institutions that will be in charge with implementing the EUR 200 million grant scheme in Bulgaria (ERDF funded). \u2022 Sustainable energy finance through related Financing Facilities In 2010, the Commission reshaped a number of earlier instruments with the intention of refocussing support to current European energy and climate objectives, in particular with respect to the 2020 objectives for energy savings and reduction of CO 2 emissions. In June 2010, a new SME Energy Efficiency sub-window was developed for the purpose of facilitating SME investments for energy efficiency and renewable energy measures generally targetting CO 2 emissions reductions. Under this sub-window, of particular relevance is the Polish Sustainable Energy Financing Facility which was established within a few weeks of a formal agreement on the reshaping of the EBRD SME Finance facility. EBRD will provide up to \u20ac150 million senior debt to financial interm ediaries in Poland, for on-lending to finance investments in energy efficiency or renewable energy. The Facility is supported by approximately \u20ac30 million of EC grant incentives for end borrowers. Similar modifications are being created in facilities targeting action in municipalities and involving all four of the abovementioned banks. \u2022 European Local Energy Assistance (ELENA) In order to facilitate the mobilisation of funds for investments in sustainable energy at local level, the Commission in cooperation with the EIB has established in 2009 the ELENA technical assistance facility, financed through the Intelligent Energy Europe Programme. The facility, implemented by the EIB, provides co-financing for project development services in order to prepare and launch bankable sustainable energy investments. The financial support is provided to local and regional public authorities and bodies acting on their behalf. The investment programmes supported should contribute to the 2020 energy and climate objectives and need to have a minimum leverage factor of 25. Investments areas for which technical assistance can be provided are inter alia the refurbishment of public and private buildings (including social housing), district heating and cooling networks as well as 54 For success stories see also the website of EBRD: http://www.bulgaria- eueeff.com/pages/eueeffbg_success_stories_en.htm ",
        "EN 27 EN decentralised cogeneration systems, urban transport, and the local infrastructure including smart grids and information and communication technologies. While this facility is targeting local and regional public bodies, it also effectively promotes energy service companies as the public entities frequently look for their involvement to carry out the energy efficiency investments. In just over one year of operation, ten ELENA projects have been approved which will provide approximately \u20ac18 million in grants to final beneficiaries with a view to mobilizing about \u20ac1.5 billion in invest ments over three year project lifetimes. \u2022 Energy Efficiency financing facility established under the European Economic Recovery Programme (EERP) In 2009 a programme was established by regulation 55 to aid economic recovery for Europe in the energy sector by granting \u20ac3.98 billion by the end of 2010. In the event of unspent funds, the EEPR Regulation states that Commission will propose an amendment of the EEPR with regard to funding energy efficiency and renewable energy projects. On 31 May 2010 the Commission presented in this respect its proposal, which provides for the creation of a dedicated financial instrument to support the development of energy efficiency and renewable energy projects in particular in urban settings. As result of a swift and constructive negotiation process during the 2nd half 2010, the Council of Ministers and the European Parliament agreed in December 2010 to the European Commission's proposal to allocate approximately EUR 146 million (i.e. 3.7% of the total EEPR envelope) towards such a new financing facility dedicated to sustainable energy. This EU contribution comes from EEPR funds mobilised in 2009 which could not immediately be allocated to projects in the 1st phase of the EEPR. The new facility will take the form of a dedicated investment fund, complemented by technical assistance and awareness raising. The initial shareholders of the fund will be the EU and the European Investment Bank. In addition to the EU contribution to the fund (about 125 M\u20ac) the EIB will invest up to EUR 75 million into the facility resulting in a total fund volume of about EUR 200 million. The Commission, in cooperation with the EIB, aims to launch this facility in the second quarter of 2011. Other financial institutions at Member State level have been invited and could join the fund afterwards. The final size of the fund will depend on additional investors (public but also private) and the eventual investment portfolio. The EU investment into the fund will be placed as risk capital into a \"European Energy Efficiency Fund\". This fund, which will be operated by a professional fund manager, will provide finance for investment projects by addressing market needs, preferably at municipal and local level. The fund will cover a large range of financial products such as senior and junior loans, guarantees or equity participation. In addition, about EUR 20 million of the EU funding will be made available as grants for project development services (technical assistance) related to technical and financial preparation of projects. Finally, awareness raising activities for national/regional authorities managing Cohesion/Structural funds in the field of sustainable energy are also envisaged. Potential beneficiaries are public authorities (e.g. municipalities), at local and regional level, and public or private companies, which are acting on behalf of those public authorities, such 55 Regulation (EC) no 663/2009 of 13 July 2009. It allocates respectively \u20ac2,365 million to gas and electricity infrastructure projects, \u20ac 565 million to offshore wind electricity projects (OWE) and \u20ac 1,050 million to carbon capture and storage projects (CCS).

This fund will invest in energy saving, energy efficiency and renewable energy projects, particularly in urban settings, which have a measurable and substantial impact on economic recovery within the EU. As regards energy saving/efficiency investments, promoted by local, regional and (where justified) national public authorities, these could include measures in public and private buildings; investments in efficient combined heat and power (CHP), incl. micro-cogeneration and district heating/cooling networks; investment in decentralised renewable energy sources, including micro-generation; clean urban transport; the modernisation of infrastructure, such as street lighting and smart grids, as well as investment in renewable energies with a potential for innovation and growth. 2.5.2. Promotion of eco-innovations For the period 2007-2013, the Entrepreneurship and Innovation Programme (EIP), one of the three pillars of the Competitiveness and Innovation Framework Programme (CIP), has earmarked \u20ac433 million for eco-innovation. Out of this budget, \u20ac200 million have been allocated to the High Growth and Innovative SME Facility (GIF) in view of supporting eco- innovation as well as other types of innovations in SMEs. GIF allows for the EU budget to participate in venture and risk capital funds set up to provide equity to small businesses in their early development and expansion stages. When the focus of these funds is mainly on eco-innovative SMEs, the EU participation, through the European Investment Fund, can be higher than normal thresholds (up to 50% compared to 25%). So far, the uptake from the market has been very satisfactory. Four agreements with Venture Capital funds (from 4 MS) investing in Eco-innovation have been signed with EU commitments of more than \u20ac50 million. Different types of eco-innovations, e.g. related to renewable energy sources, energy efficiency or waste and water treatment are financed by the funds. In an interim evaluation of the EIP, the efficiency of the GIF in terms of leverage has been highlighted. 56 The impact of this instrument on energy efficiency improvements or energy savings generated through eco-innovation in SMEs is yet not foreseeable as GIF is operational only since 2008 and investment periods are usually 5 years and beyond. An overall assessment will be possible at the end of the programme in 2013. Moreover, the discussions related to the next multiannual financial perspective of the Commission for 2014 - 2020, should also be used as an opportunity to propose possible refinements of the instrument. In the framework of the regulation on CO 2 emission standards for cars, eco-innovations are as well promoted (see 2.4.1). 2.5.3. Facilitating financing of energy efficiency investments: overall assessment Financing energy efficiency is a complex task as the investments projects are often very small and dispersed. With the cooperation engaged with International Financial Institutions on the financing of energy efficiency investments, the Commission has already made a major contribution to facilitate appropriate financing for SMEs and ESCOs. Credit lines from IFIs and other public sector banks, notably KfW, have provided an important source of finance to energy efficiency projects often through intermediated finance through local banks. While not 56 GHK 2009: Interim evaluation of the entrepreneurship and innovation programme DG Industry- European Commission ",
        "EN 29 EN a pre-requisite, effective use is often made of EU funding in order to provide technical assistance to either the participating bank for capacity building, or for supporting measures to final beneficiaries, such as energy audits and other project development services. However, it is evident that more innovative financial tools are needed to meet the investing challenge in energy efficiency. 2.6. Priority action 6: spurring energy efficiency in the new Member States The EEAP 2006 acknowledges that the potential for energy efficiency improvements is particularly large in the new MS and that energy efficiency is one of the priorities in the framework of cohesion policies. Against this background, the Action Plan defined as a priority action to spur energy efficiency in the new MS by: \u2022 Encouraging European Regional Policy to deploy its national and regional programmes to promote more intensive investment to improve energy efficiency, in particular in the new Member States, including in the multi-family and social housing sectors (2.6.1). \u2022 Promoting networking amongst Member States and regions to ensure financing of best practices in energy efficiency (2.6.2). 2.6.1. European regional policies (structural and cohesion funds) as instruments to promote energy efficiency The European Council agreed in December 2005 on the budget for the 2007-2013 period and allocated \u20ac 347 billion on Structural and Cohe sion Funds, of which 81.5% are planned to be spent in the \"Convergence\" regions. Based on simplified procedures, nearly all of the 436 programmes covering all EU regions and Member States were agreed before the end of 2007. The radical shift in their priorities means that one quarter of resources is now earmarked for research and innovation and about one third on environmental infrastructure and measures combating climate change, including energy efficiency. Financial support equivalent to 1.2% of the total budget or \u20ac4.4 billion are allocated to energy efficiency, cogeneration and energy management in the industrial, commercial, residential and public sectors. Until May 2009 support to residential buildings under the ERDF was possible but restricted to the EU12 and under limited conditions. Looking into the achievements so far, the following assessment can be made: First, major progress towards promoting more intensive investments in energy efficiency improvements through EU Regional Policy has been achieved with the adoption of two key regulatory amendments, initiated in the context of the European Economic Recovery Plan and adopted in May 2009 57 and June 2010 58 , respectively, relating to the: \u2022 Extension of the scope of financial support for housing to all MS : From now on, all MS have the possibility to support the housing sector with up to 4% of their national ERDF allocations, also in view of supporting social cohesion. This amendment represents an additional potential of up to \u20ac8 billion at EU level that could be reallocated from other 57 Regulation (EC) No 397/2009 on the European Regional Development Fund as regards the eligibility of energy efficiency and renewable energy investments in housing 58 Regulation (EU) No 539/2010 laying down general provisions on the European Regional Development Fund, the European Social Fund and the Cohesion Fund as regards simplification of certain requirements and as regards certain provisions relating to financial management, see Article 44. ",
        "EN 30 EN allocations in the present programmes for energy efficiency in housing, depending on to what extent the MS will chose to use these new possibilities. \u2022 Combination of Structural funds with private sector financing : As part of an operational programme, Structural Funds can now finance expenditures in respect of an operation comprising contributions to support: \u2013 Financial engineering instruments (e.g. JEREMIE) for enterprises, primarily small and medium-sized ones, such as venture capital funds, guarantee funds and loan funds; \u2013 Urban development funds, that is, funds investing in public-private partnerships and other projects included in an integrated plan for sustainable urban development (e.g. JESSICA); By the end of September 2010, seven JESSICA funds with an energy component are implemented in six MS, committed to invest a total of \u20ac784 million in energy efficiency measures and renewable energies infrastructure in cities. \u2013 Funds or other incentive schemes providing loans, guarantees for repayable investments, or equivalent instruments, for energy efficiency and use of renewable energy in buildings, including in existing housing. The first such fund established in Europe was set up in Greece in July 2010. Second, the picture concerning the effective use of the \u20ac4.4 billion allocated for energy efficiency in the MS shows a mixed result, but in general terms it is progressing at a slow pace. In autumn 2009, the overall EU average selection rate of projects in this area was 20% (to be compared with 27% for Cohesion Policy as a whole). Nevertheless, a number of MS offer some positive examples with a good level of selected projects (see graph 2), such as Czech Republic (49%), Lithuania (48%), Malta (44%), Austria (41%), Ireland (34%), Belgium (33%), Estonia (28%), the Netherlands (26%) and Germany (22%).

        "EN 31 EN Other MS present insufficient progress. Overall, the implementation of the energy priorities is advancing faster in the Regional Competitiveness and Employment (RCE) regions than in the Convergence ones. 59 Further, it is important to mention that not all investments in energy efficiency, inter alia in public buildings, are covered by the \u20ac 4.4 billion allo cation. Indeed, in a number of operational programmes of the 12 new MS, support to for example the educational and health sectors include the refurbishment of schools or hospital buildings. In this context, energy efficiency investments are included but not accounted for under the particular allocation to energy efficiency measures. Third, fourteen MS 60 reported having action in support of energy efficiency and renewable energy investments in the housing sector, following the priorities of the Recovery Plan, with or without modification of the Operational Programmes, and Estonia and Latvia were active in this area already from the outset of the period, which was possible in EU12. To conclude, it can be said that the financial resources available to MS from Structural and Cohesion Funds are not sufficiently channelled into investments to promote energy efficiency improvements. To this end, the Commission Communication \"Regional Policy contributing to sustainable growth in Europe 2020\" 61 sets out how managing authorities can realign current Regional Policy programmes to Europe 2020 sustainable growth objectives, among them the energy efficiency target. Regions and cities are encouraged to seize the new opportunities in energy investments in buildings and to accelerate investments in renewable energies and energy efficiency, according to their local energy potential. In this context, the importance of using Technical Assistance to facilitate the preparation of a pipeline of projects is singled out. 2.6.2. Networking to ensure financing of best practices in energy efficiency Since the adoption of the EEAP at the end of 2006, different types of schemes have been implemented to exchange information about best practices and ensure their financing. The main instrument in this context is the Intelligent Energy Europe Programme (IEE) established in 2003 to promote renewable energy sources and unlock the potential for energy efficiency in Europe. Although IEE is a relatively small financing programme (\u20ac250 million over 2003- 2006 and \u20ac 730 million over 2007-2013), it acts as a catalyst for further investments and contributes to the development of effective EU energy policy, as well as national/ regional policy making. The IEE programme also acts as a mechanism for testing and relaying new ideas, piloting of initiatives which are later scaled-up or rolled out to other Member States. The first IEE programme (referred to as IEE-1) started in 2003 and ended in December 2006. Projects financed under IEE-1 lasted between two and three years and started delivering results from 2007 onwards. More than 300 projects were supported and about half of them aimed at overcoming the market barriers to energy efficiency. Seventeen IEE-1 projects exclusively addressed networking and exchanging knowledge between countries and regions to ensure financing of best practices in energy efficiency. These projects covered best practices in financing, promoting energy services and procurement routines to local authorities, energy performance contracting, white certificates as well as innovative schemes tailored to refurbishment of social housing. 59 See http://ec.europa.eu/regional_policy/policy/reporting/cs_reports_en.htm. 60 BE, BG, DK, EL, ES, FR, IT, LT, LV, MT, NL, PL, PT, UK 61 COM(2011) 17, 26.1.2011 ",
        "EN 32 EN The second IEE programme (IEE-2) started in 2007 and runs until 2013. The funding rate for beneficiaries increased from 50% to 75% to encourage inter alia the participation of organisations from new MS. Among the IEE-2 projects supported so far, four are especially worth mentioning as being directly in line with the priority action defined: \u2022 Concerted Action (CA) on the Energy Services Directive (ESD) (2008-2011): This strategic 3-year action involves all MS and aims to achieve a certain degree of convergence across Europe in the implementation of the ESD Directive. One of the five core themes of the CA is on the use of financial instruments. It looks in particular on how to repeal and amend legislation that impedes or restricts the use of financial instruments for energy savings in the market for energy services; how to introduce funds for energy efficiency; how to design and implement tariff systems that promote energy efficiency; The Concerted Action is foreseen to be continued beyond 2011. \u2022 ChangeBest project 62 (2009-2012) aims to foster the development of energy service companies. \u2022 EESI project 63 (2009-2012) aims to promote energy performance contracting, in particular in pilot projects within the public sector. \u2022 FRESH project 64 (2009-2012) aims also at fostering energy performance contracting but targeting social housing refurbishment. The above-mentioned actions builds on so-called 'soft measures' \u2013 exchange of best practices, capacity building, promotion and dissemination \u2013 which impacts are by nature difficult to quantify in terms of energy savings. For the listed networking projects it is yet too early to assess their impacts as they have only started in 2009. However, wherever impacts of similar soft measures could be assessed, they proved to be very high compared to the level of Community support. As an example the IEE ClearSupport project (2007-2009) established Project Service Facilities in Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Czech Republic and Greece to assist housing associations, municipalities and building project developers on project identification, documentation and financing. At the end of September 2009, 218 renovation projects had been triggered by the ClearSupport project, representing about 18,000 tons of CO 2 savings. Overall the expected investment triggered by this project was more than 20 times the Community contribution. 65 2.6.3. Spurring energy efficiency in new Member States: Overall assessment The Commission has taken decisive steps to trigger energy efficiency investments in new Members States through the EU Regional Policy and through the exchange of Best Practices, in particular through the Intelligent Energy Europe programme. As shown in chapter 2.6.1, the challenge is that the financial resources available to MS from Structural and Cohesion Funds are not sufficiently channelled into investments to promote energy efficiency improvements. Hence the Commission will have to provide additional orientation and good practices to regional policy managing authorities and stakeholders in order to strengthen the instrument of regional policies to increase energy efficiency in new Member States. Moreover, to facilitate the take up of the financial allocations offered by EU Regional Policy to support energy efficiency, particularly for the building sector, 62 www.changebest.eu 63 www.european-energy-service-initiative.net 64 www.fresh-project.eu 65 www.clearsupport.eu ",
        "EN 33 EN opportunities for further synergies will be explored between energy policy instruments such as IEE (including its ELENA technical financing facility operated by the EIB) and the Covenant of Mayors. The IEE programme in particular offers the possibility to support capacity building of managing authorities, like it has been done in certain projects. 66 More generally the programme should continue to offer support to organisations from new MS to team up with partners in EU15 and develop concrete actions to trigger investment in energy efficiency, in particular in areas which offer a significant savings potential like the refurbishment of apartment blocks. 2.7. Priority action 7: a coherent use of taxation The Action Plan stated that experience has shown that taxation, as a means to internalise external costs, was a powerful tool in promoting energy efficiency. Therefore the Commission defined as a priority action to achieve a coherent use of taxation by committing to the following measures in the EEAP 2006: \u2022 Prepare a Green Paper on market based instruments (2.7.1); \u2022 Revise the Energy Taxation Directive to facilitate a more targeted and coherent use of energy taxation by integrating notably energy efficiency considerations and environmental aspects (2.7.2); \u2022 Consider the costs and benefits of using tax credits as incentives for enterprises, on one hand, to promote the increased production of certified energy-efficient appliances and equipment and for consumers, on the other hand, to promote the purchase of such appliances and equipment (2.7.3). 2.7.1. Green paper on market based instruments for environment and other policy purposes The Commission adopted in March 2007 a Green paper 67 on market-based instruments (MBIs) for environment and related policy purposes. Market-based instruments, such as taxes, charges and tradable permit schemes provide a flexible and cost-efficient means for reaching given policy objectives. In the Green Paper, the Commission explores a wide range of areas where the use of market-based instruments including taxation could be promoted further, such as energy consumption, environmental impact of transport and other areas of environment policy. More in particular the Green paper explores possible ways forward with the Energy Taxation Directive 2003/96/EC to make it more supportive of the EU energy and environmental policies in line with the EEAP 2006. The Green paper also addresses broader issues such as environmental tax reforms and role of taxation and fiscal instruments in general in the context of the integrated energy and climate change agenda of the EU. Based on the Green paper, the Commission launched in July 2007 a broad public consultation on advancing the use of MBIs for environment and energy related policy purposes in the Community. One outcome of the consultation was the suggestion to expand their use as an environment policy tool. 68 66 See www.promoscene.eu 67 COM(2007) 140 final 68 The analysis of the replies to the Green Paper have been published, see SEC(2009) 53 final; http://ec.europa.eu/environment/enveco/pdf/analyse_doc.pdf ",
        "EN 34 EN 2.7.2. Revision of the Energy Taxation Directive The current version of the Energy Taxation Directive (ETD) was adopted in October 2003 and entered into force on January 2004, but derogations applied in several areas. It creates an EU-wide system for the taxation of all energy products. The most important points of the current Community framework for energy taxation are: \u2022 Energy products are only be taxed when used as motor or heating fuel, not when used as raw materials, while electricity is taxed irrespective of its use; \u2022 Exemption of energy products or electricity used to produce electricity and electricity used to maintain the ability to produce electricity; \u2022 The \"levels of taxation\" applied by the Member States may not be lower than the minimum rates set in the Directive. \u2022 MS are allowed to differentiate between commercial and non-commercial diesel used for transport, and specific provisions apply to the taxation of commercial diesel; \u2022 Business use of energy products can be taxed at a lower rate than non-business use; \u2022 Energy products used for international air transport and navigation remain exempt from taxation (due to the existence of international commitments); \u2022 MS can choose to exempt, among other things, electricity from renewable energy sources and energy used for trains, metros, trams or trolley buses. The approach has been so far to provide for necessary minimum common rules to prevent a situation where differences in national energy taxation policies create distortions on the internal market. However, the current legislative framework does not explicitly incorporate environmental policy considerations. Without a revision, the current inconsistent treatment of energy sources in the ETD will remain, therefore taxation will not steer energy efficiency in a coherent way. Member States may refrain from actively using the taxation instrument for environmental policy purposes such as increasing energy efficiency. Therefore a revision of the ETD is necessary to provide a more robust framework for MS committed to pursue with the ambitious energy and environmental objectives through taxation. 2.7.3. Tax credits as incentives for enterprises and consumers The Commission published in December 2008 a study on \"the costs and benefits associated with the use of tax incentives to promote the manufacturing of more and better energy- efficient appliances and equipment and the consumer purchasing of these products.\" 69 The study deals with the fiscal instruments that could potentially be used to promote energy efficiency in the EU. It focuses on direct fiscal incentives (subsidies, tax credits to consumers and to manufacturers) and compares their costs and benefits with those of conventional tax instruments (energy taxation) and a regulatory measure. The costs and benefits are assessed for four different appliances selected for their high energy saving potential: refrigerators, washing machines, boilers and compact fluorescent lamps. In each case the assessment is carried out for two different EU Member States in order to capture the impact of different using patterns, price levels and market penetration of products. The countries included in the analysis are France, Denmark, Italy and Poland. 69 Biointelligence Services for European Commission/ DG TAXUD (2009): Study on the costs and benefits associated with the use of tax incentives to promote the manufacturing of more and better energy-efficient appliances and equipment and the consumer purchasing of these products, Final Report. http://ec.europa.eu/taxation_customs/common/publications/studies/index_en.htm. ",
        "EN 35 EN The study draws the following conclusions: \u2022 Energy taxation appears as the most cost-effective policy to promote energy efficiency in the EU; \u2022 Subsidies and tax credits have, however, a considerable potential of generating energy savings. In some cases energy savings induced by subsidy schemes (direct subsidies or tax credits) exceed those generated by energy tax increases manifold (e.g. refrigerators in France and Denmark). The subsidy schemes tend to have, however, higher welfare costs than the increases of energy taxation, which makes their benefit- cost balance in some cases negative (e.g. refrigerators in France); \u2022 The comparison of different incentive instruments reveals that direct subsidies and tax credits to consumers are much more cost effective than tax credits to manufacturers. In the latter case the welfare costs/ ton of CO 2 (\u20ac 650 in Italy and \u20ac 234 in Poland) exceed by far all the reasonable estimates of the CO 2 externality, and hence such policies would cost much more to the society than the benefits they could generate; \u2022 The regulatory measure (removing class B refrigerators or lower from the market) also turns out to have a relatively low capacity to generate energy savings compared with other policy options and therefore a fairly negative benefit- cost balance; The study was meant to inform the policy-makers about the costs and benefits of using direct tax incentives to promote the purchases of energy-efficient products. It remains in the competence of the Member States to use such instruments. 2.7.4. Coherent use of taxation: overall assessment of the priority action A coherent use of taxation is of paramount importance to trigger energy efficient behaviour. The Commission has put forward a Green paper on market based instruments and a study on tax incentives in the context of the EEAP's priority action on taxation. However, the main priority was to table a proposal for a revised energy taxation directive, which has not been finalized yet. Only once a revised energy taxation directive would enter into force, will a decisive step be achieved towards a more coherent use of taxation. Moreover they are still many taxation schemes in place which are inconsistent with our energy and climate objectives, such as the company car taxation benefits granted by legislation of various MS as it supports additional car use and also bigger, more polluting vehicles. 70 Taxation is thus an area which needs further attention, keeping in mind its strong subsidiarity character. 2.8. Priority action 8: raising energy efficiency awareness The Action Plan acknowledges that the efficient use of energy requires factors that motivate, facilitate and reinforce rational and responsible behaviour. Important predisposing elements for rational market behaviour are institutional capacity, awareness, and clear, credible and accessible information in energy-using technologies and techniques. Moreover, education and training are required for all stakeholders, and information technology is vital. It is against this background that the EEAP 2006 defined as priority action to raise energy efficiency awareness by developing through Community programmes: \u2022 Education and training plans and programmes for energy managers in industry and utilities (2.8.1); \u2022 Teaching aids for primary, secondary and vocational educational curricula (2.8.2). 70 See European Commission (2010): Taxation Paper \u2013 Company Car Taxation, Working paper 22 http://ec.europa.eu/taxation_customs/resources/documents/taxation/gen_info/economic_analysis/tax_pa pers/taxation_paper_22_en.pdf ",

These are detailed out in the annex of the EEAP and include inter alia : 1. Promotion of energy management schemes 2. Energy efficient procurement guidelines 3. Guidelines on how to promote energy efficient products 4. Training toolkits for industry, SMEs and the public sector 5. Reference document on Best Available Techniques on Energy Efficiency 6. Involvement of the Intelligent Energy Europe Programme Promotion of energy management schemes With the Eco-Management and Audit Scheme, EMAS, a voluntary environmental management system (EMS) was established, under which companies and other public organisations evaluate, manage and continuously improve their environmental performance. EMAS has been operative since 1995 71 and was originally restricted to companies in industrial sectors. Since 2001 EMAS has been open to all economic sectors including public and private services. 72 EMAS was strengthened by the integration of EN/ISO 14001 as the environmental management system required by EMAS, by adopting an attractive EMAS logo to signal EMAS registration to the outside world, and by considering more strongly indirect effects such as those related to financial services or administrative and planning decisions. Amending the EMAS regulation was explicitly listed as an EEAP measure and the latest revision (EMAS III) came into effect on 11 January 2010. Currently, more than 4,400 organisations and approximately 7,600 sites are EMAS-registered. In 2009, the Commission 73 analyzed the costs and benefits of EMAS registrations and found convincing evidence for a number of benefits, including reduced costs for resources and waste management, risk minimisation, regulatory compliance, regulatory relief, improved relations with internal and external stakeholders, and achieving competitive advantage. For SMEs, gaining access to public contracts was highlighted as a key benefit. For SMEs in the supply chain EMAS registration of client companies can have a direct impact. A growing number of small companies will need to demonstrate (or have already demonstrated) a recognised track record of regular, positive environmental management. In fact, often supplier companies are required to have EMAS registration in order to gain market access. For instance, in industry sectors close to the customer, suppliers note that their clients request EMAS registration. To help SMEs with establishing the EMAS, a specific toolkit has been developed. 74 The Commission committed to lead by example and started the EMAS registration process of its own buildings. The registration of all buildings will be finalized by 2014. The European Parliament is EMAS registered for their three sites Brussels, Luxembourg and Strasburg (see 2.2.3).

        "EN 37 EN While no energy efficiency procurement guidelines have been put forward, the Commission adopted in 2008 a communication \u201cPublic procurement for a better environment\" 75 to promote Green Public Procurement (GPP) as voluntary instrument for public authorities. GPP is defined as \"a process whereby public authorities seek to procure goods, services and works with a reduced environmental impact throughout their life cycle when compared to goods, services and works with the same primary function that would otherwise be procured.\u201d Green purchasing is also about influencing the market. By promoting and using GPP, public authorities can provide industry with real incentives for developing green technologies and products. In some sectors, public purchasers command a large share of the market (e.g. public transport and construction, health services and education) and so their decisions have considerable impact. A dedicated toolkit 76 was designed for use by public purchasers and by GPP trainers or for integration in general public procurement training courses and workshops. The Commission is following the GPP guidelines for its own procurement activities. Reference document on Best Available Techniques on Energy Efficiency In the context of the IPPC Directive, a Reference Document on Best Available Techniques on Energy Efficiency has been adopted in 2009 (see 2.3.1), which features exhaustive information on Energy Efficiency Management Systems (ENEMS) and the different techniques supporting its implementation is provided, such as: 77 \u2022 Planning actions and investments in an integrated way to continuously minimise the environmental impact of an installation; \u2022 Considering the installation and its systems as a whole, using energy efficiency design and selecting energy efficient process technologies for new and upgraded installations; \u2022 Increasing energy efficiency by increasing process integration, and refreshing the energy ENEMS periodically; \u2022 Maintaining sufficient staff expertise; \u2022 Communication of energy efficiency issues; \u2022 Effective process control and maintenance; \u2022 Monitoring and measuring energy usage; \u2022 Energy auditing; \u2022 Monitoring and benchmarking energy efficiency levels for installations and processes. Guidelines on how to promote energy efficient products Guidelines 78 have been prepared to facilitate the implementation of the regulation on ecodesign requirements for standby and off-mode power consumption of electrical and electronic household and office equipment ((EC) No 1275/2008), in particular for SMEs. Moreover, a brochure has been prepared on how ecodesign can help the environment by making products smarter, which was disseminated via the Europe Enterprise Network. 75 COM (2008) 400 76 http://ec.europa.eu/environment/gpp/toolkit_en.htm 77 EC (2009): Reference Document on Best Available Techniques on Energy Efficiency, chapter 2. 78 http://ec.europa.eu/energy/efficiency/ecodesign/doc/legislation/guidelines_for_ smes_1275_2008_okt_09.pdf ",
        "EN 38 EN Intelligent Energy Europe Programme In addition, many activities have been initiated to raise energy efficiency awareness in industry and SMEs in particular, under the umbrella of the Intelligent Energy Europe Programme. Some key projects targeting SMEs to optimize their energy use are: \u2022 CHANGE (09/2008-08/2010): 79 Supports SMEs in optimising their energy use by developing a European network of intelligent energy advisors at Chambers of Commerce and Industry (CCIs) and by kick-starting or enhancing concrete assistance to SMEs. This project, co-ordinated by EUROCHAMBRES involves 61 CCIs from 12 European countries. As a result of the project, more than 60 specifically trained Chamber advisors operate as \"first ports of call\u201d for SMEs in energy matters. Facilitating their access to information, organising information events, and encouraging businesses to take energy pre- checks, this advisors will bridge the gap between SMEs and existing services available on the market. Further, a reference manual for business organisations on how to advise SMEs on energy topics has been prepared in June 2010. \u2022 ENGINE (10/2007-03/2010): 80 Addresses managing and technical staff in SMEs of the automotive, metal and wood processing sectors as well as food industries and energy efficiency advisors in professional associations, Chambers of Industry and Commerce, energy service companies or relevant stakeholders in public authorities in the partner regions. The activities include specific energy efficiency checks for the SMEs and training for potential and existing energy advisors to support capacity building on both sides. Aims at setting up regional networks and promotional campaigns for energy efficiency in producing industries. 2.8.2. Teaching aids for primary, secondary and vocational educational curricula In the framework of the IEE Programme, about 20 energy education projects which involve over 200 beneficiaries from 26 MS have been launched. Around 5,000 schools across Europe have benefited directly from the actions with a huge replication potential to many millions of students, teacher and parents. In Summer 2006, the Commission already launched a raising awareness campaign \"You control climate change\". The Campaign website 81 has a dedicated section for schools, to enable teachers to use the provided teaching material in the classroom on a voluntary basis. In this context, the EEAP 2006 put forward a proposal to launch a vocational educational initiative on energy efficiency, which has not been initiated yet. However, a similar initiative 'Build up skills: Sustainable Building Workforce' will be launched by the Commission in 2011 in the framework of the IEE programme. 2.8.3. Achieving more energy efficiency awareness: overall assessment Promoting energy efficiency awareness is a key to promote the use of energy efficient products (lighting, appliances, cars) as well as the implementation of energy efficiency improvements measures by households, private companies and the public sector. 79 http://www.eurochambres.eu/Content/Default.asp?pageid=232 80 http://www.engine-sme.eu/ 81 http://ec.europa.eu/environment/climat/campaign/index_en.htm ",
        "EN 39 EN In the context of the EEAP 2006, the measures defined for priority action have been almost all finalized. The issue remains nevertheless relevant and should be further tackled in future policies. The role of training, especially for the labour force, becomes even more imperative as a well trained staff (workers) is a prerequisite to implement some key energy efficiency policies such as the renovation of the existing building stock with a view of improving its overall energy performance (see 2.2.3). 2.9. Priority action 9: Energy Efficiency in built-up areas About three quarters of the population in the EU live in built-up areas in or around cities and this urbanization trend will continue. Such urban areas consume 80% of the energy in the EU and emit about the same share of greenhouse gases. Shaping energy consumption patterns in built-up areas is in the hands of the responsible regional and local authorities. Consequently, triggering stronger commitment of cities and regions to act is key to reduce energy consumption at local level. To this end, the Commission defined as the ninth priority action to create a: \u201cCovenant of Mayors\u201d bringing together in a permanent network the mayors of 20-30 of Europe's largest and most pioneering cities. The aim is to exchange and apply best practices thereby improving energy efficiency significantly in the urban environment, where local policy decisions and initiatives are important, including transport. The Commission implemented this priority with a much more ambitious approach, upon which cities and regions commit formally to go beyond the objectives of the EU in terms of CO 2 reduction (more than 20% by 2020), by drafting and implementing Sustainable Energy Action Plans, subject to scrutiny by the Commission services. Covenant signatories accept termination of their involvement in the Covenant in case of non respect of their own commitment. The commitment is unilateral and not conditional to any kind of support by the EU. Covenant cities also commit to provide reports outlining the progress of their Action Plans. In order to allow smaller municipalities to be in a position to commit to the Covenant principles, the Commission signs agreements with the so called Supporting Structures, national and sub-national admin such agreements have been signed so far. The Covenant procedure was launched in January 2008. After a consultation period, representatives from cities and regions submitted to the Commission a final version of the Covenant text in October 2008. From that moment on, cities and regions start to adhere. By February 2009, when the first Covenant Ceremony took place at the European Parliament, 370 cities had joined. For the second Ceremony in May 2009, the Covenant consisted of 1680 signatories. The 2000 th signatory adhered in October 2009. More than 132 million people are living in a EU Covenant territory. The expected results in CO 2 tons avoided exceed 145 million tonnes per year by 2020. More than \u20ac8 billion have been mobilised in just one year of full operation. Overall assessment So far the investment by the Commission to facilitate the Covenant has been relatively small. The most important investment is linked to the European Local Energy Assistance facility (ELENA - see 2.5.1) operated by the European Investment Bank. Only through ELENA, almost \u20ac900 million were mobilised in Covenant terr itories in just 10 months in 2010 with an EU support of less than \u20ac8 million. Besides, the Covenant of Mayors will be extended to the European Neighbourhood Policy countries with a \u20ac5 million Decision in 2010. Through the ",
        "EN 40 EN Covenant, more than \u20ac300 million from the C ohesion Funds have been used in energy efficiency actions in local settings. In technical terms, several hundred Sustainable Energy Action Plans have been produced and submitted, with impressive results. UN agencies, other international organisations, multinational companies and foreign governments are requiring access to that information in order to develop new approaches. The Covenant attracted from the inception moment lots of media attention and high support by top decision-makers at EU and national level. 82 They have also taken the Covenant message to other fora, often outside the EU (for instance, in China, USA or Latin America). The main advantage of the Covenant lays in its bottom-up approach and full application of the subsidiarity principle. The role of the Commission is limited to provide a EU dimension and some supporting instruments and to guard the respect of the commitments. Because of that, it can be managed with very limited resources and high effectiveness. However, it will take some additional years to show whether the energy saving potential channelled through the Covenant of Mayors will be fully tapped. The success of the Covenant cities and regions will also to some large extend depend on provided financial and technical support. To this end, the Commission would need to further reinforce the Covenant, inter alia with additional resources to effectively tackle energy use in urban buildings and transport. 2.10. Priority action 10: Fostering energy efficiency worldwide The last priority action of the EEAP is to foster energy efficiency worldwide. To this end, the Commission stated it would take the initiative to reach a framework agreement with key external trading partner countries and international organisations. The agreement would focus on improving energy efficiency in end-use sectors and energy transformation and use a large number of policies and measures. 2.10.1. The international Partnership on Energy Efficiency Cooperation (IPEEC) The priority action has taken the form of the International Partnership for Energy Efficiency Cooperation (IPEEC). This is a major Commission initiative in the G8 context which was officially launched in 2009. It is a high level forum for enhancing and coordinating joint efforts to accelerate the adoption of sound energy efficiency improvement practices. The Partnership provides a forum for discussion, consultation and exchange of information. The present 15 members are the G8, the EU and the emerging economies Brazil, China, India as well as Australia, Mexico, and South Korea. IPEEC is open to all countries wishing to contribute to energy efficiency. A number of dedicated Task Groups work on issues such as sustainable buildings, energy management, and efficient equipment and appliance deployment. Meetings take place on a regular basis. 2.10.2. Other measures addressing energy efficiency worldwide In addition to the creation of IPEEC, the EEAP 2006 put forward more measures fostering energy efficiency beyond the EU, such as: 82 Presidents Barroso, Buzek, Van der Brande, Bresso, Zapatero and others have attended Covenant ceremonies and expressed full support.

Stronger energy efficiency focus in cooperation frameworks The focus on energy efficiency in the EU's bilateral relations has definitely increased. Cooperation on energy efficiency is systematically covered in negotiations on legal framework agreement with third countries. These agreements are often complemented by 'energy dialogues' with individual third countries or groups of countries and which take place on a regular basis including exchanges on energy efficiency (e.g. Brazil, India, Russia, the Gulf region). Energy efficiency is also included in Action Plans designed in the framework of the European Neighbourhood Policy. Moreover, improving energy efficiency measures and energy savings is covered in several Memoranda of Understanding on energy between the EU and third countries: China is a notable example. Regarding the ACP countries, EU-Africa Energy Partnership was launched in December 2007, featuring energy efficiency as one of its key elements. This partnership will be supported by concrete projects developed under a Thematic Program on environment and sustainable management of natural resources including energy as well as the EU-Africa Infrastructure Partnership. Worth mentioning is also the Action Plan on Sustainable Industrial Policy which has a strong focus on international cooperation. International cooperation on measurement methods for minimum efficiency requirements and labelling Cooperation on measurement methods are a focus in IPEEC which has a dedicated Task Group on the development of energy efficiency indicators, led by France. The issue is incidentally also being discussed in bilateral relations with major partners such as Russia. International network for dissemination of information and advice on efficient technologies The collaboration by members of the G8 + G5 in the context of the so called 'Heiligendamm Process' focused on extensive exchange of information on energy efficiency in buildings. This process was formally ended in 2009 but is being extended and actively taken up in the framework of IPEEC which has a specific Task Group on sustainable buildings. Voluntary agreements with export industries on information, minimum efficiency requirements and labelling The 'Energy Star' programme (see 2.1.4) contains a voluntary agreement on a label for office equipment. It is being applied in the EU, the US and also Japan. It has been renewed and reinforced in 2006 and is expected to be renewed again in 2011. ",

        "EN 43 EN 3. A CHIEVEMENTS IN ENERGY SERVICES While not explicitly selected as priority for the Commission to take immediate action, promoting the uptake of a market for energy services is nevertheless a priority area of the EEAP 2006. Against this background, this report looks into the achievements realized so far with the implementation of the key legislation on energy services. 3.1. Main objectives of the Energy Services Directive The Energy Services Directive (ESD) is a framework directive on end-use energy efficiency. The purpose of the ESD is to enhance the cost-effective improvement of energy end-use efficiency by: \u2022 Creating the conditions for the development and promotion of a market for energy services; \u2022 Providing mechanisms, incentives and institutional, financial and legal frameworks to remove existing market barriers and imperfections; \u2022 Triggering energy efficiency action in various areas (i.a. public sector); \u2022 Coordinating and monitoring saving activities through regular national energy efficiency action plans. The realisation of the directive\u2019s principle objective, i.e. the cost-effective improvement of energy end-use efficiency in the MS, will be achieved by setting energy savings targets of 9% for 2016, underpinned by interim targets for 2010. In other measures, the ESD sets out provisions which create the conditions needed for the development and promotion of a market for energy services and for the delivery of other energy efficiency improvement measures for final consumers. Box 1: The ESD target and the overall European energy saving objective It should be noted that the ESD target setting and the overall European 20% primary energy saving target are difficult to compare for several technical reasons: \u2022 The 9% ESD target is based on final energy consumption, excluding final use of the ETS installations or military use. In order to calculate the contribution to the 2020 primary energy saving target, the specific final energy targets need to be converted into primary energy. The outcome will depend on the national features of the saving measures, especially how many measures target electricity savings. The actual share of electricity savings versus heat savings under the ESD determines how big the ESD impact will be in primary terms. 83 \u2022 The 20% target aims at saving 368 Mtoe primary energy in 2020 compared to a projection. In the ESD, the connection between achieved savings and the resulting energy use level is looser as only 9% energy end-use energy savings have to be proven but not their impact on final or primary energy consumption. 83 This effect will be smaller for countries that already applied a weighting factor for electricity (default co-efficient is 2.5, see Annex II of the ESD). ",
        "EN 44 EN \u2022 The ESD target is set for 2016. The question is how much policy measures implemented as a result of the ESD will contribute towards the 2020 target in the 2016-2020 period. \u2022 Although the base year (5-year average) of the ESD should not be normalised (ESD Annex I), the energy savings under the ESD should be normalized, e.g. for weather conditions (see ESD Annex IV). \u2022 A share of early action savings (achieved before 2008 but after 1991/95 84 ) can be counted towards the target on the condition that they have a lasting effect. Early action savings achieved between 1991/95 and 2005 are already part of the PRIMES 2007 baseline (the fixed benchmark baseline for the 20% objective) and therefore do not contribute to the 20% target. Only early action implemented in 2006 and 2007 contributes to the 2020 target. In addition to setting end-use energy saving targets, the Directive obliges the Member States to prepare three national energy efficiency action plans (NEEAP) in which they report on their saving activities. The public sector is expected to fulfil an exemplary role in achieving the objectives of this Directive and must invest, maintain and ensure that related expenditure on energy-using equipment is spent bearing energy-efficiency in mind. Rules on improved consumer information and energy consumption are spelt out as are provisions on better metering and the billing of energy consumption. Depending on the chosen measures to achieve the saving targets, the impacts of the ESD can overlap with national implementation impacts from other Directives such as EPBD, ecodesign or labelling (see chapters 2.1, 2.2). This underlines the character of the ESD as framework Directive which was designed to back up and strengthen the implementation of other Directives that focus on end-use energy efficiency. 3.2. Level of implementation Member States had to transpose the Directive by May 2008. In the beginning, transposition of the Directive was slow with 20 reasoned opinions for non-communication issued by the Commission in February 2009. However, in the end of 2009 and beginning of 2010, the process of adoption of relevant national legislative and non-legislative measures in MS accelerated. In October 2010, 24 MS communicated full transposition while three Member States had a status on incomplete transposition with indication that the transposition in the countries would be closed by the end of 2010. Under the ESD, MS were also specifically required to adopt and submit their first NEEAP to the Commission not later than 30 June 2007. The first NEEAP were supposed to stimulate the translation of energy saving objectives into concrete and coherent measures and actions at the level of each MS. For many Member States this has been the first time they had to prepare such comprehensive national energy saving strategies and some delays with adoption of NEEAPs occurred. It was only in July 2008, i.e. a year after the deadline set in the Directive that the Commission was in receipt of all NEEAPs. The assessment in the first NEEAPs indicated that a number of MS had been successful in setting comprehensive frameworks for harnessing possibilities to reduce energy consumption 84 For details, see Annex I of the Energy Services Directive. ",
        "EN 45 EN cost-effectively. Yet, there have been some Member States which had some more difficulties in setting such frameworks. 85 Following bilateral communications with the Commission some MS (e.g. Lithuania, Hungary) on their own initiative revised their first NEEAP and adopted new significantly upgraded sets of policy measures. Some other MS adopted targets going beyond strict ESD obligations and looking at primary energy savings objectives with a time horizon for 2020. In order to support MS in transposing the Directive the Commission has set up a Concerted Action on the ESD (see chapter 2.6.2). The exchanges between MS carried out under the framework of the Concerted Action clearly helped with quicker implementation of new energy saving measures in many MS. These exchanges revealed also that even though the economic crisis created restrictions on public spending necessary for the proper implementation of many key measures set in the first NEEAP, a number of MS decided to introduce new policy measures in addition to their NEEAP as they considered smart investments in energy savings as an important instrument to improve energy security, create new jobs and fight against fuel poverty. 86 3.3. Expected impact of the Energy Services Directive As explained in chapter 3.1 the impact of the ESD may be overlapping with other EEAP instruments, depending whether MS make use of these instruments to reach the ESD's saving target. The full overview of ESD measures accountable for the end energy saving target will only be known as a result of the reporting in the second and third NEEAPs. However, it is possible to draw some first conclusions in terms of impacts out of the first NEEAPs and several research studies which have been signed out to this effect: \u2022 The 2009 analysis from Fraunhofer ISI (as part of the EU-27 Energy Savings Potential study). \u2022 The Commission's own assessment with help of PRIMES 2007 (benchmark baseline for the ESD) and PRIMES 2009 (including recession and additional policies effect). Based on the level of ambition claimed by the MS in their first NEEAPs, the final energy savings in Mtoe triggered by the ESD that could be achieved if MS manage to reach their national targets would have an accumulated effect of ca. 112-120 Mtoe. 87 The number includes \u201cearly actions\u201d taken by some MS before the adoption of ESD. 88 An assessment by Fraunhofer et al. (2009) 89 concluded that about one third of the cost- effective saving potential of the ESD sectors has been covered by the NEEAP targets. They estimated a cost-effective energy saving potential for activities covered by the ESD of at least 180 Mtoe of final energy use in 2016. 85 Synthesis of the complete assessment of all 27 National Energy Efficiency Action Plans, Commission Staff Working Document, 23.6.2009 (SEC 2009/889 final) 86 For example: a new revolving funds for energy efficiency in housing established in Estonia, Lithuania or a new support schemes for energy saving introduced in Ireland. 87 In some MS, the savings expected by some MS from the implementation on ESD are sometimes higher than their official commitments for final energy saving targets. 88 Some \u201cearly actions\u201d include measures implemented in MS back in 1991. 89 See Ecofys and Fraunhofer ISI. 2010. The feasibility of binding energy savings targets in the EU. Draft report. ",
        "EN 46 EN In their first NEEAP, MS attributed approximately one third of their savings to early actions before 2007 (which is allowed under the Directive). This would leave a net saving impact of 120 Mtoe final energy for the ESD for the period 2007-2016. With the assumption that 25% of the saving measures are targeting electricity consumption and using the conversion factor of 2.5 this would translate into some 165 Mtoe primary energy savings by 2016. This gross saving figure includes savings which can also be attributed to other measures. If we assume that some 60% of the measures taken up in the NEEAPs rest on other EU legislation, the net additional saving effect triggered by the ESD can be estimated at some 66 Mtoe primary energy savings for 2016. With the assumption that MS will continue their constant efforts on energy savings beyond 2016, net additional savings could reach some 95 Mtoe primary energy savings in 2020 . PRIMES 2007 can be considered the benchmark baseline for the ESD. PRIMES 2009 includes the national implementation measures of the ESD (as reported in the NEEAPs). With the help of both scenarios, the impact of new energy efficiency policies on end-users can be determined. As PRIMES 2009 does include the impact of the recession, we need to distinguish between the clear policy impact and the impact of the recession. The analysis will be done for industry, residential, tertiary and transport sector separately. However, by analysing PRIMES, a net impact of ESD on final energy savings in 2020 could be reduced down to 50 Mtoe. This more cautious figure can be attributed to different assumptions about the share of other EU policy measures counted in the ESD target, different lifetimes attributed to the measures or different assumptions about rebound effects. 3.4. Overall assessment The analysis shows that the underlying idea of the Energy Services Directive, that is triggering additional energy savings by setting a framework and backing up other savings Directives, has delivered positive results. As the Directive only tackles a special segment of the energy consumption side and is limited in scope and time, the benefits in terms of savings however stay considerably below the tangible potential. Further savings could be achieved by broadening the scope of the Directive as well as the obligations set by the Directive. This could be done by: \u2022 Discussing revised options for target setting which are closer linked to directly reducing energy consumption; \u2022 Stepping up provisions on cross-cutting measures such as financing, consumer information; \u2022 Turning the national energy efficiency action plan from a reporting tool into overall strategic policy documents to capture all energy savings and better describe the national energy efficiency policies; \u2022 Stepping up the obligations for the energy suppliers and integrating supply side efficiency. These items will be looked at in detail once results of the mid-term evaluation of the Energy Services Directive are available, delivering further in-detail results. ",
        "EN 47 EN 4. O VERALL CONTRIBUTION OF THE ENERGY EFFICIENCY ACTION PLAN The EEAP was proposed by the Commission with a view to move the EU towards reaping the 20% energy saving potential described in its Green Paper on Energy Efficiency and to maintain Europe's position as one of the most energy-efficient regions in the world. Although the EEAP is still in implementation until 2012, the first comprehensive assessment presented with this progress report unveils important achievements in most priority areas and priority actions addressed. 4.1. General achievements and limitations The very broad approach followed by the EEAP 2006 has the strong merit of addressing numerous ways for improving energy efficiency and provides for the first time an overarching European framework for energy efficiency measures in different sectors, addressing different stakeholders through different types of measures. The implementation of the EEAP has triggered significant positive developments by driving for new, better and implemented energy efficiency legislation: With over 20 legislative measures in its portfolio, the EEAP strongly pushed for the implementation of existing key Community legislation targeting efficient uses of energy inter alia in buildings (EPBD), products (Ecodesign, labelling), services (ESD), in energy transformation (CHP) and in rail transport. It further strengthened selected key legislation by putting forward their revision (EPBD, ecodesign and labelling Directives). Moreover it introduced new legislation addressing fuel efficiency of cars (minimum emission standards, labelling of tyres) and the uptake of clean vehicles through public procurement. EEAP further supported the implementation process of legislative measures with targeted instruments such as financing (e.g. ERDF, ELENA), Reference Documents on Best available techniques, guidelines, and promoted the exchange of best practices in energy efficiency, inter alia through the creation of information platforms (e.g. Concerted Actions in buildings and energy services, Bucharest Forum, etc.) within the EU but also internationally (e.g. IPEEC). It is undisputed that these achievements bring Europe closer to the EEAP's overarching objective to deliver the most energy-efficient infrastructure, buildings, appliances, processes, transport means and energy systems. Looking at the detailed level of measures proposed, it can be noted that the majority of the priority actions have been initiated and finalized (see chapter 2) and that the majority of the 85 measures proposed in the EEAP have been completed or are in the process of being finalized. Only a few have not been addressed now (see annex 1). Despite the strong impact, in contrast, some aspects of the EEAP limit its overall effectiveness. Indeed, its approach of listing 85 measures lead to a political reality where the Plan is often perceived as a technical document more than a strong and visible political commitment to energy efficiency and savings. Although an overarching aim was defined, it lacks clear objectives for the different sectors and the measures proposed are not directly interlinked. Further, the EEAP is mainly conceived as (priority) actions to be taken by the Commission, while the success of many measures depends to a large extend on their level of implementation in Member States (e.g. in the case of legislation) and the interplay with supportive measures (e.g. financing). ",
        "EN 48 EN 4.2. Contribution of the EEAP to the energy saving objective in 2020 In addition to the assessment of the individual progress made with each priority action (chapter 2), it is imperative to provide an appraisal of the overall contribution of the Plan towards the 2020 energy saving objective. Such an overall review is a complex task when approaching it from a bottom-up perspective, i.e. by adding up savings from single measures, to generate an aggregated impact. Indeed, overlaps resulting from interacting measures targeting the same sector would need to be identified and accounted for when compiling the overall impact. As an alternative, a top-down approach can be used to estimate the overall impact of the EEAP measures. To this end, the Energy Model called PRIMES, developed by the Technical University of Athens on behalf of the Commission, was used. At the time of the EEAP's adoption in 2006, it was estimated that it had the potential to deliver 14% energy savings by 2020 compared to a baseline scenario of the Energy Model PRIMES. To observe the effects at the macroeconomic level, it is necessary to compare the changes between the baseline used for the EEAP impact assessment 90 and the newest available one taking into account the impact of major EEAP measures implemented until the end of 2009 as well as other economic developments affecting primary energy consumption. This suggests that the energy efficiency policies are expected to deliver not 14% but about half of the savings objective in 2020. However, it should be pointed out that these projections do not take into account policies in the pipeline, especially the forthcoming ecodesign implementing measures as well as adopted policies in full such as the recast Energy Performance of Buildings Directive. This would have an additional impact on reducing future consumption. 4.3. Way forward \u2013 A new Framework on Energy Efficiency Policies The experience gained with the implementation of the EEAP is valuable for the design of any new European framework for energy efficiency policies. The following main conclusions can be drawn: \u2022 A full and ambitious application of existing energy efficiency legislation by Member States is crucial to deliver the full potential of energy savings in practice; \u2022 As energy savings are realized at national and local level, it is important to steer and mobilize action at all levels of government; \u2022 Supporting tools need to be strengthened or expanded further to increase the impact of legislation, such as National Energy Efficiency Plans, monitoring systems, access to financing and training; \u2022 More ambitious measures are needed to tackle energy consumption in all sectors; \u2022 An overarching energy efficiency framework with a longer term perspective is needed to trigger lasting political commitment towards energy efficiency improvements and energy savings. It needs to be streamlined and focused on main policy objectives, containing clear priorities without getting too technical. Any new framework should imperatively build upon the experiences gained with the implementation of the EEAP 2006 and propose additional policies to close the gap and realize 90 The baseline used for the EEAP assessment dates from 2005. This baseline has been updated in 2007 taking into account all energy efficiency policies and measures adopted until the end of 2006. As the assumption for the Gross Inland Consumption of energy are the same between the two baselines, it is recommend to use the baseline update from 2007 to coincide better with the implementation start of the new Energy Efficiency Action Plan in 2006.

Completed 1.7.3 Propose minimum performance requirements (kWh/m\u00b2) for new and renovated buildings and some components with a target for new buildings to approach the level of passive houses from 2015. \u2022 Setting EU-level harmonised cost-optimal minimum energy performance requirements for the various types of new and renovated buildings has proven to be an unfeasible option because of the very different local conditions (e.g. climate, culture, history, taxation, labour costs). This issue was solved through the provisions in the recast that Member States set minimum energy performance requirements for buildings with a view to achieving cost-optimal levels. This means the energy performance level which leads to the lowest cost during the estimated lifecycle. \u2022 The level of ambition of these nationally set equipments will be checked using the European comparative methodology framework, which shall be defined in detail under a Comitology process in 2010-2011. If there are major discrepancies MS would have to justify in writing why the gap exists and if the gap cannot be justified then they have to send a plan of how they plan to close it. \u2022 MS have to draw national plans for the increasing the number of nearly zero-energy buildings (e.g. close or more ambitious to the passive houses) and include in them intermediate target for their share of new build in 2015.
