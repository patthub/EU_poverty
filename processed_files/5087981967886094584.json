        "EN 2 EN EXPLANATORY MEMORANDUM 1. CONTEXT OF THE PROPOSAL \u2022 Reasons for and objectives of the proposal On 7 June 2016, the Commission adopted a Communication on establishing a new Partnership Framework with third countries under the European Agenda for Migration . 1 Alongside a variety of measures proposed to address the most urgent needs of refugees as well as supporting host communities, the Commission calls for a long term strategy by which the EU will promote the sustainable development goals of the 2030 Agenda and thus continue to address root causes of migration. This is also in line with the EU Global Strategy for Foreign and Security Policy with embeds challenges such as migration in the overall EU foreign policy, ensuring coherence and synergies with European Development and Neighbourhood policies and European economic diplomacy. The European Council of 28 June 2016 invited the Commission to present a proposal for an ambitious External Investment Plan (EIP) by September 2016. The EIP will be based on three pillars working hand in hand: a new investment fund (pillar 1); technical assistance (pillar 2), to help local authorities and companies to develop a higher number of sustainable projects and attract investors; and finally a range of dedicated thematic, national and regional EU development cooperation programmes combined with structured political dialogue targeted at improving the investment climate and overall policy environment in the countries concerned (pillar 3). Pillar 3 of the EIP is the link between the European Fund for Sustainable Development (EFSD) and the broad partnership between the EU and its partner countries. This partnership materialises in political and in policy dialogue that the Commission undertakes through EU delegations and political contacts. Pillar 1 will be implemented through the EFSD. The EFSD will have the key objective of providing an integrated financial package to finance investments starting in the regions of Africa and the Neighbourhood 2 . The EFSD will be composed of regional investment platforms, which will combine financing from existing blending facilities 3 and the EFSD Guarantee. It will operate as a \"one-stop shop\" to receive financing proposals from financial institutions and public or private investors and deliver a wide range of financial support to eligible investments. The key objective of the EFSD is to provide an integrated financial package to finance investments starting in regions of Africa for countries that are signatories to the Partnership Agreement between the members of the African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) Group of States of the one part, and the European Community and its Member States, of the other part, 1 COM(2016) 385 2 As defined for Africa by the Cotonou Agreement (OJ L 287, 04.11.2010), and for the EU Neighbourhood by Regulation (EU) No 232/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 2014 establishing a European Neighbourhood Instrument (OJ L 77, 15.3.2014, p. 27). 3 For Africa, see Commission Decision (2015)5210 and for the Neighbourhood Commission Implementing Decision (2016)3436.

The EFSD is expected to mobilise up to EUR 44 000 000 000 investments with funds from the general budget of the Union and other sources of EUR 3 350 000 000 until 2020. \u2022 Consistency with existing policy provisions in the policy area Within the framework of the principles and objectives of the Union's external action, of the revised European Neighbourhood Policy 5 , the European Consensus on Development 6 and of the Agenda for Change 7 and subsequent modifications and additions thereto, a primary objective of cooperation under this Regulation should be the reduction and, in the long term, the eradication of poverty in line with Article 208 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU), thus addressing root causes of migration. In addition, cooperation under this Regulation should also contribute to: fostering sustainable and inclusive economic, social and environmental development, consolidating and supporting democracy, the rule of law, good governance, human rights, gender equality and the relevant principles of international law; implementing a rights-based approach (RBA) encompassing all human rights in line with its guiding principles (transparency, participation, non-discrimination, accountability) and implementing the Gender Action Plan 8 . The EFSD aims at supporting investments starting in regions of Africa for countries that are signatories to the Cotonou Agreement- and the Neighbourhood as a means to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals, thus tackling root causes of migration and offering sustainable reintegration to returned migrants in their countries of origin. It is therefore consistent with the Union's instruments for financing external actions and with existing investment facilities. Through its emphasis on private sector involvement the EFSD will also promote the objectives described in the Communication 'A Stronger Role of the Private Sector in Achieving Inclusive and Sustainable Growth in Developing Countries'. 9 \u2022 Consistency with other Union policies The EIP is part of the EU new Partnership Framework with third countries under the European Agenda for Migration. The Plan is aligned with the reviewed European Neighbourhood Policy (ENP) 10 which focuses on supporting economic development in partner countries, to progressively achieve stabilisation and transition from emergency to structural response. It is also aligned with the Addis Ababa Action Agenda on Financing for Development. 4 OJ L 317, 15.12.2000 as last amended by OJ L 287, 4.11.2010. 5 JOIN(2015) 50 final 6 OJ(2006/C 46/01) 7 COM(2011) 637 final 8 SWD(2015) 182 final 9 COM(2014) 263 final 10 JOIN(2015) 50 final ",
        "EN 4 EN The EFSD is coherent with the EU policies in the area of climate change as it will contribute to the implementation of the Paris Agreement on Climate Change (COP 21) 11 including its international climate finance commitments. As explained in the Commission Communication The Road from Paris: assessing the implications of the Paris Agreement 12 , the Paris Agreement is an opportunity for economic transformation, jobs and growth. It is a central element in achieving broader sustainable development goals, as well as the EU priorities of investment, competitiveness, circular economy, research, innovation and energy transition. 2. LEGAL BASIS, SUBSIDIARITY AND PROPORTIONALITY \u2022 Legal basis Since the EFSD aims at enhancing investments both in developing and other third countries, the legal basis for the cooperation activities is thus Article 209(1) (for developing countries) and 212(2) (for other third countries) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. \u2022 Subsidiarity (for non-exclusive competence) and proportionality In accordance with the principles of subsidiarity and proportionality set out in Article 5 TFEU, the objectives of the proposed action cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States and can therefore be better achieved by the EU. Action at Union level can better achieve the objectives pursued, by reason of its scale and effects. More specifically, the intervention at EU level will catalyse private investment from the whole EU and third countries, making best use of the European Institutions and their expertise and knowledge for that purpose. The set-up of the Strategic Board will ensure consistency and coherence between multiple programmes and initiatives at European level. The multiplying effect and the impact on the ground will thus be much higher than what could be achieved by an investment programme from a single Member State or a group of Member States. \u2022 Choice of the instrument It is suggested to set up the EFSD and establishing the EFSD Guarantee Fund through the adoption of a Regulation of the European Parliament and the Council in ordinary legislative procedure. The establishment of a guarantee bearing a contingent liability for the Union has to be done by the legislator. The Commission is proposing in parallel a revision of Regulation (EU, Euratom) No 966/2012 of the European Parliament and the Council. 3. STAKEHOLDER CONSULTATIONS AND COLLECTION OF EXPERTISE \u2022 Stakeholder consultations Informal exploratory consultations have taken place with the European Investment Bank (EIB), Member States' Financial Institutions, the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) and the World Bank Group. The EU Platform for Blending in External Cooperation (EUBEC) was also consulted as well as the private sector and civil society organisations. 11 COM(2015) 81 final/2 12 COM(2016) 110 ",
        "EN 5 EN \u2022 Collection and use of expertise The Commission has established extensive experience with similar instruments, such as the European Fund for Strategic Investment (EFSI) 13 for EU internal policies and several financial instruments and structured grants supported by the EU blending facilities for EU external policies 14 . The objective has been to mobilise additional investment, in particular from private investors, through the provision of partial guarantees or risk cushions on a first- loss or pari passu basis to financial institutions, typically the public financial institutions currently present in EU Blending in external action, which themselves provide support (through loans, guarantees, equity or similar products). \u2022 Fundamental rights Projects benefitting from guarantees under the EFSD will be examined for their impact on fundamental rights. Within the framework of the principles and objectives of the Union's external action, of the revised European Neighbourhood Policy 15 , of the European Consensus on Development 16 and of the Agenda for Change 17 and subsequent modifications and additions thereto: (a) the primary objective of cooperation under this Regulation shall be the reduction and, in the long term, the eradication of poverty, addressing root causes of migration; (b) cooperation under this Regulation will also contribute to: (i) fostering sustainable and inclusive economic, social and environmental development, (ii) consolidating and supporting democracy, the rule of law, good governance, human rights, gender equality and the relevant principles of international law, (iii) implementing a rights-based approach (RBA) encompassing all human rights in line with its guiding principles (transparency, participation, non-discrimination, accountability), iv) implementing the Gender Action Plan 18 . The achievement of those objectives shall be measured using relevant indicators, including human development indicators, in particular sustainable development goals and other indicators agreed at international level by the Union and its Member States (e.g. UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights). 4. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS The Union will make available a total of EUR 750 000 000 for the EFSD Guarantee until 2020 stemming both from the Union's general budget and the 11 th European Development Fund (EDF) 19 . Further financing could be foreseen. The Commission intends to propose the mobilisation of the contingency margin to provide EUR 250 000 000. Other contributions from the Union budget would be made by the use of redeployments or refocusing of programmed funds. Further financing could also include other contributions by other contributors, such as Member States. 13 Regulation (EU) 2015/1017 of the European Parliament and Council of 25 June 2015 on the European Fund for Strategic Investment Advisory Hub and the European Investment project Portal and amending regulations (EU)No1291/2013 and (EU) no1316/2013- the European Fund for Strategic Investments, OJ L 169/1,1.7.2015 14 For Africa, see Commission Decision (2015)5210 and for the Neighbourhood.

OTHER ELEMENTS \u2022 Implementation plans and monitoring, evaluation and reporting arrangements The EFSD will be managed by the Commission and implemented through regional investment platforms, which will combine financing from existing blending facilities for Africa and for the Neighbourhood and the granting of the EFSD Guarantee. \u2022 Detailed explanation of the specific provisions of the proposal The EFSD shall consist of the regional investment platforms, which will combine financing from existing blending facilities for Africa and for the Neighbourhood and the granting of the EFSD Guarantee. Regional investment platforms will be focused to pursue the achievement of the sustainable development goals and better address root causes of migration. For the purposes of the EFSD initiative the Africa Investment Facility 20 and the Neighbourhood Investment Facility 21 will have their objectives refocused and will be renamed to become the new respective regional investment platforms relying on the existing structures. This will be done by Commission Decision. The regional investment platforms will have identical structures as the existing blending facilities. The Commission will be advised by a Strategic Board and two Operational Boards, one for each Regional Investment Platform. The Commission will manage the EFSD Secretariat, which will ensure the performance of all tasks and functions needed to fulfil the objectives of the EIP. The Strategic Board, co-chaired by representatives of the Commission and of the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy and composed of the Member States and the EIB, will give strategic guidance and help the Commission set overall investment goals as regards the use of the EFSD Guarantee, ensuring coordination and coherence between the Regional Investment Platforms and with the External Lending Mandate, the Resilience Initiative and the ACP Investment Facility managed by the EIB. The EIB will actively contribute through advisory functions to the Commission as regards the operational management of the guarantee. A sound technical assessment and due diligence as well as a swift implementation of individual projects will be ensured. The bankability and risk of the projects will be assessed by the eligible counterparts and verified by independent experts to ensure the credibility vis-\u00e0- vis the private sector, before the investment proposals are approved by the Commission. The detailed practical modalities of how to implement the guarantee will be decided for each investment window. The creation of additional investment platforms can be considered in the future.

(8) Moreover, the Strategic Board should support the Commission in setting strategic guidance and overall investment goals. The Strategic Board should also support coordination and coherence between the regional platforms. This should ensure complementarity of the various instruments in external action. The Strategic Board should be co-chaired by the Commission and the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy to ensure consistency and coherence with Union external policy objectives and partnership frameworks with third countries.

        "EN 26 EN 1.4.3. Expected result(s) and impact Specify the effects which the proposal/initiative should have on the beneficiaries/groups targeted. The European Fund for Sustainable Development (EFSD) will include a new Guarantee providing a range of innovative instruments to crowd-in private sector, such as guarantees covering specific risks in infrastructure projects. A multiplier effect should be generated by means of the provision of the EU guarantee. Like the European Fund for Strategic Investments (EFSI) and several financial instruments supported by the EU blending facilities since 2007, the EFSD Guarantee Fund aims to mobilise additional investments, in particular from private investors. It does so by providing partial guarantees, either on a first-loss or pari passu basis, to intermediary financial institutions (typically IFIs), which in turn provide support (via loans, guarantees, equity or similar products) to downstream beneficiaries. There are thus two layers of leverage between the EU budget guarantee provided and the total investment mobilised. At the first level, the EU guarantee enables the intermediary IFI to provide an amount of additional financing (\"internal leverage\"). At the second level (\"external leverage\"), the IFI financing mobilises additional investment at the project stage. Thereby the global initiative including the blending activities should help to mobilise total investments of up to EUR 44 billion until 2020. 1.4.4. Indicators of results and impact Specify the indicators for monitoring implementation of the proposal/initiative. A common and minimum set of indicators that reflect project outputs and intended outcomes has been defined for blending operations. These indicators can be used for monitoring implementation of the European Fund for Sustainable Development (EFSD) Guarantee . 1.5. Grounds for the proposal/initiative 1.5.1. Requirement(s) to be met in the short or long term The European Fund for Sustainable Development (EFSD) provides the means for implementing the policy objectives of the External Investment Plan (pillar 1) as outlined in the Commission Communication of 7 June 2016 on establishing a new Partnership with third countries under the European Agenda on Migration. The EFSD will have the key objective of providing an integrated financial package to finance investments in regions outside the EU. This involves mobilising both public and private investments in Africa as well as the Neighbourhood. 1.5.2. Added value of EU involvement The European Fund for Sustainable Development (EFSD) aims at promoting innovative and additional types of support, notably through the new Guarantee and credit enhancement. The new Guarantee coverage will encompass innovative instruments notably aimed at addressing bottlenecks to private investment, that are not yet addressed by the market itself, such as first-loss guarantees to portfolios of ",
        "EN 27 EN guarantees to private sector projects, risk capital, SME loan guarantees or guarantees covering specific risks in infrastructure projects. The operations financed or guaranteed through the instruments of the European Fund for Sustainable Development (EFSD) represent a highly visible and effective tool in support of the Union's external action. The EFSD provides the necessary EU political and financial backing for the Eligible Counterpart financing in countries and to investment projects which otherwise would not be able to comply due to high risk. 1.5.3. Lessons learned from similar experiences in the past The Commission has gained valuable experience with innovative financing instruments. Since first introduced at the beginning of the Multiannual Financial Framework 2007-2013, blending gradually evolved into an important tool of EU external cooperation, complementing other methods of implementation. EU regional blending facilities have been set up in all regions of EU external cooperation. By the end of 2015, the support approved under the facilities from the EU budget and EDF resources has reached a sum of around EUR 2.7 billion, generating around EUR 50 billion total investments. The predecessor to the Neighbourhood Investment Platform (NIP), the Neighbourhood Investment Facility (NIF), has a successful track record to show: allocations to the NIF from the EU Budget have reached since 2007 a total of EUR 1.432 billion. Additionally, Member States have contributed to the NIF Trust Fund with more than EUR 80 million. This has enabled the implementation of 112 projects with NIF support. The NIF contribution has succeeded in mobilising approximately EUR 13.83 billion of financing from European and International Finance Institutions since 2008 and a total investment amount of about EUR 28.10 billion, i.e. a leverage of about 20 times in investment for every euro provided by the Facility. In Africa, the EU-Africa Infrastructure Trust Fund (AITF) was set up in 2007 and has provided since then support to projects for a total of more than EUR 500 million mainly in energy, transport and water sector. In 2015, the Africa Investment facility (AfIF) was created via Commission Decision C (2015)5210 39 . Over the period 2007-2013, two facilities were subject to a mid-term evaluation (MTE), the EU-AITF in 2012 and the Neighbourhood Investment Facility (NIF) in 2013. Both concluded that these are valuable and effective instruments in supporting their respective objectives: European Neighbourhood Partnership (ENP) objectives and the development of infrastructure in Africa. In particular, project identification, relevance and design were considered positive, and both instruments achieved their goal of leveraging significant financial resources. The MTE also pointed to the significant contribution brought to the development of partnerships and increased coordination and cooperation among finance institutions as well as with the 39 C(2015) 5210 final, 29.7.2015, Commission Decision on the individual measure \"Creation of the Africa Investment Facility\" under the 11 th European Development Fund ",
        "EN 28 EN Commission. A number of recommendations were made, notably in terms of improvements to the decision making structure and in particular on the role of EU Delegations and partner countries, further exploring the involvement of private sector, as well as the use of specific financial instruments such as risk mitigation instruments, and finally the implementation of a result measurement framework. These findings have been used, with other reports, by the EU Platform for blending in external cooperation (EUBEC), set up in December 2012, to make concrete recommendations for further increasing the effectiveness of aid delivered by the EU through blending. The European Court of Auditors published a special report on blending in October 2014. The conclusions were very much in line with the above: blending the regional investment facility grants with loans from financial institutions to support EU external policies was found generally effective and projects were relevant. The recommendations covered the following aspects: to ensure documented assessment of the additionality resulting from the EU grant, to ensure the maturity of projects submitted to the executive boards, to produce guidelines on EU Blending operations, to ensure more proactive role of the EU Delegations, to simplify the decision making process, to improve Commission's monitoring of the projects and to ensure appropriate visibility for EU funding. Almost all of these recommendations have already been dealt with by the EUBEC with the development of a harmonised and improved project application form and its guidelines as well as the development of a results measurement framework including standard indicators. Additionally, following the requirement of Article 140 of Regulation (EU, Euratom) No 966/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council on the financial rules applicable to the general budget of the Union and repealing Council Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 1605/2002, applicable by virtue of Article 17 and Articles 40 of Council Regulation (EU) 2015/323, an ex-ante evaluation of the AfIF was carried out in 2014 on how the planned facility complies with the requirements of the Financial Regulation (FR) for the financial instruments. The recommendations of this evaluation have been taken into account in the management of the AfIF and will be relevant for the EU Africa Investment Platform. The results of the ex-ante evaluation demonstrated that the nature, magnitude and focus of the challenges faced by Africa (e.g. urbanisation, degrading access to essential service, food insecurity, poverty, impacts of climate change), the current EU and partner countries cooperation objectives (i.e. sustainable and inclusive development and growth, continental integration, poverty eradication, climate change) and the need to mobilise additional financial resources require a new flexible framework of financing. Taking those results into account and with the additional objective of addressing root causes of migration, the Africa Investment Platform (AIP) can provide a value added in sectors which represent key challenges in Africa. Through a wide range of forms of assistance to be adjusted to the country risks, specific project and sectors, AIP will contribute to inclusive growth and the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals, thus tackling some of the root causes of migration. The current portfolio and pipeline used in the AfIF provides for projects that contribute to the objective of addressing roots causes of migration. Whereas job ",
        "EN 29 EN creation is the main focus of projects supporting the financial sector and Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) through local banks or dedicated trust funds or projects supporting agriculture, finance, and rural development, including rural roads and electrification, employment opportunities may also be the result of particular infrastructure projects in the (renewable) energy sector or wider transport sector including not only rural roads, but also road and port construction and rehabilitation. Job creation and poverty reduction have been mentioned as an outcome of some energy projects listed in the AITF annual report. A screening of the AITF portfolio and the AfIF pipeline indicate that these blending mechanisms contribute to the objective of addressing root causes of migration, leveraging finance from the partner finance institutions involved. A screening of the 150 projects in the current AfIF pipeline reveals that possibly up to 30% of the projects could be relevant to contribute to tackling root causes of migration. Some projects target job creation and support of MSMEs as the main objectives, while the majority of the projects targets socio-economic development and resilience and in some instances also job creation and poverty reduction as a secondary effect. Out of the 23 specific countries listed as eligible under the EFSD, 18 countries are covered by the current AfIF pipeline for the Sahel/Lake Chad and for the Horn of Africa regions. The 2015 Review of the European Neighbourhood Policy reiterated that economic and social development should be at the heart of the EU's contribution to stabilising the neighbourhood and building partnerships. The EU should step up cooperation with the International Financial Institutions, relevant international organisations on private sector development, and initiatives that promote inclusive growth and employment and improve living conditions. In addition actions to strengthen partnerships with the private sector should be promoted, and the use of innovative approaches such as blending grants and loans as an important way of leveraging additional resources and increasing the impact of EU aid should be boosted. It also stresses the need to focus efforts on the development of skills, on competences and creation of opportunities particularly for young men and women. A new evaluation of the blending facilities is currently undergoing and the final report should be available before the end of 2016. 1.5.4. Compatibility and possible synergy with other appropriate instruments As outlined in the Communication of 7 June 2016 on establishing a new Partnership with third countries under the European Agenda on Migration, the Commission is proposing an ambitious External Investment Plan that would address root causes of migration. It is proposed to establish a new strategic framework with a new governance structure, including a one-stop-shop approach that deploys a range of innovative financing instruments to crowd-in private sector to adress root causes of migration by boosting investments starting in the regions of in Africa and the EU Neighbourhood. It will build on the existing architecture of EU financing instruments and resources.

With funds from the EDF and the EU budget of EUR 3.35 billion until 2020 (of which EUR 0.75 billion are initially intended for the EFSD Guarantee Fund), the EFSD is expected to mobilise up to EUR 44 billion in investments. Out of the EUR 3.35 billion, EUR 2.6 billion will be provided by refocusing existing blending instruments. The present proposal for a Regulation implies the mobilisation for the EFSD Guarantee Fund of EUR 350 million from the EU budget and EUR 400 million from the EDF. The core of the new investment plan is the EFSD, which will provide an overall framework based on three pillars: a new investment fund (pillar 1); technical assistance (pillar 2), to help local authorities and companies develop a higher number of sustainable projects and attract investors; and a range of dedicated thematic, national and regional EU development cooperation programmes combined with structured political dialogue targeted at improving the investment climate and overall policy environment in the countries concerned (pillar 3). These three pillars shall be complementary and provide a wide coordinated approach. The EFSD will include the refocused existing blending facilities and a new Guarantee providing a range of innovative instruments to crowd-in private sector, such as guarantees covering specific risks in infrastructure projects. The Regional Investment Platforms will combine existing blending instruments, will operate as \"one-stop shop\" to receive financing proposals from IFIs, public or private investors, and will deliver a wide range of financial support to eligible investments. By enabling joint European operations (combining bilateral and EU grant funding with eligible finance institutions loan operations), the AIP will generate greater coherence and better coordination between the donors, in line with the Paris Declaration principles and in compliance with the EU Financial Regulation. Member States' resources will reinforce the EU effort by strengthening the European dimension of external cooperation and enhancing EU visibility. 1.6.

For the purposes of the Commission's accounting, its reporting of the risks covered by the EFSD Guarantee and its management of the EFSD Guarantee Fund, the Eligible Counterparts with whom a guarantee agreement has been signed shall provide the Commission and Court of Auditors annually with the financial reports on financing and investment operations covered by this Regulation audited by an independent external auditor, containing, among other, information on: (a) the risk assessment of financing and investment operations of the Eligible Counterparts covered by this Regulation including information on the EU liabilities measured in compliance with the accounting rules of the Union set by the accounting officer of the Commission based on the internationally accepted accounting standards for the public sector; ",
        "EN 33 EN (b) the outstanding financial obligation for the Union arising from the EFSD Guarantee provided towards the Eligible Counterparts and their financing and investment operations covered by this Regulation, broken down by individual operations. The Counterparts shall upon request provide to the Commission any additional information necessary to fulfil the Commission's obligations in relation to this Regulation. 3. By 31 March of each year, the Commission shall submit to the European Parliament, to the Council and to the Court of Auditors, in the context of the financial statements of the Commission, the required information on the situation of the EFSD Guarantee Fund. In addition, it shall, by 31 May of each year, submit to the European Parliament, to the Council and to the Court of Auditors an annual report on the management of the EFSD Guarantee Fund in the previous calendar year, including an assessment of the adequacy of the provisioning and the level of the guarantee fund and of the need for its replenishment. The annual report shall contain the presentation of the financial position of the EFSD Guarantee Fund at the end of the previous calendar year, the financial flows during the previous calendar year as well as the significant transactions and any relevant information on the financial accounts. The report shall also include information about the financial management, the performance, and the risk of the guarantee fund at the end of the previous calendar year. 4. By 31 December 2019, the Commission shall evaluate the functioning of the EFSD. The Commission shall submit its evaluation report to the European Parliament and the Council. 5.

This report shall be submitted without delay by the Commission in the event that the approved financing and investment operations absorb in full the amount of the EFSD Guarantee available before 30 June 2020. 2.2. Management and control systems 2.2.1. Risk(s) identified The risk for the EU budget is linked to the budget guarantee provided by the Union to the Eligible Counterpart for its operations in third countries. The guarantee provides a comprehensive cover (to a cap specified below) for all payments not received by the Eligible Counterpart. The EU guarantee is restricted to EUR 1 500 000 000. ",
        "EN 34 EN The budget entry (\"p.m.\") reflecting the budget guarantee for the Eligible Counterpart loans to third countries would be activated only in the case of an effective call on the guarantee by the Eligible Counterpart which cannot be wholly covered by the Guarantee Fund (funded with at least EUR 750 000 000). The provisioning rate of 50% is based on the past experience with guarantee schemes managed by the eligible counterparts, including also first loss structures. There was never a call for more than 50% of the funding provided. The higher provisioning rate e.g. compared to some internal instruments is due to the riskier investment climate in partner countries which needs to be taken into account. 2.2.2. Information concerning the internal control system set up The Commission is responsible for managing the EU Guarantee. The financing operations in the context of the present regulation are carried out according to the Eligible Counterpart standard rules of procedure and sound banking practice. The Eligible Counterpart and the Commission enter into an agreement laying down the detailed provisions and procedures relating to the implementation of the present regulation. See also section above \"Monitoring and reporting rules\". 2.2.3. Estimate of the costs and benefits of the controls and assessment of the expected level of risk of error N.A. 2.3. Measures to prevent fraud and irregularities Specify existing or envisaged prevention and protection measures. 1. The COM shall notify OLAF promptly and provide it with the necessary information when, at any stage of the preparation, implementation or closure of financing and investment operations covered by this Regulation, it has grounds for suspecting fraud, corruption, money laundering or any other illegal activity that may affect the financial interests of the Union. 2. OLAF may carry out investigations, including on-the-spot checks and inspections, in accordance with the provisions and procedures laid down in Regulation (EU, Euratom) No 883/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council (15), Council Regulation (Euratom, EC) No 2185/96 (16) and Council Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 2988/95 (17) in order to protect the financial interests of the Union, with a view to establishing whether there has been fraud, corruption, money laundering or any other illegal activity affecting the financial interests of the Union in connection with any financing and investment operations covered by this Regulation. OLAF may transmit any information obtained in the course of its investigations to the competent authorities of the Member States concerned. Where such illegal activities are proven, the Eligible Counterparts shall undertake recovery efforts with respect to its financing and investment operations covered by this Regulation that are concerned by such activities.
