        "10.5.2019 EN Official Journal of the European Union C 162/13 Tuesday 13 March 2018 C. whereas gender equality should concern both women and men equally; whereas engagement and partnership between public and private sector stakeholders, at international and local levels, are key to promoting the synergies needed to achieve gender equality and women empowerment, and to raise awareness about issues such as: property rights; access to finance, education and vocational training; corporate behaviour; government procurement; the digital gap; and cultural bias; D. whereas trade policies aim to achieve, among other things, the sustainable and equitable economic growth and development needed to ensure poverty reduction, social justice and decent work and better living conditions for both women and men, as well as to safeguard women\u2019s rights; whereas gender equality and the empowerment of women and girls is not only to be mainstreamed across all UN sustainable development goals (SDGs), but is also a standalone goal; whereas the SDG agenda acknowledges that trade contributes to the promotion of sustainable and equitable development and could contribute to the promotion of the highest international labour and environmental standards and human rights; whereas EU trade policy is an important part of the SDG framework, and a strong gender perspective is an essential element of that framework, the aim of which is to ensure fairer and beneficial outcomes for all; whereas trade policy can also expand opportunities for women entre - preneurship, access to apprenticeship and employment; E. whereas the complex relationship between international trade and gender demands a deep understanding of the forces at work, involving the identification, analysis and monitoring of the economic and social dynamics required to develop a efficient trade policy in pursuit of economic development that also promotes women\u2019s empowerment and gender equality; whereas trade policy must therefore take account of its direct and indirect impacts on gender, as well as of specific local contexts, in order to avoid reproducing or exacerbating existing gender gaps and stereotypes, and to strengthen gender equality proactively; whe - reas the success of trade policy should also be evaluated on the basis of whether it has a positive and equal impact on both women and men; F. whereas economic development and gender equality frequently go hand-in-hand; whereas there is a broad understanding that societies in which gender inequalities are lower also tend to grow faster; G. whereas the impact of trade liberalisation on individuals also depend on their geographical localisation and on the economic sector in which they are active; whereas important differences exist, both between and within countries, in terms of production structures, female labour force participation rates and welfare regimes; whereas women comprise the majority of workers in sectors such as garment and textile manufacturing, telecommunication, tourism, the care economy and agriculture, where they tend to be concentrated in more low-wage or low-status forms of formal and informal employment than men; whereas this may lead to abuses at the workplace and to discrimination, gender segregation in types of occupations and activities, gender gaps in wages and working conditions, and gender-specific constraints in access to productive resources, infrastructure and services; whereas free trade agreements (FTAs) can lead to employment shifts and losses, particularly in export-related sectors in which women often form the majority of the work force; whereas country-specific and sector-specific gender assessments therefore bring important added value when designing trade agreements; H. whereas in the EU in 2011, export-dependent employment accounted for about one out of every nine jobs (11 %) held by women in the EU; I. whereas, according to a 2017 Commission study, almost 12 million women in the EU have jobs that depend on the exports of goods and services to the rest of the world ( 26 ); J. whereas on the basis of fact-based studies, UNCTAD insists in highlighting the limitations that women face in taking advantage of the opportunities offered by trade, arising from factors such as lack of technical training for better jobs, lack of public ser - vices to alleviate household responsibilities, and restricted access and control over resources, including credit and land, infor - mation as well as networks; whereas, on this basis, UNCTAD recommends that evaluations address the potential impact of trade policies on gender equality and women empowerment in areas such as employment, small business, prices, productivity in agriculture, subsistence agriculture and migration ( 27 );

        "C 162/14 EN Official Journal of the European Union 10.5.2019 Tuesday 13 March 2018 K. whereas current EU trade policy and its \u2018Trade for All\u2019strategy is based on three key principles: effectiveness, transparency and values, but lack a gender equality perspective; whereas the Commission has renewed and expanded its commitment on gender equality and women\u2019s economic empowerment in its review of the Aid for Trade strategy, stating that gender equality is not only a fundamental human right, but also crucial for economic development, making the most of the wide range of EU policy tools available in order to increase their overall impact on growth and poverty reduction; whereas following the provisions included in CEDAW, the EU should provide the basis for realising equality between women and men through ensuring women\u2019s equal access to, and equal opportunities in, political, economic and public life, as well as education, health and employment; L. whereas women are affected by trade and trade agreements as potential entrepreneurs, consumers, workers and informal wor - kers; whereas there is a crucial need to recognise and better understand gender-specific impacts of trade policy in order to deli - ver adequate policy responses; whereas in order to meet this aim, it is necessary to develop an adequate methodology to ensure that the possible impacts of EU trade policy and agreements on gender equality and women\u2019s rights are always evaluated; whe - reas the Commission should make quantitative gender-disaggregated research by sectors such as, among other, business, science, and technology; whereas, until now, the EU has concluded trade agreements without undertaking assessments of their impact on women and gender equality; whereas the Commission has announced that a modernised Association Agreement between Chile and the EU will include, for the first time for the EU, a specific chapter on gender and trade; M. whereas gender issues and women rights are not sufficiently taken into account in the sustainable impact assessments of trade agreements; N. whereas an ex-ante assessment of the gender implications of trade policies can make a contribution to women\u2019s empowerment and well-being and, at the same time, help mitigate existing disparities and avoid increasing gender inequality; O. whereas a review of current EU multilateral and bilateral agreements shows that 20 % of the agreements with non-European trading partners make reference to women\u2019s rights, and that 40 % of these agreements include references that aim to promote gender equality; whereas references in these agreements to promote women\u2019s empowerment are mainly voluntary and, when binding, they are not enforceable in practice; whereas a recent study by the Commission shows that a gender gap persists in terms of opportunities for access to jobs; whereas the study shows that empowering women could increase global GDP by USD 28 billion by 2025, and that it is essential as much from economic as social and poverty eradication perspectives, given the role of women in communities; P. whereas in both developing and developed countries, micro, small and medium-sized enterprises (MSMEs) constitute the lar - gest part of the private sector and a vast majority of employment; whereas, according to the International Trade Centre (ITC), MSMEs together represent 95 % of all firms globally, approximately 50 % of global GDP and over 70 % of total employment; whereas up to 40 % of all MSMEs are owned by women while only 15 % of exporting firms are led by women; whereas, howe - ver, OCDE figures show that women entrepreneurs still frequently earn 30-40 % less than their male counterparts ( 28 ); Q. whereas the public debate and reaction across Europe on trade negotiations such as the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP), the EU-Canada Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement (CETA) and the Trade in Services Agree - ment (TiSA) have shown the need for transparent and inclusive negotiations, taking into account the strong concerns voiced by European citizens in many countries; whereas EU trade policy should not lower any of the EU\u2019s standards, and whereas public services should always be excluded from trade negotiations; whereas any dispute settlement mechanism should be designed to guarantee the capacity of individual governments to regulate in the public interest and to serve public policy objectives; whe - reas progress must be expected in other critical areas of concern, such as reinforcing companies\u2019 corporate social responsibility (CSR) obligations in relation to human rights; whereas a global holistic approach to corporate liability for human rights abuses is needed in the context of global value chains;

Stresses that fair and inclusive international trade policies require a clear framework contributing to enhancing women\u2019s empowerment and their living and working conditions, strengthening gender equality, protecting the environment and improving social justice, international solidarity and international economic development; 4. Stresses that the overarching purpose of trade policy must be to promote mutually beneficial economic growth; recalls that while trade policy can promote other values that the European Union is pushing for in the multilateral arena, there are limits to the glo - bal issues that can be solved through trade policy and through trade agreements; 5.

Stresses that trading commitments in EU agreements should never overrule human rights; welcomes the UN Guiding Prin - ciples on Business and Human Rights, and calls on the Member States to adopt and elaborate national action plans in accordance with the UN Guiding Principles, taking into account women\u2019s rights and the need to combat gender-based violence; calls on the Commis - sion to use trade negotiations to encourage the EU\u2019s trade partners to adopt national action plans of their own; supports the ongoing negotiations to create a binding UN instrument on transnational corporations and other business enterprises with respect to human rights; stresses the importance of the EU being actively involved in this intergovernmental process and calls on the Commission and the Member States to encourage trading partners to engage constructively in these negotiations; 7. Calls on the Commission to ensure that Articles 16 and 17 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights are fully respected by the EU\u2019s trade partners, as a means of combatting gender-based inequalities in the field of social and economic rights; 8. Recalls that only Member States have the competence to regulate and reverse liberalisation in services of general interest, and therefore calls on them to protect fundamental objectives such as gender equality, human rights and fundamental freedoms, public health, and social and environmental standards; 9. Emphasises the need for governments to maintain their ability to allocate resources to the achievement of women\u2019s rights and gender equality in order to guarantee an inclusive and sustainable future for societies; stresses, in this regard, the paramount impor - tance of respecting, in accordance with SDG target 17.15, partner countries\u2019 democratic policy space to regulate and take suitable decisions for their own national context, respond to the demands of their populations, and fulfil their human rights obligations and other international commitments, including those on gender equality; 10. Recalls that it has called on the Commission to put an end to the investor-state dispute settlement (ISDS) system, and underlines that any dispute settlement mechanism should be designed to guarantee the capacity of individual governments to regulate in the public interest and to serve public policy objectives, including measures to promote gender equality as well as stronger labour, envi - ronmental and consumer rights; 11. Notes that IPR provisions in trade often have an impact on public health and on the particular health requirements of women; calls on the Commission and the Council to ensure that IPR provisions in trade agreements take due account of women\u2019s rights, parti - cularly with regard to their impact on women\u2019s health, including access to affordable healthcare and medicines; calls on the Commis - sion and the Council to promote the protection of geographical indications (GIs) as a tool of particular importance for the empowerment of rural women; calls, furthermore, on the Commission, the Council and the Member States to reconsider the exten - sion of protection to non-agricultural products, bearing in mind that the EU has already agreed to protect non-agricultural GI products in FTAs; ",

Recalls that the SDG require gender-disaggregated data to allow progress to be tracked towards all goals, including SDG 5 on gender equality; stresses that there is no adequate data available on the impact of trade on gender equality, and calls for sufficient and adequate gender disaggregated data on the impact of trade to be collected; stresses that such data would make it possible to establish a methodology with clear and measurable indicators at regional, national and sectorial levels, improve analysis and define objectives to be achieved and measures to be taken to ensure that women and men benefit equally from trade; underlines that particular attention should be put on quantitative and qualitative gender-disaggregated analysis of labour evolution, ownership of assets and financial inclusion in sectors that have been impacted by trade; encourages the Commission to cooperate with European and international orga - nisations such as the World Bank, the United Nations, the OECD and the European Institute for Gender Equality (EIGE), as well as with national statistics offices, with a view to improving the collection and availability of such data; calls on the EU and its Member States to include in ex-ante and ex-post impact assessments the country-specific and sector-specific gender impact of EU trade policy and agree - ments; stresses that the results of the gender-focused analysis should be taken into account in trade negotiations \u2013 considering both positive and negative impact throughout the whole process, from the negotiation stage to implementation \u2013 and should be accompa - nied by measures to prevent or compensate possible negative effects; II. Strengthening gender equality in trade: sector-specific considerations and objectives 13. Underlines that services of general interest and services of general economic interest \u2013 including, but not limited to, water, social services, social security systems, education, waste management, public transport and healthcare \u2013 must remain exempted from the scope of trade negotiations and fall under the competence of Member State governments; urges the EU to ensure that trade and investment treaties do not lead to the privatisation of public services that could impact women, both as service providers and service users, and increase gender inequality; stresses that the issue of public provision of social services is especially salient for gender equa - lity, given that changes in access to, and user fees of, such services and their quality can lead to uneven gender distribution in unpaid care work; points out that governments, and national and local authorities, must retain the full right and ability to introduce, regulate, adopt, maintain or repeal any measures with regard to the commissioning, organisation, funding and provision of universal access to services of general interest and services of general economic interests; 14. Stresses that trade policy can have an impact on access to essential health services, and can therefore influence access to, and the advancement of, reproductive and sexual health and rights objectives in policies, programmes and services; emphasises, therefore, that basic healthcare \u2013 in particular access to sexual and reproductive health and rights services \u2013 are exempted from trade negotiations and notes that they fall under the competence of the Member States; 15. Calls for binding, enforceable and effective measures to combat the exploitation, and improve the working and living condi - tions, of women in export-oriented industries, in keeping with the objective of improving the living and working conditions of women in countries and sectors of concern, in particular in the garment, textile and agriculture sectors, in order to avoid that trade liberalisa - tion contributes to precarious labour rights and increased gender wage gaps; believes that such measures, and the establishment of common definitions, should allow for clearer and better coordinated action with international organisation such as the UN, the WTO, the ILO and the OECD; values the Bangladesh Sustainability Compact as a good example, and as a step forward in terms of getting a monitoring mechanism in place, and calls for full compliance of its terms; calls, in this context, on the Commission, on all internatio - nal actors and on all businesses concerned to acknowledge and adhere to the new OECD Due Diligence Guidelines for Responsible Supply Chains in the Garment and Footwear sector; 16. Calls for an increased focus on women working in the informal sector, recognising the need to reinforce decent work standards for women workers in this sector; 17.

        "10.5.2019 EN Official Journal of the European Union C 162/19 Tuesday 13 March 2018 18. Stresses that the impact of increasing agricultural exports generally favours women less than men, as emerging trends indicate that small farmers, many of whom are women, are often not in a position to compete in overseas markets owing to inheritance laws and a lack of access to credit, information, land and networks, as well of possibilities to comply with new rules and standards; notes that particular efforts must be made to improve the positive impact of trade on women in the agricultural sector, where they have been identified as being particularly vulnerable, but also as having a clear potential for empowerment; stresses that women-owned businesses would benefit from the elimination of gender stereotypes, from increased market access and facilitated access to finance, marketing formation and networks, and from improved capacity building and training; notes that trade liberalisation could impact women negatively in sectors such as agriculture and food processing; stresses that although women workers predominate in world food production (accounting for 50-80 % of the global labour force), they own less than 20 % of the land, and, consequently, that increasing commercial demands on and for land makes it difficult for poorer women to gain or retain secure and equitable land access; recalls the need to prevent the potentially negative impact of IPR clauses, e.g. on seed privatisation, in trade agreements on food sove - reignty; 19. Stresses that women who work in subsistence agriculture face additional barriers to maintaining food sovereignty owing to the strong protection of new varieties of plants under the International Convention for the Protection of New Varieties of Plants (UPOV Convention) in trade agreements; 20. Underlines that EU agricultural imports may undercut traditional small-scale farms and thereby endanger women\u2019s livelihoods; 21. Recalls the importance of MSMEs in the EU\u2019s economic structure; calls on the Commission to continue its efforts to support MSMEs, with specific focus on, and measures for, women-led MSMEs; calls on the EU and its Member States to pay particular attention to the special circumstances of women-led MSMEs when establishing export help-desks, to take advantage of the possibilities created by FTAs and to strengthen services, technologies and infrastructures (such as access to internet) that are of particular importance to the economic empowerment of women and women-led MSMEs; calls on the Commission to help set up partnerships between female entrepreneurs in the EU and their counterparts in developing countries; III. Strengthening gender equality in trade: actions required at EU level 22. Insists that certain elements of EU trade policy, such as TSD chapters and the GSP+ system and the monitoring thereof, can help promote and uphold human rights, including gender equality, workers\u2019 rights and environmental protection; insists that binding and enforceable provisions in EU trade agreements are needed to ensure respect for human rights, including gender equality and envi - ronmental and labour protection, as well as to ensure that EU trade policy is coherent with the Union\u2019s overarching aims of sustainable development, poverty reduction and gender equality; 23. Calls on the EU and the Member States to ensure that the objectives of the SDGs, in particular Goal 5 on gender equality, and the Strategic engagement for gender equality 2016-2019 are fully reflected in EU trade policies; 24. Regrets the fact that the EU\u2019s trade strategy entitled \u2018Trade for All\u2019does not mention gender equality; welcomes the fact that the \u2018Report on the Implementation of the Trade Policy Strategy Trade for All\u2019of 13 September 2017 mentions gender equality in trade and specifies that it is essential for EU decision makers to improve their understanding of the impact of trade instruments on gender equa - lity; calls on the Commission to take this dimension into account in its mid-term review of the Trade for All strategy, and to ensure that the gender perspective is included and mainstreamed in the EU\u2019s trade and investment policy, as it would maximise the overall gains from trade opportunities for all; recalls that trade policy could contribute to promoting gender equality on the international scene, and should be used as a tool to improve the living and working conditions of women, on equal terms as men, for instance by supporting the reduction of gender pay gaps by promoting the creation of better quality jobs for women; ",

Calls on the Commission, the Council and the Member States to promote agreements at multilateral level to expand the protec - tion granted by gender-sensitive EU laws such as the Conflict Minerals Regulation; 29. Calls on the European Investment Bank (EIB) to ensure that companies participating in projects co-financed by the EIB shall be required to adhere to the principle of equal pay and pay transparency, and to the principle of gender equality, as set out in Directive 2006/54/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council ( 29 ); 30. Is convinced that CEDAW is of great importance for all policy areas, including trade; stresses that all Member States have acce - ded to CEDAW; invites, therefore, the Commission to include a reference to CEDAW in trade agreements and to take steps towards the EU\u2019s accession and ratification of the Convention; calls on the Member States to incorporate the principle of gender equality in their legal systems, abolishing all discriminatory laws and adopting appropriate ones prohibiting discrimination against women; 31.

Calls on the Commission to ensure that social and environmental standards, particularly labour rights subscribed to in FTAs and autonomous regimes, apply throughout the territory of trade partners, and, particularly, in EPZs; 33. Stresses the importance of monitoring the implementation of the EU\u2019s Generalised Scheme of Preferences ( GSP) and GSP+ sys - tems, particularly as regards the implementation of core conventions; points out that the GSP + conventions include the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women of 1979, Convention No 111 concerning Discrimination in Res - pect of Employment and Occupation, and Convention No 100 concerning Equal Remuneration for Men and Women Workers for Work of Equal Value; points out that upholding and implementing such conventions helps further gender equality; acknowledges that the GSP and GSP+ systems are valuable tools for promoting respect for human rights; calls on the Commission to find ways to improve these systems by means such as reinforcing their conditionality to the removal of legal discrimination against women, and to continue linking economic incentives to the effective adoption, implementation and appropriate monitoring of core human rights, and of envi - ronmental and labour conventions that are particularly relevant to women; welcomes the Commission\u2019s mid-term evaluation of the GSP systems in this regard; 34.
