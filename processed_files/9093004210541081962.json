Under its policy of cooperation with developing countries and in order to respond appropriately to situations of food insecurity caused by serious food shortages or food crises the Community shall carry out food-aid operations and operations in support of food security in the developing countries. Food-aid operations of a humanitarian nature shall be carried out in the framework of the rules on humanitarian aid and shall not fall within the scope of this Regulation. In the event of a serious crisis, all the instruments of the Community's aid policy shall be implemented in close coordination for the benefit of the population concerned. 2. Operations under this Regulation shall be appraised after analysis of the desirability and effectiveness of this instrument as compared with other means of intervention available under Community aid which could have an impact on food security and food aid, and in coordination with these means. The Commission shall ensure that operations under this Regulation are appraised in close coordination with intervention by other donors. 3. The objectives of the food-aid operations and operations in support of food security referred to in paragraph 1 shall, in particular, be: \u2014 to promote food security geared to alleviating poverty, to help the population of developing countries and regions, at household, local, national and regional levels, \u2014 to raise the standard of nutrition of the recipient population and help it obtain a balanced diet, \u2014 to take account of the concern to ensure the supply of drinking water to the population, \u2014 to promote the availability and accessibility of foodstuffs to the public, \u2014 to contribute towards the balanced economic and social development of the recipient countries in the rural and urban environment, by paying special attention to the respective roles of women and men in the household economy and in the social structure; the ultimate objective of Community aid operations shall be to make the recipients into agents of their own development, \u2014 to support the efforts of the recipient countries to improve their own food production at regional, national, local and family level, 1996R1292 \u2014 EN \u2014 28.12.2005 \u2014 003.001 \u2014 4 ( 1 ) OJ No L 165, 23. 6. 1984, p. 7.

        "\u25bc B \u2014 to reduce their dependence on food aid, \u2014 to encourage them to be independent in food, either by increasing production, or by enhancing and increasing purchasing power, \u2014 to contribute to the initiatives to combat poverty with development as an objective. 4. The Community's aid shall be integrated as thoroughly as possible into the development policies, particularly those on agriculture and agri- foodstuffs, and the food strategies of the countries concerned. Community aid shall back up the recipient country's policies on poverty, nutrition, reproductive health care, environmental protection and rehabilitation, with special attention to the continuity of programmes, particularly in a post-emergency situation. Whether sold or distributed free of charge, aid must not be liable to disrupt the local market. TITLE I Food-aid operations Article 2 1. The products supplied, along with an other operation in the framework of food aid, must reflect as closely as possible the dietary habits of the recipient population and shall not adversely affect the recipient country. When products are selected, consideration shall be given to how to maximize the quantity of food with a view to reaching the maximum number of people, taking into account the quality of products in order to ensure adequate levels of nutrition. When selecting the products to be supplied as Community aid and the procedures for the mobilization and distribution of that aid, particular account shall be taken of the social aspects of access to food in the recipient countries, and especially of the most vulnerable groups and the role of women in the household economy. 2. Food aid shall primarily be allocated on the basis of an objective evaluation of the real needs justifying such aid, as this is the only way to improve the food security of groups which do not have the means or possibility of plugging their food shortage themselves. To that end, consideration shall be given to the following criteria, without excluding other relevant considerations: \u2014 food shortages, \u2014 the food situation measures using human development and nutritional indicators, \u2014 per capita income and the existence of particularly poor population groups, \u2014 social indicators of the welfare of the population in question, \u2014 the recipient country's balance-of-payments situation, \u2014 the economic and social impact and financial cost of the proposed operation, \u2014 the existence in the recipient country of a long-term policy on food security. 3. The granting of food aid shall, where necessary, be conditional on the implementation of short-term, multiannual development projects, sectoral operations or development programmes, and as a priority those which promote sustainable long-term food production and food security in the recipient countries within the framework of a food policy and strategy. Where appropriate, this aid may take the form of a direct contribution to the implementation of such projects, operations or programmes. Where Community aid is intended for sale, such comple- mentarity must be ensured by the use of counterpart funds for purposes agreed by the Community and the recipient country or, where 1996R1292 \u2014 EN \u2014 28.12.2005 \u2014 003.001 \u2014 5 ",
        "\u25bc B appropriate, the body or non-governmental organization which receives the aid. Where food aid is provided as backing for a development programme spread over a number of years, it may be supplied on a multiannual basis linked to the programme in question. Besides the allocation of basic foodstuffs, aid may be used for the supply of seed, fertilizer, tools, other inputs and commodities, the creation of reserves, technical and financial assistance and awareness and training schemes. 4. As a key component of food-security programmes food aid may be given to support efforts by the recipient countries to create buffer stocks paying special attention to individual farmers' stocks and national reserves, in tandem with the setting-up of regional reserves. 5. Counterpart funds shall be managed in a manner consistent with other Community aid instruments. In the case of countries undergoing structural adjustment, and in line with the relevant resolutions of the Council, the counterpart funds generated by the various development assistance instruments constitute resources which must be managed as part of a single and consistent budgetary policy in the context of a programme of reforms. In this context, the Community could move from targeting counterpart funds towards more general allocation, as soon as progress has been made in improving the effectiveness of the monitoring instruments, programming and budget implementation, and as regards internalization of reviews of public expenditure. Without prejudice to the foregoing, these funds shall be managed in accordance with general Community aid procedures for such funds and as a priority to support food-security policies and programmes. TITLE II Operations in support of food security Article 3 Where circumstances warrant it, the Community may carry out operations in support of food security in developing countries suffering a food shortage. Such operations may be implemented by the recipient countries, the Commission, international or regional organizations or non-govern- mental organizations. The purpose of these operations shall be to support, using the resources available, the framing and execution of a food strategy or other measures fostering the food security of the population concerned and to encourage them to reduce their food dependency and their dependence on food aid, especially in the case of low-income countries with serious food shortages. The operations must help to improve the living standards of the poorest people in the countries concerned. Operations in support of food security shall take the form of financial and technical assistance, in accordance with the criteria and procedures laid down in this Regulation. Such operations shall be planned and appraised in the light of their consistency with, and complementarity to, the objectives and operations financed by other Community development-aid instruments. They must be part of a multiannual plan. Article 4 A developing country eligible for Community food aid operations under this Regulation may receive part or all of the food that has been \u2014 or may be \u2014 allocated to it in the form of operations in support of food security either directly or through international, regional or non-govern- mental organizations, with particular account being taken of trends in production, consumption and reserves in that country, the food situation of its inhabitants and the food aid granted by other donors. 1996R1292 \u2014 EN \u2014 28.12.2005 \u2014 003.001 \u2014 6 ",
        "\u25bc B Article 5 Operations in support of food security shall take the form of technical and financial assistance aimed, in accordance with the objectives laid down in Article 1, at improving sustainable and long-term food security by helping finance, inter alia : \u2014 the supply of seed, tools and inputs essential to the production of food crops, \u2014 rural credit support schemes targeted particularly at women, \u2014 schemes to supply the population with drinking water, \u2014 storage schemes at the appropriate level, \u2014 operations concerning the marketing, transport, distribution or processing of agricultural and food products, \u2014 measures in support of the private sector for commercial development at national, regional and international level, \u2014 applied research and field training, \u2014 projects to develop the production of food crops while respecting the environment, \u2014 flanking, awareness, technical assistance and field training operations, in particular for women and producers' organizations and agricultural workers, \u2014 support measures for women and producers' organizations, \u2014 projects to produce fertilizer from raw materials and basic materials found in the recipient countries, \u2014 schemes to support local food-aid structures, including training schemes on the ground. TITLE III Early-warning systems and storage programmes Article 6 The Community may support existing national early-warning systems and help to strengthen existing international early-warning systems concerning the food situation in developing countries and, in exceptional and duly substantiated cases, it may operate such systems, in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 27. It may also cover the cost of implementing storage programmes in these countries in support of food-aid operations under this Regulation or comparable measures undertaken by the Member States, international or regional organizations or non-governmental organizations. Such operations should be consistent with other Community development aid instruments, including the use of counterpart funds generated by the sale of food aid, and be compatible with Community development policy. These operations are intended to strengthen the food security of the recipient countries. They must help improve the living conditions of the poorest sections of the population in the countries concerned and conform with their development objectives, in particular the policy on food crops. Community participation in such operations shall take the form of financial and/or technical assistance, in accordance with the criteria and procedures laid down in this Regulation. Operations supported by Community aid shall be appraised in the light of and in a manner consistent with existing programmes managed by specialist international organizations. 1996R1292 \u2014 EN \u2014 28.12.2005 \u2014 003.001 \u2014 7 ",
        "\u25bc B Article 7 Community support for storage programmes and early-warning systems may be granted, upon request, to international or regional organizations or non-governmental organizations for operations to help developing countries eligible for food aid from the Community and its Member States. Article 8 Community aid may help finance the following measures: \u2014 early-warning systems and systems for gathering data on trends in harvests, stocks and markets, the food situation of households and the vulnerability of the population with a view to improving under- standing of the food situation in the countries concerned, \u2014 operations aimed at improving storage systems with a view to reducing waste or ensuring sufficient storage capacity for emergencies. Such operations may also include the establishment of the infrastructure, in particular bagging, unloading, disinfection, treatment and storage facilities, needed to handle food products in these countries in support of food-aid operations or operations in support of food security, \u2014 preparatory studies and training schemes in connection with the above activities. CHAPTER II Implementing procedures for food aid and storage and early- warning operations in support of food security Article 9 1. The countries eligible for Community aid for operations under this Regulation are listed in the Annex. In this connection, priority shall be given to the poorest sections of the population and to low-income countries with serious food shortages. The Council, acting by a qualified majority on a proposal from the Commission, may amend that list. Eligibility for contracts shall be determined in accordance with the rules of eligibility, and the derogations therefrom, set out in Regulation (EC) No 2110/2005 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 14 December 2005 on access to Community external assistance ( 1 ). 2. Non-profit-making non-governmental organisations (NGOs) eligible for direct or indirect Community financing for the implementa- tion of operations under this Regulation must meet the following criteria: (a) they must be autonomous organisations in an eligible country under the laws in force in that country; (b) they must have their headquarters in an eligible country. The headquarters must be the effective decision-making centre for all co-financed operations; (c) they must show that they can successfully carry out food-aid operations; in particular through: \u2014 their administrative and financial management capacity, \u2014 their technical and logistical capacity to handle the proposed operation, 1996R1292 \u2014 EN \u2014 28.12.2005 \u2014 003.001 \u2014 8 ( 1 ) OJ L 344, 27.12.2005, p. 1. \u25bc M3 ",

Article 10 1. The Community may help finance operations in support of food security of the kind described in Titles I, II and III (Chapters I and II) executed by the recipient country, the Commission, international or regional organizations or non-governmental organizations. 2. Cofinancing operations may be carried out at the request of recipient countries, international or regional organizations or non- governmental organizations, where such operations seem the most appropriate way of enhancing the food security of groups without the ways and means to cope with a food shortage themselves. \u25ba M3 Parti- cipation in contractual procedures implemented through an international organisation or co-financed with a third country is defined in Regulation (EC) No 2110/2005. \u25c4 3. In the design of the Community operations defined in Titles I, II and III, the Commission will give particular attention to: \u2014 the pursuit of sustainable impact and economic viability in project design, \u2014 the clear definition and monitoring of objectives and indicators of achievement. Article 11 1. Products shall be mobilised in the recipient country or in one of the developing countries (listed in the Annex), if possible one belonging to the same geographical region as the recipient country. The origin of supplies and materials purchased under this Regulation shall be determined in accordance with the rules of origin, and the derogations therefrom, set out in Regulation (EC) No 2110/2005. 2. Exceptionally, products may be mobilized on the market of a country other than those provided for in paragraph 1 of this Article in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 27: \u2014 if the requisite type or quality of product is unavailable on the market of the Community or any of the developing countries, \u2014 if there is a serious food shortage, where such purchases are likely to increase the effectiveness of the operation. \u25ba M3 3. \u25c4 Where food is purchased in the recipient country or in a developing country, steps must be taken to ensure that such purchases threaten neither to disrupt the market of the country concerned or of any other developing countries in the same region nor to affect adversely the supply of food to their inhabitants. Such purchases shall be integrated as thoroughly as possible into the implementation of Community development policy towards these countries, particularly with regard to the promotion of food security in the country concerned or at regional level. 1996R1292 \u2014 EN \u2014 28.12.2005 \u2014 003.001 \u2014 9 \u25bc B \u25bc M3 \u25bc B \u25bc M3 \u25bc B ",
        "\u25bc B Article 12 Where a recipient country has partially or totally liberalized food imports, the mobilization of Community aid must be consistent with that country's policy and not distort the market. In such cases, the Community contribution may take the form of a foreign-currency facility to be made available to private-sector operators in the country concerned, subject to the operation being part of a social and economic policy and an agricultural policy aimed at alleviating poverty (including the strategy on the importation of basic foodstuffs). The recipients shall be required to prove that they have made proper use of the means put at their disposal. Priority shall go to small and medium-sized private operators in order to ensure that operations are complementary. To the extent that its powers to carry out operations so allow, the Commission may adopt positive discrimina- tion measures for small and medium-sized private operators. Such aid shall be governed by the principles laid down in Article 11. Article 13 1. The Community may cover costs relating to the transport of food aid. 2. Where the Commission considers that the Community should cover costs relating to the inland transport of food aid, it shall take account of the following general criteria: \u2014 a serious food shortage, \u2014 the delivery of food aid to low-income countries suffering from serious food shortages, \u2014 whether the food aid is destined for the international or regional organizations or non-governmental organizations referred to in Article 10, \u2014 the need to increase the efficiency of the food-aid operation in question. 3. Where food aid is sold in the recipient country, the Community should cover inland transport costs only in exceptional circumstances. 4. The Community may also cover the air transport costs of food-aid operations in exceptional circumstances. Article 14 The Community may cover final distribution costs where the smooth execution of the food-aid operations concerned requires it. Article 15 Community aid shall take the form of grants. Aid may cover the external and local costs of implementing operations, including maintenance and operating costs. Operations under this Regulation shall be exempt from taxes, duties and customs charges. Any counterpart funds shall be used in accordance with the objectives laid down in this Regulation and managed in agreement with the Commission. The competent authority of the recipient country shall keep accounts on the collection and use of the funds and shall be obliged to render accounts.
