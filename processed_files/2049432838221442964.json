P6_TC1-COD(2005)0117 Position of the European Parliament adopted at first reading on 15 December 2005 with a view to the adoption of Regulation (CE) No \u2026 /2005 of the European Parliament and of the Council estab- lishing accompanying measures for Sugar Protocol countries affected by the reform of the EU sugar regime THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION, Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 179 thereof, Having regard to the proposal from the Commission, Acting in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 251 of the Treaty ( 1 ), ( 1 ) Position of the European Parliament of 15 December 2005. 23.11.2006 EN C 286 E/475 Official Journal of the European Union Thursday 15 December 2005 ",
        "Whereas: (1) The European Community is committed, within the framework of the ACP-EC Partnership Agree- ment ( 1 ), to supporting the ACP countries on their path to poverty reduction and to sustainable development, and recognises the importance of the commodity sectors and their related Protocols. (2) The provisions of the common organisation of the markets in the sugar sector established by Council Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 of 19 June 2001 ( 2 ) will be revised, taking into account the legis- lative proposals presented by the Commission to the Council . (3) Under the Sugar Protocol, attached to Annex V of the ACP-EC Partnership Agreement, some ACP countries rely on the EU market to export sugar. The reform will significantly alter their market conditions. (4) The adjustment process of the Sugar Protocol countries to these new market conditions will be com- plex, considering the socio-economic importance and the multifunctional role of the sugar sector and its significant degree of reliance on the EU market, for several of these states. (5) In its Communication to the Council and the European Parliament on accomplishing a sustainable agricultural model for Europe through the reformed CAP \u2014 sugar sector reform, the Commission committed itself to supporting the adjustment process of Sugar Protocol countries, and set out the principles for its support proposals in the Staff Working Document on an Action Plan on accompanying measures for Sugar Protocol countries affected by the reform of the EU sugar regime. This Working Document was discussed with the Sugar Protocol countries. (6) It is essential that Sugar Protocol countries receive support as quickly as possible to maximise the chances of successful adaptation to the new conditions, in full complementarity with existing assist- ance. (7) It is therefore necessary to grant Sugar Protocol countries financial and technical assistance, includ- ing budget support where appropriate, additional to that provided for in the framework of the ACP- EC Partnership Agreement, to enable them to adapt to the new market conditions, offering a broad range of support to take into account heterogeneity of situations between countries and within a country. This must include upgrading the competitiveness of their sugar cane sector, developing alter- native economic activities, and coping , with the help of adequate resources, with the serious broader social, environmental and economic consequences of a reduction of the contribution of the sugar sector to their economies, or a combination of several of these. (8) As this assistance should reflect the specific adjustment efforts required by each of these ACP sup- pliers as a consequence of the reform, objective criteria should be laid down to determine the extent of such assistance. (9) Such assistance should be provided for a period of one year, with continued support to be made available until 2013, by means of the development part of the Development Cooperation and Econ- omic Cooperation Instrument. (10) Since the objective of the action to be taken, namely to accompany the adaptation process of Sugar Protocol countries affected by the EU sugar reform, cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States and can therefore, by reason of the scale and effects of the proposed action, be better achieved at Community level, the Community may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity set out in Article 5 of the Treaty. In accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in that Article, this Regulation does not go beyond what is necessary to achieve that objective. (11) The measures necessary for the implementation of this Regulation should be adopted in accordance with Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission ( 3 ) , ( 1 ) Partnership Agreement between the members of the African, Caribbean and Pacific Group of States of the one part, and the European Community and its Member States, of the other part, signed in Cotonou on 23 June 2000 (OJ L 317, 15.12.2000, p. 3).

        "HAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION: Article 1 Subject 1. A scheme for financial and technical assistance, including budget support where appropriate, is hereby established to accompany the adjustment process of Sugar Protocol countries, faced with new conditions on the sugar market due to the forthcoming reform of the common organisation of the market in sugar. 2. Subject to Article 11(3), this scheme shall be implemented for the year 2006. Article 2 Definitions For the purpose of this Regulation: 1) \u2018 Sugar Protocol countries \u2019 means the ACP countries listed in the Annex , 2) \u2018 sugar \u2019 means raw cane or white cane sugar. Article 3 Eligibility for assistance and procedure 1. Sugar Protocol countries shall be eligible for financial and technical assistance, including budget sup- port, where appropriate. 2. Financial and technical assistance shall be granted at the request of each Sugar Protocol country. Requests for financial and technical assistance shall be presented by \u2026 ( * ). 3. The requests shall be based on a comprehensive multi-annual adaptation strategy, defined by the country concerned in accordance with Article 4, in consultation with all stakeholders. The multi-annual adaptation strategy may include measures in the process of being implemented and also current and future financial impacts of social plans already implemented, on the express condition that the measures and social plans concerned are clearly in line with the objectives laid down in Article 4(1). 4. Sugar Protocol countries which submit a request which is not based on a comprehensive, multi-annual adaptation strategy shall only be eligible in 2006 to financial and technical assistance aiming to contribute to the development of such a strategy. Article 4 Multi-annual adaptation strategy 1. The multi-annual adaptation strategy shall pursue one or more of the following objectives: (a) to enhance the competitiveness of the sugar and cane sector, where this is a sustainable process, in particular in terms of the long-term economic viability of the sector, taking into account the situation of the different stakeholders in the chain, (b) to promote the economic diversification of sugar-dependent areas, for example by redirecting current sugar production towards the production of bio-ethanol and other non-food applications of sugar, (c) to address broader impacts generated by the adaptation process, possibly related, but not restricted, to employment and social services, land use and environmental restoration, the energy sector, research and innovation and macro-economic stability.

        "2. The strategy shall at least define the objectives pursued, the approach and means identified to achieve them, the responsibilities of the different stakeholders, and the financial plan to implement the strategy. It shall assess its sustainability under present and future market conditions, and in social and environmental terms. It shall demonstrate its consistency with general development strategies of the country and its poverty focus. 3. Within the multi-annual strategy, a specific assistance plan for 2006 shall be defined. In the design of this plan, particular attention shall be given to: \u2014 the pursuit of cost effectiveness and sustainable impact, \u2014 the clear definition and monitoring of objectives and indicators of achievement. Article 5 Measures adopted by the Commission 1. After consultation with the Sugar Protocol country concerned , the multi-annual adaptation strategy shall be adopted under the procedure referred to in Article 7(2) and in accordance with Article 4. 2. Special account will be taken of the individual situation of each Sugar Protocol country. For countries finding themselves in a political crisis, unrelated to the evolution of the sugar sector, the delivery of assist- ance under this Regulation will be assessed by the Commission on a case by case basis. 3. Assistance to Sugar Protocol countries without a multi-annual adaptation strategy shall be subject in 2006 to an annual work programme, adopted under the procedure referred to in Article 7(2). 4. The assistance provided for under this Regulation shall be complementary but additional to assistance provided under other instruments of development cooperation. Article 6 Implementation of measures The measures financed under this Regulation shall be implemented in accordance with general rules as set out in Council Regulation (EC , Euratom) No 1605/2002 of 25 June 2002 on the Financial Regulation appli- cable to the general budget of the European Communities ( 1 ).
