        "50th anniversary of the Schuman Declaration The date of 9 May took on special significance this year, marking the 50th anniversary of the Schu man Declaration. On 9 May 1950, Robert Schuman, the French Foreign Minister, took a historic step towards European integration by proposing to place the entire Franco-German coal and steel production under a common High Authority, in an organisation open to the other countries of Eu rope. This brought into being the ECSC, the forerunner of today's European Union. The European institutions chose the European Parliament h\u00e9micycle in Brussels as the venue to commemorate this occasion. An academic symposium took stock of the process of European in tegration and looked ahead to the future, from the point of view of the European Union's place in the world. The symposium was attended by numerous political figures, scientists, writers and ac ademics. In his message, the President of the European Commission, Romano Prodi, highlighted two elements of the 1950 Declaration, namely the pragmatic aspect of the process aimed at secur ing peace, freedom and prosperity throughout Europe, and the creation of permanent supranational institutions to oversee the European project in a strong and efficient manner. Mr Prodi reaffirmed also the need for internal reform of the institutions and drew attention to the White Paper being prepared by the Commission on the subject of governance. The President of the European Parlia ment. Nicole Fontaine, expressed the wish that governments would rediscover, within the frame work of the Intergovernmental Conference, the visionary spirit which inspired the Schuman Dec laration, pointing out that what Europe needs most at this turning point in its history is to regain the original political momentum.

Presidency statement, on behalf of the Eu ropean Union, on the human rights and humani tarian situation in Colombia (\u2014> point 1.6.8). Equatorial Guinea 1.2.2. Parliament resolution on Equatorial Guinea. Adopted on 18 May. Highly concerned at the process of democratic transition in Equatorial Guinea, especially since the 1999 national elec tions were disrupted by violence and irregulari ties, Parliament called on the government to hold elections under acceptable conditions of transpar ency and with regard to fundamental freedoms, thereby providing an opportunity to show the in ternational community its genuine desire to com mit to the process of d\u00e9mocratisation and consol idation of the rule of law. Parliament also urged the government to guarantee the right to vote and ensure freedom of movement, association and ex pression for everyone and for opposition parties, and to guarantee that the media be allowed to op erate and opposition parties be given access to them throughout the electoral campaign. Finally, Parliament called on the Commission not to resume its aid to Equatorial Guinea if the electoral process failed to respect democratic standards and fundamental freedoms. Iran 1.2.3. Parliament resolution on Iran. Reference: Parliament resolution on the prisoners facing trial in Iran on charges of espionage on be half of Israel and the United States: Bull. 4-2000, point 1.2.3 Adopted on 18 May. Protesting against the contin uous threatening of the lives of independent jour nalists, Parliament asked for the withdrawal both of the official steps taken against those individu als and of the judicial proceedings against them. It called on the Iranian authorities to lift the ban on newspapers and periodicals, and to respect their international obligations as a signatory to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights guaranteeing freedom of expression and association. Finally, Parliament asked the Coun cil, the Member States and the Commission to take due account of this situation when consider ing the establishment of more normal and mutu ally productive relations with Iran, based on re spect for fundamental human rights, including freedom of speech and expression. Myanmar 1.2.4. Parliament resolution on Myanmar. Reference: Parliament resolution of 16 September 1999 on Myanmar: OJ C 54, 25.2.2000; Bull. 9-1999, point 1.1.4 Adopted on 18 May. On the 10th anniversary of Mrs Aung San Suu Kyi's election as President, with the National League for Democracy (NLD) having won a large majority of the seals in parlia ment following free and fair elections, although it had still not been permitted to convene, Parliament called on the State Peace and Development Coun cil (SPDC) to enter into a meaningful dialogue with the democratic opposition and ethnic groups. It called on the SPDC also to release all political prisoners immediately, to cease human rights abuses, to allow political parties to function freely and to end the widespread practice of forced la bour. Furthermore, Parliament called on the SPDC to reopen all universities so that higher education is no longer reserved for the military elite but is ac cessible to the civilian population, and to stop re cruiting child soldiers.

Parliament resolution on the Commission's recommendation for the broad guidelines of the economic policies of the Member States and the Community for 2000. Reference: Broad guidelines of the economic pol icies of the Member States (1999): OJ L217, 17.8.1999; Bull. 7/8-1999, point 1.3.1 Commission recommendation: COM(2000) 214; Bull. 4-2000, point 1.3.1 Adopted on 18 May. Parliament stressed the im portance of generating high rates of non-inflation ary and ecologically sustainable growth as the central element of the strategy for achieving a re turn to full employment and a transition to a knowledge-based economy. Pointing out that higher growth requires a structural reform of the labour market, it urged those Member States still lagging behind with structural reforms to increase the flexibility of markets. It believes that it is pos sible to reduce the level of taxation in many Mem ber States and that social security systems need to be overhauled, so as to reduce the tax burden on job creation. It underlined the need to pursue fiscal consolidation in order to ensure ongoing price sta bility, a prerequisite for economic growth. It ex pressed support for all measures aimed at strength ening competition, liberalising public utilities and reducing regulatory burdens. It called for the crea tion of Community support mechanisms for the benefit of SME associations. And it pointed to the need to identify the sources of instability of inter national financial markets and to engage in nego tiations so as to reduce potential instability while keeping capital markets free and open. Stability and convergence programmes 1.3.2. Council opinion on the updated stability programme of Austria (2000-03). Reference: Council opinion on the stability pro gramme of Austria (1998-2002): OJ C 42, 17.2.1999; Bull. 1/2-1999, point 1.3.5 Commission recommendation: Bull. 4-2000, point 1.3.2 Adopted on 8 May. The Council welcomed the fact that the deficit targets agreed in the original stability programme were met in 1998 and 1999. However, as growth was above trend in the period 1998-99, it regretted that no further headway in budgetary consolidation was made during that period. It noted, moreover, that the debt ratio, which is still above the 60 % reference value, increased in 1999. The updated programme forecasts a decline in the general government budget deficit from 2 % of GDP in 1999 to 1.3 % by 2003, while the gross debt ratio is expected to decrease from 64.9 % of GDP to 61.2% over the same period. These projections are based on a macroeconomic scenario featuring a gradual fall in output growth from its current cycli cal peak of 2.8 % to 1.9 % by 2003, corresponding to annual average growth of 2.5 %, i.e. slightly above trend. In view of the favourable supply and demand conditions in the Austrian economy at the moment and the healthy external environment, the Council considered that such a growth outlook ap peared feasible without igniting inflationary pres sures, as assumed in the programme. The Council considered that the medium-term government deficit envisaged in the updated sta bility programme was not fully in line with the re quirements of the Stability and Growth Pact as it does not provide a large enough safety margin to prevent the deficit from breaching the 3 % of GDP reference value in the event of a cyclical downturn. It therefore urged the Austrian Govern ment to reduce the deficit targets in the next up date of the programme. In addition, it invited the Bull. EU 5-2000 ",
        "Economie and monetary policy government to revert to its original goal for the government debt ratio of 60 % of the GDP refer ence value by 2002. The Council considered that, in order to achieve the aim of a sustained consolidation of govern ment finances, wide-ranging structural reforms, in particular public sector reform and reforms in the transfer and benefit systems, were essential. In its view, the structural reform measures outlined in the programme would play a key part in im proving the functioning of product and labour markets while the general thrust of these reforms appeared appropriate and in keeping with the broad guidelines for the economic policies of the Member States and the Community. OJC 162, 10.6.2000 1.3.3. Parliament resolution on the annual assess ment of the implementation of the Member States' stability and convergence programmes. Adopted on 18 May. Parliament noted with satis faction that the budgetary objectives set in the previous stability and convergence programmes had all been achieved and, in some cases, even ex ceeded. It is of the opinion that budgetary consol idation must remain a priority and considers that the much-improved economic environment and the positive growth expectations provide Member States with the opportunity to speed up fiscal con solidation while at the same time introducing long-overdue structural reforms. It urged Member States to implement more radical reforms of their labour markets in order to tackle Europe's unac- ceptably high unemployment and to proceed rap idly with the liberalisation of markets such as tel ecommunications and energy. It asked that an annex be attached to the stability and convergence programmes investigating potential implications of ageing populations for public finances as well as different scenarios for the years 2005 to 2010. And it called for more harmonised timing of pro gramme submission by the Member States so as to improve comparability. Economic and monetary union 1.3.4.

The purpose of the report is to assess the progress made by the two Member States (Greece and Sweden) which, by Council decision of 3 May 1998, were granted a deroga tion on the ground that they did not fulfil the nec essary conditions for the adoption of the single currency on 1 January 1999. The Commission recapitulates the main findings about the progress achieved, for each of the two Member States, on the basis of the various criteria mentioned in Article 121(1) of the EC Treaty and indicates that this assessment leads it to conclude that Greece has achieved a high degree of sustain able convergence, justifying the abrogation with effect from 1 January 2001 of its derogation (\u2014\u00bb point 1.3.5). It notes, on the other hand, that there are no grounds for changing the current sta tus of Sweden. COM(2000) 277 1.3.5.

Commission communication to Parliament, the Council and the European Central Bank on secondary legislation relating to the euro and Greece, containing a proposal for a Council regu lation amending Regulation (EC) No 974/98 on the introduction of the euro, a proposal for a Council regulation amending Regulation (EC) No 1103/97 on certain provisions relating to the introduction of the euro and a proposal for a Council regulation amending Regulation (EC) No 2866/98 on the conversion rates between the euro and the currencies of the Member States adopting the euro. Regulations to be amended: Regulation (EC) No 1103/97 on certain provi sions relating to the introduction of the euro: OJ L 162. 19.6.1997; Bull. 6-1997, point 1.3.32 Regulation (EC) No 974/98 on the introduction of the euro: OJ L 139, 11.5.1998; Bull. 5-1998, point 1.2.8 Regulation (EC) No 2866/98 on the conversion rates between the euro and the currencies of the Member States adopting the euro: OJ L 359, 31.12.1998; Bull. 12-1998, point 1.2.10 Adopted on 30 May. As a sequel to its proposal for a Decision of 3 May (\u2014\u00bb point 1.3.5) finding that Greece fulfils the necessary conditions for the adoption of the single currency, the Commission is presenting the above proposals prior to adop tion of the Council decision concerning the abro gation of Greece's derogation in order to ensure flexibility with respect to the date of adoption of the regulations by the Council. In the event of a favourable decision, the Council will subse quently have to adopt the conversion rate between the euro and the drachma applicable from 1 Janu ary 2001 and to take the other measures needed to introduce the euro in Greece. The date envisaged for the adoption of the euro in Greece falls within the transitional period ( 1 Jan uary 1999 to 31 December 2001), during which the former currencies of the participating Member States are subunits of the euro. Euro banknotes and coins will be introduced as from 1 January 2002. The scope of the measures to be taken for the introduction of the euro in Greece depends to a large extent on whether the transitional period remaining after 1 January 2001 can be considered to be sufficiently long for Greece. Given that Greece will benefit from the experience gained in the other countries with respect to the prepara tions for 2002, it can be assumed that it will be able to comply with the deadline set for the end of the transitional period and that no specific provi sions in the legal framework of the euro are nec essary. Consequently, the two Council regula tions which form part of the legal framework of the euro \u2014 Regulation (EC) No 974/98 on the in troduction of the euro and Regulation (EC) No 1103/97 on certain provisions relating to the introduction of the euro \u2014 can be fully applied to Greece. They need to be amended for the sole purpose of integrating Greece and its currency into the existing framework. The proposal for a Council regulation amending Regulation (EC) No 2866/98 on the conversion rates between the euro and the currencies of the Member States adopting the euro provides that the conversion rate for the drachma is the present central rate of the drachma in the exchange rate mechanism (EUR 1 = GRD 340.750). As for the other currencies and in accordance with Council Regulation (EC) No 1103/97 on certain provi sions relating to the introduction of the euro, the rate is determined to six significant figures.

Results European Union Labour Force Survey 1.3.13. Table 1, derived from a study by Eurostat, the Statistical Office of the European Communi ties in Luxembourg, presents some of the results of a labour force survey conducted in the Euro pean Union in 1999. It shows, for example, that the average employment rate in the European Un ion was 62 %, ranging from 52 % in Spain to 77 % in Denmark, that 13 % of employees were working under a fixed-term contract, that 46 % of unemployed people had been seeking a job for more than a year, and that the average employee in the European Union worked 40.4 hours per week: the longest working week (43.6 hours) was in the United Kingdom and the shortest (38.4 hours) in Belgium. 1.3.10.

In the face of current demographic trends (lowered fer tility, longer life expectancy and ageing), the Committee felt that development of a family pol icy would provide a starting point. Noting that population renewal through natural growth was not occurring in the EU, the Committee pointed to immigration as an alternative to falling birth rates. Bull. EU 5-2000 15 ",

Social protection and social security 1.3.15. Economic and Social Committee own-in itiative opinion on the employment of migrant ag ricultural workers from non-EU countries. Adopted on 24 May. Purpose: to draw the atten tion of the European institutions and the social partners to the importance of migrant agricultural workers, whose social protection is very limited. The Committee stressed the need for action in view of the growing number of migrant workers in the EU, at a time when eastward expansion may aggravate the problem. It was in favour of es tablishing adequate transitional arrangements to control the impact of freedom of movement for workers. The Committee considered also that the Commission should, with the participation of the social partners, set up an agricultural migrant work observatory responsible for recording and analysing migration movements and formulating proposals, addressed to the EU institutions, for improving the situation. Moreover, it advocated the introduction of a written work permit, con taining personal data and information on social security and skills, thus verifying the legal status of migrant workers and protecting them against the effects of illegal work. The final point made by the Committee was that migrant workers should enjoy the same economic and social rights as other workers. It urged the Commission to re view social security schemes in the agricultural sector and to look at possible ways of incorporat ing migrant workers into these schemes. 1.3.16. Economic and Social Committee opinion on supplementary health insurance. Adopted on 24 May. The Committee welcomed a working document drawn up by the European Parliament's Committee on Employment and So cial Affairs. It felt that the aim should be to lay down guidelines rather than to legislate in this area, with the objective of ensuring that contrac tual specifications serving as codes of good con duct be negotiated with private insurers in each Member State. 1.3.17.

Building on recent initia tives, and with a view to meeting the commitment made by the Intergovernmental Conference to take into account the needs of people with disabil ities when drawing up measures under Article 95 of the EC Treaty, the Commission looks at key EU policies which can contribute to the improve ment of access for people with disabilities.

        "Employment and social policy vocational training, transport, the internal market, the information society, the new technologies and consumer policy. The Commission points out that mobility plays a crucial role in ensuring participa tion in economic and social activity, and lack of mobility is a factor restricting the participatory rights of people with disabilities, to the detriment of all. Having recognised the importance of this issue for some time, the Commission suggests new ways whereby the needs of people with disa bilities might be better addressed. At the same time, it emphasises that advances must be made consistently on all fronts, in order to get the best results out of the process. It also asserts that en hanced access for people with disabilities will have positive spin-offs in other areas, such as the quality of working life, consumer protection and the competitiveness of European businesses. Ac cordingly, the Commission draws together the different strands of the inter-sectoral policies con cerned, and affirms its determination to continue fostering the development of good practice within its own departments. Finally, the Commission an nounces its intention of proposing to the Council that the year 2003 be declared 'European year of disabled citizens' in order to raise public aware ness and provide a catalyst for the introduction of new policies at all administrative levels.

Parlia ment approved the proposal for a Council direc tive implementing the principle of equal treat ment irrespective of racial or ethnic origin (Parliament will address the other parts of the package subsequently). It proposed certain amendments, concerned mainly with the defini tion of indirect discrimination, incitement to dis criminate, a wider material and personal scope, links between discrimination based on ethnic ori gin and on religion, mainstreaming of equality between men and women, the right to collective action before the courts, the role of non-govern mental organisations in implementing the direc tive and the system for producing reports on im plementation in the Member States. Economic and Social Committee opinion deliv ered on 25 May. Welcoming the proposals, the Committee supported the approach adopted by the Commission. However, it suggested that the Commission should consider enacting future leg islation based on the principles set out in the pro posed directive combating discrimination on grounds of racial or ethnic origin, in order to pro tect all groups vulnerable to discrimination on grounds of religion or belief, disability, sexual orientation or age. More specifically, having re gard to the directive on racial or ethnic origin, the Committee recommended that an additional Arti cle be inserted, stressing the key role of NGOs in implementing and monitoring the directive with out prejudice to the prerogatives of the social partners. It proposed also that the independent bodies to be created in all the Member States should have the power to receive and pursue com plaints on behalf of both individuals and organi sations. Taking the view that the prevention of discrimination and the promotion of equal oppor tunities form an important part of the overall strat egy underpinning the anti-discrimination propos als, the Committee wanted the Commission to give thought to a high-profile media promotional campaign covering the action programme to com bat discrimination. Amended Commission proposal adopted on 31 May. In the light of the opinions delivered by the other institutions and bodies, the changes made by the Commission to its initial proposal have to do mainly with: clarification of the terminology regarding application of the directive to both legal and natural persons; the question of indirect dis crimination according to existing case-law; incite ment to discriminate; extending the scope of the text (public sector, unpaid and voluntary work, practical work experience, healthcare); the value of conciliation procedures to the defence of rights; supplementing the provisions on information; and extending the concept of social dialogue to cover non-governmental organisations.

While acknowledging that various aspects of women's life have improved since 1995, Parliament deplored the lack of agreed indicators, gender-segregated data, bench marks and a clear timetable in the Beijing Plat form for Action, and urged the participants at the New York Conference on Beijing +5 to make good these shortcomings. Parliament recom mended that the European Union, in cooperation with the Council of Europe and non-governmen tal organisations, and through relations with third countries, conduct a multiannaul campaign to combat violence and discrimination against women. Parliament called also on the Member States to take a number of specific measures to tackle gender disparities in employment. It re quested them also to develop new mechanisms and strategies, including the use of quotas, to achieve a critical mass of women leaders in all ar eas and all democratic institutions, and at all lev els of decision-making, insisting moreover that special attention be paid to the social partners.

It stressed that the aim of simplification was to improve the ef fectiveness of the acquis communautaire by mak ing rules easier to apply and to enforce. The Council found it particularly important to avoid the over-regulation and excessive administrative burden on SMEs liable to constrain them and their economic development. It emphasised in particu lar the importance of selecting sectors for SLIM where there was a demonstrated need for simpli fication.

It obliges insurance companies to appoint a resident claims representative in other Member States, au thorised to deal with any claims arising from ac cidents, and to set up information centres to help traffic accident victims establish the name of the insurer to which they have to address their claims. The proposal further provides for the possibility of introducing a direct right of action throughout the European Union in favour of the victim, ena bling the claim for compensation to be addressed directly to the insurer of the person responsible for the accident. 1.3.39.

Reference: Conclusions of the Lisbon European Council: Bull. 3-2000. point 1.9 Directive to be amended: Parliament and Council Directive 97/67/EC on common rules for the devel opment of the internal market of Community postal services and the improvement of quality of service: OJ L 15, 21.1.1998; Bull. 12-1997, point 1.2.172 Adopted by the Commission on 30 May. In this proposal for a directive, the Commission re sponds to the Lisbon European Council's objec tive of speeding up the liberalisation of postal services with a view to creating a fully-opera tional internal market. The proposal also takes ac count of the need for universal service and of the social, regional and employment aspects of postal services. The Commission's aim is to establish a more appropriate and open postal sector which will come closer to meeting the needs of all users and strengthen the economy of the European Un ion while safeguarding the essential social objec tives, particularly where universal service is con cerned. The measures in the proposal aim, through various changes to the postal directive, to continue opening up the Community postal mar kets using a gradual and controlled approach. The proposal thus amends the postal directive to specify clearly the stages by which the Commu nity postal sector will be opened up according to a planned process allowing the market as a whole, and universal-service providers in particular, all the time they need to achieve the necessary struc tural modernisation and to adapt to fiercer compe tition in a stable and predictable regulatory con text. The proposal also provides for continued gradual and controlled opening of the internal market of Community postal services. The first step, to be implemented by 1 January 2003, is to lower the current limits on weights and prices for certain services which may continue to be reserved; all weight and price limits for direct mail and outgo ing cross-border mail are to be abolished, how ever. The second step is to take effect on 1 January 2007. Parliament and the Council are to decide by 31 December 2005 on what this subsequent step should be, on a proposal from the Commission in 2004 following a review of the sector which will focus on maintaining universal service in a com petitive environment.

In its report the Commission shows that the enforcement of such restrictions depends largely upon voluntary compliance by the traveller and that the restrictions are difficult to control effectively within an internal market founded on the principle of free movement of goods and persons.

Commission decision adopted on 3 May. The decision authorises the creation of a full- function joint venture between the Japanese groups Hitachi Ltd and NEC Corporation in the field of dynamic random access memories (DRAMs), which are components used in elec tronic devices and, in particular, computers. Hitachi is a Japanese electronics company which manufactures and markets a wide range of prod ucts including computers, semi-conductors, con sumer products and electrical and industrial equipment. NEC is a Japanese supplier of elec tronic products and services. It manufactures and markets a full spectrum of products and systems in the following sectors: semi-conductors, elec tronic devices, communications, computer pe ripherals, imaging and computers. The new en tity, to be called NEC-Hitachi Memory, will combine the operations of the two groups as re gards the development, manufacture and sale of DRAMs and, more particularly, of the new gener ation of electronic components. The Commission has examined the proposal un der the merger control regulation to determine whether it is likely to create or strengthen a dom inant position on the markets on which the joint venture would be active. Given the market shares previously held by Hitachi and NEC and given the number and size of competitors already presents on these markets, the Commission has concluded that a dominant position would not be created or strengthened. In accordance with Article 2(4) of the merger control regulation, a joint venture having as its object or effect the coordination of the competi tive behaviour of its parent companies also has to be appraised in the light of the criteria laid down in Article 81(1) and (3) of the EC Treaty. The Commission has reached the conclusion that no market on which Hitachi and NEC were jointly present posed serious competition problems. The Commission has therefore decided to author ise the joint venture and declare it compatible with the common market. Bertelsmann/Kooperativa F\u00f2rbundet/BOL Nordic 1.3.56.

Bertelsmann is not present on the mail order and Internet book selling market in those countries and, although KF is, it does not have a dominant position.

EBU's share of the relevant markets has fallen significantly over the last 10 years. The parties have made certain changes to the agreements notified. The changes, which are part of the notified Eurovision system, correspond to the rules for access by non-members between 1993 and 1999.

As far as the Agreement on the European Economic Area is concerned, the exemption granted under Article 53(3) has been applicable since 1 January 1994, the date when the Agreement entered into force. This decision follows the Commission's decision of 20 December 1999 to initiate proceedings un der Article 6(1 )(c) of the merger control regula tion. Alcoa is the largest producer of aluminium in the world and has interests in all areas of the alumin ium industry. It operates in Australia, Brazil, China, the European Union, Japan and North America. Reynolds Metals is present on the same markets as Alcoa and operates in several parts of the world. The merger, which will create the largest inte grated aluminium producer in the world, would have resulted in dominant positions in three prod uct markets (smelter-grade alumina, commodity alumina hydrate and high purity P0404 alumin ium) but Alcoa proposed divestments aimed at re storing the competitive conditions prevailing be fore the merger and hence ensuring healthy competition and protecting consumers' interests. Consequently, provided that all the conditions contained in the proposed commitments are ful filled, the Commission has decided to declare the merger compatible with the common market and with the functioning of the EEA Agreement. Mergers Commission decisions under the merger control regulation Reference: Council Regulation (EEC) No 4064/89 on the control of concentrations between undertak ings (OJ L395, 30.12.1989; Bull. 12-1989. point 2.1.78; Supplement 2/90 \u2014 Bull.), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 1310/97: OJ L 180. 9.7.1997; Bull. 3-1998. point 1.2.49 Alcoa/Reynolds Initiation of proceedings: Bull. 12-1999, point 1.2.51 1.3.58. Adopted on 3 May. A merger has been au thorised between the US aluminium producers Alcoa and Reynolds Metals, provided that the commitments made by the parties are honoured. Dow Chemical/Union Carbide Initiation of proceedings: 1.2.54 Bull. 12-1999, point 1.3.59. Adopted on 3 May. The acquisition of Un ion Carbide by Dow Chemical has been author ised, provided that the commitments made by the parties arc honoured. The decision follows the Commission's decision of 22 December 1999 to initiate proceedings un der Article 6(1 )(c) of the merger control regula tion. Dow Chemical and Union Carbide are companies operating in the scientific and technological sec tor at world level and engaged in the integrated production of chemicals. The headquarters of both companies are situated in the United Slates. Both have sizeable operations in Europe. The merger will create one of the world's largest producers of plastics and chemicals. Competition Bull. F.U 5-2000 y> ",
        "Competition concerns were raised in three fields: polyethylene (PE) resins, in particular C8 linear low density polyethylene (C8 LLDPE), ethyleneamines (chemical intermediates) and PE technology. To resolve the problems posed by the merger in these sectors, the parties have agreed to sell vari ous production segments and to grant licences for some of their principal technologies. The Com mission has therefore authorised the merger. Nabisco/United Biscuits 1.3.60. Adopted on 5 May. The acquisition of United Biscuits (Holdings) Pic by Finalrealm Limited, a company controlled by Nabisco Group Holdings Corporation, has been authorised, pro vided that the commitments made by the parties are honoured. The new company, Glaxo SmithKline, with 7.3 % of global sales, will be the largest pharmaceutical company in the world. The merger creates overlaps in a number of treat ment areas for human pharmaceuticals. In most of these markets, the Commission found that the overlapping activities were unlikely to lead to ad verse competition effects. However, serious doubts arose in a number of key areas where the new entity would have achieved very high market shares, up to almost 100%, in three markets: anti-virals, excluding anti-HIV (J5B), topical anti-virals (D6D) and anti-emetics (A4A). Seri ous doubts arose also in connection with cepha losporins (JID) in Spain. Moreover, the Commis sion's investigation showed that the parties' position in the asthma (COPD) treatment area could be further strengthened by the compounds they are developing at the moment. A collective bid was notified by Finalrealm, the acquiring vehicle formed by Nabisco, the US in vestment company Hicks, Muse, Tate and Furst (HMTF), the venture capital firms Cinven and PAI, and a subsidiary of Deutsche Bank. Nabisco, however, will be the only one to have control of United Biscuits, a British firm. Nabisco is a food giant based in the United States with a modest presence in Europe. Its main inter ests in Europe are in Spain and, consequently, there is no substantial overlap with United Bis cuits. The parties undertook to outlicense in Europe SmithKline Beecham's pipeline compound for treating COPD, if competing pipeline products fail to reach the market. The Commission considered that the commit ments were sufficient to eliminate the serious competition concerns and has therefore author ised the merger. Sara Lee/Courtaulds The merger nevertheless gave rise to competition concerns on account of the inclusion of The Hori zon Biscuit Company Ltd, brought in by HMTF. The merger has been altered to exclude Horizon from the initial project. This was done by HMTF selling its minority stake in Finalrealm to the other financial investors involved in the deal. In view of the above, the Commission has decided to authorise the merger. Glaxo Wellcome/SmithKline Beecham 1.3.61. Adopted on 8 May. A merger between Glaxo Wellcome and SmithKline Beecham has been authorised, provided that the parties honour their commitments. 1.3.62. Adopted on 8 May. The purchase of Cour- taulds Textiles by Sara Lee has been authorised, provided that the commitments made by the par- tics are honoured. The deal would have created a dominant position in the hosiery market in France, where the two companies own the two largest brands, Dim and Well, giving them a combined market share in value terms nearly nine limes larger than their closest competitor (Le Bourgct). Sara Lee's commitment to divest Textiles Well SA, i.e. the Well brand, and the associated manu facturing site of Le Vigan in France, has removed this concern, and the Commission has authorised the merger. 30 Bull. EU 5-2000 ",
        "Competition EADS 1.3.63. Adopted on 11 May. The Commission has authorised the creation of the European Aeronau tic, Space and Defence Company (EADS), pro vided that the parties honour their commitments. The Commission has authorised the proposed cre ation of EADS, to which the German company DaimlerChrysler AG, France's Lagard\u00e8re SCA, the French State and the Spanish company Socie dad Estatal de Participaciones Industriales (SEPI) have contributed their activities in the aeronautic, telecommunications, space and defence sectors. EADS will be active in commercial aircraft, tele communications equipment, commercial and mil itary helicopters, space, guided weapons, drones or unmanned air vehicles used for military opera tions, military aircraft and defence electronics. The Commission considered that there were com petition issues in the space market, given the par- tics' shares of two satellite equipment markets: antenna reflectors and central tubes. In order to remove these competition concerns, the parties offered some commitments consisting in the divestment by A\u00e9rospatiale-Matra Lanceurs (AML) of two packages which will enable their purchascr(s) to design, manufacture and sell an tenna reflectors and central tubes for satellites in an independent and viable manner. These divest ment packages comprise intellectual property rights, the transfer of employees or, at the pur chaser's option, the provision of technical assist ance and dedicated tools. In the case of central tubes, the parties will also transfer their supply contract with Alcatel Space, and, in the case of antenna reflectors, the parties will waive their rights under the long-term supply agreement be tween AML and Alcatel Space. BP Amoco/Castrol 1.3.64. Adopted on 18 May. The Commission has approved the acquisition of the UK-based lubri cants company Burmah Castrol by BP Amoco (BPA), the Anglo-American oil company. BPA is an integrated oil company active in oil ex ploration, refining and the production of petro chemicals. Castrol is a diversified group active in the manufacture and marketing of finished lubri cants and chemicals, including printing inks and metallurgical, construction and mining chemicals. The merger will make BPA the third-largest man ufacturer of lubricants in the world and will sig nificantly consolidate its position in this sector. Although BPA's position in the lubricants sector is strengthened by the solid brand, technical ex pertise and products research of Castrol, the Com mission has concluded that the merger will not create a dominant position and has therefore au thorised it. Pfizer/Warner-Lambert 1.3.65. Adopted on 22 May. The merger between the US-based pharmaceutical companies Pfizer Inc and Warner-Lambert Inc has been approved, provided that the parties honour their commit ments. The merger will create one of the largest pharma ceutical companies in the world. The Commission's investigation revealed over laps in a number of human pharmaceuticals. Al though, in many areas, those overlaps did not give rise to competition problems, the new company, which is to be called Pfizer Inc, would have achieved very high market shares in three mar kets: anti-Alzheimer products (N7D) in Belgium, Greece, Spain, Luxembourg, Austria, Finland and Sweden; calcium antagonists (C8A) in Austria; and antihclmintics, excluding schistomicides (P1B), in Germany and Austria. In the market for anti-Alzheimer products, the parties offered to divest all assets relating to Warner-Lambert's rival product Cognex. As re gards calcium antagonists (C8A), they proposed to outlicense Warner-Lambert's drug Dilzem in Austria. As far as antihclmintics are concerned, they committed themselves to transferring all the assets relating to either Helmex/Combantrin (Pfizer) or Vanquin (Warner-Lambert) to an un- associatcd third party in Austria and Germany. The Commission considered that the undertak ings were sufficient to eliminate the serious doubts about the merger and has therefore author ised it. Bull. EU 5-2000 ",
        "Competition Boeing/Hughes 1.3.66. Adopted on 26 May. The decision initiates proceedings under Article 6(1 )(c) of the merger control regulation. The Commission has decided to open an in-depth investigation into the proposed acquisition by The Boeing Company of the satellite business of Hughes Electronics Corporation. Boeing is active in the commercial aircraft, space and defence industries. It supplies navigation sat ellites and has substantial activities in the field of satellite launch services, where it operates its family of Delta launchers and has an interest in Sea Launch, another launch service operator. Hughes, a subsidiary of General Motors, is the world's leading manufacturer of commercial GEO satellites. It also produces certain satellite equipment and provides satellite-based communi cation and pay-TV services. The preliminary investigation shows that the pro posed merger could strengthen Hughes's position as leader on the market for commercial GEO sat ellites. Similarly, there are indications that, after the transaction, Hughes would be able to steer the buyers of its satellites towards Boeing launchers. Given Hughes's current competitive position on the GEO satellites market and the recent develop ment of Boeing's launcher business, the Commis sion has therefore identified serious risks that the merger may lead to the creation of a dominant po sition on these markets. The merger may also have harmful effects as regards access by third parties to the satellite equipment produced by Hughes. State aid Decisions to raise no objection Measures that do not constitute State aid within the meaning of Article 87 of the EC Treaty Denmark and Sweden 1.3.67. Commission decisions on tax reductions for experts recruited abroad. Adopted on 3 May. The Commission has decided to raise no objection to the change to the Danish rules which consists in a reduction in the income tax payable by experts recruited abroad. It has also authorised the application of a Swedish sys tem comprising a reduction in the income tax paid by such experts and a corresponding reduction in the national insurance contributions paid by their employers. Since these measures are applicable to employers in all sections of industry, the Com mission has concluded that these are not aid schemes which fall under Article 87( 1 ) of the EC Treaty.

The Commission has de cided to raise no objection to the implementation by the Finnish authorities of several provisions of the scheme entitled 'Aid to Business Act 2000- 06'. These are measures comprising investment aid, aid for R &D and aid to small businesses. The annual budget for the scheme is about EUR 102 million. The Commission has discov ered that some of the measures were covered by the de minimis rules and did not fall, therefore, within the scope of Article 87(1) of the EC Treaty. As for the measures which it has ap proved, the Commission has concluded that they comply with the procedures and conditions of compatibility with the common market laid down in the different frameworks and guidelines con cerned. 32 Bull.

This is a firm in dif ficulty within the meaning of the guidelines, and the Commission has doubts about whether the conditions laid down in the guidelines have been met in order that aid to such firms can be consid ered to be compatible with the common market. It has also issued an injunction requiring the Ger man authorities to supply the information neces sary for an assessment of the case. Belgium 1.3.73.

Under the framework for State aid to the motor vehicle industry, regional aid may be au thorised only if there is an economically viable al ternative for the location of the project and, in the light of the information at its disposal, the Com mission has no assurance that this is the case here.

Commission decision on aid to Fesa-En- fersa (Fertiberia SA). in respect of aid in the form of a grant of EUR 1.37 million (NLG 3.02 million) to the bus manu facturer Autobusfabrick Bova bv. According to the Dutch authorities, this is environmental aid whose twofold purpose is to supply Peru with 15 buses which emit 50% less pollution than those already in the country and to set up a service for maintaining the buses and training the drivers and mechanics. The Commission has serious doubts about the compatibility of this aid with the provisions of the framework on environmental aid, which require in particular that aid should not be tied to a specific company. Moreover, the aid is not being granted to the purchaser but to the producer operating in the context of intra-Com- munity competition and seems, if anything, to be akin to export aid. Reference: Community guidelines on State aid for rescuing and reslructuring firms in difficulty: OJ C 288, 9.10.1999; Bull. 7/8-1999, point 1.3.43 Adopted on 16 May.

Parliament welcomed the draft Commission directive since it took the view that transparency was essential in order to estab lish fair competition as public undertakings were entering new markets, competing globally and seeking supplementary revenues, and this was bringing them into direct competition with the private sector. It believed that the obligation on these undertakings to keep separate and analytical accounts would enable the Commission to comply with its duty to ensure that the rules on competition were applied in a fair and effective manner.

According to the joint text, the refer ence payment deadline, imposed primarily if no deadline is specified in the contract, is to be thirty calendar days from the date of receipt of the invoice. Interest on late payments is then to be invoiced at seven percentage points above the European Central Bank rate (currently 11.25 %). Public and private debtors are to be treated equally, and reservation of title is to be admissible if the contract includes a clause to this effect. Approved by the Council on 18 May. The pro posal for a directive aims to solve the problems for businesses caused by late payment by harmo nising the deadline for payment at thirty days from the invoice date, unless otherwise specified in the contract, and by harmonising the interest rates on late payments. It also provides for the mutual recognition of retention-of-title clauses and simplified, accelerated debt-recovery proce dures.

The Committee welcomed the deci sion by the Lisbon European Council to draw up this charter for businesses lacking the financial and human resources of large companies. It sug gested incorporating the policies for small firms in public programmes and initiatives supported by the Member States and intensifying the cul tural and dynamic factors governing the relation ships between those working in small European firms. The Committee also stressed that public policies should promote access to the market by small entrepreneurs by removing the existing constraints and reducing inappropriate costs.

In its communication the Commission sets out the keynotes of the sustain able-development policy for the extractive indus try in the European Union, seeking a balance be tween the need to make extraction safer and cleaner and the need to keep it competitive. The Commission points out that the industry's envi ronmental-protection performance in general needs improvement and that accidents must be prevented. It stresses the need for clear and bal anced legislation at Community, national and lo cal level and for effective administrative struc tures and procedures, and calls on the Member States, the extractive industry and the other inter ested parties to work on creating a framework for consensus on identifiable objectives, a timetable for achieving them and specific measures to this effect.

It reiterated its sup port for the development of a world navigation system with strong European participation (Galileo system). It also called upon the Commis sion to draw up, in close cooperation with the European Space Agency (ESA) and the Member States, a proposal for an Earth observation plan and an environmental monitoring service.

Parliament called upon the Commission and the Member States to develop a new approach to the Community's research efforts which focuses on objectives and the way in which these European objectives can be achieved in a global context. According to Parliament, a 'European research area' requires a major contribution by the Euro pean institutions, directed towards encouraging an enhancement of efforts and improved coher ence between the various programmes at regional and Member State level. However, the contribu tion of the institutions should remain tightly fo cused on those objectives that can only be achieved at EU level and on ancillary activities such as monitoring progress, communicating in formation, fostering best practice, developing framework programmes, improving the legal framework, securing freedom of movement and dismantling barriers to research mobility and fa cilitating research networks and other mecha nisms geared to achieving a 'critical mass'. In addition, it suggested the establishment of a per manent research field dealing with the question of the ethics of science and technology, with the spe cific aim of undertaking a comparative study of the laws and ethical criteria governing the re search programmes, with a view to encouraging the development of a coherent and common ap proach to these issues. Parliament also calls upon the Commission to consult the scientific commu nity when formulating new research policy and to work more closely with industry to help establish a genuine European research area. In addition, it called for the introduction of an inexpensive Community patent and for consideration to be given to any other rules needed to permit the tran sition to the new knowledge-based economy. Economic and Social Committee opinion deliv ered on 24 May. The Committee shared the Com mission's views about pooling the resources available and setting up 'centres of excellence' by networking existing leading-edge research insti tutions. It considered that only a few centres of excellence should be set up initially, restricting the fields and work chosen to projects and objec- 3 S Bull. EU 5-2000 ",

The Committee also advocated simplifying the procedures for a European patent and reducing the costs, with English as the second common language for the patent. Lastly, with regard to mobility between re search institutions, universities and industry, the Committee takes the view that adequate incen tives and conditions should be created and that school and university courses should be made more comparable. The setting-up of a virtual Eu ropean university could be another instrument and symbol of European scientific integration.

It proposes that the Member States and the Com mission commit themselves to achieving the fol lowing three objectives by 2002: a cheaper, faster and secure Internet; investing in people and skills; and stimulating the use of the Internet. The objec tives will be achieved through eleven lines of action the thrust of which is to accelerate the adoption of legislation, deploy infrastructure and services across Europe and facilitate coordination between Member States, including via bench marking activities by the Commission.

Proposal for a Council decision adopting a multiannual Community programme to stimu late the development and use of European digital content on the global networks and to promote the linguistic diversity in the information society. Adopted on 24 May. The programme proposed by the Commission for the period 2001-05 as part of the eEurope initiative is aimed at promoting the development and use of European digital content and to promote linguistic diversity in the informa tion society. The concept of 'digital content' is in dependent of a specific medium or format and can be delivered over a multitude of existing and new delivery channels, including fast-growing and emerging services and platforms like mobile In ternet. The Commission proposes three lines of action: stimulating the exploitation of public sec tor information, enhancing linguistic and cultural customisation, and supporting market enablers. The goal is to help create an environment favour able to business initiatives where European crea tivity, cultural diversity and technical strengths can be commercially exploited.

The Council considered it vital for the Member States to act consistently and with solidarity in the context of the forthcoming nego tiations at the World Radiocommunications Con ference 2000, in order to defend the Community's interests to the highest possible degree. It wel comed the Commission's communication on the European positions for the conference, and ex pressed its broad support for the European com mon proposals notably in relation to third genera tion mobile communications (IMT-2000/UMTS), radionavigation satellite systems (Galileo), satel lite broadcasting, satellite broadband communica tions, and high-density fixed services. 1.3.95.

Welcoming the timely and efficient implementation of the telecommunica tions regulatory package in most Member States and the fast response of the market to the new pos sibilities offered, Parliament was nevertheless deeply concerned about the fact that limited offer at local loop level has prevented liberalisation from providing its full potential to most users and from contributing to a reduction in the cost of ac cess to the Internet. It therefore demanded that steps be taken to foster all forms of unbundled ac cess to the local telephone loop and to other exist ing fixed infrastructure and also to encourage and facilitate the development and use of new alterna tive infrastructure, in particular wireless local loop systems, without having to resort to specific legislation on this issue. It called for a special re view of the cable market, with particular attention being paid to the ownership of cable systems by incumbent operators and for consideration to be given to a more competitive regime that stimu lates new investment and service provision. Lastly, Parliament congratulated the Commission for its clear analysis of the situation and for hav ing launched a wide-ranging and transparent con sultation process. 1.3.96.

It also called upon them to take concrete measures to ensure the availability of sufficient frequency bands for use by public and private broadcasting and by amateur radio licensees, as well as for passive uses, such as earth observation and radio astronomy or for radio satellite naviga tion systems. Furthermore, Parliament called upon the Member States to review public use of frequencies, for example by the armed forces, to ascertain whether frequencies could be released by means of more efficient use, for instance by making technical improvements. 1.3.97.

Commission decision approving the sin gle programming document (SPD) for Commu nity structural assistance under Objective 1 in the province of Hainaut in Belgium for 2000-06. Approved on 10 May. Formally adopted on 15 May. The purpose of this programme is to stimulate the expansion of eco nomic activity in Hainaut. During the period con cerned, the province will receive assistance of EUR 645 million from the EU Structural Funds, to help it to become gradually independent of Fund support under Objective 1. Altogether, this EU funding will mobilise EUR 2 221 million in investment in Hainaut, of which EUR 914 million will be part-financing from the private sector. The programme concentrates on wealth-creating in vestment that generates permanent jobs. It pays special attention to the impact of the global econ omy, innovation and technology transfer. The de velopment of cooperation networks is also a pri ority. These measures will support modernisation of the economy by acting simultaneously on all the fundamental factors in the growth process: 'physical capital', 'knowledge capital' and 'hu man capital'. The SPD lists six priorities for ac tion: growth through the expansion of the produc tive base in industry and market services; growth through the knowledge economy, through the de velopment and exploitation of Hainaut's potential for research and technological innovation, in par ticular new communication and information tech nology; developing the potential of agriculture, forestry, aquaculture and the countryside; making Bull.

Approved on 12 May. Formally adopted on 24 May. The main objective of the SPD is to increase the number of businesses throughout the entire area and assist their devel opment through the following approaches: im proving the skills level, focusing on sectors with potential for growth, developing efficient produc tion methods, fostering cooperation between businesses and with research institutes, and devel oping reindeer farming so as to create jobs and preserve the Sami culture. Environmental protec tion and improvement and equal opportunities have been fully integrated into the various meas ures in the SPD. These regions will receive EUR 391 million in assistance from the EU Structural Funds. Altogether, this EU funding will mobilise EUR 1 040 million in investment, of which EUR 353 million will be part-financing from the pri vate sector. 1.3.102.

Approved on 17 May. Formally adopted on 24 May. The general strat egy of the SPD for S\u00f6dra Skogsl\u00e4n is intended to encourage development and knowledge-based growth in the region's businesses. The purpose is basically to increase employment, cut unemploy ment and attract sufficient newcomers to the re gion to balance the outflows in the long term. This strategy will differentiate between the coast and the inland areas. It involves broadening and re generating the business sector; improving the skills level in business and the general population; strengthening the spirit of entrepreneurship and encouraging new and competitive businesses; creating closer partnership between the public sector, society at large and the private sector, to improve the business climate and make the region more attractive to newcomers; placing more em phasis on internationalisation; improving contacts between research and education centres and busi nesses. Environmental protection and equal op portunities will be fully integrated into the various measures in the SPD. These regions will receive EUR 356 million in assistance from the EU Struc tural Funds. Altogether, this EU funding will mo bilise EUR 1 325 million in investment, of which EUR 336 million will be part-financing from the private sector. 1.3.103. Draft Commission decision in principle approving the single programming document (SPD) for Community structural assistance under Objective 1 in the region of Flevoland in the Netherlands for 2000-06. Approved on 31 May. The main guidelines of the SPD for Flevoland arc to further integrate Flevol and into a wider surrounding, focus on activities that arc potentially successful and future-ori ented, and guarantee a high-quality environment. The strategy is based on different approaches for urban and rural areas; the territorial and social di vision between the two is more pronounced than elsewhere in the Netherlands. The SPD aims at strengthening production structures by promoting investment in businesses or business services with strong growth potential in sectors such as in formation and communications technology, med ical technology, biotechnology, pharmaceuticals, environmental technology, food-processing, met allurgie industry and processing of synthetic materials. Special attention will be paid to meas ures in favour of SMEs, in the form of support for research and development, the promotion of e-commcrce and internationalisation of their activities. In terms of social cohesion and the la bour market, the SPD aims at organising sec tor-oriented short-track training sessions with a focus on young people and women without a job. The Community will contribute financing of EUR 126 million. Altogether, the programme 42 Bull. EU 5-2000 ",

These regions will need to invest sub stantially to improve regional competitiveness, so as to create long-term viable jobs. Five major ar eas for action linked to the priorities of the CSF have been defined: promoting the competitive ness of industry, in particular SMEs; infrastruc ture measures; environmental protection and im provement; promoting labour potential and equal opportunities; rural development and fisheries. These development priorities will be backed up by technical assistance. The regional programmes are accompanied by three horizontal programmes managed at Federal level (transport, human re sources and fish farming). The CSF pays special attention to equal opportunities and sustainable development. Many measures are also intended to support the transition to the information society. Regulation (EC) No 1655/1999; OJ L 197, 29.7.1999; Bull. 7/8-1999, point 1.3 Adopted on 4 May. Parliament considered it nec essary to increase the budgetary resources allo cated for the development of a trans-European transport network (TEN-T) and took the view that to finance it a package of integrated measures is needed. In this connection, Parliament welcomed the revision of Regulation (EC) No 2236/95 aimed at securing as high a contribution as possi ble from the private sector, paving the way for public/private partnerships and tapping venture capital to finance TEN projects. However, it con sidered that recourse to private funding should not be an obstacle to the development of communica tions in areas which currently have a lower per capita income. Similarly, it expressed concern that, if the revision of the TEN-T guidelines were to concentrate on existing bottlenecks, it would assign only secondary importance to the situation of the peripheral and outermost regions. Lastly, it called upon the Commission to reduce the propor tion of resources assigned to feasibility studies and related matters.

Pointing to the links between trafficking in persons and mi gration and asylum policies, it recommends a common EU policy underpinned by a legal frame work and effective measures geared to preven tion, protection and support for victims. Believing that a clear and harmonised definition is a neces sary precondition for effectively countering trafficking in women, Parliament calls on the Commission to make specific proposals for har monising national laws and methods of detection and prosecution, and to take a number of immedi ate and effective measures. It calls on the appli cant countries to take action on the legislative, administrative and police fronts to combat traf ficking in women and to develop international co operation, particularly with Europol and Interpol, with a view to detecting and dismantling criminal networks. Parliament also takes the view that per secution on grounds of sex and, specifically, traf ficking in human beings should justify the grant ing of refugee status. 1.4.3.

The pro posal specifies, among other things, the immedi acy of the protection, the maximum duration thereof (two years), the Member States' obliga tions towards the beneficiaries of such protection (issuing of a residence document, providing ac cess to employment and suitable housing, neces- 46 Bull.

COM(2000) 279 New and renewable energy sources Promotion of new and renewable energy sources 1.4.40. Proposal for a European Parliament and Council directive on the promotion of electricity from renewable energy sources. Adopted by the Commission on 10 May. The pur pose of this proposal is to ensure that the govern ments of the Member States and the European en ergy industry commit themselves to increase the use of renewable energy sources in electricity production so that the EU can meet its commit ments under the Kyoto Protocol on climate change to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 8 % by 2010 and double (from 6 % to 12 %) the share of renewable energy in gross inland energy consumption, which means that renewable elec tricity's share must increase from 13.9 % to 22 %. It is based on three elements: D indicative targets for future consumption of green electricity for each Member State: the Com mission considers that national targets to be set each year by the Member States will have the value of a political commitment on their part, and the figures given in an annex to the directive have been arrived at on the basis of the most neutral possible criteria, taking into account the plans adopted by each of them, their renewable energy production potential and the need to spread the ef fort between the 15 Member States; \u00dc a support scheme for the production of green electricity that will leave intact the current prac tices in the various Member States: the leeway given to Member States should make it possible to build up sufficient experience to be able to pro pose a harmonised system as from 2005, given Energy efficiency and rational use of energy Community action plan on energy efficiency 1.4.41.

The Council considered that the communication on the promotion of energy efficiency and the action plan submitted by the Commission in April are a decisive contribution to promoting energy efficiency and helping to achieve the Kyoto commitments. It broadly en dorsed the strategy set up by the Commission, confirming the need for Community and national measures to remove market barriers that may pre vent the realisation of energy savings, and the need to strengthen and expand the existing poli cies and measures, to consider closer integration of the energy efficiency dimension into other Community policies and to envisage new actions. In particular, it called upon the Commission to work with the Member States to define more pre cisely how coordinated measures will work, to come forward with early proposals for future pro grammes, bearing in mind that the SAVE subpro gramme and the fifth research framework pro gramme expire in 2002, to consider appropriate changes with a view to improving energy effi ciency during the revision of the Community guidelines on State aid for environmental protec- 56 Bull.

Parliament notes that, ac cording to the Commission, measurable progress has been achieved in the development of technical specifications for interoperability (TSI) since the adoption of Directive 96/48/EC and that the con ditions for a genuine opening-up of the railway equipment market and the appearance of new forms of commercial exploitation have at last been achieved. However, it deplores the fact that no TSI has been adopted, while interoperability was regarded as fundamental to the mobility of persons and the efficiency of trans-European rail way systems. It pointed out that so far only two Member States have incorporated the provisions of the directive into their national law and that, even if the high-speed services such as Eurostar and Thalys are a success, differences from one Member State to another still represent a consid erable handicap to the development of rail trans port in Europe. Parliament also stresses the valu able contribution that the development of a coherent and reliable trans-European railway sys tem can make to the political and economic inte gration of the various countries. 1.4.46.

Parlia ment wanted in particular a broader definition of interoperability, by including social provisions. However, it specified that the directive is not aimed directly or indirectly at harmonising working conditions in the rail sector but only staff qualifications and health and safety condi tions at work that are a vital part of the operation of the system. Parliament also wants the social partners to be involved in preparing and revising technical specifications for interoperability in relation to professional qualifications and health and safely conditions. It also introduces a list of priorities for the harmonisation of the trans-Eu ropean freight transport network, in particular concerning control and command and signalling, traffic management (including staff qualifica tions for trans-frontier services), rolling stock and noise.

Parliament took the view that the development of a single market in the Euro pean airline industry has led to positive competi tion which should not, however, be diminished by other factors such as delays or congestion. It reit erated its support for the setting-up of a European Air Safety Authority (EASA). It called upon the Commission to submit a proposal on working conditions for air traffic control staff and common standards for training and licensing for all techni cal and commercial flight staff. Parliament reiter ated its request for completing the internal market by creating a single European airspace. To this end, it called upon the Member States to transfer to the European Union regulative responsibility for air traffic control. It also called upon the com petition authorities to rigorously enforce rules against unfair practices and considered that the formation of global strategic alliances should be seen in a positive light as long as they do not force smaller airlines or new entrants out of the market. Lastly, Parliament called upon the Commission to propose measures to restrict as far as possible the adverse effects of the growth in aviation, by re ducing emissions and using more modern tech niques which are less polluting. Health and consumer protection Public health 1.4.50. Commission communication on the health strategy of the European Community, accompa nied by a proposal for a European Parliament and Council decision adopting a programme of action in the field of public health.

In these two documents, the Commission sets out the key elements of the Community strategy geared to implementing the health-related objectives and requirements laid down in Articles 3( 1 )(p) and 152 of the EC Treaty. The new framework for action in the field of public health, presented in the communication, should enable the Community to face up to its obligations effectively by setting out clear ob jectives and policy instruments. Besides the public health programme, the new framework encompasses other legislative measures, includ ing the possibility of taking decisions in respect of veterinary and plant-health legislation, meas ures having to do with standards of quality and safety of organs and substances of human ori gin, and in relation to blood and blood deriva tives. Furthermore, a European health forum will be set up to give all those involved in the public health field an opportunity to play a part in the development of health policy and to help ensure that the concerns of the general public are fully addressed. The proposed action programme in the health field focuses on three priorities: improving health information and knowledge, rapid response to health threats, and action in connection with health determinants (effective health-promotion and disease-prevention measures). This pro gramme will provide significant added value while respecting fully the responsibilities of the Member States for the organisation and provision of health services and medical care.

Belarus 1.6.4. The following Presidency statement on be half of the European Union concerning the judg ment handed down against Mr Mikhail Chigir, was published in Brussels and Lisbon on 25 May. 'Bearing in mind that Mr Chigir's return to prison would have put paid to any hope of establishing the cli mate of confidence necessary for the holding and ob servation of democratic elections in Belarus, the Euro pean Union notes that he remains at liberty. However, the sentence imposed on Mr Chigir on 19 May 2000 is designed to prevent him from playing a proper part in politics and in the coming elections in his country. The European Union regrets this further instance of the use of legal proceedings against opposition figures for political purposes, which: D illustrates the blurring of powers in Belarus, al though separation of powers forms a basic principle of all European democracies; D does not help efforts to establish the conditions deemed essential to the organisation of free, democratic elections; D also casts doubt on the credibility of the national di alogue process set in motion by the authorities, just when they have agreed to hold talks with opposition parties. The European Union, which since Mr Chigir's arrest in March 1999 has constantly denounced the political ex ploitation of this case, like others before it, therefore keenly hopes that the hearing of the appeal lodged by Mr Chigir before the Supreme Court in Belarus may provide an opportunity to revise the judgment against him and thus facilitate the holding of the coming elec tions in an acceptable manner. The central and east European countries associated with the European Union, the associated countries Cy prus, Malta and Turkey, and the EFTA countries mem bers of the European Economic Area, align themselves with this declaration.'

'Ten years after the 1990 legislative elections in Burma/Myanmar, which the democratic party, the Na tional League for Democracy (NLD), won by such a convincing margin, the European Union deeply regrets that the Burmese authorities still fail to respect the clear democratic verdict of the people. The European Union furthermore expresses its grave concern that the period leading up to this anniversary has been marked by fresh arrests of NLD activists. It reiterates its call on the Burmese authorities to re spect human rights, restore democracy and engage in a dialogue with opposition parties and ethnic minorities that could lead to lasting national reconciliation in a united and democratic State.

'In view of the ministerial meeting of the PIC for Bos nia and Her/.egovina, taking place on 23-24 May, the EU recalled its full commitment to the peace process in Bosnia and Herzegovina. In this regard, it commended the remarkable work accomplished in Bosnia and Herzegovina by the High Representative and his staff, and reiterated its entire support to their action. The European Union took note that approaching the fifth year after Dayton substantial progress has been made. The security situation has stabilised. Major re construction has been completed. Minority returns are accelerating. The Brcko District is established and functioning. Successive elections have initiated a trend towards growing political pluralism. Bosnia and Herze govina is accepted as a nation State. There is a new mood across Bosnia and Herzegovina as we move into the new millennium. The people of Croatia have shown the way by voting for peace, freedom and justice. There is a movement towards true 'ownership' by the people and by civil society, with democratic freedom and eco nomic transparency finally taking root. However, much more could have been achieved: polit ical obstruction and the pursuit of narrow ethnic agen das by some, is holding the people of Bosnia and Herzegovina back from reaping the full economic and democratic benefits the Dayton/Paris Accords held out to them. The European Union supports the High Repre sentative in the use of his full powers to ensure imple mentation of the peace accords, including the removal of those obstructing economic reforms. The programme presented, if agreed to by the PIC, will empower the people of Bosnia and Herzegovina to seize the opportunities open to those in a modern Euro pean Slate, and to choose the path of prosperity and democratic freedoms. Implementing Dayton/Paris Accords means: D Accelerating economic reform to avoid economic collapse. Breaking the stranglehold of political parties on economic and commercial life.

'The European Union welcomes the decision by Prime Minister Koirala's government in Nepal to extend the mandate of the Deuba Commission, which has been set up to create a cross-party consensus among the coun try's democratic groups and pave the way for negotia tions with the Maoist insurgents. In the European Un ion's view a negotiating process offers the best chance of resolving Nepal's problems for the longer term. The European Union has observed with growing con cern the escalation of the internal conflict following the declaration of the people's war more than four years ago. Maoist attacks against representatives of the dem ocratic State and civilians are always unacceptable and, frequently, barbarian. The avowed aim of the insur gents is to overturn the democratic order. The European Union upholds the government of Ne pal's right to defend the country's newly established democracy in countering this terrorist insurgency. The European Union notes that the democratic State has the sole right to use legitimate force to preserve the rights and security of its citizens. The European Union be lieves that the authorities in Nepal must seek to estab lish basic security and an environment in which devel opmental efforts to overcome poverty can be pursued, and that the insurgency hinders the development proc ess. The Union notes that a number of international author ities including the UN special rapporteur on extrajudi cial killings. Amnesty International and the US State department have reported on extensive human rights abuses by both the insurgents and the Nepal police fol lowing the Maoists' declaration of the people's war. The European Union calls on the Maoist insurgents to call an immediate halt to their violence and on the Nepalese government to ensure that its representatives act uniquely within the bounds of the law. The European Union also recalls that it is the responsi bility of the government in Kathmandu, through effec tive leadership and proper governance, to investigate allegations of extremely serious human rights abuses by the Nepalese police, including extrajudicial killings, torture and disappearances, and systematically to pros ecute those responsible. The government must in the view of the European Union, issue strong and clear guidelines to the Nepal police to avoid the recurrence of such abuses in the future. The culture of impunity must be ended. The European Union therefore strongly urges both par ties to redouble their efforts to create the necessary con ditions to enter into early and serious negotiations lead ing to a full and permanent peace.

Re\u00ad porting freely and independently in Serbia is an act of democracy and public service. In contrast, the Serbian Government's flagrant meas\u00ad ures to block free media constitute an unacceptable de\u00ad nial of the right to freedom of expression and clearly demonstrate the wishes of the Government of the FRY to continue the path towards total isolation, despite the democratic aspirations of the Serbian people.

The following Presidency statement on behalf of the European Union on the recent events in Serbia was published in Brussels and Lisbon on 22 May. 'The European Union is deeply concerned at the latest developments in Serbia and strongly condemns the takeover of Belgrade's independent TV station Studio \u0392 on Wednesday, 17 May and the simultaneous actions against Radio B292, Radio Index, the daily BLIC as well as TV Mladenovac. This action, following continuing mass arrests and de\u00ad tention of opposition representatives and student lead\u00ad ers, heavy punishment of independent media, repres\u00ad sion of journalists and obstacles to public rallies of the democratic forces, is the latest in a series of repressive actions by the Milosevic regime. The Council expressed its concern over reports regard\u00ad ing further measures to be taken by the regime against the democratic opposition and civil society. The increasing policy of repression by the regime is leading FRY and Serbia into a position of greater dis\u00ad tance from free and democratic Europe, increasing the isolation of the country and running against the wishes of the Serbian people. Almost 10 years after the dismantling of the SFR of Yugoslavia, the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia re\u00ad mains the only one among the south-east European States which still stands isolated from the mainstream of Europe. President Milosevic's regime alone is re\u00ad sponsible for that situation. The European Union has deployed great efforts to help the transition process of countries of the western Bal\u00ad kans to democracy and a market economy, through substantial economic support, technical assistance, the offer of contractual relations and the development of enhanced political dialogue. The European Union, together with the countries of the region, is also working in the framework of the Stabil\u00ad ity Pact to bring those countries closer to the prospect of integration in the Euro-Atlantic structures. Much has already been achieved. The European Union is looking forward to welcoming the FRY in this framework of cooperation after a successful democratic change in Serbia has been achieved. The European Union's policy is not directed against the Serbian people, but against President Milosevic's re\u00ad gime which is violating basic human rights in the most flagrant manner. The European Union has no quarrel with the Serbian people. This is why the European Un\u00ad ion is providing substantial humanitarian assistance, developing a comprehensive dialogue with civil soci\u00ad ety and taking measures to support democracy and the independent media in Serbia.' 70 Bull.

The purpose of the agreement is to promote fair conditions of compe tition on the world market and concert efforts to stabilise it at a commercially sustainable level.

The report states that the world market for merchant vessels is still in crisis and weak prices are persisting be cause of the extremely low prices offered by Ko rean shipyards. The Commission is continuing to monitor the market and to implement all the measures initiated to resolve the problem, in par ticular trying to obtain formal undertakings by the Korean Government of non-intervention in the financing of shipbuilding activities. It therefore recommends exercising continued pressure on the Republic of Korea to reapply the provisions of the agreed minutes and to participate in efforts to im prove the market situation; collecting further evi dence on possible injurious harmful practices which could constitute obstacles to trade; keeping the IMF informed about findings so that Korea is closely monitored; and encouraging the EU ship building industry to further improve its competi tiveness.

Noting that in spite of vari ous efforts, the external debt of many developing countries had increased even further, Parliament asked the European Union and its Member States to promote a strategy to provide faster debt relief or cancellation for the poorest countries, based on respect for democratic principles and good gov ernance. It called on the governments of the ben eficiary countries to implement the necessary economic reform measures and commit them selves to channelling the savings from debt relief into poverty alleviation.

The Council presented rec ommendations on the basis of the evaluation of development instruments and programmes by the Commission and the Member States. As regards internal coordination within the European Union, it asked the Commission and the Member States to take advantage of the potential for complemen tary action on a country-by-country and sec tor-by-sector basis; to adapt the partner country strategy documents taking account of the need for a poverty reduction strategy; to pinpoint obstacles to more frequent use of co-financing and draw up proposals for harmonising procedures and finan cial rules; to strengthen the coordination of hu manitarian aid; and to step up the exchange of in formation. The Council stressed the importance of strengthening the partner country's ability to assume responsibility in working out develop ment programmes and strategies. Lastly, on the subject of\" the role of coordination within the Eu ropean Union in relation to broader coordination, the Council asked the Commission and the Mem ber States to play a proactive role in the coordina tion arrangements established by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank and the United Nations and to step up their own coor dination in order to make the arrangements more effective and thereby increase the influence and visibility of the European Union. 1.6.55.

In this communication, the Commission proposes reforms in the manage ment of Community external aid, aiming above all to reduce the time taken to implement ap proved projects, to make significant improve ments in the quality and responsiveness of project management, to ensure robust management pro cedures in line with the best international stand ards and, finally, to improve the impact and the visibility of EC aid. In order to implement this reform, the Commis sion recommends: D a radical overhaul and unification in the pro gramming of external assistance in order to reflect the EU's policy objectives and priorities; D integration of the project cycle, from identifi cation of projects to implementation; D creation of a single body in charge of projects ('EuropeAid') to lake over from the Common Service for External Relations (SCR): D extensive devolution of project management to the Commission's delegations and, where con ditions pennit, the authorities in beneficiary countries; D developing a common administrative culture within the external relations departments; D measures to eliminate old and dormant com mitments.

Elements of a comprehensive strategy.'. Reference: Conclusions of the Cardiff European Council of June 1998: Bull. 6-1998, point 1.11 Adopted on 10 May. In this communication, which responds to the commitments made by the Cardiff European Council concerning the integra tion of the environment and sustainable develop ment in Community policies, the Commission outlines a strategy to ensure that the environment is a key element in the European Union's support for the developing countries. Pointing out that the developing countries have primary responsibility for identifying and responding to environmental issues and for integrating environmental consid erations into their policies, the Commission stresses that EC economic and development co operation programmes should support developing countries' own efforts to protect their own envi ronment and the shared global environment. It also states that the EU's efforts to help the devel oping countries integrate into the world economy should also reflect their commitment to environ mental sustainability in the context of the next World Trade Organisation round. The Commis sion puts particular emphasis on the major UN Environmental Conventions on climate, biodiver sity and desertification and the role thai develop ing countries can play in these global environ mental issues. Lastly, it notes that Community funding which is specifically targeted on the envi ronment is modest compared with the overall flows of Community aid and that the key chal lenge is systematically to strengthen the integra- 76 Bull.

The two proposals for regulations on EU assistance to the western Balkans (Albania, Bosnia and Herze govina, Croatia, the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and the Federal Republic of Yugo slavia (Serbia and Montenegro)) are aimed at im proving, simplifying and accelerating EU action in the region. Essentially, the Commission pro poses bringing together, on a single legal basis and in a single programme, the initiatives cur rently covered by the Phare and Obnova pro grammes, setting clearer and more precise objec tives for Community action, and encouraging close regional cooperation between recipient countries. Assistance would go to reconstruction and stabilisation in the region, to support for de mocracy, the rule of law, human and minority rights, and promoting economic development and reforms geared to creating market economies. The Commission also proposes that the assistance be programmed in close collaboration with the authorities of the countries concerned, who will have to undertake to pursue the institutional, ad ministrative and economic reforms, and that re spect for democratic principles, fundamental freedoms, and human and minority rights should constitute preconditions for receiving the assist ance. Regulation (EC) No 2454/1999 setting up the European Agency for Reconstruction would also be adapted to the new regulation on assist ance. COM(2000)281 1.6.66.

Proposal for a Parliament and Council decision concerning the revision of the financial perspective, accompanied by a communication from the Com mission to the Council and Parliament on the finan cial programming of heading 4 (External action). Reference: Council Regulation (EC) No 555/2000 on the implementation of operations in the frame work of the pre-accession strategy for Cyprus and Malta: OJL 68, 16.3.2000; Bull. 3-2000, point 1.5.6 Adopted by the Commission on 3 May. The Com mission proposes raising the ceiling of the External action heading of the financial perspective (heading 4) by EUR 300 million a year from 2001 to 2006, in order to finance aid to the Balkans for 2000-06, without increasing the overall amount of the financial perspective (thanks to an equivalent reduction in heading 1 (Agriculture)). Following the adoption by the Council of a regulation on aid to Cyprus and Malta, the Commission also proposes reclassifying this aid (EUR 20 million) by moving it from heading 4 (External action) to a new sub heading of heading 7 (Pre-accession aid). This re classification in no way changes the purpose of the aid and the amounts already programmed. COM(2000) 262; COM(2000) 268 Budgetaiy procedures 2001 financial year 1.7.2. Preliminary draft budget 2001. References: Conclusions of the Berlin European Council: Bull. 3-1999, point 1.4 Commission communication on activity-based budgeting (ABB): Bull. 11-1999, point 1.7.1 Budget 2000: OJ L 40,14.2.2000; Bull. 12-1999, point 1.6.3 Commission communication on the priorities for the 2001 budget: COM(2000) 158; Bull. 1/2-2000, point 1.7.1 Approved by the Commission on 10 May. The preliminary draft budget (PDB) for 2001 (see Tables 7 and 8), which fits into the revised finan cial framework proposed by the Commission (-> point 1.7.1), totals EUR 96.924 billion in commitment appropriations and EUR 93.874 bil lion in payment appropriations, well below the overall ceilings. The large margins left beneath the ceilings agreed at the Berlin European Coun cil are EUR 427 million for commitments and EUR 1 019 million for payments. The prelimi nary draft is marked by budgetary rigour: if agri cultural expenditure is excluded, the growth in commitment appropriations compared with the 2000 budget is 1 %. The focus is on the priorities identified by the Commission: increased involve ment in foreign affairs and a strong commitment towards enlargement, support for rural develop ment, the creation of a knowledge-based society, and improvement of the living conditions of Eu ropean citizens. The PDB was produced for the first time, as the Commission proposed in No vember 1999, using an activity-based budgeting approach. It was presented in its traditional form and sent officially in this form to the budgetary authority. The broad lines of the preliminary draft are as fol lows: D the agriculture budget is 7.6 % up compared with 2000; this increase is largely the result of the Agenda 2000 decisions taken at the Berlin Euro pean Council in 1999; Bull. EU 5-2000 91 ",
        "Budgets D for structural measures the preliminary draft contains total amounts corresponding to what was agreed in Berlin in 1999; in the interests of tight budgeting, the payment appropriations are kept at virtually the same level as in 2000; D the Commission's margin of manoeuvre on internal policies is fairly limited, as four fifths of the expenditure on these policies is determined in advance by allocations agreed by the Council and Parliament under the co-decision procedure; in addition the increase possible compared with the 2000 budget corresponds exactly to the increase planned for the fifth research framework pro gramme; the preliminary draft budget responds primarily to two of the four priorities identified by the Commission in the strategic options for the next five years, namely the new economic and so cial agenda, designed to build a knowledge-based society, and improvement of the living conditions of European citizens; the increase for research is 8 %, and special priority is given to education and youth (Socrates and Leonardo programmes); the preliminary draft budget for 2001 also carries large amounts for the social dialogue, measures to combat discrimination and, in the field of justice and home affairs, for the Refugee Fund; D on the external relations front, assistance to the western Balkans is a top priority for the Union (EUR 815 million is earmarked for the region, a large increase compared with the 2000 budget); in order to fund the assistance to the Balkans, the commitment appropriations for nearly all the other external operations are cut to below the 2000 budget levels; in payments, however, the al locations continue to increase; in addition the funds entered are well above those for the previ ous programming period 1993-99; food aid and humanitarian aid are kept at the same level as in the 2000 budget; broadly speaking the Commis sion has sought to focus the available resources on actions forming part of a strategy for combat ing poverty; D the increase in the Commission's administra tive expenditure (excluding pensions) is 2.3 %; no new posts, with the exception of the 76 posts already agreed for the European Anti-Fraud Of fice (OLAF), have been requested at this stage. 1.7.3.

Reference: Budget 2000: OJ L 40. 14.2.2000; Bull. 12-1999. point 1.6.3 Approved by the Commission on 10 May. The pur pose of the preliminary draft amending budget for the 2000 financial year is to enter the balance for the 1999 financial year (EUR 3.2 billion), revise certain amounts of own resources (in particular the VAT and GNP-based resources), adapt certain amounts in the calculation of the correction of the budgetary imbalance for the United Kingdom, and introduce some new budget lines (in particular the line for the 'rapid reaction facility').

        "2. Council declaration on the Commission programme for 2000 2.2.7. On 25 May the Council adopted the follow ing declaration. 'In accordance with the Interinstitutional Declaration of 25 October 1993 on democracy, transparency and subsidiarity, and having noted the Commission's stra tegic objectives for 2000-05, the Commission's work programme for 2000, and the European Parliament's resolutions of 17 February and 16 March 2000, the Council of the European Union presents its priorities for the year 2000 which are set out below. At an institutional level the Intergovernmental Confer ence (IGC), which was convened with the Council's agreement and began work on 14 February, will amend the structures and functioning of the Union with a view to its enlargement. The Portuguese Presidency will sub mit a report on progress to date to the Feira European Council, and will be able to propose the addition of new items to the agenda at that point. The IGC's work should be completed before the end of the French Pres idency. The Biarritz European Council in mid-October will provide a useful opportunity to meet at an ad vanced stage in those negotiations. The convention to draw up the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union will present a draft in good time for it to be considered by the European Council before the end of the year, and to make possi ble its joint promulgation by the institutions. It will then have to be considered whether and, if so, how the char ter should be integrated into the Treaties. In the field of the common European security and de fence policy and in that of crisis prevention, the Euro pean Councils at Cologne and Helsinki gave the deci sive impetus for the establishment of structures and instruments making it possible to elaborate both the headline goal and the military capability target needed to achieve the full range of Petersberg tasks, as agreed at those European Councils, while respecting the third subparagraph of Article 17(1) of the Treaty on Euro pean Union. In the same context, an action plan for the strengthening of non-military crisis management in struments was also adopted. The Council underlines the role of its Sccrctary-Gen- eral/High Representative for the Common Foreign and Security Policy in support of those efforts, and in the improved coordination of the Community's actions throughout the world. The Council, acting on the conclusions of the Helsinki European Council, has also tackled the question of im provements in its own functioning, and has taken an in itial decision on a reduction in the number of Council formations. The Council is also following with interest the Com mission's plans for reform to ensure improved effi ciency, greater transparency and increased responsibil ity. The Council asks that these administrative reforms should be implemented rapidly; it will monitor this work closely and participate actively in the reform process, regularly examining the progress made in this respect. In the same spirit, the Council declares that it is deter mined to contribute to the adoption of a Statute for Members of the European Parliament and to a satisfac tory solution as regards parliamentary assistants. The Council welcomes the steps taken by the Commis sion to develop its approach in the direction of dialogue and openness. It will pay particular attention to the adoption of provisions on the rights of access to docu ments from the institutions as stipulated in Article 255 of the EC Treaty. The year 2000 also marks a new stage in one of the ma jor areas of work for the Union, namely its enlarge ment, and will afford an overall view of the negotia tions. Negotiations with the six applicant countries designated by the Luxembourg European Council in December 1997 (the Czech Republic, Estonia, Hun gary, Cyprus, Poland and Slovenia) are now well ad vanced, and the Helsinki European Council decided to open negotiations officially with six other applicants (Bulgaria. Latvia, Lithuania, Malta, Romania and Slo vakia). The Helsinki European Council also opened a new chapter in relations with Turkey, deciding to rec ognise it as an applicant country and to work with it, following the conclusion of an Accession Partnership, towards the fulfilment of the necessary conditions for the opening of effective negotiations, as laid down in its conclusions. Finally the European Conference should be convened in 2000 to discuss subjects of common in terest for the Union and the applicant countries. The Union's economic and social agenda is marked by the new momentum provided by the Lisbon European Bull. EU 5-2000 119 ",
        "Council declaration on the Commission programme for 2000 Council on employment, economic reform and social cohesion as part of a knowledge-based economy; its main result has been the setting of a new strategic goal, based on a new open method of coordination at all lev els and on an action programme with a precise timeta ble, while integrating and strengthening the process launched by the Luxembourg, Cardiff and Cologne Eu ropean Councils, particularly the central role of the broad economic policy guidelines. The achievement of an information society for all, of a European area of research and innovation, and of a fa vourable climate for the creation and development of innovative businesses (particularly small and me dium-sized enterprises), the completion and constant adaptation of all aspects of the internal market (includ ing financial markets which are both efficient and inte grated in the framework of monetary union and the introduction of the euro) and through seeking an im provement in fiscal coordination, should be combined with the modernisation of the European social model to invest in human resources \u2014 particularly through edu cation and training, the encouragement of mobility and policies in favour of equality of opportunity and treat ment between men and women, especially in the world of work \u2014 and is to be founded on a socially active State. The cultural dimension should also not be neglected, particularly in the field of audiovisual production. The mid-term review of the Luxembourg process will pro vide an opportunity to develop the coordinated strategy on employment. The Council will ensure that prepara tions are made for the adoption of a European social agenda at the European Council at Nice. Other internal policies share this approach, with a dy namic and stable economy being strengthened by the integration of environmental considerations, and by at tention being paid to consumer protection, particularly with regard to public health and food safety, where in creased efforts will be made. The Council will also make every effort to further work on the proposal for a new action programme for the en vironment, which will constitute the environmental el ement of the European Union's sustainable develop ment programme. Particular attention will be paid to transport safety. With regard to the outermost regions, the Council in tends to adopt the first measures implementing the new provisions laid down in the Amsterdam Treaty (Article 299(2) of the EC Treaty). Another aspect which directly affects citizens is the es tablishment of the European area of freedom, security and justice as decided by the Tampere European Coun cil, in implementation of the Amsterdam Treaty. The Council welcomes the 'scoreboard' presented by the Commission, and the list of proposals which it intends to submit to the Council during the year, particularly on asylum and immigration, improved access to justice, measures on crime prevention (particularly urban juve nile delinquency) and on an improvement in the mutual recognition of judgments, increased convergence of provisions on civil matters, particularly rules on juris diction, and an intensification of police, judicial and ad ministrative cooperation, particularly in respect of the fight against major organised and transnational crime (especially drug-trafficking, money-laundering, traf ficking in human beings, etc). The role of the European Police Office (Europol) should be reinforced in this area, and the contributions of the European Monitoring Centre on Racism and Xenophobia and of the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction should be encouraged. Finally, the Council emphasises the importance of the respect of provisions on data protection. The Feira European Council should define the goals and measures required for external action by the Union in the field of justice and home affairs, in order to en sure the greatest possible effectiveness for decisions re lating to the area of freedom, security and justice. In this respect the Council welcomes the cooperation es tablished with certain third States in the Schengen con text. In the field of external relations, the Council, assisted by the High Representative for the CFSP, in full coop eration with the Commission and with the support of the special envoys which it has appointed, will aim above all to ensure the greatest possible consistency be tween all the aspects involved, whether these are eco nomic, political or security-related. The year 2000 will be marked by cooperation with de veloping countries, particularly on the basis of the com munication just adopted by the Commission. With re gard to the African, Caribbean and Pacific States (ACP), the recently concluded Partnership Agreement \u2014 which succeeds the Lom\u00e9 Convention \u2014 will be signed before the summer in Suva. The Cairo summit on 3 and 4 April between Africa and the EU opened the way to strengthening cooperation and solidarity between the two continents, based on the declaration and action plan agreed there. In the Euro-Mediterranean area, there will be another Euro-Mediterranean Conference in the autumn of 2000, and also, if circumstances permit, a summit bringing together the Heads of State or Government of the 27, which will allow them to assess cooperation and progress on realising the aims contained in the Barce lona Declaration (1995). The revision of the MEDA regulation will be actively pursued in 2000. as will the adoption of the common strategy on the Mediterranean region.

The Council underlines the importance of the role of the European Agency for Reconstruction in that region. It encourages all States in the region to make every effort to enable the Union to conclude Stabilisation and Association Agreements with them, as a stage on the road which might lead to membership when all the conditions are fulfilled. The European Council should adopt a com mon strategy for the western Balkans in order to define clearly the framework and objectives of the Union, and to offer a reference point for the States concerned. The Council welcomes the fact that the Commission is preparing an Action Plan for the Northern Dimension of the Union with a view to its approval by the Feira European Council. Relations with Ukraine and Russia benefit both from Partnership and Cooperation Agreements (PCA) which are already in force, and from common strategies adopted in 1999. These instruments offer a framework for the development of these relationships; the Council reiterates that it is following the development of the sit uation in Chechnya closely, in the context of its rela tions with Russia. The other newly independent states, particularly those of central Asia, will continue to be assisted through the Tacis programme and through the PCA currently being ratified with the majority of them. Relations with Asia will develop in accordance with the agreements and structures linking the Union with the Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN), particularly at the ministerial meetings to be held this year, and in the context of the Asia-Europe Meeting (ASEM), which will hold its third meeting in Seoul and give new impetus to Euro-Asian cooperation. Particu lar attention will be paid to relations with Indonesia and to the situation in East Timor. The Portuguese Presi dency will organise the first summit between the EU and India this year. The critical dialogue with China must be continued but its aims must be more focused and targeted on effectiveness, which is to be discussed by the summit planned for the autumn. In the commer cial sphere the Union hopes that agreement will be found this year on the accession of China to the World Trade Organisation (WTO). The functioning of the spe cial administrative regions of Hong Kong and Macao will also receive attention from the Union. Finally, the summit with Japan, which will also take place in the second half of the year, will assess relations with that country. Developments on the Korean peninsula will also be closely followed, as will the situation in Burma/Myan mar. Transatlantic relations, given their importance for both sides, should use existing instruments to the maximum, as the community of interests linking the Union with the United States and Canada is not in doubt, other than certain trade disputes which these instruments should be able to solve or to prevent. Relations with the other major industrialised partners, namely Australia and New Zealand, will be approached in the same spirit and will use existing instruments to the full. Following the Rio summit in June 1999, Latin America and the Caribbean will remain very close to the Union, which will continue in its determination to develop and implement the network of agreements linking them in various ways, with Mexico occupying a place of partic ular importance. The negotiation of agreements with Mercosur and with Chile should progress significantly this year. The Union will also continue to lend its sup port to the reconstruction of areas tragically affected by natural disasters. It will follow developments in Cuba closely. Finally, multilateral trade negotiations should be re launched, drawing lessons from the Seattle Conference and ensuring the resumption of talks on solid founda tions, based on a wide global agenda.'
