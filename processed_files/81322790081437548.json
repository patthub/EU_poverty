        "Tourism as a factor in economic development and international trade A. whereas tourism undeniably constitutes a driving force behind growth in developing countries at all levels; whereas its role in international trade tends to increase in spite of recent natural disasters that have affected tourism flows to several regions of the world, B. whereas an organised tourism programme, or an individual trip, increasingly encompasses multiple tourism destinations in more than one country, thereby contributing to increased regional cooperation and the strengthening of ties between countries, C. whereas tourism is one of the fundamental aspects of any coherent development policy to be imple- mented in developing countries; whereas its links to other economic sectors, particularly agriculture and fisheries, food and beverage production and processing, other manufacturing industries, handicraft production, transport, and financial services, should be encouraged, D. whereas tourism activities may require infrastructure projects in the areas of transport, energy, new communication technologies, housing, sanitation, health and hygiene in developing countries, E. whereas it is fundamental that such projects should benefit both local communities and the tourist industry, F. whereas the tourism industry has often failed to establish strong links within national economies; whereas tourism infrastructure is mostly foreign-owned and investment is driven by substantial finan- cial and tax incentives granted by individual countries in competition with one another, G. whereas tourism accounts for more than twice as much in financial transfers from rich to poor coun- tries than governments give in aid; whereas, of the 50 Least Developed Countries, 46 now have tourism as the largest foreign exchange earner, H. whereas, in 41 of the 50 poorest countries in the world, tourism constitutes over 5 % of GDP or 10 % of exports, I. whereas the 2001 New Partnership for Africa's Development (NEPAD) base document specifically refers to the importance of African tourism and draws up a Tourism Action Plan, endorsed by the African Union (AU) in 2004, which includes the recognition of the role of ecotourism and cultural tourism for Africa, J. whereas local investment in the hospitality sector should be encouraged, either by policies allowing the creation of local private and cooperative forms of enterprises that could produce goods and services previously imported, or through joint ventures between local and international enterprises, K. having regard to the current negotiations on Economic Partnership Agreements (EPAs), which will, as from 1 January 2008, replace the unilateral preferential trade regime for commercial relations between the ACP countries and the EU, Tourism as a factor in environmental protection and the conservation of heritage and culture L. whereas sustainable tourism can develop only if it respects natural and cultural conditions and the traditions of the local communities where it evolves, M. whereas tourism must not be seen as an enemy of the environment but rather as its ally, since tour- ism's profitability is conditional on preserving the environment and heritage, N. whereas special attention needs to be paid by the authorities to environmentally friendly forms of tourism such as ecotourism, rural tourism and \u2018 solidarity tourism \u2019 , O. whereas tourism is sustained by the conservation and improvement of local heritage \u2014 be it natural or cultural, tangible or intangible \u2014 and of historic buildings, 30.12.2006 C 330/16 Official Journal of the European Union EN ",
        "P. whereas the safety of tourists and tourist facilities and sites requires special attention on the part of the authorities, Q. whereas sensitive areas should be opened to tourism investment only after evaluation of their capacity to withstand the impact of tourism-related activities, R. whereas it is legitimate for governments, after consulting representative tourist sector organisations, to lay down strict rules for visitors to very popular sites, S. whereas the concept of limiting tourist numbers in small island States, mountain areas and coastal areas affected by overwhelming numbers of tourists needs to be integrated and accepted by the national authorities concerned, T. whereas unplanned and uncoordinated tourism development may put pressure on scarce water and energy supplies, add to the stress on wildlife and marine resources in protected areas and threaten ecologically fragile areas, U. whereas it may be necessary for the EU to assist governments in framing, monitoring and imple- menting legislation controlling access to, and use of, ecologically fragile areas, V. whereas it is necessary to reconcile energy practices with transport policies, with a view to protecting the environment and complying with the targets of the Kyoto Protocol aimed at sustainable develop- ment, Tourism as a factor in public health and education, including the social impact of sex tourism W. whereas a country's public health standards are an element of its attractiveness, X. whereas tour operators should provide tourists with information on risks of disease and injury linked to a given destination or tourism activity and on the norms and values of host societies, Y. whereas tourism necessarily impacts on public health standards on account of hygiene requirements, healthcare measures, vaccination campaigns and the dissemination of information on disease preven- tion, Z. whereas an appropriate fiscal policy directed towards the tourism sector can provide governments with revenue to provide improved health facilities that benefit both local residents and tourists, AA. whereas traveller behaviour may exacerbate tourist health problems and put undue pressure on local health services, AB. whereas HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria are now global scourges, AC. whereas the risk both to tourists and local people from the spread of highly contagious diseases such as diarrhoeic infections, respiratory infections, fevers of unknown cause and hepatitis cannot be ignored or downgraded in developing countries' health policies, AD. whereas nationals should receive appropriate education and training to participate in tourism activities at all levels, AE. whereas tourism impacts on education, providing local communities with access to language learning and new information and communication technologies, thereby enabling them to promote their cultural heritage on the basis of respect for customs and traditions while at the same time requiring greater awareness of, and adaptation to, the evolution of society and modern habits, 30.12.2006 C 330/17 Official Journal of the European Union EN ",
        "AF. whereas it is nonetheless essential for public authorities to ensure the preservation of local traditions that respect human rights, especially the rights of women and children, AG. whereas tourism in some countries is associated with violations of human rights such as child labour, prostitution and sexual exploitation, AH. whereas sex tourism must be dealt with by means of a permanent and concerted campaign on the part of European and local authorities, in coordination with non-governmental organisations, AI. whereas only coordinated measures, the spread of information and the introduction of penalties on the basis of respect for international law can be genuinely effective, AJ. whereas widespread publicity regarding the penalties for sex tourism should have a deterrent effect, crimes related to sex tourism must be prosecuted, and it must be possible to bring prosecutions both in the country of origin and in the country where they are committed, AK. whereas policies and measures implemented by tour operators, travel agencies and airlines, such as distributing brochures or screening videos on journeys to sensitive destinations, have a positive impact, AL. whereas Member States of the World Health Organisation (WHO) have been called upon to take measures to protect the poorest and most vulnerable groups from \u2018 transplant tourism \u2019 and the sale of tissues and organs, Tourism as a factor in poverty reduction AM. whereas the World Tourism Organisation's programme \u2018 Sustainable Tourism for Eliminating Poverty \u2019 contributes to the Millennium Development Goal of poverty reduction, by seeking to develop and support tourism projects in least developed and other developing countries, support micro-entrepre- neurial initiatives in tourism, create job opportunities, facilitate market access and develop local capaci- ties to favour those people living on less than one dollar a day, AN. whereas tourism is not the answer to all problems, but should be part of a broader pro-poor national growth policy, AO. whereas in some countries tourism has emerged accidentally, sometimes as the only economic devel- opment option when the traditional agro-export sector has failed to retain its position in the global market place, AP. whereas tourism is a major employment generator; whereas all job creation measures must comply with International Labour Organisation (ILO) standards, AQ. whereas forms of tourism seeking to guarantee fair payment for local workers and entrepreneurs merit particular attention from the authorities, especially in the case of \u2018 fair tourism \u2019 , AR. whereas tourism is labour intensive, has high female employment ratios and is not necessarily import intensive; whereas it has low barriers to entry, encompassing all types and dimensions of enterprises, and it provides opportunities for downstream economic links in the local economy, thereby allowing poor people to gain opportunities for unskilled and semi-skilled employment, AS. whereas governments could create incentives for companies to invest and operate in ways favouring the poor, by adapting their licensing, concessioning, supply-chain and marketing policies, 30.12.2006 C 330/18 Official Journal of the European Union EN ",
        "Tourism as a factor in economic development and international trade 1. Calls for the impact of tourism and the principles of sustainable tourism and good governance to be systematically and coherently taken into account in the drafting of EU and ACP development policy; 2. Considers that, to be sustainable, tourism must improve the lives of local people, protect their envir- onment and health, and support the local economy through the purchase of food, processed goods, handicraft, services and other resources locally; calls on the governments of developing countries to ensure the full involvement of local communities in tourist activities and to ensure the fair sharing of the economic, social and cultural benefits generated; 3. Recommends that the Commission focus on sustainable tourism in its cooperation and development policy and in the context of its development guidelines and its efforts to consolidate entrepreneurial structures, specifically within its relationship with the ACP countries; regrets that the current Strategy for Africa does not include any reference to tourism; asks, therefore, in order to allow for effective development of the recommendation, that the personnel in the Tourism Unit of the European Commission's DG Enterprise and in the services dealing with tourism in the AU and ACP Secretariats should be reinforced, and their expertise be used in subjects directly or indirectly concerning tourism; 4. Calls on ACP governments to examine policies designed to guarantee \u2018 planning gain \u2019 benefits for the local communities where tourism projects take place; 5. Insists on the need to reinvest the profits of tourism in local development; calls on tour operators to review their \u2018 all-inclusive \u2019 packages which prevent spin-off benefits to the local communities, and encourages these operators as far as possible to source materials and staff locally, including managerial staff; 6. Encourages governments to promote the creation and development of public-private partnerships and to facilitate the setting-up of private and cooperative enterprises in the tourism sector; 7. Calls for an increase, where appropriate, in the proportion of sustainable tourism-oriented projects financed under the European Development Fund (EDF); 8. Proposes that the issue of sustainable tourism and its economic impact be included in the current negotiations on the EPAs, and that the interests of developing countries in relation to the European market be given positive consideration when tourism-related issues are raised by them in the General Agreement on Trade and Services (GATS); 9. Notes that in many developing countries the tourism sector is fundamentally a private-sector activity, and that the Community must therefore find ways to ensure that interested parties and other social partners are fully involved in all discussions regarding development policy affecting the tourism sector; 10. Demands that the governments of the countries concerned and EU tour operators enforce human rights standards, workers' rights in accordance with ILO core labour standards, the protection of the European tourism-consumer and the recommendations concerning tour operators; 11. Calls on the governments of developing countries to introduce transparent and properly regulated procedures for access to national markets in accordance with the recommendations of the UN World Tourism Organisation, as a necessary condition for all foreign investment; Tourism as a factor in environmental protection and conservation of heritage and culture 12. Calls for the establishment of sustainable tourism policies and regulations to protect and conserve natural resources, the cultural heritage and traditional land tenure systems; 13. Encourages the optimisation of existing technical and scientific resources with a view to preventing the degradation or destruction of architectural heritage and environmental deterioration; 30.12.2006 C 330/19 Official Journal of the European Union EN ",
        "14. Calls for EU support to the tourism sector also to incorporate the environmental dimension, particu- larly with regard to waste management and coastal zone development; 15. Calls for all European investments in tourism in developing countries to be subject to the same rules applicable to EU funding for investment within the EU, such that any investment which is manifestly detrimental to the environment, human rights, ILO core labour standards, the way of life of indi- genous communities or the historical and cultural heritage of the recipient country must not be supported; 16. Calls on the EU to provide technical support to countries which, under the impact of mass tourism, are obliged to take measures to preserve their tourist sites; calls also for an exchange of best practices in this field; 17. Stresses the urgent need for the Community to aid countries hit by natural disasters that affect their tourist industry; calls for special attention to be paid to the situation of small island States; 18. Encourages local authorities which are confronted with an over-rapid tourist boom to take measures to limit numbers where necessary; 19. Calls, in the interests of accessible, protected and secure tourism, for initiatives to tackle crime directed against tourism, including specialist training for police services; 20. Calls on the Commission, in its activities in support of sustainable development, to recognise the right of a country or a region to define its own priorities democratically when financing regional coopera- tion projects; 21. Calls on the governments of the Member States, and the Commission, with the support of tour opera- tors and experienced organisations, to act to promote ethical standards in tourism by introducing a certified European Fair Trade Tourism label; 22. Calls on the EU to assist governments in framing, monitoring and implementing legislation controlling access to, and use of, ecologically fragile areas on land or sea; Tourism as a factor in public health and education, including the social impact of sex tourism 23. Considers that income from sustainable tourism may contribute to improving the standard of living of the population in developing countries and to public health, as well as to housing, communications, energy and technology infrastructures; 24. Considers that appropriate fiscal policy directed towards the tourism sector can provide governments with revenue to offer improved health facilities and other infrastructure that benefit both local resi- dents and tourists; 25. Underlines that tourism has an impact on public health standards and local health services; recognises, therefore, the need to mobilise research at European level to combat malaria, tuberculosis, sexually transmitted diseases (including HIV/AIDS) and neglected diseases; 26. Calls once more on the Commission to ensure financial support for the vaccination of children, targeted at urgent needs regarding vaccines combining antigens against the following diseases: diphtheria, tetanus, whooping cough, hepatitis B and Haemophilus Influenzae type B meningitis; 27. Calls on tour operators and travel agencies to inform their clients of the risks of disease and injury they may face when choosing a destination or tourism activity and of the norms and values of host societies; 30.12.2006 C 330/20 Official Journal of the European Union EN ",
        "28. Calls on the EU to support the creation in ACP countries of schools teaching professional skills in tourism, languages and new information and communication technologies, aiming to train personnel for regional and local tourism activities in developing countries or groups of developing countries with the same needs; 29. Calls on the Union and the Member States to make their experience and know-how available to devel- oping countries with tourist potential with a view to offering on-site training of personnel; calls on the Commission to support projects in developing countries requesting such know-how; 30. Calls on the governments of the countries concerned to circulate among themselves an annual list of visa refusals on the grounds of male and female sex tourism offences, crimes against humanity or terrorism; 31. Calls, with a view to combating child sex tourism: \u2014 on the Commission and Council to give greater priority to the fight against child sex tourism, including restoring the budget line \u2018 Combating child sex tourism in third countries \u2019 in order to ensure that resources are dedicated to this; \u2014 on the Commission to recognise the link between child pornography and sex tourism and ensure that this is raised in political dialogue with third countries; \u2014 on the Commission and the Member States to ensure that children's needs and rights are given priority in development aid, in particular the rehabilitation and reintegration needs of children affected by sex tourism; 32. Encourages tour operators, travel agents and airlines who have already done so to continue to act against sex tourism by raising their clients' awareness and informing them of potential legal risks, and calls on those who have not taken such steps to begin to do so; calls on all operators to cooperate with the authorities in identifying potential criminal activity; 33. Calls on all States to ensure the ethics of transplantation by adopting measures to eliminate \u2018 transplant tourism \u2019 ; Tourism as a factor in poverty reduction 34. Calls for the above-mentioned Global Code of Ethics for Tourism to be incorporated into national law by all countries; 35. Calls for the promotion of locally-controlled sustainable tourism initiatives aimed at poverty allevia- tion, the conservation of biodiversity and the promotion of human rights; 36. Calls on the EU and its Member States to provide financial support to the UN World Tourism Organi- sation initiative ST-EP (Sustainable Tourism-Eliminating Poverty) and other initiatives that work towards alleviating poverty in developing countries; 37. Recommends a new pro-poor vision in national policies and in tourism policies that is aimed at the empowerment of local populations and their organised economic activities; 38.

Recognises tourism is labour intensive, has high female employment ratios, is not necessarily import intensive, has low barriers to entry, encompasses all types and dimensions of enterprises and provides opportunities for downstream economic links in the local economy, and thereby allows poor people to gain opportunities for unskilled and semi-skilled employment; 42. Considers that governments could create incentives for companies to invest and operate in ways that favour the poor, by adapting their licensing, concessioning, supply-chain and marketing policies; 43.

        "J. whereas three out of every four countries \u2014 which are often politically, culturally and economically different from each other \u2014 are located on the same international rivers, and whereas, in the absence of agreements on reasonable and equitable use, water, the source of life, becomes a potential source of tension and disputes that can degenerate into conflict, K. whereas in African and Asian countries the availability of water is subject to numerous seasonal fluc- tuations and periodic cycles of drought and flooding, and whereas some coastal and island States are faced with the problem of saltwater infiltration of groundwater, L. whereas drought is often caused by incorrect land use, over-grazing, deforestation and the implementa- tion of major irrigation projects that are unsustainable, M. whereas current trends as regards, among other things, demographics, urbanisation, climate change, the environment and economic structures are a major challenge in water management terms for devel- oping countries, particularly those in the Sahel region, N. whereas intensive production farming consumes about 70 % of freshwater for irrigation purposes, with 40 % losses, and whereas improving field irrigation techniques should result in major water savings and an increase in agricultural production that will offset the failure of rain-fed production to cover all food requirements, O. whereas current water-for-food requirements will need to be increased by 50 % over the next 10 years in order to achieve the Millennium Development Goal of halving the number of malnourished people, P. whereas in many rural parts of Africa the local population has no access to wells, a water supply network, a drinking water source or a rainwater cistern, Q. whereas the development and promotion of appropriate sanitation technologies, the implementation of strategies mobilising endogenous financial resources and the involvement of communities will enable the use of sustainable sanitation methods to be stepped up at local level over the coming decade, R. whereas a lack of the necessary financial resources to cover the renewal of infrastructure and the main- tenance and management of existing facilities unavoidably results in the deterioration of water services and the exclusion of poor population groups, particularly in periurban areas, owing to the high cost of the services, S. whereas rational water management requires the involvement of local populations \u2014 particularly women, who play an important role in water management \u2014 at national, local and regional levels, as well as appropriate charging so as to ensure universal access to the water required to cover essential needs while ensuring efficient water use by enhancing user responsibility, T. whereas governments in developing countries are unable to set water rates at a level that reflects supply costs, U. whereas a lack of the necessary technical, financial and human resources lies at the root of poor water resource and water service management, V. whereas policies involving the privatisation of water resource management and the liberalisation of public services have accelerated the growth of the external indebtedness of southern countries, whose available resources are being earmarked for debt repayment rather than sustainable development and access to drinking water, education, health, housing and energy, W. whereas private sector participation in water supply and sanitation remains low in developing coun- tries, X. whereas private participation in water services remains controversial due to the fact that universal, non-discriminatory use of water should be seen as a right; whereas, however, private sector participa- tion can in some cases make a financial and management contribution to water services and contribute new technology and skills, 30.12.2006 C 330/33 Official Journal of the European Union EN ",
        "Y. whereas in most developing countries there is a genuine desire to take due account of water, hygiene and sanitation issues in development policies and strategies (decentralisation, combating poverty, inte- grated water resource management etc.) and water and sanitation financing initiatives (EU, NEPAD, African Development Bank (ADB), African Ministerial Council on Water (AMCOW) etc.), Z. whereas with a view to meeting the MDGs, initiatives are being taken at European level, including the EUWI, which seeks to promote improved access to drinking water and sanitation for disadvantaged population groups in the ACP countries by actively addressing the funding deficit issue, AA. whereas the EU and its Member States provide some EUR 1.4 billion per year for water and sanitation in developing countries, making the EU the largest aid provider in the world in this sector, and whereas this funding must be used to strengthen the public sector, which must guarantee access to water supply, AB. whereas the EUWI aims to increase international mobilisation for achieving the MDGs and WSSD targets for drinking water and sanitation, through strategic regional partnerships involving all stake- holders \u2014 governments, civil society, local authorities and the private sector, 1. Reiterates that universal, non-discriminatory access to water is a right, and considers that development and anti-poverty policies and strategies should take account of people's vital water needs, particularly those of the most disadvantaged groups, and the need to ensure that water resources are managed equitably and sustainably in the interests of society as a whole; 2. Calls on ACP countries to introduce agricultural policies and strategies that promote irrigation methods which bring major water savings and to make control over water a priority with a view to achieving sustainable food security; 3. Recommends that ACP States introduce new water production and consumption methods based on sustainable integrated water resource management, taking account of the socioeconomic dimension of water and giving prominence to ecological agriculture based on the mobilisation of endogenous resources, the promotion of appropriate technologies and the involvement of all stakeholders; 4. Calls on the EU to pay special attention to ACP countries hard hit by water shortages and the attendant phenomena of drought and famine, by stepping up the provision of funding; 5. Acknowledges that privatisation of water in developing countries remains a highly sensitive and controversial issue which should be handled accordingly; calls for policies involving the privatisation of water resource management and the liberalisation of public services in ACP countries consistently to address social responsibility, and to be conditional on an affordable and increased supply of water and sanitation, in particular for the poorest, and on the principle that universal non-discriminatory use of water should be seen as a right; 6. Calls for an end to international pressure on developing countries, in negotiations conducted in bilat- eral and multilateral forums and through international financial institutions, to liberalise their water industries, which undermines their public services in this field; 7. Recalls that, while water and sanitation are widely cross-cutting issues, they have still not been adequately integrated into the development actions of other related sectors such as agriculture, industry, health, education, forestry and the environment; 8. Notes that water resources are deteriorating because of climate change and recalls that dynamic sustainable management of aquatic ecosystems is essential for prevention and mitigation of the nega- tive impact of climate change; 30.12.2006 C 330/34 Official Journal of the European Union EN ",
        "9. Recalls that awareness-raising in sustainable management practices is essential to ensuring water supply for future generations, increasing food security and improving the hygiene and sanitation beha- viour of the population; 10. Calls for integrated management of water resources taking account of all legitimate uses and demands, with an emphasis on the integration of land and water uses, upstream and downstream areas, coastal zone management and surface and groundwater management; 11. Recognises that gender and culture have a role in water and sanitation development and recalls that all approaches and solutions need to be adapted to local culture and gender roles; 12. Recalls that making progress towards sustainable access to, and management of, water in developing countries relies on strong local political commitment, transparency and stakeholder ownership; 13. Recalls the importance of fostering water-responsible behaviour among users, which implies a shift from a supply approach to a demand-driven one in water management; 14. Considers that public authorities should retain control of water management, providing access to it for all and maintaining scales of charges which are transparent to the public; 15. Considers that the financial resources marshalled as part of the Highly Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) initiative should help to provide funding for the vital sectors of water and sanitation, education and health; 16. Encourages the EU and the ACP countries to introduce innovative funding instruments such as local, national, regional and continental funds to support water policy and existing public and private funding instruments; 17. Calls on the EU to continue its efforts to ensure sustainable access to water for ACP countries, in order to make control over water a top strategic priority enabling ACP countries to reduce the structural vulnerability of the countries hardest hit; 18. Calls for strengthening of potential in the EU-ACP cooperation process in the area of water and sanita- tion; calls for a higher priority to be given by the ACP countries to water and sanitation in their devel- opment strategies and plans, and for a coordinated EU response through mechanisms such as the EUWI, the ACP-EU Water Facility and the development assistance programmes of the Commission and the Member States; 19. Calls on the EU to support research into water hydrants and the eradication of rivers in flatlands, which may lead to the creation of swamps, the evaporation of 50 % of water resources and a defi- ciency in iodine available for river fish, which, in turn, may lead to an iodine deficiency among the population, especially among children; 20. Calls on the Commission to carry out an assessment and an evaluation of the ACP-EU Water Facility and the projects that it has funded, in order to determine whether specific funding for further initia- tives in this field is to be set aside under the 10th EDF; 21. Recognises the need for a substantial increase in financial resources to cover infrastructure renewal, and maintenance and management of water and sanitation facilities, with a view to improving services and stepping up the involvement of a large section of the population which is unable to pay high water service prices; 22. Recalls that the main goals of the EUWI are to reinforce the political commitment to water and sanita- tion and to improve the effectiveness of water management through dialogue with all stakeholders including civil society and the public and private sectors, promoting a demand-driven approach and coordination of donor responses; calls on the Member States and the Commission to reinforce their support and involvement in pursuing these goals; 30.12.2006 C 330/35 Official Journal of the European Union EN ",
        "23. Calls for institutional strengthening and capacity building to improve water governance and combat corruption by means of legal and policy reforms, human resources development, training and networking; 24. Calls on ACP countries sharing the same water catchment area to improve coordination policies and intervention and water resource management strategies, in particular by setting up and/or building the capacities of regional organisations with responsibility for water policy, with a view to ensuring arbitra- tion in disputes over water use and fostering the emergence of a culture of sharing common assets and support for more responsible management of those assets; calls on the governments of the EU Member States and the international community to support the ACP countries in their efforts; 25. Calls for extensive dialogue among various water users at local, national and cross-border level, with the aim of developing efficient cross-sectoral planning, providing adequate management of reservoirs, developing a database on bilateral water projects, promoting long-term institutional twinning and cooperation between higher education institutions, sharing local knowledge and conserving ecosys- tems; 26. Instructs its Co-Presidents to forward this resolution to the ACP-EU Council, the European Commis- sion, the Secretary-General of the United Nations, the African Union and all organisations responsible for water management. RESOLUTION ( 1 ) on the review of negotiations on Economic Partnership Agreements (EPAs) The ACP-EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly, \u2014 meeting at Bridgetown (Barbados) from 20 to 23 November 2006, \u2014 having regard to Article 17(2) of its Rules of Procedure, \u2014 having regard to its resolution of 21 March 2002 adopted in Cape Town (South Africa) ( 2 ), \u2014 having regard to Article 37(1) of the Cotonou Agreement, which states that the EPA negotiations shall take place \u2018 during the preparatory period which shall end by 31 December 2007 at the latest \u2019 , \u2014 having regard to the Declaration by the Trade Ministers of the Member States of the African Union adopted in Nairobi (Kenya) on 14 April 2006, \u2014 having regard to the resolution of the European Parliament of 23 March 2006 on the development impact of Economic Partnership Agreements (EPAs) ( 3 ), \u2014 having regard to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), in particular Article XXIV thereof, \u2014 having regard to the decisions, resolutions and declarations adopted by the ACP Council of Ministers at its 83rd session, held in Port Moresby from 28 to 31 May 2006, in particular Decision No 2 on Economic Partnership Agreements, A. whereas carrying out critical evaluation of EPA negotiations is necessary, B. noting that in most regions the negotiations on EPAs have reached virtual deadlock in view of disagree- ments on what is understood by the \u2018 development dimension \u2019 , which should be central to discussions on EPAs, C. whereas firm and specific undertakings have so far not been provided by the European side on the financing of the development dimension, 30.12.2006 C 330/36 Official Journal of the European Union EN ( 1 ) Adopted by the ACP-EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly on 23 November 2006 in Bridgetown (Barbados).

        "D. whereas the Cotonou Agreement addresses the question of support for economic development and regional cooperation in the ACP countries, in particular in Articles 21, 22, 25, 29, 30, 33 and 35, E. having regard to the concerns that are apparent among States, and in civil society and the private sector, in the light of the conclusions of impact assessments conducted at national and regional level, F. whereas the main objective of EPAs should be to contribute to the sustainable social and economic development of ACP countries, through the promotion of greater value addition to goods and services produced in ACP countries for national, regional and international markets, G. whereas the agricultural sector is the engine of development for most ACP countries because it makes a significant contribution to national GDP and is the main source of employment and income for many people, H. whereas EPAs should ensure that benefits of increased trade and economic growth contribute to poverty reduction in order to fulfil Cotonou commitments, I. whereas the level of education and training of the population is a fundamental factor for competitive- ness and in some ACP regions is being undermined by the growing HIV/AIDS crisis, J. whereas the establishment of a genuine regional market, within a customs union, represents an essen- tial basis for the success of the implementation of EPAs, K. whereas the increase in intra-regional trade intended by the EPAs is hindered by weak intra-regional infrastructures and a wide range of non-tariff barriers to trade, L. acknowledging the right for the European Union to have high phytosanitary and other health standards and therefore calling for increased assistance to ACP countries to comply with such regulation in order to be able to export their products to the European Union, M. whereas the reciprocal freedom of trade between the developed countries of the European Union and the ACP developing countries constitutes a serious risk until the ACP countries become competitive, N. whereas the EPA configurations are not a reflection of existing regional economic integration arrange- ments, O. whereas the ACP must resolve questions of overlapping membership of regional groups and establish long-term frameworks for regional harmonisation for any EPA to be successful and workable, P. whereas the waiver accorded by the WTO in Doha in 2001 to allow for preferential trade relations between the EU and ACP countries was meant to last three years longer (until 2007) than the Doha Round negotiations (to be concluded in 2004) launched at the same time, Q. whereas the pressing problem of availability and timely disbursement of financial resources remains a serious stumbling block, R. whereas the parallel conduct of the EPA negotiations and the WTO cycle of negotiations has been interrupted by the suspension of the Doha Round, giving rise to valid concerns about the commit- ments that should be made under the EPA negotiations, S. understanding ACP reluctance to negotiate, bilaterally or otherwise, on issues which have been jetti- soned at a multilateral level, T. recognising that a positive outcome to negotiations could help redefine what a multilateral develop- ment round should consist of; recognising further that EPAs should be complementary to an agree- ment on Doha and not an alternative, 30.12.2006 C 330/37 Official Journal of the European Union EN ",
        "U. having regard to the setting-up of EPA adjustment mechanisms to address the loss of government revenue resulting from EPA-induced trade liberalisation and structural adjustment and to provide support for economic development and regional cooperation in the ACP countries, V. whereas Article 2 of the Cotonou Agreement provides for differential treatment, taking into account the different levels of development of ACP countries, W. whereas the EPAs should facilitate the reduction of existing inequalities between men and women in the economic and social sectors, X. noting that, as far as the European side is concerned, the implications of the EPAs have not yet been clearly determined at this stage of negotiations, Y. whereas the EPAs will in any case increase the financial needs of the ACP countries to carry out enhanced regional integration policies and economic reform, Z. whereas parliamentarians, as representatives of the people and their institutions, should be kept informed throughout the negotiations, AA. whereas in Port Moresby the ACP Council called for the \u2018 full and comprehensive \u2019 review required under Article 37(4) of the Cotonou Agreement to \u2018 be all inclusive and consultative with all stake- holders including non-state actors and parliamentarians \u2019 and whereas, in view of there being little evidence of this occurring, it welcomes a second JPA resolution on EPAs, AB. whereas EU common agricultural policy reform and subsidies for products of export interest to the ACP have a significant bearing on ACP agricultural exports to European markets, 1. Understands that the EPA negotiations stem from the need to make ACP-EU trade relations compatible with WTO rules but calls on the Commission to be vigilant that the issue of compatibility does not take precedence over the overall aim of sustainable development; calls for the pacing, timing and extent of liberalisation schedules to be in line with ACP regional harmonisation schedules to minimise harmful shocks; 2. Calls on the Commission not only to focus on compatibility with WTO rules but also, in cooperation with developing countries, to aim to improve the rules of the WTO so that they work better for devel- opment; 3. Recalls that, under the Cotonou Agreement, EPAs should be aimed essentially at economic growth and poverty reduction in countries, most of which are classified as LDCs; 4. Calls for priority to be accorded in the negotiations to supporting the structural transformation of ACP economies, thereby supporting \u2018 sustainable economic and social development \u2019 ; considers that EPAs should be devised and negotiated as development agreements rather than trade agreements; 5. Recognises that, whether it be liberalisation of services or of competition and government procure- ment, robust regulatory frameworks are needed before any liberalisation takes place and calls on the Commission to support and monitor independent regulators as part of any change to current provi- sions; 6. Calls for negotiators to work together to develop a strategy to increase ACP agricultural competitive- ness that goes beyond market access and addresses real development issues for ACP agriculture such as scaling up SPS quality programmes across the ACP; 7. Calls for a strengthening of competitive production capacities in ACP countries before the removal of customs duties; 30.12.2006 C 330/38 Official Journal of the European Union EN ",
        "8. Calls on the Commission and the ACP regions to design EPAs around the principles of asymmetry in favour of ACP regions, support for ACP regional integration and implementation of a sound and predictable framework for promoting trade and investment in ACP regions; 9. Expresses its concern over the current EU proposals for free trade with ACP countries under the Cotonou EPAs leading to the liberalisation of trade, including trade in agricultural products, and considers that this policy might cause problems to ACP countries' development, relating in particular to food security and development of local industries; 10. Calls for the EPAs to be based on the principle of building and consolidating regional markets first, before markets are opened to the EU; 11. Calls on the EU to develop more effective instruments of support to production adjustment in ACP countries, thereby encouraging the diversification of production and promoting greater value addition; 12. Reiterates its call on the European side to provide support as regards the financing of tax and economic adjustment costs and investments linked to the lifting of supply constraints; 13. Welcomes recent pledges of additional Aid for Trade resources specifically focused on EPA support and calls for the arrangements and timescale for disbursement of the funds pledged to be fully explained by both the Commission and Member States as part of a response to ACP requests for additional funds for EPAs; 14. Calls on the Commission to look at ways of reducing the bureaucratic burden of EDF requirements and for the ACP side to bring forward detailed, costed proposals of how and for what any additional EPA funds would be needed; 15. Calls for further money, additional to existing European Development Fund commitments, to be made available if necessary; 16. Calls on the EU to support the proper sequencing of the development of ACP policies in trade-related areas in ACP countries, with the subsequent conclusion of inter-regional agreements in trade-related areas, so as to ensure coherence; 17. Calls on the EU not to exert undue pressure and to take steps to ensure that, in the event of negotia- tions not being completed by 1 January 2008, existing ACP exports to the EU are not disrupted until a final settlement is reached; 18. Urges the Commission and the ACP to use the EPA review as an opportunity to discuss openly the obstacles to completing negotiations and bring forward detailed proposals to overcome them; 19. Recalls that the Cotonou Agreement provides that in the event that a country or region does not wish to sign up to an EPA/FTA it should not find itself worse off in terms of market access; calls on the Commission to examine all alternative possibilities, which include improved rules of origin, including non-reciprocal arrangements, in accordance with Article 37(6) of the Cotonou Agreement; 20. Calls on the EU to refrain from proposals which could disrupt ACP regional processes; 21. Calls therefore for a real public debate in the ACP and EU countries, including civil society and govern- mental and parliamentary institutions; calls also for the establishment of appropriate information and consultation mechanisms; 22. Recognises that Parliamentary oversight with regard to scrutiny of, and participation in, EPA implemen- tation will contribute to the stated aims of good governance and transparency and that the Joint Parlia- mentary Assembly is the appropriate body to formally, comprehensively and officially review the impact and implementation of EPAs, and calls for the establishment of a monitoring group within the JPA; 30.12.2006 C 330/39 Official Journal of the European Union EN ",
        "23. Calls on the Commission to respect the position of those regions which do not want to include the \u2018 Singapore Issues \u2019 in the EPA negotiations and recalls that bilateral negotiations on trade in services should respect the right of each country freely to regulate public services; 24. Calls for the EU to undertake not to include in EPAs provisions on intellectual property rights forming an additional barrier to access to essential medicines and to provide ACP countries with support enabling them effectively to implement the 2001 Doha Declaration, i.e. effective use of TRIPS flexibil- ities; 25. Stresses the importance of public services for development and democracy and consequently asks the Commission to act with caution when considering liberalisation of services and in fields such as water, health, education, transport and energy; 26. Instructs its Co-Presidents to forward this resolution to the ACP-EU Council and the European Commission. 30.12.2006 C 330/40 Official Journal of the European Union EN "
