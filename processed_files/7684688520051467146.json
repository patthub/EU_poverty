        "DIRECTORATE-GENERAL FOR EXTERNAL POLICIES OF THE UNION DIRECTORATE B POLICY DEPARTMENT BRIEFING \"A HUMAN RIGHTS AND POVERTY REVIEW: EU ACTION IN ADDRESSING CASTE-BASED DISCRIMINATION\" Abstract Caste-based discrimination is a serious human rights violation, negatively affecting political, economic, social, cultural and civil rights of approximately 260 million people worldwide. The European Union is committed to the promotion of human rights within the EU and in its external relations. This brief aims to assess to what extent the EU has integrated the fight against caste-based discrimination in its external relations. Light is shed on the specific situations in Bangladesh, India, Nepal, Pakistan and Yemen and the European Union\u2019s actions to address caste-based discrimination in these countries. Based on the analysis, the briefing elaborates recommendations on how the EU can mainstream the fight against caste-based discrimination into policies, strategies and programmes as well as dialogues with caste-affected countries. Legal realities and options for addressing discrimination vary between the partner countries. In order to mainstream the fight against caste-based discrimination, the EU, and the EEAS in particular, should utilize all options with regard to that country, including association agreements as well as partnership and cooperation agreements. Regarding countries that will not receive bilateral aid, the focus should be put on dialogues to address caste-based discrimination. Lessons on mainstreaming can be gained from the European Union\u2019s experience in mainstreaming human rights. EXPO/B/DEVE/FWC/2009-01/Lot5/33 February 2013 PE 433.805 EN ",

        "Policy Department DG External Policies EXECUTIVE SUMMARY The face of caste-based discrimination Caste-based discrimination is built on traditional notions of purity and pollution. It is characterised by separation of groups and exclusion of lower castes, hereditary divisions of labour and hierarchy. It affects approximately 260 million people worldwide. The biggest group to suffer caste-based discrimination are the \u2018Dalits\u2019 of South Asia, a mixed group of sub-castes, which form the lowest group in the social stratification. Most vulnerable within the Dalit and low-caste community are women, some specific sub-castes, and children. Discrimination of low-castes and Dalits takes on multiple forms, and includes caste-based violence and denial of rights. It is often connected to employment, as castes are mostly created along occupational lines. Low-castes and Dalits are frequently forced to carry out specific occupations that are often demeaning and hazardous, like manual scavenging. They are more vulnerable to bonded labour and forced prostitution. Members of lower castes are constrained in engaging in society, taking part in religious life and conducting business. They are frequently socially and economically boycotted by higher castes. Economic exclusion and restricted access to resources (i.e. land, markets, employment) and services (i.e. health, education, water and sanitation) result in higher poverty rates among lower castes. Discrimination tends to be aggravated in times of crisis, leaving Dalits especially vulnerable during man-made or natural disasters. Untouchability practices and discriminations based on caste (or descent) are outlawed in some caste- affected countries. Nevertheless, the notion of lower castes \u2018polluting\u2019 higher castes and the discrimination connected to this belief still persists and leads to discrimination in private and public spheres. Therefore, improving legislative and policy measures and above all securing access to justice are crucial elements to improve the plight of members of lower castes. Caste-based discrimination and the European Union The EU has in recent years repeatedly addressed caste-based discrimination in resolutions and reports, such as the resolution of the European Parliament on the \u201cHuman rights situation of the Dalits in India\u201d (2007) 1 , the resolution on \u201cHuman rights in the world and the European Union's policy on the matter including implications for the EU's strategic human rights policy\u201d (2012) 2 and the resolution on caste discrimination in India (2012) 3 . The EU in general, and the EEAS in particular, has various channels to address caste-based discrimination. Among them are dialogues with caste-affected countries, development cooperation (programming), humanitarian assistance, and trade relations. However, not only do the political and legal realities vary in all caste-affected countries, but the EU\u2019s options to engage also differ according to the cooperation with the country. In order to shed light on the varying situations, five caste-affected countries and the EU\u2019s actions with regard to caste-based discrimination have been analysed in this report. 1 European Parliament: Resolution P6_TA (2007)0016, Human rights of the Dalits in India. 2 P7_TA(2012)0126 (tabled: A7-0086/2012), 18.04.2012. 3 European Parliament resolution of 13 December 2012 on caste discrimination in India (2012/2909(RSP)); P7_TA(2012)0512 4 ",
        "A Human Rights and Poverty Review: EU action in addressing caste-based discrimination \uf0b7 In Bangladesh low castes suffer caste-based discrimination similar to the forms of discrimination in India: segregation, limited access to services, employment discrimination and massive discrimination against women. The Constitution of Bangladesh (1972) guarantees that the state shall not discriminate on the basis of caste and several other laws against discrimination exist. However, compared with India or Nepal, awareness of caste-based discrimination is still low and lack of legislation is still an issue. \u2018Human Rights\u2019 are a focus of EU \u2212 Bangladesh cooperation, but caste-based discrimination is not addressed in the specific instruments and not mainstreamed in dialogues and programmes. \uf0b7 India has model legislation with regard to caste-based discrimination, including quotas for Dalits for political representation. Untouchability has been outlawed by the Constitution since 1949 . At the same time, the vast majority of people suffering caste-based discrimination live in India. Lack of implementation of legislation and lack of access to justice are major problems. Caste-based discrimination is mostly understood as an internal issue. In the Joint Statements of the last three EU \u2212 India Summits, caste-based discrimination was not addressed. The EU has addressed caste-based discrimination in two resolutions 4 , in the Country Strategy Paper (2007-2013) (and related documents) and in development projects carried out in India, though not coherently. In the near future India will be treated as a graduated country and will not receive bilateral aid from the EU. Therefore, the EU activities to tackle caste-based discrimination will need to put a strong focus on dialogues, such as the India \u2212 EU human rights dialogue. \uf0b7 In Nepal the Constitution of 1990 prohibited caste-based discrimination and outlawed untouchability. These provisions, and provisions further strengthened in the Interim Constitutions of 2007 have been translated into the \u2018Caste-based Discrimination and Untouchability Act\u2019 in May 2011, closing legislative gaps. Similar to the situation in India, the lack of implementation of legislation remains a major problem. In Nepal more than in other countries, tackling discrimination and inequality is understood as a main prerequisite for stability. Caste-based discrimination was not included in the EU \u2212 Nepal Co-operation Agreement signed in 1996, but it is addressed in the Country Strategy Paper for Nepal (2007 \u2212 2013). Caste-based discrimination is not thoroughly mainstreamed yet, but caste-based discriminatory practices have been addressed in most projects in Nepal. \uf0b7 The Government of Pakistan has only very recently acknowledged the existence of caste-based discrimination in Pakistan. The information base and awareness of caste-based discrimination is relatively low, and legislation to it is underdeveloped. A few affirmative action regulations exist, but they remain largely ignored by the government and the administration. 4 European Parliament resolution of 13 December 2012 on caste discrimination in India (2012/2909(RSP)); P7_TA(2012)0512 5 ",
        "Policy Department DG External Policies Members of lower castes in Pakistan are often part of Hindu and Christian minorities, but discrimination against Muslim members of lower castes also exists. While caste structures in Pakistan may be somewhat atypical, the forms of discrimination witnessed are very similar to those in India, Bangladesh and Nepal. The lack of recognition of caste discrimination in Pakistan is reflected in the EU\u2212Pakistan relations. No reference to caste-based discrimination was found in the key documents despite a strong focus on human rights, which is one of the priority fields in cooperation. \uf0b7 In Yemen \u2018al Akhdam\u2019 (\u2018the Servants\u2019) form a caste outside the Hindu caste system but its members suffer similar forms of discrimination as castes in other countries, especially with regard to employment. The government so far has not been very active in combating caste stratification; no affirmative action or anti-discrimination legislation exists. The lack of recognition of caste discrimination in Yemen is mirrored in EU \u2212 Yemen relations. Whereas human rights are a focal area in cooperation, no reference to the Akhdam is made in key documents and few references can be found in projects targeting the Akhdam community. Conclusions and recommendations Caste-based discrimination follows an inhuman logic of purity and pollution, creating stiff hierarchies in all caste-affected countries. However, the legal realities and options for addressing the discrimination vary. Any assessment must therefore take national legislation and existing policy measures into account. Furthermore, the relevant institutions and their functionality need to be considered. Lessons for successful mainstreaming can be drawn from the mainstreaming of human rights: \uf0b7 A \u2018caste-based discrimination clause\u2019 could be included in Association Agreements, Partnership and Cooperation Agreements, Country Strategy Papers, Annual Action Programmes, Joint Programming and National Development Plans. Reference to caste-based discrimination could also be included in the most important guidelines for EU human rights policy. \uf0b7 Projects combating caste-based discrimination should be considered for stronger support under EuropeAid (EIDHR) funding. \uf0b7 Projects targeting a range of key issues (labour, education, justice) and certain target groups (women) should always take caste discrimination into account. Minimum recommendations for these priority sectors should be elaborated. Knowledge on specifically vulnerable groups should be gathered and fed into project development. \uf0b7 A caste-sensitive approach needs to be applied in humanitarian and development assistance. \uf0b7 For EU personnel in caste-affected countries, training on caste-based discrimination should be included in the human rights training modules. \uf0b7 The network of focal points currently under development in all EU delegations worldwide and in the EEAS and Commission services headquarters could be used to improve information flow on caste discrimination and the best practices used to fight it. Best practices to increase the impact of EU human rights policy dialogues should be considered when integrating caste-based discrimination in EU policies. These include embedding the human rights policies in the overall relations with the third country concerned, ensuring a close link with other human 6 ",

Furthermore, they should inform concerned UN and EP committees with the progress and outcome of such dialogues. \uf0b7 Concerning Bangladesh, Pakistan and Yemen, the EU should work towards more recognition of caste discrimination and promote legislation against caste discrimination as well as for reservations (quotas) for low-castes. \uf0b7 The EU should endorse the draft UN principles and guidelines for the Effective Elimination of Discrimination based on Work and Descent and promote their use. \uf0b7 Consultations with civil society on caste-based discrimination should be held. 5 EEAS: Human rights and democracy in the world, p. 17. 7 ",
        "Policy Department DG External Policies 1. INTRODUCTION Caste-based discrimination is a serious human rights violation, negatively affecting the political, economic, social, cultural and civil rights of its victims. Even in countries where it is outlawed, various forms of discrimination and physical violence, including murder, rape and torture, persist against those ranked low in the caste hierarchy. Progress has been made in the last decades in caste-affected countries on the road to end caste discrimination: legislation to fight caste-based discrimination and a changed, more confident collective self-image as well as higher political awareness among those affected in most countries are signs of the progress made. Still, much remains to be done: according to a study commissioned by the European Commission, caste-based discrimination still affects the lives of approximately 260 million people worldwide 6 . The segregation is based on the complex notion of castes 7 . \u2018Castes\u2019 8 are a hierarchical social stratification that is characterised by three main aspects: separation of groups, hereditary division of labour and hierarchy. The concept of purity and pollution is the main dividing line between castes; lower castes are believed to \u2018pollute\u2019 higher castes. The opposition of purity and pollution stretches across all major areas of social life: certain professions are considered pure while others are less so or impure; society generally disapproves of intermarriage between castes and even higher-caste groups eating together with lower-caste groups can provoke caste-based discrimination, for example by forcing members of lower castes to sit separately 9 . Groups below the lowest caste are affected most severely by \u2018caste-based discrimination' 10 . The position of these groups outside the main caste system has led to their dehumanisation; 11 they were and sometimes still are referred to as \u2018untouchables\u2019. Untouchability existed or exists in a range of countries, with India being the most prominent example. In India, all groups formerly considered \u2018untouchables\u2019 are now officially referred to as \u2018scheduled castes\u2019. In India and other South Asian countries, these groups often call themselves \u2018Dalits\u2019 (\u2018broken\u2019 or \u2018oppressed\u2019 people) 12 . The former UN Sub-Commission on the Promotion and Protection of Human Rights treats caste discriminations under \u2018discrimination[s] based on work and descent\u2019 13 . 6 International Dalit Solidarity Network: Caste-based Discrimination in South Asia. Situational Overview, Responses and Ways forward, Copenhagen, 2009, p.1. Despite the progress made, some regions have experienced setbacks in recent years and registered an increase in caste-based atrocities. See: IDSN: Caste-based Discrimination in South Asia, p. 3. 7 John Scott / Gordon Marshall: A Dictionary of Sociology . Oxford University Press, New York, 2009. 8 The word \u2018caste\u2019 is of Portuguese origin and provides no explanation of the highly complex hierarchical stratification that the caste system is. In India, the affiliation to a caste is based on \u2018varna\u2019 and \u2018jati\u2019. The category \u2018varna\u2019 describes the four main castes, with the Brahmin at the top and the Shudra as the lowest caste. \u2018Jati\u2019 is also a social classification, though highly differentiated: there are roughly 20,00 different jatis in India, with differences between regions. See: Uwe Skoda: Kaste, das Kastensystem und die Scheduled Castes. In: Wichard Woyke (ed.): Indien. Wochenschau Verlag Schwalbach, 2008, p. 35 ff. In other caste-affected countries the categorisations are different, though a strong hierarchy and the notion of purity and pollution are at the heart of all caste systems. Traditionally caste systems are affiliated with Hinduism, but elements can be found also in non-Hindu communities. 9 Skoda: Kaste, das Kastensystem und die Scheduled Castes, p. 35 ff. 10 These groups usually have no \u2018varna\u2019. 11 Anupama Rao: The Caste Question. Dalits and the Politics of Modern India , University of California Press, Berkeley, 2009, p. 1. 12 This report addresses the issues of Dalits and other caste-affected groups. For reasons of readability, sometimes the only the term \u2018Dalit\u2019 is used, as Dalits are the most affected group, however all caste-affected groups are addressed. 13 Discrimination based on work and descent in turn is defined as \u201cany distinction, exclusion restriction, or preference based on inherited status such as caste, including present or ancestral occupation, family, community or social origin, name, birth place, place of residence, dialect and accent that has the purpose or effect of nullifying or impairing the recognition, enjoyment, or exercise, on an equal footing, of human rights and fundamental freedoms in the political, economic, social, 8 ",
        "A Human Rights and Poverty Review: EU action in addressing caste-based discrimination Untouchability practices and accompanying discrimination have a very long legacy. In India, they can be traced back more than two thousand years and were only officially abolished in the new (post\u00ad colonial) constitution in 1949. Following its independence, India adopted further legislation to end caste-based violence and instituted affirmative action policies. The affirmative action policies include \u2018reservations\u2019 - quota \u2013 for Dalit representatives, in order to ensure the political representation of Dalits in political bodies according to their percentage of the Indian society. Furthermore, quotas have been set concerning the employment of Dalits and their access to public higher education 14 . While legislation for ending caste-based discrimination already exists and caste-based discrimination is on the political agenda in some affected countries, poor implementation of legislation, lack of access to justice for individuals or groups affected by caste-basted discrimination and social or economic discrimination, including social boycotts, are major barriers to equality. The European Union is committed to the promotion of human rights within the EU and in its external relations. Human rights shall run like a \u2018silver thread through a truly integrated range of external policies\u2019 15 . This brief aims to assess the extent to which the EU has integrated the fight against caste- based discrimination in its external relations. For this purpose, the most important policy guidelines concerning human rights and key documents regulating and documenting the relations between the EU and the selected caste affected countries 16 were analysed. Summit declarations as well as country strategy papers were analysed for key words (\u201cDalit\u201d, \u201ccaste\u201d, \u201cbonded labo*\u201d, \u201cmanual scavenging\u201d, \u201chuman right\u201d and \u201cuntouchab*\u201d 17 ). Subsequently, the identified passages were qualitatively checked. The documents were obtained from the websites of the European Union, particularly from the website of the European External Action Service (EEAS), and its delegations. Within the scope of this policy brief no all-encompassing analysis of all documents that influence the relations between the EU and the partner countries could be undertaken. Emphasis was put on key documents (country strategy papers, key documents as designated by the EEAS) and the documentation of dialogues. Furthermore, selected projects as presented on the websites of the EU delegations in the respective country were cross-checked. Those projects were chosen according to topic. Following the identified main forms of discrimination (see section 2), projects related to the following fields of work were analysed: employment, human rights, access to justice, women, children, education, political participation, access to services and humanitarian assistance. Please find the list of analysed documents in Annex 1. The text is structured as follows: In section 2, we define caste-based discrimination and identify key areas where countermeasures should be taken. The channels of the EU to address caste-based discrimination vary depending on the partner country, as do the legislation concerning caste-based discrimination and commitments to end it within countries. Section 3 sheds light on these realities, including a discussion of caste-based discrimination in Bangladesh, India, Nepal, Pakistan and Yemen.

THE FACE OF CASTE-BASED DISCRIMINATION Caste-based discrimination is built on traditional notions of purity and pollution and various categories of separation that have been established over time. Different forms of discrimination tend to interact and reinforce each other and perpetuate the plight of low-caste communities or those outside the caste system. For example, widespread poverty among Dalits and other low castes goes hand in hand with poor education because affected children may have to take care of younger siblings instead of going to school while parents work. This in turn often leads to a low awareness among Dalits and other low castes about their rights and ways for redress 18 . 2.1 Who is affected? While all Dalits and low castes are vulnerable within their respective society, there are some particularly vulnerable groups within the Dalit community. Dalit women suffer from multiple forms of discrimination based on poverty, low education, gender and caste. With limited access to education, professional/vocational training 19 and safe employment, they are at the bottom of society and often unaware of their rights; thus, they have a limited capacity to escape or improve their situation. The multiple forms of discrimination make them highly vulnerable to physical assaults, including rape and forced prostitution, crimes which often go unpunished 20 . Subgroups within castes may sometimes face special forms of stigmatisation. For example, the Badi and Valmiki groups are even more marginalised and exploited than other low castes. The Badi are associated with \u2018sex work\u2019, and the Valmiki are stigmatised due to their work as manual scavengers. Some sub-castes are marginalised for often being debt-bonded labourers 21 . Huge differences between different regions and states exist. However, general caste discrimination occurs more frequently in rural as opposed to urban areas 22 . 18 Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights in Nepal: Opening the Door to Equality. Access to Justice for Dalits in Nepal. OHCHR, Kathmandu, 2011, p. 11. Furthermore, low-caste children often suffer various discriminations at school, like being forced to sit separately or cleaning the school latrines, also leading to high dropout rates. For further information see: Center for Human Rights and Global Justice /Human Rights Watch: Caste discrimination against Dalits or so-called untouchables in India, 2007, p.33. 19 A 2002 ILO survey of Dalits in Nepal showed that 62.2% of Dalit women are illiterate (compared with 34.6% of Dalit men). Of the small group of Dalits that had undergone some sort of training only 20 per cent were women. See: ILO: Equality at work: Tackling the challenges, Global Report under the follow-up to the ILO Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work, 2007, p.36. 20 Maggie Black: Women in ritual slavery.

URL: http://www.antislavery.org/includes/documents/cm_docs/2009/w/women_in_ritual_slavery2007.pdf. In the resolution of 17 January 2013 on violence against women in India (2013/2512(RSP)) the European Parliament expresses its concern about the widespread violence perpetrated against Dalit women and girls in India, including sexual violence by men from the dominant castes, and at the extraordinarily high level of impunity for perpetrators in such cases and calls on the Government of India to treat all cases of sexual violence towards all women equally, and to investigate and prosecute such cases in an equal, fair, transparent and speedy manner. 21 OHCHR, Access to Justice for Dalits in Nepal, 2011, p. 14. 22 However, caste discrimination also takes on modern forms frequently applied in urban settings. See: Navsarjan Trust/Robert F. Kennedy Center for Justice & Human Rights: Understanding Untouchability. A Comprehensive Study of Practices and Conditions in 1589 Villages, 2012. 10 ",
        "2.2 A Human Rights and Poverty Review: EU action in addressing caste-based discrimination Dalit children are another particularly vulnerable group. Their discrimination in the educational system leads to high dropout rates. Consequently, fewer Dalit and low-caste individuals undertake professional training, thus perpetuating the existing cycle of poverty. Even though more and more \u201cuntraditional\u201d professions are created in modern societies, which are not affiliated with a certain caste, caste-affected individuals often do not benefit from these opportunities due to their low educational status. Economic and social discrimination: Poverty among the caste affected Although untouchability practices are officially forbidden in India and in Nepal 23 , in practice the notion of Dalits and low-caste individuals \u2018polluting\u2019 higher castes still exists. It continues to seriously constrain opportunities for Dalits and members of the lower castes to engage in society, take part in religious life and to conduct business. Members of lower castes may still get turned down when attempting to enter temples, and their access to cremation grounds is restricted. Forcing their way in has repeatedly led to violent incidents 24 . They may be denied access to water, health services and public offices. The discrimination of Dalit and low-caste children at school leads to high dropout rates, further perpetuating the circle of poor education, poverty and vulnerability 25 . Furthermore, Dalits are often boycotted socially or economically. This form of discrimination is difficult for the state to tackle. Only when the boycott is publicly announced by members of higher castes, for example by promoting the exclusion of Dalits from buying in shops or using private services, the public authorities have leverage to act 26 . Informal boycotts, where members of higher castes do not buy in Dalit shops or use their services are more difficult to detect. The existence of such hidden discrimination is evidenced by the fact that Dalits are strongly represented in public employment and education, where quotas are applied, and less strongly represented in the (formal) private sector 27 . Direct social and economic discrimination results from the fact that the caste system is strongly interwoven with \u2018traditional\u2019 occupations. Castes are mostly created along occupational lines, but also some \u2018polluting\u2019 occupations are forced upon particular Dalit \u2018sub-castes\u2019. Entering occupations that \u2018belong\u2019 to other castes is difficult for individuals belonging to low casts or Dalits. The \u2018impure\u2019 occupations carried out by Dalits, like manual scavenging 28 , are often demeaning and hazardous. Manual scavenging is also an example illustrative of the failure to implement legislation protecting Dalits in India. Although a legal act that prohibits the employment of manual scavengers 29 has been in force since 1993, manual scavengers are still regularly employed. Not a single conviction has been carried out under this act in the last 19 years. On the contrary, even state agencies or state companies have been known to hire manual scavengers 30 . Furthermore, Dalits are more vulnerable to bonded labour. According to a report on bonded labour in India, Nepal and Pakistan, around 90% of all bonded labourers are Dalits, minorities and indigenous 23 In Bangladesh, Yemen and Pakistan no legislation outlawing \u2018untouchability\u2019 exist. 24 See for example: Times of India: Angry relatives of dead dalit priest refuse to accept body, 10.12.2012. 25 The Hindu: Dalit school dropouts narrate their discrimination accounts, 05.11.2012.

        "Policy Department DG External Policies people 31 . Low education, limited options for employment and exclusion are major causes for high poverty rates among Dalits. The above-mentioned forms of discrimination tend to be aggravated in times of crisis: \u2018caste-blindness\u2019 in disaster relief has left Dalits especially vulnerable as they have slower access to help, less support and face other forms of discrimination 32 . 2.3 Access to justice and political participation There are now legal provisions in several countries prohibiting caste-based discrimination and there are, by law, no untouchable people or groups. Therefore, access to justice seems to be the most crucial element to improve the plight of members of lower castes. As stated in the World Development Report \u201clegal institutions play a key role in the distribution of power and rights. They also influence other institutions that deliver public services and market practice\u201d 33 . A study entitled \u201cAccess to Justice for Dalits in Nepal\u201d identified four essential components of improving access to justice for those discriminated against based on caste: 1. strengthening the normative framework; 2. increasing legal awareness; 3. providing access to appropriate forums and improving the effective administration of justice and 4. strengthening accountability, enforcement and oversight 34 . Continuing discrimination can be in some respects directly linked to the failures of public sector entities. An example would be the lack of implementation of existing legislation or a caste-bias in justice systems. Society as a whole, the police and even victims often perceive caste-based crimes as a social issue rather than a crime 35 . According to the study conducted in Nepal, only Dalits who had support from Human Rights Defenders registered caste-based crimes with the police 36 . The study further revealed low accountability on the part of law enforcement officers and a lack of proportionate punishment and compensation. Furthermore, the assigned role of the law enforcement officers was not clear or not fully accepted by officers. Repeatedly, police forces also failed to protect victims and witnesses. Other problems related to enforcement by public authorities are the lack of Dalit/low-caste representation within the police and justice system and financial constraints. Financial limitations exist on the official side, where insufficient personnel or funds may preclude covering a certain assigned area. On the side of victims, financial constraints might restrain people from registering cases because of a lack of resources (e.g., loss of income, difficult physical access to police and courts). The political participation and representation of Dalits varies strongly from country to country, and also in different communities. Reservation policies as applied in India have increased political representation and clout of low-caste individuals. \u2018Caste\u2019 is one of the determining factors in political representation. However, equal political participation in all spheres of politics has not yet been fully achieved. Political 31 Krishna Prasad Upadhyaya: Poverty, discrimination and slavery.

        "3.1 A Human Rights and Poverty Review: EU action in addressing caste-based discrimination parties often do not adequately represent members of lower castes and Dalits 37 , and violence has occurred during election campaigns preventing Dalits from voting or running for political office. In other countries with caste systems like Bangladesh, Yemen and Pakistan, the political debate on caste discrimination is in its initial phase. Thus, political participation and representation of low-caste people tend to be significantly weaker. 3. CASTE-BASED DISCRIMINATION AND THE EU Policy guidelines affecting caste-based discrimination The European Union has in recent years repeatedly addressed caste-based discrimination in resolutions and reports, such as the Annual Human Rights reports. The European Parliament has had several hearings on the topic and the European Commission has funded Dalit human rights defenders 38 . Of special importance are the resolution of the European Parliament on the \u201cHuman rights situation of the Dalits in India\u201d (2007) 39 and the resolution on \u201cHuman rights in the world and the European Union's policy on the matter including implications for the EU's strategic human rights policy\u201d (2012) 40 . The former addresses the various forms of discrimination that Dalits suffer in detail. The latter contains two articles targeting caste-based discrimination 41 . One condemns discrimination based on work and descent, and the second recommends initiatives to ensure that attention is given in EU human rights policy and cooperation instruments to eliminating caste-based discrimination. Furthermore, on 13 December 2012 the European Parliament adopted a resolution on caste-based discrimination in India calling for the development of an EU policy on caste-based discrimination, the endorsement of the draft UN Principles and Guidelines for the Effective Elimination of Discrimination based on Work and Descent 42 and the inclusion of caste discrimination in dialogues with Indian authorities and programmes. The resolution includes direct references to atrocities committed against communities and individuals of low caste status and Dalits, strongly condemning the crimes committed against them and the poor record of the Indian government in this regard 43 . However, caste-based discrimination has not yet been included in the EU\u2019s Annual Human Rights Report. 37 Hasan, Politics of Inclusion , p.127 ff. 38 Namely in 2000, 2002, 2003, 2005, 2008 and 2009, see: IDSN: Towards an EU Policy Framework for the Effective Elimination of Discrimination based on work and decent, p. 4. 39 European Parliament: Resolution P6_TA (2007)0016, Human rights of the Dalits in India. 40 P7_TA(2012)0126 (tabled: A7-0086/2012), 18.04.2012. 41 Art. 111 Condemns all forms of human rights violations committed against people discriminated against on the basis of work and descent, and the limited access to justice for victims; calls on the EU and its Member States to endorse the draft UN Principles and Guidelines for the Effective Elimination of Discrimination based on Work and Descent; Art.: 117 Recommends initiatives for EU legislation to ensure that attention is paid in EU human rights policy and cooperation instruments to eliminating caste discrimination, and action in caste-affected countries, including Nepal, India, Bangladesh, Pakistan, Sri Lanka and Yemen. 42 A UN study on discrimination based on work and descent undertaken by the former UN Sub-Commission on the Promotion and Protection of Human Rights include the draft principles and guidelines.

        "3.2 Policy Department DG External Policies Caste-based discrimination in selected countries The EU in general and the EEAS in particular have various channels to promote non-discrimination and the inclusion in EU activities of communities affected by the caste system. Among them are dialogues with caste-affected countries, development cooperation (programming), humanitarian assistance, and trade relations. The majority of people affected by caste-based discrimination live in South Asia, especially India, but also in Nepal, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh and Pakistan. Outside of South Asia, social stratification systems sometimes referred to as \u2018caste-like\u2019 systems exist in Myanmar, Bali, Japan and Yemen. Furthermore, the term has been applied to an array of situations involving social inequality and stratification around the world 44 , though this use is somewhat controversial 45 . Caste-based discrimination in relation to work, provision of services and education has also occurred in caste-affected diaspora communities in Western countries 46 . Low caste and Dalit population Country Low castes and Dalits 47 Bangladesh ~ 4.5 million (3 \u2212 4% of population ) India ~ 166.6 million (15 \u2212 20% of population) Nepal ~ 3.5 million (13.5% of population) Pakistan ~ 330 000 \u2212 2 million (0.25 \u2212 1.2% of population) Yemen ~ 150 000 \u2013 3.5 million Source: see footnote . As described in the previous chapters the legal provisions for low-castes and the political participation of low-castes do vary strongly from country to country.The following chapters give a short introduction to the status quo of castes in five countries and a brief discussion of the EU's approach to the issue, which is based on the analysis of key documents (see Annex 1). 44 Especially in Africa and the Middle East, countries include: Ethiopia, Nigeria, Kenya, Mauritania, Senegal, Chad, Mali, Ghana, Madagascar and Niger. 45 See Chris Smaje: Natural Hierarchies: The Historical Sociology of Race and Caste .

        "A Human Rights and Poverty Review: EU action in addressing caste-based discrimination 3.2.1 Bangladesh The European Union is Bangladesh\u2019s biggest trading partner (54% of exports are to the EU). As a Least Developed Country, Bangladesh trades with the EU under the most preferential trading scheme. Furthermore, the EU is one of Bangladesh\u2019s biggest donors (EUR 142 million official development assistance in 2010 48 ). A total of EUR 403 million is allocated under the Country Strategy Paper (2007 \u2212 2013) alone 49 . \u2018Human Rights\u2019 are a focus of the cooperation with Bangladesh, but caste-based discrimination is not specifically addressed in the respective documents. In 2012, the Delegation of the European Union to Bangladesh published a comprehensive report on EU-Bangladesh relations 50 . It emphasises the common work on strengthening human rights, fighting poverty and promoting gender equality, but no specific reference is made to caste-based discrimination. The fact that caste-discrimination has not been identified as a major human rights concern in Bangladesh may be connected to the fact that the Dalit movement in Bangladesh is very new in comparison to other countries. The first systematic investigation of Dalit (including Muslim-Dalits) and low-caste discrimination was undertaken in 2008. It discovered that the discrimination against Dalits in Bangladesh is similar to the situation elsewhere: segregation, limited access to services, discrimination against women, and discrimination of children in education. Discrimination with regard to employment has led to exceptionally high poverty rates among Dalits, affecting Hindu and Muslim Dalits alike. With regard to political participation, however, Hindu Dalits suffer from more intense discrimination than Muslim Dalits 51 . With regard to the political leverage on discrimination, the Constitution of Bangladesh (1972) states that \u2018The state shall not discriminate against any citizen on ground of religion, race, caste, sex or place of birth\u2019 52 , and several other pieces of legislation against discrimination exist. However, as opposed to some of the other caste-affected countries, lack of legislation is still an issue in Bangladesh. The lack of quota systems for Dalits is mirrored in the negligible representation of Dalits in policy-making bodies. The EU supports several projects which should include groups affected by the caste system as they target vulnerable and impoverished groups (i.e., \u2018Small Initiative by Local Innovative NGOs\u2019 and \u2018Support to the Hard to Reach through Basic Education\u2019). Funded under the EIDHR scheme, civil society seminars on human rights were organised in Bangladesh in 2011. Nonetheless, apart from a project that directly aims at promoting the human rights of Dalits, caste-based discrimination is not mainstreamed in dialogues and programmes 53 . 48 http://development.donoratlas.eu/Global-Trends.aspx#AtlasTitle 49 http://eeas.europa.eu/delegations/bangladesh/eu_bangladesh/political_relations/index_en.htm. 50 Delegation of the European Union to Bangladesh: Bangladesh and Europe 2012.

        "Policy Department DG External Policies 3.2.2 India India is in a special position among the caste-affected countries. The vast majority of people affected by the caste system live in India, and due to India\u2019s geopolitical position, the engagement of the EU with India is more intense than with other countries with caste systems. The EU aims to foster an EU \u2212 Indian strategic partnership. Foreign policy consultations at a senior level, ministerial meetings as well as EU \u2212 India Summits, security dialogues and an India \u2212 EU human rights dialogue are held regularly 54 . Furthermore, the EU interacts with the Indian Human Rights Commission and has a standing Human Rights Working Group. Traditionally, caste-based discrimination has been a sensitive topic in India. International action in the field has been rejected by the Indian government, which considers caste-based discrimination an internal issue. Moreover, the government points to existing legislation. While there are voices in India challenging this position, it is still shared by large parts of the population despite long-standing implementation difficulties 55 . A certain discrepancy can also be found on the EU side. Despite the resolution \u2018Human rights of the Dalits in India\u2019 criticising the \u2019lack of substantive EU engagement with the Indian Government, notably within the EU \u2212 India Summits, on the vast problem of caste-based discrimination\u2019, the problem remains largely unchanged. In the Joint Statements of the last three EU-India Summits, caste-based discrimination was not addressed. Only general references to human rights are made in a range of documents where the word \u2018caste\u2019 is usually not even mentioned. An exception is the Country Strategy Paper for India (2007\u20132013). In the Strategy Paper several references to \u2018caste\u2019 and Dalits are made, particularly with regard to opportunity, education and gender. Under the Multi-Annual Indicative Programme the funded activities carried out in line with the Country Strategy Paper are laid out. In this document, as well as in the Mid-Term Review, references to caste- based discrimination are made. These relate to equal opportunities, mainstreaming human rights (including caste discrimination) in all activities where appropriate, education, infant/child and maternal mortality and health. Although not yet fully mainstreamed, caste-based discrimination is considered at some crucial focal points in these documents, most coherently with regard to women\u2019s rights. A random examination of projects carried out suggests that caste-based discrimination needs to be more coherently addressed on a more concrete level, for example under the European Instrument for Democracy & Human Rights, which has funded various Dalit projects. In sum, there is a discrepancy between project goals as stated in the Country Strategy Paper and the concrete projects carried out versus the official dialogues in which caste-discrimination is largely ignored. In the proposal regulation establishing a financing instrument for developing cooperation (2011 56 ), India is listed as a \u2018graduated country\u2019 and will not receive bilateral aid. There will be no Country Strategy Papers (or Annual Action Programmes) for India if the proposal regulation is adopted 54 EEAS: Annual Activity Report.

        "A Human Rights and Poverty Review: EU action in addressing caste-based discrimination in its current form. Nevertheless, this history of discrepancies should be kept in mind when engaging with India in dialogues and projects. 3.2.3 Nepal Dalits in Nepal constitute about 13.5% of the population. They face various forms of discrimination, which are similar to those in other caste-affected countries, including poverty, limited access to justice and inadequate political representation 57 . The 1990 Constitution includes equality before the law, prohibited caste-based discrimination and outlawed the concept of untouchability for the first time. However, until recently the lack of translation of the positive constitutional provisions into laws and the lack of legislation tackling discrimination in the private sphere has been criticised by Dalit groups 58 . With the adoption of the \u2018Caste-based Discrimination and Untouchability Act\u2019 in May 2011, which criminalises caste-based discrimination in public and private spheres, most of the remaining legislative gaps have been closed. This makes Nepal one of the most progressive countries in ending caste-based discrimination. However, similar to the situation in India, the lack of implementation of the legislation is a major problem for members of lower castes. In Nepal more than in other countries, tackling discrimination and inequality is also understood as a main prerequisite for stability in the country. The Comprehensive Peace Agreement (2006 59 ) that ended the ten-year armed conflict noted inequality and discrimination as a root cause for conflict 60 . Caste-based discrimination has not been included in the EU \u2212 Nepal Co-operation Agreement signed in 1996, but it is addressed in the Country Strategy Paper for Nepal (2007 \u2212 2013). Non-inclusion of lower castes/Dalits is named as one of the \u2018most critical failures\u2019 of the country\u2019s development; and caste- based discrimination is additionally linked to \u2018caste-sensitive\u2019 issues, such as gender and education. Caste-based discrimination is not thoroughly mainstreamed and received little attention in the Mid- Term Review of 2010. On a more concrete level, an evaluation of the European Union\u2019s cooperation with Nepal 61 concluded that supported interventions between 2002 \u2212 2013 generally addressed caste-based discriminatory practices well in projects in Nepal. The evaluation found, however, that the use of evidence-based assessments as well as analysis of existing policies and formal institutional structures and processes creating caste-based discrimination could be improved In recent years, Nepal has been increasingly committed to fighting caste discrimination. Already in 2002 the National Dalit Commission was established. In 2009 Nepal declared itself an \u2019untouchability free\u2019 state, established a National Dalit Commission and adopted the above mentioned act. In 2011 the government accepted all recommendations concerning caste-based discrimination given during the Human Rights Council\u2019s Universal Periodic Review. In light of these positive developments, the EU should further encourage Nepal to move forward along this promising path and support it by including caste-based discrimination in a coherent way in its policies, strategies and programmes. 57 IDSN: Caste-based discrimination in South Asia, p. 7. 58 Krishna Bhattachan/ Rej Sunar/ Yasso Battachan: Caste-based discrimination in Nepal.

        "Policy Department DG External Policies 3.2.4 Pakistan The Government of Pakistan has only very recently acknowledged the existence of caste-based discrimination in Pakistan 62 and the need to give redress to victims. The long silence about caste oppression is mirrored in limited official data on the discrimination that members of lower castes face and the number of people affected (with estimations ranging from 330 000 to 2 million), some NGO estimations going as high as 5 million), as well as in discriminatory provisions in the law. Caste-based discrimination is not as such a punishable crime in Pakistan 63 . A few affirmative action regulations exist, but they remain largely ignored by the government and the administration on all governance levels. Members of lower castes in Pakistan are often part of Hindu and Christian minorities, but discrimination against Muslim members of lower castes also exists. Muslim low-caste discrimination is not included in most estimates or discussions on caste-based discrimination because it contradicts the notion that all Muslims are equal and the perception of caste-discrimination as an Indian/Hindu problem. The logic for the segregation of non-Muslim members of lower castes appears to be borrowed from Hindu notions of purity and pollution. For example, non-Muslim low castes are frequently forced to sit separately when eating in public, such as in restaurants or during school meals. This practice is then explained by emphasising that the discriminated groups eat foods forbidden in Islam 64 . While the reasons given for caste-based discrimination in Pakistan may be somewhat atypical, the forms of discrimination witnessed are very similar to those in India, Bangladesh and Nepal. Discrimination revolves around occupations, is rampant in education, touches everyday situations concerning eating together and is especially grave for women. The lack of recognition of caste discrimination in Pakistan is reflected in the EU \u2212 Pakistan relations. No reference to caste discrimination was found in the key documents despite a strong focus on human rights, which is one of the priority fields in cooperation 65 . Programmes, which might be beneficial for members of lower castes, though not explicitly targeting them, include child protection projects targeting underprivileged groups and a Strategy for Human Rights Defenders in Pakistan funded under the European Instrument for Democracy & Human Rights. 3.2.5 Yemen \u2018Al Akhdam\u2019 66 (\u2018the Servants\u2019) is a caste outside the Hindu caste system but its members suffer from \u2018typical\u2019 caste discrimination. They are almost exclusively bound to one occupation (mostly sweeping), stigmatised and segregated from the rest of society. Most Akhdam have not received an education and the level of child labour and school dropout rates remains very high. Other critical problems are the lack of access to adequate housing and basic services, especially health services. Infant and maternity mortality among the Akhdam is among the highest in the world 67 . 62 In the Universal Periodic Review (4th UPR session, 2008) and the examination by the UN Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination (CERD 74th session, 2009).

        "A Human Rights and Poverty Review: EU action in addressing caste-based discrimination Different from some of the Dalit groups in South Asia, the Akhdam have been very poorly organised in the past and many of them have accepted their low position in society 68 . But in recent years, political activism is slowly evolving. In 2012 the Akham held their first national conference in Sana\u2019a 69 . The government so far has not been very active in combating caste stratification; no affirmative action or anti-discrimination legislation exists. Furthermore, the government employs the Akhdam street sweepers mostly without government employee benefits, such as permanent work contracts and pensions 70 . The lack of recognition of caste discrimination in Yemen is mirrored in EU \u2212 Yemen relations. Whereas human rights are a focal area in cooperation, no reference to the Akhdam is made in key documents and few references can be found in projects targeting the Akhdam community 71 . 4. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS The Lisbon Treaty states that human rights, democracy and the rule of law shall be at the centre of external action. Building on this, the general approach on human rights of the EU is outlined in the Joint Communication \u2018Human Rights and Democracy at the Heart of EU External Action\u2014Towards a More Effective Approach\u2019 (2011). The objective of the Communication is to make the external policy on human rights more coherent and effective, while tailoring the policies to the targeted country. Without rejecting the overall objectives, the future approach shall be adapted more closely to the realities on the ground, especially by developing tailored human rights strategies for all countries. This general understanding could also be applied to caste-based discrimination. Caste-based discrimination follows an inhuman logic of purity and pollution, creating stiff hierarchies in all caste-affected countries and resulting in gross human rights violations.. However, the legal realities and options for addressing the discrimination vary. There are countries such as India on the one hand, with elaborated legislation on Dalits, quota schemes and a long-standing debate, and countries like Yemen, which have not fully accepted the reality of caste within their country, on the other. Thus, they require different political approaches and policies. Any assessment must therefore take national legislation and existing policy measures into account. Furthermore, the relevant institutions and their functionality need to be considered 72 . The mainstreaming of caste-based discrimination in country strategies and programmes is important in order to send a clear message on behalf of the EU. However, the channels used and projects on the ground will often differ with regard to the respective country. 68 Robert Worth: Despite caste-less society in Yemen, generations languish at bottom of ladder, New York Times 27.2.2012.

        "4.1 Policy Department DG External Policies Combating caste-based discrimination\u2014how to develop and mainstream policies, strategies and programmes of the EU The objective of eliminating discrimination on any grounds has been affirmed by the \u2018European Consensus on Development\u2019 in 2005. Caste-based discrimination has not been explicitly mainstreamed into the relevant programmes and strategies. Although it is theoretically covered in the Consensus\u2019 general reference to discrimination, the explicit inclusion of caste-based discrimination seems advisable. Studies suggest that caste-specific provisions target caste discrimination more effectively than more general provisions on broader themes like religious discrimination 73 . Lessons for successful mainstreaming can be drawn from the mainstreaming of human rights: \uf0b7 Since 1995, the EU has aimed at including a \u2018human rights clause\u2019 in all political framework agreements with third countries. Building on this, a \u2018caste-based discrimination clause\u2019 could be included in Association Agreements, as well as Partnership and Cooperation Agreements. Furthermore such a clause could be included in Country Strategy Papers, Annual Action Programmes, and Joint Programming and National Development Plans. The \u2018human rights clause\u2019 has been acknowledged to improve the coherent inclusion of human rights into EU framework agreements and programmes. Furthermore it forms the legal basis for measures taken in response to violation of human rights. These measures can include suspension of meetings and technical co-operation programmes with the country concerned 74 . \uf0b7 On a higher level, reference to caste-based discrimination could be included in the most important guidelines for EU human rights policy 75 , where appropriate. For example, the \u2018Guidelines to EU policy towards third countries on torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment\u2019 may be considered. Furthermore caste-based discrimination could be included as a ground of discrimination addressed as part of the EU anti\u00ad discrimination agenda. \uf0b7 As a serious human rights violation that exacerbates poverty, projects combating caste-based discrimination should be considered for stronger support under EuropeAid (EIDHR) funding. EU-funded projects need to consider caste-based discrimination issues at all stages of the project cycle, including identification, implementation and especially regarding monitoring and evaluation. To increase the impact of projects, special attention should be given to the most vulnerable groups: women and children. 73 Government Equalities Office: Caste discrimination and harassment in Great Britain.

        "A Human Rights and Poverty Review: EU action in addressing caste-based discrimination \uf0b7 Because caste discrimination affects a range of key issues to a particular extent, projects targeting these fields should always take caste discrimination into account. This would include all projects with a focus on education, women, access to justice, and labour (with regard to bonded labour, manual scavenging or lack of choice of occupation). Minimum recommendations for these priority sectors in caste-affected countries should be elaborated in an \u2018Operational Guidance for Programming\u2019 76 . Visibility for these minimum recommendations needs to be ensured. In the identification phase of projects, knowledge on specifically vulnerable groups, like particularly vulnerable sub-castes, should be gathered and fed into project development. Knowledge gathering can be undertaken in cooperation with national or international non\u00ad governmental Dalit groups (for example, the International Dalit Solidarity Network) or official Dalit representatives, like the National Dalit Commissions, where they exist. \uf0b7 There is evidence that caste discrimination is more intense in times of humanitarian crises. A common caste-sensitive approach needs to be elaborated and then applied in humanitarian and development assistance. As emergency humanitarian aid is subject to fast planning, the necessary knowledge on castes needs to be gathered on an ongoing basis and stored at a central, known point (possibly the human rights focal points). In case of emergency help, procedures must be setup for this information to be used and included in programming. \uf0b7 In order to position human rights at the center of external action, training on human rights is provided in the EEAS, including to all heads of EU delegations 77 . In caste-affected countries this training could be extended to include training on caste-based discrimination. The training modules 78 elaborated for human rights, gender and child protection should be complemented with training on caste-based discrimination for EU personnel in caste-affected countries. This training could be included in the pre-posting trainings given in Brussels. The EU could develop \u201cGuidelines to EU policy to addressing caste-based discrimination\u201d to provide a tool for EU personnel working in and with caste-affected countries. \uf0b7 To mainstream human rights into all EU external action, the EU is furthermore developing a network of focal points in all EU delegations worldwide and in the EEAS and Commission services headquarters. These shall be equipped with the latest available technologies for sharing information and best practice 79 . Considering the shortage of information on caste- based discrimination, especially with regard to atypical caste-like situations , e.g., Yemen, the EU may consider the use of this network to improve information flow on caste discrimination and the best-practices used to fight it. These focal points could also collect and administer the information on relevant contact persons and groups (as the above mentioned non\u00ad governmental Dalit groups). 76 IDSN: Caste-based discrimination in South Asia, p. 10. 77 Joint Communication, Human Rights and Democracy at the heart of EU External Action, p. 18. 78 European External Action Service: Human rights and democracy in the world.

        "4.2 Policy Department DG External Policies Dialogue with partners: addressing caste-based discrimination Best practices to increase the impact of dialogues of EU human rights policy, identified in a review in 2011, should be considered when integrating caste-based discrimination in EU policies. They are the following: 1. better embedding them in the overall relation to the third country concerned 2. ensuring a close link with other human rights policy instruments, particularly the new human rights country strategies; 3. focusing attention on the follow-up to the dialogues through concrete action plans, legislative reforms and projects which the EU can support through its instruments, including cooperation assistance 80 . The inclusion of caste-based discrimination into country strategies and projects of the EU is an important measure for targeting caste-based discrimination more coherently. Underlying structural causes and caste barriers also need to be simultaneously addressed. Purely developmental approaches via projects are insufficient if the underlying structural causes and caste barriers are not concurrently addressed 81 . Embedding the elimination of caste-based discrimination in the overall relations to caste- affected countries should therefore be a goal. Human rights dialogues and policy dialogues provide good opportunities to exchange experiences on fighting caste discrimination and to address underlying structural causes within partner countries. The focus of the respective dialogues must be adapted to the main challenges faced by each country in the fight against caste-based discrimination. \uf0b7 Consistent with the resolution \u201cHuman rights of the Dalits in India\u201d and \u201cCaste discrimination in India\u201d, the EEAS, the Council and Commission should raise the issue of caste-based discrimination during EU-India summits and other meetings as part of all political, human rights, civil society development and trade dialogues. Furthermore, they should inform concerned EP committees with the progress and outcome of such dialogues 82 . \uf0b7 Concerning Bangladesh, Pakistan and Yemen, the EU, mainly in form of the EC and EEAS, should work towards more recognition of caste discrimination and promote legislation against caste discrimination, and for reservations (quota) for low-castes. \uf0b7 The United Nations 83 has undertaken a comprehensive study on caste-based discrimination, which includes the draft Principles and Guidelines for the Effective Elimination of Discrimination based on Work and Decent 84 . The EU should promote the endorsement of this framework in the Human Rights Council, and work for its implementation. The EU should furthermore take into consideration the observations and recommendations on caste-based discrimination of UN 80 EEAS: Human rights and democracy in the world, p. 17. 81 ILO: Equality at work, p.37. 82 P6_TA (2007)0016. 83 A comprehensive compilation of how caste discrimination and similar forms of discrimination based on work and descent have been addressed by the UN treaty bodies, Universal Periodic Review, and the Special Procedures can be found at www.idsn.org/uncompilation. 84 Draft Principles and Guidelines on the Effective Elimination of Discrimination based on Work and Descent, (A/HRC/11/CRP.3),18 May 2009. 22 ",
