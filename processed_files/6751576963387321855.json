        "Evaluation of legislation, policy and practice on child participation in the European Union (EU) Country Mapping Fiche for Croatia March 2015 1 Country Fiche: CROATIA Name of country expert: Ivana Je\u0111ud Bori\u0107 Position / title: Assistant Professor Organisation: University of Zagreb, Faculty of Education and Rehabilitation Sciences Part 1: Overall arrangements within the country A. National Legislative/ Policy Framework (including definitions and budget/financing) a. Background context to child participation agenda within the country: \uf0b7 Historical development \uf0b7 Cultural attitudes and their influence (+ / -) The former Republic of Yugoslavia signed the Convention on the Rights of the Child in 1989. After the declaration of independence, on October 8th 1991, Croatia formally became one of the states that ratified UNCRC. The total population of Croatia is currently 4.437.460, and the proportion of children in total population is 20%. Croatia is divided in 20 counties and the City of Zagreb, but has a centralistic approach to public policies. Croatia is a member of the United Nations, the Council of Europe, NATO, and since July 1 st 2013, a Member State of the European Union. The UNCRC is perceived as a formal document which set standards and measures for the rights of the child in the country in general and participatory rights in particular. Nonetheless, some of the interviews with Government stakeholders also mentioned certain practices of child participation which existed in former Yugoslavia too e.g. in schools, children chose their class presidents, students had the opportunity to become representatives of their peers in the Union of Pioneers (Savez pionira) etc. Consequently there was a certain tendency to enable children to participate in school life. [\u201c If we remember, we had even 30 or 50 years ago, class presidents and some kind of schools councils where children were learning very actively about participation .\u201d] (interview: Government Stakeholder (GS) 1 ) However, the Convention on the Rights of the Child is generally perceived as the starting point, especially when it comes to participatory rights. Since 1999, there has been some research on the rights of the child, including participatory rights. Data from research conducted in 1999, by professor Antonija \u017di\u017eak and Nivex Koller-Trbovi\u0107, from University of Zagreb (Sveu\u010dili\u0161te u Zagrebu), showed that most of the children believed 1 The anonymity of all interview respondents has been preserved in the version of the fiche for publication. The views of representatives from Ministries and other official Government bodies are attributed using the term \u2018Government Stakeholder\u2019 (GS), and the views of representatives from all other organisations are attributed using the term \u2018Non-Government Stakeholder (NGS)\u2019. A full list of organisations represented in the study fieldwork is provided in Part 4 of the fiche. ",

National Legislative/ Policy Framework (including definitions and budget/financing) that adults do not listen to them and that they don't have opportunity to express their views. Later research showed no improvement in that sense. For example, research undertaken by UNICEF Office for Croatia (Ured UNICEF-a za Hrvatsku) in 2010, indicated that children feel that they can participate to a larger extent in their own families but very little in their local community (children said that adults do not consult them or include them in decision making). Establishment of the Child Ombudsman is the second important issue related to child participation. Since2003, Republic of Croatia has had an official Ombudsperson for Children and The Child Ombudsman Law. According to the Child Ombudsman Law, in Article 6, the Child Ombudsperson (Pravobranitelj za djecu), monitors the implementation of the rights of the child and promotes the rights of the child countrywide. More specifically related to participatory rights, Article 7 states: \u201c The Child Ombudsperson cooperates with children, encourages children to express their views, respects their opinion, initiates and participates in public activities for the improvement of children\u2019s position and suggests measures for increasing the influence of children in society \u201d. In the last decade, there has been some change in legislation that supports child participation, especially Article 12: Family Law, Social Welfare Law, Law on Education in Primary and Secondary Schools, Youth Councils Law. In 2005, the National Council of Students was founded. Their duty is to represent all students of primary and secondary schools, related to all things that concern their lives, work and education system. Recent developments also show increased professional and public awareness about child participation: in 2012, two children were included as full members of the National Council for Children (Vije\u0107e za djecu). Furthermore, in 2013, child participation has been set as one of the strategic goals for the National Strategy on the Rights of Children in the Republic of Croatia 2 (2014-2020). Two child representatives participated in the working group that was established to oversee the drafting of this document (interview: Non- Government Stakeholder (NGS). 2 The Strategy was accepted on September 25 th 2014 by the Croatian Government. There is still no final version of the strategy at the time of writing, but it\u2019s acceptance is documented at the following link: http://www.mspm.hr/novosti/vijesti/vlada_rh_usvojila_nacionalnu_strategiju_za_prava_djece_od_2014_do_2020- ",
        "Evaluation of legislation, policy and practice on child participation in the European Union (EU) Country Mapping Fiche for Croatia March 2015 3 A. National Legislative/ Policy Framework (including definitions and budget/financing) Cultural attitudes vary from negative to very positive, depending on the personal experiences with child participation and personal and professional beliefs. All of the interviewees agree that in general, cultural attitudes explicitly support child participation as an idea, but when it comes to a practical level, adults are sceptical and do not really support child participation. One of the reasons for this lies in alack of real understanding of child participation. Child participation is still in general perceived as some sort of decoration or formal fulfilment of certain policies and laws. However, there are some very positive examples and positive attitudes relating to child participation, which led for example to greater and more meaningful participation of children in certain parts of Croatia (for example, the Children\u2019s Council in the city of Opatija (Dje\u010dje vije\u0107e grada Opatije) (NGS). The general sense gauged from the responses received is that there is a great need for education and sensitisation of adults, to increase their understanding of child participation and their readiness, knowledge and skills to support children to participate. At the state level (government, legislation and policies) a change in attitudes can be perceived in the last few years, mostly due to pre access and accession to the European Union (harmonization of laws and policies; for example through the harmonization of laws and policies (mostly due to pre-access and accession to the European Union). b. How is Article 12 UNCRC reflected in legislation? Note: please include details of: \uf0b7 Relevant national legislative documents \uf0b7 Obligations imposed on authorities, bodies, and / or appropriate adults \uf0b7 Remedies for violations of these obligations Family Law Act, in part 2.

National Legislative/ Policy Framework (including definitions and budget/financing) The Union of Societies Our Children (Savez dru\u0161tava Na\u0161a djeca) was founded in the 1950s and since then has actively promoted the wellbeing of children. The Union operates on the national level and is organised through its network of a hundred local Societies, \u201cOur Children\u201d, active in different towns and districts in Croatia. All of the Union\u2019s programme activities are based on the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child and the wishes, interests and needs of children and parents.

The Network acts as a national (umbrella) association and is also a member of the European Youth Forum. g. What are the budgetary resources and relevant financial programmes aimed at the promotion and implementation of child participation in each Member State? How visible are they? There are no specific budgetary resources aimed at the promotion and implementation of child participation. According to the 2012 Alternative Report of Implementation of the CRC the main problem is non transparent information and data about financial resources for children on national and local level, according to specific areas (e.g. family, education, health). The Child Ombudsman actively advocates for a child budget on the national level, where all the financial resources for children would be clearly visible and transparent. [\u201c There are no special financial resources for children\u2019s participation, at least as far as I know...but I\u2019m very glad you are asking me that question...because we have been advocating in the last 6 or 7 years the creation of a so called \u201cchildren\u2019s budget\u201d. We insist that the state clearly says \u201cThis is for children\u201d...and then we will monitor if it is a small amount or big...to be able to recognise which resources are for children.\u201d] (NGS) From the perspective of the Ministry of Social Politics and Youth (Ministarstvo socijalne politike i mladih) (GS), in their budget, there are specific resources aimed at programmes of civil organisations, which promote child's rights in general. [\u201cWe (the Ministry of social policy and youth) have a budget item called \u201caffirmation of child\u2019s rights\u201d and it refers to all rights....we don\u2019t have special item for participation, but we have this general item within we finance NGO project related to children\u2019s rights.\u201d](GS) Representatives from civil sector, on the other hand, report cuts in financial resources made to their programme based on the National Plan of Activities for Children. The main goal of the programme was to promote child participation through children\u2019s councils in cities and municipalities. Due to a financial crisis and state budget cuts, the program was left without finances. However, it is still listed as one of activities in National Plan of Activities for Children. ",

What influence do policy and recommendations at EU level have in developing legislation policy and practice for implementing Article 12 in your country? Policy and recommendation at EU level is reported to have a great influence in developing legislation policy and practice for implementing Article 12 in Croatia. All of the interviewees agree that Croatian laws and procedure are to a great extent influenced by EU level policy and recommendations. Most of them are translated into Croatian (in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Ministarstvo vanjskih poslova)) and disseminated within the country. Some of the interviewees believe that policies and legislation concerning child participation are exclusively influenced by the EU policies and recommendation, which are some sort of inspiration and motivation to change national laws and procedure. [\u201c Policies and procedures from European level influenced us almost exclusively..., firstly UNCRC and then all the rest...I think that if it hadn\u2019t been for these things\u2026 pushing us, we would be behind current trends...we have certain delays anyway, because we accept all those documents only on a formal level.\u201d (NGS) An interviewee from the civil sector pointed out that in some cases, people in Croatia just accept European recommendations or strategies without thinking about how will this affect children/ people in our country or how will this be implemented in Croatia. [\u201c We lack vision, to know what we want. A good proportion of laws and European recommendations are \u201cimported\u201d without thinking of how they will fit our context, do we really want those changes...we are not able to create conditions for real implementation .\u201d](NGS) b. What has been done in the Member State pursuant to the Council of Europe Recommendation on child participation? How has the Recommendation been: - Translated into the national language(s)? - Disseminated within the Member State/implemented in part? Related to the European policy context, the new policy document for children follows the same strategic goals as the Council of Europe Strategy for the Rights of the Child (2012-2015 ) : \u201c Promoting child-friendly services and systems, Eliminating all forms of violence against children, Guaranteeing the rights of children in vulnerable situations, Promoting child participation\u201d. The Council of Europe Recommendation on child participation is not yet known in Croatia, or translated to national language or disseminated within the country. c. What tools and measures have been set in place to implement the Council of Europe Recommendation? - How widely have they been publicised / used? - How useful are they considered to have been? Generally, when presented with the indicators of Council of Europe Recommendation, interviewees found them useful as a potential tool to assess child participation.

How effective is legislation in supporting the implementation of participation overall? - Clarify which laws have been most /least effective; evidence of this - Examples of good / poor practice The common opinion of all interviewees is that laws and policies are in general well written, except for the fact that they do not prescribe any sanction for violation of child participatory rights. Regarding efficiency of legislation, the general opinion is that implementation is the key problem. [\u201c Our problem was always in the implementation of existing laws, procedures and strategies, not in the quality of it. Implementation is the weakest link .\u201d(NGS) []\u201c I think that there is a still a lot of work ahead of us...until full implementation when it comes to children\u2019s participation .\u201d](NGS) The main issue in terms of children\u2019s participation is a lack of adequate institutional mechanisms to include children in decision making. Children\u2019s participation is still largely based on initiatives of various non- governmental organisations. (Opinions and attitudes of children and youth in Croatia) b. What have been the main challenges and barriers to implementing this legislation and policy /developing participation in practice? How have they been addressed? There is a low level of public and professional awareness about children\u2019s participation. There is limited knowledge about the rights of the child in Croatian society in general, and among children. For example, research shows that 50% of children, in the representative sample of 503 children, aged 8 to 9, have never even heard for rights of the child (Opinions and attitudes of children and youth in Croatia). Many adults also, even professionals, when asked about children\u2019s rights, are still focused on responsibilities and duties. There is a lack of understanding of participation among the general public. Overall, in Croatian society adults and children do not fully understand the idea and purpose of child participation and are not prepared for its implementation. Many adults still believe that participation is fulfilling childrens wishes. One of the problems related to that lack of understanding is a lack of civil participation of adults. (\u201c I somehow believe that\u2019s the key problem in our society, we don\u2019t have sufficiently developed general participation, on all levels, starting from us adults, we have possibilities but people do not participate because of numerous reasons.\u201d ] (NGS) There is a lack of understanding of participation in systems that involve children.

Implementing Legislation and Policy There is a lack of systemic approach in supporting participation . Good practices of child participation are mostly present in certain local communities, where there are adults that are aware of the importance of child participation. [\u201c I\u2019m surprised to see all the things that exist...but it is all so confusing, without any order or system. \u201d (NGS)However, there is a lack of support on the national level that would enable all children in Croatia to participate.

Also, in the creation of this document, representatives of children are included. c. What is the situation of child participation in sectors that are covered by relevant legislation? National Government & overall policy-making Participation of children in the Council for Children (Vije\u0107e za djecu) is a new notion (since 2012) and the Council as had only one meeting when the present research was conducted. Children were included only in the subgroup for Participation of children, but in no other working group related to other strategic goals (Promoting child-friendly services and systems, Eliminating all forms of violence against children, Guaranteeing the rights of children in vulnerable situations). Local and regional government & services Regardless of the continuous increase of Youth Councils (Savjeti mladih), many cities and local municipalities have not established Youth Councils. The main issue is the lack of sanctions for not meeting the requirements of the law. Also, there is a certain confusion related to the interpretation of regulations for establishments, the criteria for selection of members and the activities of youth councils, in some municipalities. In some of the youth councils the representatives are members of political parties. Care sector Beneficiaries\u2019 Councils (Vije\u0107e korisnika) in children\u2019s institutions are mostly only formal, without any real participation of children or their possibility to participate in decisions related to their lives in the institution. Children are not included enough in creation of the individual plans related to their placement and treatment. Children are most often not properly informed about where they will be placed (in case of removal from the birth family, in situations when their current placement has finished etc.) Children in care also stated that their opinion is not taken in consideration when choosing a school/ occupation, which results in their lack of motivation for education.

I think that this new strategic document should really get into all pores, in all sectors that deals with children and then information, education and implementation in practice, encouraging children\u2019s activities, changing school climates...giving the opportunity to adjust in order to participate, to create something and then they will be better prepared and willing to pass this to children. It\u2019s not simple. It is easier to write it down (the strategy).\u201d] (GS) b. What support or training exists for organisations in developing appropriate child friendly participation? - types of training and what this covers The only identified training for the development of child friendly participation exists within the Union of Association of Our Children (Savez dru\u0161tava Na\u0161a djeca). All adults, who are mentors for Child Forums and Child Councils are specifically trained in the area of child rights in general and more specifically in the area of child participation. Training for mentors is organised by the Union, several times through the year. Some of the interviewees believe that there is a lack of education and training for child participation: starting from undergraduate and graduate level in university programmes for the education of professionals who work with children (e.g. teachers, social workers, pedagogues) (NGS, GS). \u201c Maybe the problem is in trainers themselves, we know that a relatively small number of people deal with children\u2019s participation (in academic and research circles)...and to be able to train or educate others, first you have to be convinced by participation....but, once you get to know the concept of participation, you become its advocate .\u201d ](NGS)) An interviewee from the Ministry of social policy and youth (Ministarstvo socijalne politike i mladih), mentioned a postgraduate study programme on Child Rights as an example of good practice. [\u201c For the first time in our country we have a postgraduate study on child rights and other postgraduate and graduate studies include topics and subjects related to the rights of the child, for example Social Work Studies (Studijski centar socijalnog rada), Faculty of Humanities (Filozofski fakultet), Faculty of Education and Rehabilitation Sciences (Edukacijsko-rehabilitacijski fakultet), but there is still space in basic education to learn about the rights of the child and child participation, through civil education. \u201d](GS) ",

Cultural attitudes towards children\u2019s participation a. Please provide an overview of the following: \uf02d Predominant attitudes towards children\u2019s participation \uf02d Drivers of positive/negative attitudes \uf02d Challenges in changing attitudes and additional legislation needed at national and EU level Predominant attitudes towards children\u2019s participation are basically characterised by the lack of awareness and knowledge in general, as well as among professionals. The participation of children is not yet recognised and respected by adults in most of the area of children\u2019s lives. On a formal level, participation is often listed as a goal, but there is, beside low awareness, also a lack of will among adults to accept children\u2019s views and opinions and to respect them. Adults often have wrong impressions about children\u2019s participation and children\u2019s needs (they are often viewed as children\u2019s wishes) and they tend to ignore the right of the children to participate. Those kinds of adult attitudes are present in the general public, but also among professionals who work with children (e.g. in schools, alternative care etc.) (see Analysis of state of child and women rights in Croatia). \u201c If we are talking about, so to say common people, I\u2019m not so surprised...I\u2019m more surprised by the attitudes of professionals. Like they do not understand the concept of children\u2019s rights...we in Child Ombudsman Office often receive questions from teachers, people that should know and live child\u2019s rights...they ask us \u201cYou only talk about child\u2019s rights, what about responsibilities?\u201d... I can just not understand that.\u201d] (NGS) One of the drivers of those kinds of negative attitudes can be attributed to a relatively low level of civil participation of adults: the main question gathered from the interviews is: if adults do not experience their rights to participation, how can they understand and support children\u2019s participation. In order to change this negative attitude among the general and professional public, the key messages about changes needed that were highlighted by the stakeholders interviewed can be summarised as follows: \uf0b7 Awareness raising campaign that will introduce and reinforce the notion of child participation \uf0b7 Citizenship education in primary and secondary schools \uf0b7 Specialized trainings of professionals working with children about children\u2019s participation and about methods of work with children to enable participation \uf0b7 Systemic research about practice of children\u2019s participation in Croatia Development of efficient institutional mechanisms that will support, protect and monitor children\u2019s participation.

To what extent has children\u2019s participation been effective in influencing /affecting change (e.g. in policy and practice)? What evidence is there for that? The overall assessment of interviewees is that child participation is effective on a local level, mostly through activities of Childrens Councils (Dje\u010dje vije\u0107e). [\u201c On a local level this makes more sense and has more impact. We have a yearlyr public session of Children\u2019s Council, where children can ask important questions. The Child Ombudsperson is also invited and other representatives from city council, media and everything is public and on the record and if the mayor promises something to the children then it is not good if he doesn\u2019t fulfil that promise. These public sessions are very useful because they oblige adults in some way.\u201d] (GS) On a national level, the only evidence of child participation is their demonstration against the state graduate exam (in 2009), when students have organised nation-wide demonstration, demanding that state graduate exam be postponed to 2010. They succeeded in this demand and the Ministry postponed the beginning of the state graduate exam. According to the general view, the impact of children\u2019s participation is more visible on a local level, especially in those local communities that are dedicated to including children in the life of the community. Examples of good practice are cities of Opatija and Velika Gorica. b. What are the most commonly accepted measures of \u2018effective\u2019 and/or \u2018meaningful\u2019 children\u2019s participation within the country? The most commonly accepted measures of \u2018effective\u2019 and/or \u2018meaningful\u2019 children\u2019s participation within the country are: \uf0b7 Practical implementation of children\u2019s suggestions, when the adults listen to children, respect their views and include them in decision making; \uf0b7 Activities with children: when adults are working together with children and not for children; \uf0b7 Activities where children are equal partners; \uf0b7 When children are prepared for participation through informal and formal education; \uf0b7 When an idea/ need/ problem is recognised/ initiated by children, they addressed adults (institutions) and the problem is solved. c. How is the effectiveness of participation monitored and evaluated , and by whom? - What are the most commonly accepted measures of effective and/ or meaningful participation? There are no official mechanisms for monitoring or evaluating participation. Most commonly accepted measures are surveys with children; providing their feedback on certain topic or giving them feedback concerning the questions they pose or needs they identify. One example of good practice was research on children\u2019s participation in children\u2019s councils in Croatia: after processing data, the research team prepared a presentation of results for children. The results were presented in joint meetings of children\u2019s councils of Croatia where children could comment on results and provide their own interpretation.

Children\u2019s Forums (Dje\u010dji forum) and Children's Councils (Dje\u010dje vije\u0107e), are the most recognised examples of good practice, mostly because their work is recognised on the local level (especially in certain local communities) and on national level (through Union of Association of Our Children (Savez dru\u0161tava Na\u0161a djecca)). Those organisations are most visible and known among general and professional public. Network of Young Councillors of the Child Ombudsperson (Mre\u017ea mladih savjetnika Pravobraniteljice za djecu). The Network has now a second generation of young councillors, elected democratically by their peers (who were youth counsellors in the first generation). Young councillors have regular meetings both on national and regional levels (they are divided into 4 regions). They communicate with each other and with the Child Ombudsperson (Pravobranitelj za djecu) througha closed forum on a daily basis.

However, when it comes to children with behavioural problems or juvenile delinquents, individual risk is most often combined with poor parental care and negative family circumstances. When in out-of-home care, children can be placed in residential care and in foster care (mainly traditional forms of foster care and to a lesser extent specialised foster care that is currently undeveloped in Croatia). Review of Out-of-Home Interventions for Children/Youth According to The Specific Acts in Croatia Act Reasons for out-of-home placement _______________________________________________________________________________ Social Welfare Act Inadequate parental care; Behavioural Problems, Special Needs Family Law Act Inadequate parental care Act Juvenile delinquency The Centre for Social Welfare (Centar za socijalnu skrb) is a focal point responsible for the placement of children in out-of-home care.

        "Evaluation of legislation, policy and practice on child participation in the European Union (EU) Country Mapping Fiche for Croatia March 2015 36 Setting / vulnerable group 1: [Children in institutional/alternative care settings] Children can have special legal guardians appointed (Family Law Act) that represent their best interest in court. Those special guardians are mostly professionals from CSW. According to the 1996 Council of Europe's European convention on the exercise of children's rights that Croatia signed in 2010, a child has the right to a special representative (lawyer) appointed by the court. The problem with this institute is that there is a lack of training or specialisation among lawyers to perform this duty. In 2010 in Croatia the care has been adopted. In accordance with this document, by 2016, the plan is to change the proportion of institutional and alternative (non-institutional) forms of care for children and youth, in favour of alternative forms (20%: 80%). Within this document special attention is given to the youngest children (0-7 years), where foster care is recognized as strategic exit strategy from the current state of care in accordance with UN Guidelines for the Alternative Care of Children). There are two scientific projects, which brought up participation of children in out-of-home placement in focus: Social-Pedagogical Diagnosis: Beneficiaries' Participation In Process Of Needs Assessment And Intervention Planning (NGS), and Children\u2019s Perspective On Foster Care . In the first project the main goal was referred to as beneficiaries\u2019 participation (children and youth at risk in the family and/or behaviour) in the process of needs assessment and intervention planning, as well as verification of capabilities and effectiveness of this approach. Project goals were divided into two major groups: the participatory and scientific goals. Participatory goals were oriented toward testing the possibilities and efficiency of the participatory work with the beneficiaries in the process of needs assessment, decision making and planning, monitoring and evaluating the interventions. One of the participatory goals was to examine whether participation increases activity, insight and responsibility of the beneficiaries. Scientific-theoretical goals sought to determine the key topics which children and youth elaborate through self-presentation, as well as to determine similarities and differences between the beneficiaries\u2019 self-presentation and experts\u2019 views of those topics. Scientific- theoretical goals of the project have been fully achieved, while the participatory goals have been achieved partially. That can be attributed to a lack of preparedness and readiness of professionals themselves, the formal organisation of the institutions (which often meant a lack of adequate space for conducting the interviews), time-consuming participatory work (preparation for an interview, an interview, a transcript of the interview, direct work on the interview, joint planning of interventions), etc. . However, the children showed interest and willingness to participate in the process of needs ",

In other words, it was shown that participatory approach gives good results for all stakeholders of the process. Children and youth gained and experienced power and a sense of importance, but also a sense of responsibility. They talked about power to influence their own life and to influence a decision-making process regarding their lives. Better understanding of themselves, better relationships and communication with professionals working with them are some of the benefits for them too. On the other hand, professionals also talked about the facilitation of communication and establishment of better relationships with children they work with, better understanding of children and sharing the responsibility with children and youth. From the text above it is obvious that children accepted this approach. That means that they want to take part in everything concerning their life. During the process of participation, it is necessary to explain the goals, purposes, roles and possibilities to them. That gives and ensures both of them (children and professionals) a framework for cooperation with clear rules, expectations, roles and responsibilities of all partners in the process. During the project, several obstacles were identified when it comes to beneficiaries' participation. Namely, some professionals showed difficulties with accepting this kind of approach. This was especially evident with practitioners working with \u201cdifficult\u201d children, clients lacking goodwill and in highly structured treatment. ",
        "Evaluation of legislation, policy and practice on child participation in the European Union (EU) Country Mapping Fiche for Croatia March 2015 38 Setting / vulnerable group 1: [Children in institutional/alternative care settings] Sometimes it was very hard to motivate practitioners even more because researchers didn't have practical experience in participatory work with children which would serve as a starting point to encourage professionals' motivation. On the contrary, practical experience in participation had to \u201cbe built\u201d together with children, practitioners and researchers. Furthermore, some professionals feared that they would lose their authority if they embraced participation. They didn't believe in some \u201cother\u201d approach than the one they were already familiar with. Professionals said they needed some additional competencies to initiate and maintain participatory approach in their work. They also stated that it is necessary that participation is a base-line of institutional philosophy and not just an approach of one or two professionals working in an institution. Summarizing the experience from the project, based on interviews with professionals who participated in the project, \u017di\u017eak (2005) concluded that participation is easier for children than for adults. For genuine and active participation of children in the intervention system, both children and adults should be equally prepared. Participation of children and young people gives good results for everyone involved, especially when taking into account the following issues: consent and willingness of all interested parties, good preparation, awareness, defining roles and expectations, and minimum technical requirements. The purpose of the second project was directly related to developing new knowledge needed to improve the quality of foster care of children. General research objective was researching and understanding foster care from the perspective of foster children and birth children of foster parents, as well as adults with experience of living in foster care as children, i.e. exploring and understanding the user\u2019s perspective. Participative goal of this research was to increase the level of children\u2019s participation in research and to \u201cmove\u201d participants from active participants toward partnership with researchers. In other words, as the involvement of participants was one of the fundamental ideas and values of this research, efforts were made during the research to raise the level of involvement of children. The key participants in this research were children (foster children and birth children of foster parents) and adults with experience of living in foster care as children. There are two general conclusions, followed by recommendations for policy and practice of out-of-home placement for children in Croatia. ",

The conclusion is based on the fact that the children, after being adequately informed about the objectives and purpose of the research, voluntarily participated in the research. As participants, the children competently, in accordance with their age and experience, described their experience of foster care and voluntarily participated in authorizing the written version of their interviews. Furthermore, the conclusion is based on the fact that some of them were interested in continued participation in the joint analysis of gathered results and guidelines. This conclusion led to following recommendations: \uf0b7 Results, conclusions and recommendations of the research should be presented to participants for discussion, expansion and finalisation. The secondary outcome of this recommendation could be a formulation and description of a model for participatory work with beneficiaries of social welfare services. \uf0b7 Children with the appropriate experience and of suitable age should be invited and engaged as consultants in the process of preparation of documents and strategies related to out-of-home child care, so that they can offer their personal opinion from their perspective and represent the interests of beneficiaries. \uf0b7 Encourage the establishment of associations, forums and similar beneficiary organisations to establish a legitimate and continuous presence of the beneficiary (children\u2019s) perspective in the public child care system. Secondly, the research identified, described and documented, through powerful statements from participants, the importance of informing children about all the key features of forms of care available to them, as well as the importance of involving children as participants in the planning and decision making in all stages of care. Children are not only good participants in research; they are primarily interested and good participants in the intervention. Research participants speak about foster care, as well as the entire system of care, in different ways according to their age and experience, but their statements still contain the emotional dimension that further indicates the importance of professionally based communication with children, i.e. the importance of conversation in the participatory sense (deciding about placement and the course of the intervention) and the intervention sense (nurturing children\u2019s memories, working on experiences, especially traumatic ones, venting emotions).

How do they work in practice? \uf0b7 What structures or forums and feedback mechanisms exist to support participation? \uf0b7 To what extent has the agenda for participation been shaped by children on their own terms? The most common form of child participation in out-of-home care is informing and consulting children when they are separated from their birth family, prior to placement in institutions or foster care. This occurs at the stage of identifying and prioritising needs. When in out-of-home care, children should be actively included in the process of individual intervention planning, but that rarely happens in practice or it is done in a very formal way In institutional care, children participate through Beneficiaries\u2019 Councils (Vije\u0107e korisnika), which are formed at each specific institution. However, the level of participation differs from one institution to other. There is no formal framework for the participation of children in those councils. In some cases, children participate more actively in research and in policy or programme design, as mentioned previously. \u201c Residential institutions do not all function in the same way, so experiences with participation are also very different. It depends also on which professionals work in certain institutions (social workers, pedagogues or people that don\u2019t have this caring profession background) and on the age of professionals .\u201d (GS) An interviewee from CSW mentioned that all children have the right to be informed and to participate in decision making processes (before placement in out-of-home care) and in the placement process, but many children do not exercise that right. The stakeholder believes that one of the reasons for this is the fact that they have \u201cnegative image\u201d of social workers and do not trust them enough. \u201c I\u2019ve noticed that children don\u2019t have enough self-confidence to call their social worker and say something...they are probably afraid. \u2018How will this \u201cauntie that takes care of me\u201d interpret my call and wishes?\u2019...there are many open questions in that field. I think that we as a profession (social workers) have this negative stigma as \u201cchild-snatchers\u201d.

On the other hand, I don\u2019t believe that their participation can change much because parents often brainwash children to say what they want them to say and very often children's statements don\u2019t reflect their real feelings. \u201d (NGS) ",

One understands the concept of children\u2019s rights, and I believe that that number of people didn\u2019t reach the critical point in our society. Most people still perceive the rights of the child as privileges and in that sense they perceive child participation as well, not as a child\u2019s right but more because some adults are nice and they ask children what do they want and think....Also, many professionals working with children also lack understanding and awareness of what child participation is . Their personal experiences and attitudes to a large extent influence their efforts regarding child participation. \u201d (NGS) \u201cThere are very few people in Croatia that are \u201cinvolved\u201d in participation issues, that are competent and have skills and resources...and one of the important resources is certainly time...to actively promote participation on a policy level. As long as participation is something that is done along the way, it is hard to expect that the progress will be fast...the value of participation should be nurtured .\u201d(NGS) At a specific level (professionals working with children), there is often a very large caseload that leaves no time and space for giving enough attention to child participation. \u201c When I started to work in CSW I was in charge of 300 cases, now I\u2019m in charge of approximately 100 cases, families. We recently calculated that we have only 9 working hours per year for one family, for the whole casework. What can you do in that time? I believe that children would participate more and perceive me differently and would be more willing to talk to me if they would see me more often .\u201d](NGS) The current position concerning participation of this group of children in Croatia is seen by stakeholders as a preparation phase for actual participation that would include all interested parties: beneficiaries, professionals, researchers, decision-makers and the general public. Until this point researchers and academics have played a crucial role by initiating projects that enabled some insights and experiences about a participatory paradigm, as well as writing and talking about participation and in that way promoting the idea and the ethics of participatory work. A perceived problem is that this so called preparation phase has already lasted a long time (since the beginning of 2000), and there is a continued lack of real interest and resources for actual participation. It seems that the idea of participation of children in care is much more developed in education and on a university level, and not so much in practice.

The bad news is that the current economic situation and general feeling of insecurity directly affects the implementation of new standards, but the good news for Croatia at this point is the support and interest on a policy level (Child's Ombudsman (Ured pravobranitelja za djecu), Ministry of Social Policy and Youth (Ministarstvo socijalne politike i mladih)).

Since then, it has taken part in the activities of the international community in the field of suppressing trafficking in human beings. The aforementioned Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, Especially Women and Children includes an internationally recognised definition of trafficking in human beings, which was fully adopted and integrated into the legislation of the Republic of Croatia (Article 175 of the Penal Code). The Republic of Croatia is also a signatory of all relevant international documents in the field of suppressing trafficking in human beings: Convention on the Rights of the Child and the Optional Protocol on the Sale of Children, Child Prostitution and Child Pornography. Special attention in the Republic of Croatia is paid to children as a particularly vulnerable and endangered group. In order to protect them from human trafficking, and to integrate the provisions of the aforementioned international documents into the national system, the Government of the Republic of Croatia adopted a National Plan for Combating Trafficking in Children, October 2005 \u2013 December 2007. Furthermore, in June 2007, the Republic of Croatia ratified the Council of Europe Convention on Action against Trafficking in Human Beings. In Croatia a national referral system has been established, as well as the National Committee for Combating Trafficking in Human Beings (Nacionalno vije\u0107e za suzbijanje trgovanja ljudima) as an umbrella body whose members are representatives of all relevant institutions in the field of combating trafficking in human beings (Ministry of Interior Affairs (Ministarstvo unutarnjih poslova), Ministry of Foreign Affairs and European Integration (Ministarstvo vanjskih poslova i europskih integracija), Ministry of Justice (Ministarstvo pravosu\u0111a), Ministry of Social Policy and Youth (Ministarstvo socijalne politike i mladih), Ministry of Finance (Ministarstvo financija), Office of the State Attorney of the Republic of Croatia (Dr\u017eavno odvjetni\u0161tvo Republike Hrvatske) and civil society organisations).

Croatia is mostly perceived as a transitory country for human trafficking, as well for trafficking children. Not many unaccompanied children stay in Croatia for longer period (GS) & Non Government Stakeholder). However, stakeholders expect that since Croatia became a Member State of the EU, the situation might change. According to official data from the Ministry of Interior of Croatia (Ministarstvo unutarnjih poslova Republike Hrvatske), during 2011 certain changes in trends were recognised: Croatia had become, to a greater extent, both a country of origin and a final destination for human trafficking. When talking about child victims of human trafficking, there are certain problems regarding the definition of \u201ctrafficked children\u201d (see Analysis of state of child and women rights in Croatia and Unaccompanied Children (Foreigners) in the Republic of Croatia. In Croatia, a common expression that is used is \u201cunaccompanied children\u201d that refers to all children foreigners caught without their parents or legal guardians. Unaccompanied children are always perceived as potential victims of human trafficking (NGS). In 2010 an independent study was conducted, commissioned by UNHCR, supported by the Government Office for Human Rights (Vladin Ured za ljudska prava), drafted and researched by the non-governmental association, Centre for New Initiatives (Centar za nove inicijative). It gathers expert views on the issues facing Croatia in addressing the protection needs of unaccompanied and separated children arriving in Croatia. The study indicates that competent State institutions, NGOs, international organisations and professionals in the country have not adequately recognised and studied the complex issues; namely the lack of coherent statistical data, the lack of coordination between the ministries and the need to establish a full strategy on how to address the growing numbers in the future. In Croatia, in 2012, over 200 unaccompanied children arrived, of whom 43 sought asylum. There has been a sharp increase in 2011 in children seeking asylum, with the Ministry of Interior reporting that between 1st January and 31st May 2011, 69 children, unaccompanied or separated arrived in Croatia. These children arrive mainly from Afghanistan, Somalia and Iran, fleeing chaotic and often dangerous situations in their countries of origin. The ",

The main problems related to children\u2019s participation, as reported in the study, are: \uf0b7 The institute of special guardian for unaccompanied children are in most cases social workers from the local CSW, that are only formally appointed but in practice judged to be inefficient in protecting child\u2019s best interests (they do not meet with the child and take care of their needs).

There are no specialised institutions or trained professionals to work with this group of children. Legislation and policy frameworks \uf0b7 What are the main legislative / policy drivers for child participation for this setting (incl. Article 12 & others) \uf0b7 Which children are covered through legislation and practice (age ranges, classifications, etc.)? \uf0b7 How effectively has the legal framework supported implementation of children\u2019s participation? Convention on the Right of the Child (articles related to participatory group of rights) Recommendation of the Child Ombudsman related to unaccompanied children (asylum seekers and immigrants).

At a local level each Centre for Social Welfare (Centar za socijalnu skrb) and institution for children or children\u2019s home is responsible for the implementation of participation rights for this group of children.

However, there are certain problems regarding the institute of special guardian. Namely, if the child is caught in a group, then one of the adults from this group can be appointed as his guardian, and the question is what is the nature of relationship between the child and the adult (it can be the person who abuses the child) and if this person will protect the best interest of the child (NGS), See Analysis of state of child and women rights in Croatia). \u201c Children often travel in the company of adults where it is unclear what kind of relationship they have with the children; they can even travel with people that are trafficking them. So, each time you have a child that is travelling without parents it is justified to assume that he/ she is a potential victim of trafficking .\u201d(NGS) There are some prominent international organisations (Croatian Red Cross (Hrvatski Crveni kri\u017e) and UNHCR Office in Zagreb (Ured Visokog povjerenika Ujednjenih naroda za izbjeglice)) and NGO\u2019s (e.g. Centre for new initiatives (Centar za nove inicijative), Autonomous Women\u2019s House (Autonomna \u017eenska ku\u0107a), Centre for Initiatives in Social Policy (Udruga za inicijative u socijalnoj politici)) that provide help and services for all victims of human trafficking, as well as for children. There are no official networks of children (unaccompanied or victims of human trafficking) in Croatia, which is mostly attributed to the fact that Croatia is a transitory country and children often do not stay here for a longer time. This is because Croatia is geographically relatively well positioned within a passage from east to west. In contrast, more developed countries in Western Europe are viewed more highly by children/ adults of migrant status ddue to their better employment prospects and social protection systems.

Certain networks are more useful for those children that are more permanently placed .\u201d (NGS) There are no special standards or training available to support participation of children in this setting/ group. One of the examples of good practice, which no longer exists, was training for special guardians for unaccompanied children (). The training was a part of the activities of the Centre for Initiatives in Social Policy (Udruga za inicijative u socijalnoj politici) in collaboration with UNHCR; it consisted of providing general information about unaccompanied children in Europe and in Croatia; principles of good practice; examples from the current Croatian practise.

How do they work in practice? \uf0b7 What structures or forums and feedback mechanisms exist to support participation? \uf0b7 To what extent has the agenda for participation been shaped by children on their own terms? The most common form of child participation in this group is informing children about their rights and services and consulting children about their wishes and needs. However, this is done only at a very general level due to the aforementioned fact that unaccompanied children do not stay very long in Croatia and that adults/ professionals are not trained to work with them (both in general and regarding their participatory rights). Also, currently there are no official structures or forums and feedback mechanisms to support participation by this group of children and they are not being included in developing the agenda on participation. The reason for that can probably be attributed to the low level of participation of children in general.

There are no official definitions of \u201cquality\u201d and \u201ceffectiveness\u201d in the sense of child participation. The participation of this specific group of children is not being monitored or evaluated and there is no evidence of more or less effective participation.

Croatia followed good practice from other countries in which children\u2019s councils and forums have longer tradition. . They were established at the turn of the century as a means to boost child participation and general involvement in the local community: using child-friendly methods, they were to encourage and develop cooperative, reciprocal relationships between children and local authorities.

The Children's Forum and the Council is aimed at all children aged 9 to 14, who can freely join and can stop attending whenever they want. The Children's Forum revolves around group activities for children, which take place in groups of around 20-25 boys and girls.
