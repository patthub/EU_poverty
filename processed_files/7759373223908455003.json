        "II (Non-legislative acts) REGULATIONS COUNCIL REGULATION (EU) No 356/2010 of 26 April 2010 imposing certain specific restrictive measures directed against certain natural or legal persons, entities or bodies, in view of the situation in Somalia THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION, Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 215 (1) and (2) thereof, Having regard to Council Decision 2010/231/CFSP of 26 April 2010 concerning restrictive measures against Somalia and repealing Common Position 2009/138/CFSP ( 1 ), Having regard to the joint proposal from the High Represen\u00ad tative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy and the European Commission, Whereas: (1) On 20 November 2008, the United Nations Security Council (hereinafter referred to as the \u2018Security Council\u2019), acting under Chapter VII of the Charter of the United Nations, adopted Resolution 1844 (2008) confirming the general and complete arms embargo against Somalia imposed by the United Nations Security Council Resolution (UNSCR) 733 (1992) and introducing addi\u00ad tional restrictive measures. (2) The additional restrictive measures concern restrictions on admission and financial restrictive measures against individuals and entities designated by the Security Council or by the United Nations Sanctions Committee established pursuant to UNSCR 751 (1992) concerning Somalia (hereinafter referred to as the \u2018Sanctions Committee\u2019). In addition to the general arms embargo, the Resolution introduces a specific prohibition on the direct and indirect supply, sale or transfer, of weapons and military equipment and a specific prohibition on the provision of related assistance and services, to individuals and entities listed by the Sanctions Committee. (3) The restrictive measures are aimed at individuals and entities designated by the United Nations (UN) as engaging in or providing support for acts that threaten the peace, security or stability of Somalia, including acts that threaten the Djibouti Agreement of 18 August 2008 or the political process, or threaten the Transitional Federal Institutions (TFIs) or the African Union Mission in Somalia (AMISOM) by force, as having acted in violation of the arms embargo and related measures, or as obstructing the delivery of humanitarian assistance to Somalia, or access to, or distribution of, humanitarian assistance in Somalia. (4) On 16 February 2009, the Council of the European Union adopted Common Position 2009/138/CFSP concerning restrictive measures against Somalia ( 2 ) which provides, inter alia, for financial restrictive measures concerning natural or legal persons, entities or bodies listed by the UN, as well as for a prohibition on the direct and indirect provision of assistance and services related to weapons and military equipment to such persons, entities or bodies. (5) On 19 March 2010, the Security Council adopted UNSCR 1916 (2010) which, inter alia, decided to ease some restrictions and obligations under the sanctions regime to enable the delivery of supplies and technical assistance by international, regional and sub-regional organisations and to ensure the timely delivery of urgently needed humanitarian assistance by the UN. (6) On 12 April 2010, the Sanctions Committee adopted the list of persons and entities which are subject to restrictive measures. EN 27.4.2010 Official Journal of the European Union L 105/1 ( 1 ) See page 17 of this Official Journal. ( 2 ) OJ L 46, 17.2.2009, p. 73. ",
        "(7) On that basis, on 26 April 2010 the Council adopted Decision 2010/231/CFSP. (8) These measures fall within the scope of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union and, therefore, notably with a view to ensuring their uniform application by economic operators in all Member States, an act of the Union is necessary in order to implement them as far as the Union is concerned. (9) Council Regulation (EC) No 147/2003 of 27 January 2003 concerning certain restrictive measures in respect of Somalia ( 1 ) imposed a general prohibition on the provision of technical advice, assistance, training, financing or financial assistance related to military activities, to any person, entity or body in Somalia. A new Council Regulation should be adopted to implement the measures concerning natural or legal persons, entities or bodies listed by the UN. (10) This Regulation respects the fundamental rights and observes the principles recognised in particular by the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union ( 2 ) and notably the right to an effective remedy and to a fair trial, the right to property and the right to the protection of personal data. This Regulation should be applied in accordance with those rights and principles. (11) This Regulation also fully respects the obligations of Member States under the Charter of the United Nations and the legally binding nature of Security Council Resolutions. (12) The power to amend the list in Annex I to this Regu\u00ad lation should be exercised by the Council, in view of the specific threat to international peace and security in the region posed by the situation in Somalia and in order to ensure consistency with the process for amending and reviewing the Annex to Council Decision 2010/231/CFSP. (13) The procedure for amending the list in Annex I to this Regulation should include providing to designated natural or legal persons, entities or bodies the reasons for their listing as transmitted by the Sanctions Committee, so as to give them an opportunity to present observations. Where observations are submitted or substantial new evidence is presented, the Council should review its decision in the light of those obser\u00ad vations and inform the person, entity or body concerned accordingly. (14) In order to create maximum legal certainty within the Union, the names and other relevant data for identifying natural or legal persons, entities or bodies whose funds and economic resources are frozen in accordance with this Regulation should be published. (15) Any processing of personal data of natural persons under this Regulation should respect Regulation (EC) No 45/2001 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 18 December 2000 on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data by the Community institutions and bodies and on the free movement of such data ( 3 ) and Directive 95/46/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 24 October 1995 on the protection of indi\u00ad viduals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data ( 4 ).

(2) On 16 February 2009, the Council adopted Common Position 2009/138/CFSP concerning restrictive measures against Somalia and repealing Common Position 2002/960/CFSP ( 2 ), implementing UNSCR 1844 (2008) which introduced restrictive measures against those who seek to prevent or block a peaceful political process, or those who threaten the Transitional Federal Institutions (TFIs) of Somalia or the African Union Mission in Somalia (AMISOM) by force, or take action that undermines stability in Somalia or in the region. (3) On 1 March 2010, the Council adopted Council Decision 2010/126/CFSP amending Common Position 2009/138/CFSP ( 3 ) and implementing UNSCR 1907 (2009) which called upon all States to inspect, in accordance with their national authorities and legislation and consistent with international law, all cargoes to and from Somalia, in their territory, including seaports and airports, if the State concerned has information that provides reasonable grounds to believe that the cargo contains items whose supply, sale, transfer or export is prohibited under the general and complete arms embargo to Somalia established pursuant to paragraph 5 of UNSCR 733 (1992) and elaborated and amended by subsequent resolutions. (4) On 19 March 2010, the United Nations Security Council (hereinafter referred to as the \u2018Security Council\u2019) adopted UNSCR 1916 (2010) which, inter alia, extended the mandate of the monitoring group referred to in paragraph 3 of UNSCR 1558 (2004) and decided to ease some restrictions and obligations under the sanctions regime to enable the delivery of supplies and technical assistance by international, regional and sub- regional organisations and to ensure the timely delivery of urgently needed humanitarian assistance by the United Nations (UN). (5) On 12 April 2010, the Sanctions Committee established by paragraph 11 of UNSCR 751 (1992) concerning Somalia (hereinafter referred to as the \u2018Sanctions Committee\u2019) adopted the list of persons and entities which are subject to restrictive measures. (6) For the sake of clarity, the measures imposed by Common Position 2009/138/CFSP as amended by Council Decision 2010/126/CFSP and the exemptions provided for in UNSCR 1916 (2010) should be inte\u00ad grated into a single legal instrument. (7) Common Position 2009/138/CFSP should therefore be repealed. (8) This Decision respects the fundamental rights and observes the principles recognised in particular by the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union ( 4 ) and notably the right to an effective remedy and to a fair trial, the right to property and the right to the protection of personal data. This Decision should be applied in accordance with those rights and principles. (9) This Decision also fully respects the obligations of Member States under the Charter of the United Nations and the legally binding nature of Security Council Resolutions.

        "COMMISSION DECISION of 26 April 2010 setting up the Expert Group on a Common Frame of Reference in the area of European contract law (2010/233/EU) THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION, Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, Whereas: (1) The European Council at Tampere in October 1999 requested the Commission to study the need to harmonise legislation in the area of substantive civil law. (2) The Commission issued a Communication on European contract law ( 1 ) in 2001 with the purpose of launching a process of consultation on potential problems and actions in the area of contract law, the responses to which indicated a clear consensus on the need to improve the consistency of the existing Union contract law legislation in order to ensure its uniform application and a smooth functioning of the internal market. (3) The Commission issued an action plan entitled \u2018A more coherent European contract law\u2019 ( 2 ) in 2003 which proposed to improve the quality and coherence of Union contract law legislation through the establishment of a Common Frame of Reference, which would provide the Union with a non-binding reference tool containing principles, definitions and model rules to be used for the revision of existing Union legislation and the preparation of new legislation in the area of contract law. (4) As a preparatory measure, the Commission financed in 2005, through a grant under the 6th Framework Programme for Research, a European academic network of researchers to carry out in-depth legal research which led to an academic Draft Common Frame of Reference (hereinafter referred to as \u2018the Draft Common Frame of Reference\u2019). (5) The Stockholm Programme for 2010-2014 invites the Commission to submit a proposal on a Common Frame of Reference in the area of European contract law which should be a non-binding set of fundamental principles, definitions and model rules to be used by the lawmakers at Union level to ensure greater coherence and quality in the lawmaking process. (6) The Europe 2020 strategy for smart, sustainable and inclusive growth ( 3 ) recognises the need to make it easier and less costly for businesses and consumers to conclude contracts with partners in other EU countries, inter alia, by making progress towards an optional European Contract Law. (7) It is therefore necessary to set up a group of experts in the area of civil law, and in particular contract law, and to define its tasks and its structure. (8) The group should assist the Commission in preparing a proposal for a Common Frame of Reference in the area of European contract law, including consumer and business contract law, using the Draft Common Frame of Reference as a starting point and taking into consideration other research work conducted in this area as well as the Union acquis . The group should, in particular, help the Commission select those parts of the Draft Common Frame of Reference which are of direct or indirect relevance for contract law, and restructure, revise and supplement the selected contents. (9) The group should be composed of highly qualified experts with competence in the area of civil law, and in particular contract law, appointed in a personal capacity. (10) Rules on disclosure of information by members of the group should be provided for, without prejudice to the Commission\u2019s rules on security as set out in the Annex to Commission Decision 2001/844/EC, ECSC, Euratom ( 4 ). (11) Personal data relating to members of the group should be processed in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 45/2001 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 18 December 2000 on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data by the Community institutions and bodies and on the free movement of such data ( 5 ).

Article 2 Task The group\u2019s task shall be to assist the Commission in the prep\u00ad aration of a proposal for a Common Frame of Reference in the area of European contract law, including consumer and business contract law, and in particular in: (a) selecting those parts of the Draft Common Frame of Reference which are of direct or indirect relevance to contract law; and (b) restructuring, revising and supplementing the selected contents of the Draft Common Frame of Reference, taking also into consideration other research work conducted in this area as well as the Union acquis . Article 3 Consultation The Commission may consult the group on any matter relating to the preparation of a proposal for a Common Frame of Reference in the area of European contract law. Article 4 Membership \u2014 Appointment 1. The group shall be composed of up to 20 members. 2.

        "COMMISSION DECISION of 26 April 2010 granting Luxembourg a partial derogation from Decision 2006/66/EC concerning the technical specification for interoperability relating to the subsystem \u2018rolling stock \u2014 noise\u2019 of the trans- European conventional rail system and from Decision 2006/861/EC concerning the technical specification of interoperability relating to the subsystem \u2018rolling stock \u2014 freight wagons\u2019 of the trans-European conventional rail system (notified under document C(2010) 2546) (Only the French text is authentic) (2010/234/EU) THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION, Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, Having regard to Directive 2008/57/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 17 June 2008 on the inter\u00ad operability of the rail system within the Community ( 1 ), and in particular Article 9 thereof, Having regard to the request submitted by Luxembourg on 23 September 2009, Whereas: (1) In accordance with Article 9(1)(d) of Directive 2008/57/EC, on 23 September 2009 Luxembourg submitted a request for partial derogation from Commission Decision 2006/66/EC ( 2 ) (TSI Noise) and from Commission Decision 2006/861/EC ( 3 ) (TSI Freight Wagons), for wagons type NA and AFA of LOHR company. (2) The request for derogation concerns freight wagons used to transport road trucks over rail which are manufactured according to a design that existed before the entry into force of both TSIs. (3) In accordance with Article 15 of Regulation (EC) No 881/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council ( 4 ), the European Railway Agency provided its technical opinion on the request for partial derogation on 16 December 2009. (4) The opinion indicates that the provisions of six sections of TSI Freight Wagons describing draw gear, lifting and jacking, equipment attachment, kinematic gauge, vehicle dynamic behaviour and parking brake (respectively in Sections 4.2.2.1.2.2, 4.2.2.3.2.4, 4.2.2.3.2.5, 4.2.3.1, 4.2.3.4 and 4.2.4.1.2.8) cannot be applied to the wagons concerned due to their construction constraints implied by specialised kind of transported commodity. Regarding TSI Noise, the wagons in question have to use, in combination with composite brake blocks, also louder cast iron blocks in order to achieve required braking performances. Therefore until more silent tech\u00ad nology is in place the limits for pass-by noise (Section 4.2.1.1 of the TSI) cannot be met. (5) The overall economical impact of application of the two TSIs, and more specifically of Sections 4.2.3.1 and 4.2.3.4 of TSI Freight Wagons, to the wagons type NA and AFA of LOHR company is estimated to almost EUR 204 million. This amount together with other requirements that would need to be applied to comply with the TSIs would not only heavily compromise the economical viability of the project but also seriously delay or bring to a halt its implementation. (6) The derogation is granted for a limited period of time that should be used by Luxembourg to accelerate the development of innovative solutions promoted by the harmonised specifications and compliant with the TSIs in question. (7) The provisions of this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Committee set up by Article 29 of Directive 2008/57/EC, HAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION: Article 1 The partial derogation from TSI Noise and TSI Freight Wagons requested by Luxembourg on 23 September 2009 for LOHR wagons type NA and AFA in accordance with Article 9(1)(d) of Directive 2008/57/EC is granted with the following limitations: (a) with regard to provisions of Section 4.2.1.1 of the TSI Noise, for as long as no technical solution to achieve compliance is available; (b) with regard to provisions of Sections 4.2.2.1.2.2, 4.2.2.3.2.4, 4.2.2.3.2.5 (type NA only), 4.2.3.1, 4.2.3.4, 4.2.4.1.2.8 of the TSI Freight Wagons, until the revised decision on TSI Freight Wagons enters into force.
