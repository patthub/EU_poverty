        "ExEcutivE summary 7 E xecutive summar y Introduction How can data on subjective well-being \u2013 how people perceive the quality of their lives \u2013 be used in policy? And are such data relevant in the context of the economic challenges that Europe is currently facing? This report draws out new policy-relevant findings from the third wave of Eurofound\u2019s European Quality of Life Survey (EQLS), conducted in 2011\u20132012. It shows how data on well-being can help policymakers identify the groups and countries that are bearing the brunt of the economic cri- sis, as well as those that are holding out better than expected, and provides a new layer of evidence to aid policy decisions. The report compares countries and groups across the then 27 EU Member States, identifying the determinants of well- being and the factors that might protect individuals from low well-being. It also looks at how subjective well-being has changed between 2007 and 2011 in the EU as a whole and in individual Member States. The report goes beyond the use of reported life satisfaction to consider a full range of subjective well-being concepts, including hedonic well-being (short-term feelings), eudaimonic well-being (how well people are function- ing in their lives) and satisfaction with different aspects of life. Policy context Policymakers need to get a picture of the real impact of the crisis on people\u2019s lives. There is a sense that the crisis has deepened inequalities and has had a greater impact on groups that are already vulnerable in society \u2013 is this borne out in the well-being data? Many have argued that new indicators are part of the pack- age needed to help get out of the current crisis and to prevent another one happening. The 2009 Communication from the European Commission \u2018GDP and beyond: Measuring pro- gress in a changing world\u2019 calls for a more holistic approach to measurement, including the measurement of well-being, and a greater focus on the distribution of resources and outcomes between social and economic groups, and between regions. The EQLS data are key to informing such a debate. Key findings \u2022 Well-being is highest in the social democratic countries of northern Europe (Denmark, Finland, the Netherlands and Sweden), and lowest in Bulgaria, Greece, Hungary, Latvia and Romania. While well-being correlates with GDP per capita, several countries achieve higher well-being than would be expected based on GDP alone. \u2022 Almost all countries have low well-being on at least one measure. For example, despite overall high well-being, the UK has the lowest levels of vitality and neighbourhood belonging. Estonia and Latvia have the lowest levels of health satisfaction. \u2022 The population groups that stand out as having low well- being include those limited by illness or disability, unemployed people, those who are separated or divorced, and individuals in the middle age bracket (35\u201349 years). \u2022 Cyprus, Hungary and Romania have the greatest levels of overall well-being inequality, with Germany and the UK not far behind. The analysis identified which well- being inequalities were sharpest in different countries. For example, the well-being gap between those with high and those with low incomes was greatest in Bulgaria, while the biggest gender gaps were in Cyprus, Portugal and Romania. \u2022 While life satisfaction increased marginally between 2007 and 2011, happiness has fallen and perceived social exclu- sion has increased, indicating that well-being has indeed stagnated during the crisis. Importantly there are different regional patterns, with the European average being elevated by increases in the newer Member States such as Bulgaria and Romania. \u2022 Where there have been increases in well-being, particularly in the Baltic states, Ireland, southern Europe and the UK, they have been enjoyed by those in the highest income quartiles. Conversely, the largest falls in well-being were experienced by those in the bottom income quartile. ",
        "SUBJECTIVE WELL-BEING 8 \u2022 The strongest predictors of well-being were material dep- rivation, health, work\u2013life balance and lack of time, and satisfaction with public services. \u2022 The predictors varied according to the measure being used. For example, the strongest predictor of loneliness was being widowed, while the strongest predictor of stress was work\u2013 life balance. \u2022 The predictors also varied between country clusters used in this study. Health was the single most important deter- minant of life satisfaction in the social democratic cluster. Public service satisfaction was the second most important determinant in southern Europe. More detailed analysis revealed some surprising results. \u2022 Social aspects of deprivation, such as not being able to invite guests over, were the most important in the index of deprivation created using the EQLS. \u2022 The most important detrimental impact of housing on life satisfaction was not feeling secure that one could stay in one\u2019s house. \u2022 Temporary employment contracts of less than 12 months were particularly detrimental to life satisfaction, while those of 12 months or over had no significant negative impact. \u2022 Face-to-face contact with friends had a strong impact on well-being, while indirect contact (by phone or email) had almost no positive impact. \u2022 When other factors are controlled for, people in rural areas have higher well-being than those in urban areas. Policy pointers \u2022 The data stress the importance of paying particular atten- tion to several groups \u2013 those limited by disabilities or ill health, unemployed people and middle-aged people. They also send out warning signals for several countries that have low or falling well-being \u2013 Estonia, Greece and Sweden all having notable declines. \u2022 Positive lessons can be drawn from some countries. Aside from the usual focus on Scandinavian countries, Poland has higher life satisfaction than many of its neighbours, while Spain (at least in 2011) appeared to be holding up, despite the crisis, in terms of average well-being and low well-being inequality. \u2022 From the perspective of increasing well-being, the data make it quite clear what the policy priorities are \u2013 reducing poverty and deprivation, tackling unemployment, integrating people with disabilities, addressing work\u2013life balance and maintaining the quality of public services. \u2022 The data also highlight the importance of protecting social networks and relationships. This implies, for example, con- sidering the unintended social consequences associated with increasing geographical labour mobility, or the fall- ing social cohesion and trust associated with increased inequality. \u2022 Working conditions have an effect on well-being \u2013 moving employees from short-term to permanent contracts would have a bigger impact on well-being than moving unem- ployed people into short-term contracts. Tackling overwork would increase well-being. \u2022 Local governments in urban areas could look to rural areas to identify what is providing them with a well-being advan- tage. Access to green space and community are likely to play a role. Meanwhile, rural policy should ensure there are still employment opportunities available to allow people to live in rural areas. \u2022 Physical activity contributes to well-being \u2013 possible inter- ventions to increase it include greater inclusion in school curricula and broadening active travel opportunities. \u2022 Being in debt is negatively associated with well-being for all respondents, but particularly for those on low incomes, highlighting the need for protective measures.

        "introduction 9 1 Based on GDP per capita, purchasing power parity (PPP) and World Development Indicators. 2 Eurostat data, February 2013. 3 Based on EQLS data from 2007 and 2011. 4 L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Andor, speaking at the seminar \u2018Policies for a well-being driven economic agenda for Europe\u2019, Budapest, 5 March 2013. Introduction At the time of writing, Europe continued to face a crisis the scale of which has not been seen since the end of World War II. In 2011, the gross domestic product (GDP) per capita of 22 out of the then 27 EU Member States was below 2008 levels, 1 and unemployment rates were higher than in 2008 in 25 out of the 27 countries. 2 Public debt has become a critical issue in many countries. These economic problems have led to growing dissatisfaction with ruling elites. In many countries, recent elections have been marked by falling support for major political parties and a simultaneous rise in newer, anti-estab- lishment parties. In some countries, particularly Greece and Spain, this discontent has manifested itself in social unrest. Unsurprisingly, all this has been accompanied with a significant decline in people\u2019s optimism about the future. 3 This report considers the impact of the crisis on the experienced well-being of Europeans. Many socioeconomic indicators have demonstrated worrying trends, but, as the European Com- missioner for the Directorate General for Employment, Social Affairs and Inclusion (DG EMPL) highlighted, the focus needs to be on the following questions. What has been \u2018the real impact on people\u2019s lives\u2019? 4 Who has been hit hardest? Where have there been surprisingly positive well-being patterns? What do the inequalities in well-being look like? What are the factors that explain the variation in well-being across Europe? What find- ings provide policy pointers as to how to increase, or at least stem the fall in, well-being in the coming years? The report uses data from Eurofound\u2019s third European Quality of Life Survey (EQLS), which interviewed respondents in all 27 EU countries in 2011\u20132012. Comparisons are also made with the previous wave of the survey, conducted in 2007. Unsurprisingly, experienced well-being has indeed fallen in many countries within Europe. However, falls in many western European countries have been matched by increases in well- being in eastern European countries. The results also show: \u2022 material deprivation is the strongest predictor of many aspects of experienced well-being; \u2022 other key factors include health, work\u2013life balance and per- sonal relationships; \u2022 several factors may \u2018protect\u2019 against the negative impact of low income or bad health, which are known to influence experienced well-being \u2013 these include personal solvency, job security and family relationships; \u2022 inequalities in experienced well-being are large; in many countries, the 20% of the population with the highest lev- els of well-being report a sense of life satisfaction over six points higher than the 20% of the population with the low- est levels of well-being, on a scale of 1\u201310; \u2022 in many countries, the gap in well-being between the wealthiest and the poorest members of the population has grown during the crisis. Well-being in a time of crisis The question arises as to whether it is right to look at well- being in a time of economic crisis? Surely policymakers should focus efforts for now on returning to economic growth. This is indeed the position of some (Thiry et al, 2013). However, there are several reasons why the new science of well-being may be more relevant than ever before. First, it is important to monitor for low levels of well-being, so as to identify those population groups that require targeted pro- tection. This need may not always be apparent simply through the use of economic indicators. Secondly, well-being analysis might help identify areas or popu- lation groups that have higher well-being than expected, which might provide policy lessons that could be replicated for other population groups, or lead to general policy recommendations. Thirdly, analysing well-being can help quantify and compare the differential impacts on well-being of different aspects of life, thereby informing debate on policy trade-offs. For example, what aspects of housing are most important to well-being? What are the relative effects on well-being of poor working conditions versus unemployment? In general, what are the most important factors that determine well-being? Such trade- offs are likely to become particularly acute from now on, given the lack of a clear path to the rates of economic growth that Europe saw pre-2008. In the context of constrained fiscal space, governments may have to get smarter about the ways in which they seek to ensure the well-being of their populations. ",
        "SUBJECTIVE WELL-BEING 10 5 The Lisbon Treaty also refers to \u2018Promoting \u2026 peace and the well-being of the Union\u2019s peoples\u2019 as among \u2018the main objectives of the Union\u2019. These three questions \u2013 who is doing badly, who is doing bet- ter than expected and what are the trade-offs between policy goals \u2013 are questions being asked by senior officials at the European Commission. The findings drawn together in this report will seek to start answering them. But it is important to acknowledge that there are several rea- sons why policy decisions cannot be made on the basis of the various findings discussed in this report alone. First, the findings from the EQLS are based on cross-sectional analysis. For example, the results can demonstrate that married people are happier than single people, but this on its own does not mean that getting married will make single people happier. Fortunately though, in many cases, other research using panel data has been able to demonstrate such longitudinal changes (for example, Lucas et al, 2003). Secondly, this report only looks at the direct effects on individuals. Richer people may have higher well-being, but studies on relative income have highlighted that one person\u2019s increase in income comes at the expense of everyone else\u2019s relative income declining (Clark et al, 2008). Thirdly, the study does not look at indirect or lagged (long-term) effects. It may be that policies that are good for well-being in the short term might lead to other outcomes that, in the long term, harm well-being within a country. Finally, the analysis does not consider the effect of policies on other desir- able outcomes, such as reducing environmental pressures or improving international relations. The first of these four issues can, at least theoretically, be resolved through the collection of more well-being data. How- ever, the remaining three require well-being analysis to be brought together with other kinds of analyses, modelling and of course consideration of trade-offs. Rise of well-being in Europe Well-being is cited as early as 1993 in the Treaty on the Euro- pean Union (also known as the Maastricht Treaty). However, it was not until 2006 that it began to appear more explicitly in EU policy rhetoric, when the European Sustainable Development Strategy cited the well-being of present and future generations as its central objective (see Figure 1 for a timeline) (Council of the European Union, 2006). 5 In response, Eurostat commis- sioned work in 2007 to scope out the feasibility of well-being indicators at the European level (Eurostat, 2009). Figure 1: Key well-being events in Europe EU Sustainable Development Strategy Communication \u2018GDP and beyond\u2019 Stiglitz Commission, final report Eurostat \u2018Feasibility study\u2019 for well-being indicators OECD Measuring and fostering the progress of societies conference, Istanbul Beyond GDP conference DGINS Sofia Memorandum UK \u2018Measuring National Well-Being Programme\u2019 announced Eurostat/INSEE Sponsorship Group reports SILC Well-being module approved Eurostat \u2018Quality of life indicators\u2019 web page online 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 Note: DGINS = Directors General of the National Statistical Institutes Well-being has been a central element of the \u2018Beyond GDP\u2019 agenda, which arose in recognition of the shortcomings of GDP as a measure of human welfare. The agenda was launched in the EU with a major conference in the European Parliament in 2007, and in 2009 the European Commission produced a Communication entitled \u2018GDP and beyond: Meas- uring progress in a changing world\u2019, which provides a road map for new areas of measurement. It concludes, \u2018ultimately, national and EU policies will be judged on whether they are successful in delivering [social, economic and environmental] goals and improving the well-being of Europeans\u2019 (European Commission, 2009). Shortly afterwards, a commission set up by then French President Nicolas Sarkozy, and headed by Nobel prize-winning economist Joseph Stiglitz, made a set of widely heeded recommendations, notably a \u2018shift in emphasis from measuring economic production to measuring people\u2019s well-being\u2019 (Stiglitz et al, 2009, p. 12). ",
        "introduction 11 6 http://www.brainpoolproject.eu 7 The conference was part of another FP7 project called e-Frame. For more information, visit http://www.eframeproject.eu. The work of this commission is seen to have been pivotal in the recognition of the policy importance of well-being (H\u00e1k et al, 2012). Subsequent to its formation, Eurostat, in conjunction with the French National Institute of Statistics and Economic Studies (INSEE), set up the Sponsorship Group on Measuring Progress, Sustainable Development and Well-Being. In 2013, Eurostat published an online set of quality of life indicators, including some subjective well-being items from the EQLS (Eurostat, 2013). Meanwhile, the EU Statistics on Income and Living Conditions (EU-SILC), the main social survey coordi- nated by Eurostat, added a well-being module in 2013. In 2012, a stock take of subjective well-being measurement in the EU found 11 countries with official national surveys that included subjective well-being, including France, Germany, Italy, Poland and the UK (Abdallah and Mahony, 2012). In total, 32 official or semi-official surveys were found incorporating subjective well-being measures in Europe. These range from small-scale surveys with samples of little over 1,000, to the UK\u2019s Annual Population Survey which, from 2011 onwards, includes data on subjective well-being for 160,000 respond- ents each year. In recent years, attention has begun to move from the meas- urement of well-being to its use to inform policy, a process that includes this report. In the EU, this question was central to the Well-Being in 2030 project set up by the European Policy Cen- tre and funded by DG EMPL. It is also the central question of the Commission\u2019s FP7 project BRAINPOoL (Bringing Alterna- tive Indicators into Policy) funded by the Directorate General for Research and Innovation (DG RES). 6 Recent conferences on well-being have placed a growing emphasis on its relevance for policy. For example, the European conference on \u2018Measuring well-being and fostering the progress of societies\u2019, organised by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Develop- ment (OECD) in Paris in June 2012, concluded with a round table on \u2018well-being policy frameworks\u2019. 7 In the OECD\u2019s recent Guidelines on measuring subjective well-being , an entire chap- ter is devoted to policy uses (OECD, 2013). Consideration of the potential for subjective well-being meas- urement to be used in policymaking and evaluation has been particularly developed in the UK, where several government ministries, including the Department for Transport, Commu- nities and Local Government, the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills (Foresight Mental Capital and Wellbeing Project, 2008) and the Department of Health (2009), have dedi- cated efforts to using well-being data. In addition, a team within the UK Cabinet Office (which coordinates different ministries) is charged with helping and encouraging civil servants to do more in this area (UK Civil Service website). Other policy agendas in the EU One of the challenges of using well-being analysis in policy is that there is no such thing as \u2018well-being policy\u2019. As this report will show, well-being evidence is relevant for a range of policy areas, from economic to environment policy, and from health to housing policy. Indeed one of the main arguments for using well-being evidence in policy is that it provides a more holistic perspective, encouraging policymakers to pay greater atten- tion to the positive and negative impacts of all policy areas on people\u2019s lives in general (Michaelson et al, 2009). Given this holistic approach, this section of the report briefly notes some of the main EU priorities and policy areas for which well-being evidence may be relevant. \u2022 Europe 2020 strategy (European Commission, 2010): Alongside growth, sustainability and innovation, the strategy gives the EU a renewed focus on social issues and inclusion. One of its five headline goals includes poverty reduction, and new \u2018at risk of poverty\u2019 indicators have been developed to monitor progress towards this goal. The other four headline goals include increasing employment rates, active ageing, broadening tertiary education and reducing emissions. \u2022 Social Investment Package (European Commission, 2013): A series of communications have been produced on the challenges in implementing European Social Funds to achieve social investment and cohesion. Encouraging peo- ple to enter, and stay in, the labour force is central. There is also interest in getting workers into the healthcare and long- term care sectors; other important elements of the package are child poverty and well-being and homelessness. \u2022 Youth Employment Package (European Commission, 2012c): High youth unemployment rates (21% in Europe overall and up to 50% in Spain and Greece in 2013) have spurred interest in developing youth guarantee schemes to help young people to avoid the scarring effects of unemployment. Several of the Commission\u2019s DGs also have a specific interest in well-being or related issues. \u2022 DG Employment, Social Affairs and Inclusion has perhaps the most obvious interest in well-being. As well as the Social Investment Package and Youth Employment Package, the DG lists as priorities working time and active ageing. \u2022 DG Regional and Urban Policy is developing its own well- being indicators to help in directing the large funds it administers: regional development, cohesion and accession. It is also taking a particular interest in youth unemployment. \u2022 DG Environment was the first to move into the Beyond GDP and well-being agenda, sustainable development being linked to well-being now and in the future (Council of the European Union, 2006). In terms of well-being, current focuses include a review of EU air quality policy, as well as water and waste legislation. ",
        "SUBJECTIVE WELL-BEING 12 \u2022 DG Agriculture and Rural Development describes its mission in its 2013 Management Plan as follows: \u2018to ensure the well-being of \u2026 rural areas\u2019. Its objectives include ensuring jobs and quality of life in the countryside (European Com- mission, 2012a). Meanwhile, it is worth bearing in mind the context of the Multi- annual Financial Framework 2014\u20132020 agreed upon by the Member States in February 2013. The framework sets the budget for the EU until 2020, which, for the first time, will be smaller than the previous one. Cuts are expected to affect the European Social Fund in particular. What is subjective well-being? The Encyclopaedia of Quality of Life and Well-being Research defines subjective well-being as: The personal perception and experience of positive and negative emotional responses and global and specific cognitive evaluations of satisfaction with life. \u2026 Simply, SWB [subjective well-being] is the individual evaluation of quality of life. (Proctor, in press) Subjective well-being is occasionally referred to in this report as experienced well-being to highlight that it reflects people\u2019s experiences of their lives. Table 1, which is based on a classi- fication by Dutch sociologist Ruut Veenhoven, illustrates that subjective well-being is subjective in two senses, in terms of what is being measured and how it is being measured. Self- reported housing satisfaction is used as an example here. Table 1: Two dimensions of subjectivity Objective substance Subjective substance Objective measurement objective assess- ment of overcrowding based on number of rooms and number of people living in the home. How long individual stays in the house before moving. Subjective measurement assessment of accommodation (for example, whether the home is over- crowded). self-reported housing satisfac- tion. Source: Veenhoven, 2002 As Table 1 shows, self-reported housing satisfaction is sub- jective both because it involves a subjective measurement (asking someone in a survey), and because the thing being assessed is itself subjective (it is someone\u2019s opinion). What is being assessed is not the individual\u2019s home, but the individual\u2019s perception of that home. Consider a respondent who lives in a large comfortable house, but indicates that they are dissatisfied with it. The data showing that the respondent is not satisfied with the home are not incorrect, unless the respondent has chosen to lie in the survey. If they feel dissatisfied, then they are dissatisfied. Perhaps they are just hard to please, but perhaps there is indeed something unpleasant about the house that the analysis has not been able to identify using objective data. A key element of subjective well-being is, therefore, that the substance of the thing being assessed is subjective. As such, subjective well-being is best assessed subjectively, through surveys. As Helliwell and Wang outlined in the World Happi- ness Report : The most fundamental indicator of your happiness is how happy YOU feel, not whether others see you smiling, your family thinks you are happy, or you have all the presumed material advantages of a good life. (Helliwell and Wang, 2012, p. 21) Another key element is that measuring subjective well-being means evaluating something that can be unequivocally \u2018good\u2019 or \u2018bad\u2019. Asking someone whether they feel old or young is also a subjective measurement of a subjective substance, but there is no inherently \u2018good\u2019 or preferable answer. It is not \u2018better\u2019 to be either young or old. A third key element is that subjective well-being measures assess something about the life of an individual. Satisfaction with the economic situation of a country may be an important determinant of subjective well-being, but it is not a measure of subjective well-being because it is an assessment of some- thing quite external to the respondent. Finally, this study argues that good measurement of subjective well-being assesses concepts that are general and universally desirable and important. About this report This report is based on the most interesting and policy-rele- vant findings that come from analysis of the latest EQLS. After presenting some information on the well-being framework and methodology used in Chapter 1, Chapters 2 and 3 describe the pattern of well-being in Europe. Chapter 2 presents the ",
        "introduction 13 differences between countries in subjective well-being, while Chapter 3 focuses on differences between population groups, and looks more broadly at well-being inequality. Chapter 4 goes beyond the descriptive, using statistical analyses to attempt to identify the determinants of high and low well- being. Results are structured according to Eurostat\u2019s eight quality of life domains (Eurostat, 2013). Chapter 5 explores a few protective factors that appear to mitigate the negative effects on well-being of low income, unemployment and poor health. In Chapter 6, data from the second round of the EQLS are used to consider how well-being has changed between 2007 and 2011. Chapter 7 draws out the policy implications of the analysis chapters, structuring them based on policy area, rather than type of analysis. This report is one of a series of reports by Eurofound to exam- ine the results from the third EQLS. These include the overview report Quality of life in Europe: Impacts of the crisis (Eurofound, 2012b) and reports on: \u2022 subjective well-being; \u2022 social inequalities; \u2022 quality of society and public services; \u2022 trends in quality of life in Europe (2003\u20132012).

        "SUBJECTIVE WELL-BEING 16 Methodology This chapter outlines the data and techniques used in this report. It first provides a framework for conceptualising subjec- tive well-being and its three main aspects \u2013 hedonic well-being, evaluative well-being and eudaimonic well-being. Then it intro- duces the main data source, the EQLS, and identifies the questions used to measure subjective well-being. The chap- ter concludes with a brief note on the methodologies used and the data used to explain the variations in subjective well-being. Aspects of subjective well-being Over the past 60 years, several approaches to measuring sub- jective well-being have emerged. While these approaches were originally often seen in opposition to one another, consensus has recently emerged around three main approaches that are complementary to one another, and that they should be used together to provide a rounded picture of well-being (ONS, 2011; Eurostat, 2013; OECD, 2013). \u2022 hedonic well-being \u2013 Also called \u2018affect\u2019, this refers to people\u2019s day-to-day feelings and moods. Both positive and negative feelings are measured, and it has been found that the two are not entirely correlated (Diener et al, 1985). Typi- cally, surveys ask respondents to answer questions that refer to relatively short time periods, for example a day or a week, so as to aid recall. While this means that such measures may suffer from substantial temporal variability \u2013 as people\u2019s mood will go up and down from day to day \u2013 large sample sizes and good survey design (not interviewing everyone on a Monday, for example) should ensure that this does not systematically bias population estimates. Indeed, some studies suggest that those hedonic measures, where respondents are not asked to recall how they have felt over long periods of time, may be the most resistant to cultural biases in response (Krueger et al, 2009). \u2022 Evaluative well-being \u2013 Respondents are expected to pro- vide a more cognitively influenced judgement, weighing up different aspects of their lives. The most regularly used ques- tion asks people to report how satisfied they are with their life as a whole nowadays, thereby not fixing a tight time frame. Another common question asks respondents to position them- selves on a ladder with the top of the ladder representing the best possible life. Such questions have intuitive appeal, as they explicitly ask respondents to provide an overall assessment, but they also implicitly bring in relative effects, as satisfaction is likely to be judged against expectations. There is a risk that someone reporting being satisfied is only so because they have low expectations (Michalos, 1985). \u2022 Eudaimonic well-being \u2013 Less commonly incorporated into large-scale surveys, questions designed to gain infor- mation on this form of well-being ask respondents about a range of concepts believed to be important to well-being, such as sense of autonomy, relationships, meaning and self-esteem. Eudaimonic approaches draw on a tradition dating back to Aristotle, through various psychological and humanistic theories (for example, Deci and Ryan, 1980; Keyes, 2002; Seligman, 2011; Huppert and So, 2013), and evidence demonstrating universal relevance of the factors measured. Sometimes they are understood as precondi- tions to well-being (as measured by evaluative and hedonic approaches); sometimes they are seen as part of well-being itself. The new economics foundation (nef) has argued that measuring eudaimonic well-being provides a more textured approach to well-being analysis, leading more naturally to policy conclusions and ensuring that well-being is not considered to be only about being happy (Centre for Well- Being, 2011). The Dynamic Model of Well-being developed by nef in 2008 sees eudaimonic well-being, or \u2018flourishing\u2019, as being a direct outcome of the interaction between one\u2019s external conditions, personal resources and social relations (Thompson and Marks, 2008; see adaptation as a working model in Figure 2). In turn, eudaimonic well-being, particularly when framed as the ability of individuals to meet their psychological needs, is theorised to lead to hedonic well-being (Ryan et al, 2008; see also Boulanger et al, 2011). An individual\u2019s experience of hedonic well-being, and their ability to flourish, can then be expected to determine how they respond to evaluative well-being questions (albeit through a filter of their memory and how their experience compares with their expectations). All three approaches can be measured using the EQLS.

European Quality of Life Survey The EQLS is conducted by the European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions (Eurofound), a tripartite European Union Agency founded in 1975 to con- tribute to the planning and design of better living and working conditions in Europe. Eurofound brings together stakeholders from three different realms \u2013 employer groups, trade unions and policymakers. The first EQLS was conducted in 2003 and the second in 2007; the third and most recent round was completed in 2011\u20132012. The third EQLS covers the 27 European Union Member States as at the time of the survey, as well as seven other European candidate or pre-accession countries (which also included Croatia). The minimum sample size for each country was 1,000, with larger samples for the seven most populous nations in Europe. The survey is designed to allow representative estimates at the national level, covering the pop- ulation aged 18 or over. 8 Interviews are conducted face to face. The first round of the survey was accompanied by a concept paper presenting Eurofound\u2019s understanding of quality of life (Eurofound, 2003). More information can be found in the third EQLS overview report (Eurofound, 2012b). The third EQLS includes 26 questions that directly assess subjective well-being, as well as a unique combination of questions on a full range of quality of life areas that can be expected to influence subjective well-being. Table 2 lists the well-being questions in the 2011 survey, identifies the concepts they purport to measure, categorises them according to the three types of well-being (evaluative, hedonic or eudaimonic), and indicates whether the question was also included in the 2007 survey. Precise question wording can be seen in the questionnaire. 9 Table 2: Subjective well-being: List and categorisation of subjective well-being items in the third EQLS questionnaire Item Concept Well-being category In 2007 survey Q29a i am optimistic about the future optimism (general) Eudaimonic \uf0fc Q29b i generally feel that what i do in life is worthwhile Feeling worthwhile Eudaimonic Q29c i feel i am free to decide how to live my life autonomy Eudaimonic Q29d in my daily life, i seldom have time to do the things i really enjoy time pressure Eudaimonic Q29e i feel left out of society social exclusion \u2013 left out of society Eudaimonic \uf0fc Q29f life has become too complicated today that i almost can\u2019t find my way social exclusion \u2013 life is too com- plicated Eudaimonic \uf0fc Q29g i feel the value of what i do is not recognised by others social exclusion \u2013 not recognised Eudaimonic \uf0fc Q29h some people look down on me because of my job situation or income social exclusion \u2013 looked down upon Eudaimonic \uf0fc Q29i i feel close to people in the area where i live neighbourhood belonging Eudaimonic Q30 all things considered, how satisfied would you say you are with your life these days? overall life satisfaction Evaluative \uf0fc Q40a How satisfied you are with each of the following items? your education Education satisfaction Evaluative \uf0fc Q40b How satisfied you are with each of the following items? your present job Job satisfaction Evaluative \uf0fc Q40c How satisfied you are with each of the following items? your present standard of living standard of living satisfaction Evaluative \uf0fc Q40d How satisfied you are with each of the following items? your accommodation accommodation satisfaction Evaluative \uf0fc ",
        "SUBJECTIVE WELL-BEING 18 10 Question 41 asks respondents to report how happy they are, and may at first sight seem like a hedonic question because of its use of the word \u2018happy\u2019. However, the question is phrased more evaluatively, with respondents asked \u2018to take all things together\u2019, that is to consider their life as a whole. The word \u2018happy\u2019 is rather more synonymous with \u2018satisfied\u2019. Previous research has suggested that responses to questions like this fall somewhere in between responses to purely evaluative questions and purely hedonic questions (Diener et al, 2010); a pattern that will be confirmed in this report. Creating synthetic subjective well-being indicators The question arises as to how the 26 indicators listed in Table 2 should be understood. Some, such as life satisfaction and happiness, appear to be overall measures \u2013 they give ana- lysts an overall assessment of how someone is doing, without indicating how their well-being might be improved. Others, such as the questions on loneliness or vitality, provide more specific information. One would expect the overall measures to broadly correlate, as they are trying to reach some kind of general assessment, albeit in different ways (for example evalu- atively or hedonically). But the more specific measures need not correlate \u2013 it is easy to imagine someone who is lonely, but has a lot of energy. Importantly, the policy implications of low scores on these specific aspects of well-being may be differ- ent. For example, high levels of stress might be related to long working hours and time poverty. High levels of loneliness or social exclusion might be related to a disrupted social fabric. This report goes some way to exploring the differing drivers for these various aspects of subjective well-being. To help in this process, a range of six synthetic indicators are defined that either provide a more overall assessment of well- being, or something related to a specific aspect of well-being. The indicators are based on the categories and distinctions presented in Table 2, and factor analyses (see Annex 2 on statistical techniques). Overall measures WHO-5 Mental Well-Being Index (Q45a-e) Part of the questionnaire is based on the five questions that make up the World Health Organization\u2019s Mental Well-Being Index (WHO-5), which was developed to measure positive psychological well-being (Bech, 1998). The index measures a mix of hedonic and eudaimonic well-being over the previ- ous two weeks. Hedonic well-being index (Q45a, b; Q46a, c) Well-being scientists regularly draw a distinction between positive and negative affect (for example, OECD, 2013). The circumplex model of affect adds a second dimension, that of arousal (Russell, 1980). The third EQLS includes four items that can be seen to represent all four possible combinations Item Concept Well-being category In 2007 survey Q40e How satisfied you are with each of the following items? your family life Family satisfaction Evaluative \uf0fc Q40f How satisfied you are with each of the following items? your health Health satisfaction Evaluative \uf0fc Q40g How satisfied you are with each of the following items? your social life social life satisfaction Evaluative \uf0fc Q41 taking all things together, how happy would you say you are? overall life (happiness) Evaluative 10 \uf0fc Q45a i have felt cheerful and in good spirits Positive emotion (cheerful) Hedonic \uf0fc Q45b i have felt calm and relaxed Positive emotion (calm and relaxed) Hedonic \uf0fc Q45c i have felt active and rigorous vitality (active) Hedonic/Eudaimonic \uf0fc Q45d i woke up feeling fresh and rested vitality (rested) Hedonic/Eudaimonic \uf0fc Q45e my daily life has been filled with things that interest me Engagement Eudaimonic \uf0fc Q46a i have felt particularly tense negative emotion (tense) Hedonic Q46b i have felt lonely loneliness Eudaimonic Q46c i have felt downhearted and depressed negative emotion (downhearted) Hedonic ",
        "mEtHodology 19 11 Stoll et al (2012) provide a thorough review of the drivers of subjective well-being, which was used to inform a similar review carried out on behalf of Eurostat (Abdallah and Stoll, 2012). of these two dimensions: cheerful \u2013 positive, aroused; calm \u2013 positive, unaroused; tense \u2013 negative, aroused; and depressed \u2013 negative, unaroused. These are combined in the hedonic well-being index, with the negative emotions reversed such that scoring high on the index requires an absence of nega- tive emotions. Overall well-being index (all Q29, Q30, Q41, Q45, Q46) The standardised scores for all subjective well-being items (except domain satisfactions) were combined, with equal weightings, into a single overall well-being index. This was not used very often, but was useful as an overall outcome measure. Aspects of well-being Social exclusion index (Q29e\u2013h) This index was developed by Eurofound using the first EQLS, and reported on in the third EQLS overview report (Eurofound, 2012b). A high score on the social exclusion index indicates high levels of perceived social exclusion (that is, low well-being). Elements of eudaimonic well-being index (Q29a\u2013c) Aside from the items in the social exclusion index, the third EQLS includes several more measures of what can be under- stood as eudaimonic well-being. However, in factor analysis (see Annex 2), only three could be loaded together into a sin- gle factor \u2013 optimism, feeling worthwhile and autonomy. These are grouped together in this eudaimonic well-being index. While overall measures of well-being do exist that are based on eudaimonic items (see Huppert and So, 2013), the limited number combined here means that this measure is less likely to be considered as an overall one. Stress and busyness index (Q29c, d; Q45b, Q46a) Four items \u2013 time pressure, autonomy, calm and relaxed, and tense \u2013 could be loaded together in a factor that appears to be related to stress and busyness. The standardised scores (see Annex 2) for the four items were averaged to produce an index. Stress and busyness are seen in this report as negative outcomes, but it is worth noting that they are often associated with generally positive conditions, such as having a job. Determinants of subjective well-being The analysis explored a range of items and topics from the third EQLS which it was thought, based on previous research, might explain individual-level variation in subjective well-being. 11 Table A1 in Annex 1 lists these items, structured according to the domains of quality of life identified by the Eurostat Expert Group on the topic. A list of \u2018demographics and core varia- bles\u2019 were also identified that provide vital statistics about the respondent that tended to be given primacy in the analyses (see below). Table A2 in Annex 1 lists the country-level indica- tors used in the analysis (such as GDP per capita). Statistical techniques used Three main types of analysis were used to produce this report \u2013 factor analyses, bivariate analyses and multivariate regres- sion analyses. \u2022 Factor analyses \u2013 Several variables that are believed to measure similar or interrelated concepts are brought together to see how they group together into underlying factors. For example, the analysis tested how the subjec- tive well-being variables group together so as to produce synthetic variables. \u2022 Bivariate analyses \u2013 In a bivariate analysis, one is look- ing to see how a single predictor or determinant variable is related to a single outcome variable; for example, the rela- tionship between age and life satisfaction, or gender and the social exclusion index. In most cases, statistical tests are carried out to see whether the effects found in the survey sample are significant \u2013 that is, that they do in fact represent differences in the population at large. \u2022 Multivariate regression analyses \u2013 Multivariate analyses allow the researcher to combine several predictor variables into one analysis. This allows one to compare relative effect sizes to see which predictors are more important, and also allows one to control for potentially confounding variables. For example, a certain ethnic minority might have lower average life satisfaction than another, but can the differ- ence be explained in terms of the average incomes of the two groups, or is there an independent effect of ethnicity?

        "SUBJECTIVE WELL-BEING 22 Patterns of subjective well-being across Europe This chapter explores the patterns of well-being across Europe. As well as using the synthetic indicators described in Chapter 1, it will also explore patterns for some more detailed aspects of subjective well-being. This sort of analysis is not just about making league tables. Comparing well-being outcomes will enable policymakers and analysts to begin to identify the characteristics of countries that are doing well in terms of well-being despite the economic crisis, so that lessons may be learnt from them. It is also useful for providing warning signals to countries whose well-being is below par, and to highlight places where support is needed.

        "PattErns oF subJEctivE wEll-bEing across EuroPE 23 Overall measures Life satisfaction Figure 3 maps average life satisfaction across Europe, which ranges from 8.4 in Denmark (on a scale of 1 to 10) to 5.5 in Bulgaria (Table A3 in Annex 3 presents mean scores for all main indicators for all countries). Figure 4 shows that GDP per capita explains a lot of this vari- ation, with the richest countries such as the Netherlands and Denmark indeed having some of the highest levels of life sat- isfaction, and the poorest such as Bulgaria also having the lowest levels of life satisfaction. However, the relationship is not perfect. For example, Hungary is richer, per capita, than Poland, and yet life satisfaction is 1.3 points lower. Romania\u2019s GDP is only slightly higher than Bulgaria\u2019s, and yet the two countries differ in life satisfaction by 1.2 points. At the other end of the scale, Denmark \u2013 consistently the European country with the highest levels of life satisfaction \u2013 is not quite the rich- est, with Ireland and the Netherlands both having higher GDP per capita. Finland has higher levels of life satisfaction than Germany and Belgium, despite having lower GDP per capita. These differences are important in the current economic climate, as countries have to work to maintain high levels of subjective well-being without being able to rely on growing GDP.

Correlation (R) = 0.81. 12 Source: GDP data from Eurostat Further analysis showed that considering median equivalised net household income instead of GDP per capita eliminated some of the discrepancies with life satisfaction. For example, median household income in Denmark is the highest in the EU, with the exception of Luxembourg. Meanwhile, despite Poland having a lower GDP per capita than Hungary, median income there is higher. This closer correlation highlights the relevance of median household income as a better measure of people\u2019s living standards than GDP per capita. 12 This is a Pearson correlation coefficient, which is used on several occasions in this report. Only statistically significant correlations are shown. Cor- relation estimates the relationship between two variables. Correlation coefficients can have values between -1 and 1, where a value of 0 indicates no correlation, a value of -1 indicates a perfect inverse relationship, and a value of 1 indicates a perfect direct relationship. Values between 0.1 and 0.3 are considered weak correlation, 0.3 and 0.5 indicate medium, and 0.5 to 1.0 indicate strong correlation. Correlation does not prove causality. ",
        "SUBJECTIVE WELL-BEING 24 The analysis also looked at how clusters of similar countries do (Figure 5), using the welfare regime typology developed by Whelan and Ma\u00eetre (2010). The typology divides up Euro- pean countries into seven groups according to welfare state regimes. It draws on the widespread categorisation developed by Esping-Anderson (1990), but goes beyond it to incorpo- rate the formerly communist countries of central and eastern Europe. The results echo the pattern seen when looking at GDP \u2013 with the clusters consisting of economically more disadvantaged countries (the post-socialist corporatist and post-socialist liberal clusters of central and eastern Europe, the 2007 accession cluster of eastern Europe and the southern European cluster) having lower levels of life satisfaction, while the western European clusters (social democratic, liberal and corporatist) have higher life satisfaction. One useful finding that emerges from the clustering is the dis- tinction between the social democratic cluster and the other two western European clusters \u2013 corporatist and liberal. In terms of GDP per capita, there is plenty of overlap between the three clusters. In terms of life satisfaction, however, the social democratic cluster clearly performs better. The only non- social democratic country to have higher life satisfaction than any social democratic country is Luxembourg, which scores above the Netherlands \u2013 but of course Luxembourg is rather an atypical case. Figure 5: Life satisfaction, by country and country cluster (scale of 1\u201310) 4.5 5.0 5.5 6.0 6.5 7.0 7.5 8.0 8.5 9.0 Social democratic Corporatist Liberal Southern European Post- socialist corporatist Post- socialist liberal Accession D K F I S E N L L U A T B E F R D E I E U K E S M T C Y I T P T E L P L S I C Z S K H U L T EE L V R O B G L i f e s a t i s f a c t i o n Note: Q30 (for question wording, see note to Figure 3). While there is generally not that much variation in life satis- faction within clusters, three countries in particular appear to score much lower than their peers \u2013 Greece in southern Europe, Hungary in the post-socialist corporatist cluster and Bulgaria in the 2007 accession cluster. Greece\u2019s average life satisfaction of 6.2 contrasts with an average of 7.1 for the rest of southern Europe overall; Hungary\u2019s 5.8 contrasts with an average of 6.9 for the other countries in the post-socialist cor- poratist cluster; while Bulgaria and Romania appear to have little in common in terms of life satisfaction (5.5 versus 6.7). ",
        "PattErns oF subJEctivE wEll-bEing across EuroPE 25 happiness and hedonic well-being The question on happiness and the hedonic well-being index both measure overall well-being, similarly to life satisfaction. But how do the results for these two measures differ from the results found for life satisfaction? There is substantial intercorrelation between the three meas- ures, 13 and much of the pattern is the same whichever measure is used (Figures 6 and 7). Social democratic countries report the highest life satisfaction, happiness and hedonic well-being, followed by the liberal and corporatist countries. However, there are differences. While the three former socialist regime clusters perform worst on life satisfaction and happiness, all three clusters have higher levels of average hedonic well-being than the southern European cluster. Bulgaria, Slovakia and the Czech Republic, in particular, all fare much better in terms of hedonic well-being than in terms of life satisfaction. For exam- ple, Bulgaria ranks bottom in terms of life satisfaction, but ranks 16th out of 27 in terms of hedonic well-being. Meanwhile, most southern European countries have rela- tively lower hedonic well-being than life satisfaction. Greece, for example, has the lowest score on hedonic well-being in Europe, just behind neighbouring Cyprus. The only exception within southern Europe is Portugal, which rises up the rankings for hedonic well-being relative to life satisfaction. Within the corporatist cluster, France and Luxembourg follow a pattern similar to southern Europe, scoring much lower in terms of hedonic well-being than life satisfaction. For exam- ple, France ranks 12th out of 27 for life satisfaction, but 20th in terms of hedonic well-being.

Do these results represent genuine differences in the patterns of various aspects of well-being, or are they cultural biases? Abdallah (2011) notes that different measures of well-being may be influenced by different cultural biases \u2013 including positivity biases, acquiescence biases and translational issues. Oishi (2010) reviews some of the differences in interpretations of concepts of happiness and life satisfaction. That said, there may well be some genuine differences in the experiences of people\u2019s lives that are reflected in the results. Diener et al (2010) suggest that evaluative meas- ures such as life satisfaction are more strongly determined by economic conditions than hedonic measures (see also Eurofound, 2009). Indeed, the correlation between hedonic well-being and GDP is more than 40% lower than the corre- lation between life satisfaction and GDP. 14 These differences are explored later in this chapter, when looking at the pat- terns of results for the individual questions used in measuring subjective well-being. 14 R = 0.38 for hedonic well-being, versus R = 0.66 for life satisfaction.

The WHO-5 can be seen as attempting to be more holistic than life satisfaction, capturing a broader range of experiences. Once again, the familiar pattern of high-scoring social dem- ocratic countries emerges; however, now there are some differences. Austria and Germany rank second and third respectively on the WHO-5 index, compared to only sixth and 13th on life satisfaction. Sweden, meanwhile, now only ranks ninth. At the other end of the scale, it is Latvia with the lowest WHO-5 score, and Romania which lies second from the bot- tom.

        "SUBJECTIVE WELL-BEING 28 Aspects of well-being This section first presents the patterns for four key meas- ures of aspects of well-being \u2013 stress/busyness, perceived social exclusion and eudaimonic well-being, all based on the synthetic indicators described in Chapter 1, and loneliness. Perceived social exclusion is of particular interest, given that it has risen significantly since 2007 (see Chapter 6). Later the scope broadens to include a wider range of individual subjec- tive well-being questions. There, the analysis looks at which aspects of subjective well-being each country scores relatively poorly on. The idea is to be able to identify specific areas for improvement for each country. Perceived social exclusion and loneliness The social democratic countries do not score as consist- ently well on these more social indicators (Figures 9 and 10). Denmark still ranks best on both measures but, for exam- ple, Sweden only ranks eighth for loneliness. With regard to social exclusion, Germany and Austria rank second and third best respectively. With regard to loneliness, the liberal cluster ( Ireland and the UK) do quite well, performing better than the corporatist countries.

I have felt lonely. The highest levels of perceived social exclusion are, as with the lowest levels of life satisfaction, in the 2007 accession cluster (Figure 9). But beyond that, the welfare regime clusters do not seem to be a useful guide for results. Cyprus and Greece have some of the highest social exclusion scores. But other coun- tries in the southern cluster (Portugal and Spain) have some of the lowest exclusion scores. Some of the post- socialist corporatist countries of central Europe do well with relatively low scores \u2013 Slovenia, Hungary and Slovakia. But their more northerly neighbours Poland and the Czech Republic do only marginally better than Greece, Bulgaria and Cyprus. The clues for these differences may therefore lie in the policies, poli- tics and culture specific to each of these sets of neighbouring countries, rather than the more general welfare state charac- teristics shared by the southern European cluster. In terms of loneliness, people in Greece, Italy, Hungary, Roma- nia and Bulgaria reported the highest levels of loneliness \u2013 Italy being a surprising outlier (Figure 10). Comparing the two metrics, it seems as if liberal countries do better in terms of loneliness and corporatist ones do better in terms of social exclusion. The lower levels of social exclusion in corporatist countries may reflect a greater effort by society to be inclusive; however, it is not clear why loneliness was particularly high in some of those same countries.

        "PattErns oF subJEctivE wEll-bEing across EuroPE 33 With the exception of Denmark, every country suffers at least one aspect of well-being where they rank in the bot- tom half of the table. In other words, almost all countries have improvements to make in at least one aspect of well-being. For example, Sweden, which ranks third in terms of life sat- isfaction, comes third from bottom in terms of vitality (feeling fresh and rested). The UK, which does relatively well in terms of life satisfaction, ranks bottom on three measures: both vital- ity measures (fresh and rested, and active and vigorous), and neighbourhood belonging. Other results worthy of highlight- ing include low job satisfaction in Spain (ranked eighth from bottom), feeling tense in Luxembourg (ranked sixth worst) and low health satisfaction in Estonia (ranked second from bottom). Of course, most of the countries that do poorly in terms of life satisfaction and the other overall measures also have particular areas of concern that are highlighted in Table 3. Greece does worst in terms of hedonic well-being, stress and autonomy. Bulgaria does worst in terms of satisfaction with standard of living, social life and family life. Hungary ranks second to worst for stress, autonomy and feeling downhearted and depressed. One can also look at the measures where countries do particu- larly well. For example, Bulgaria may rank bottom in terms of life satisfaction, but Bulgarians were the most likely nationality in Europe to report feeling active and vigorous, and the sec- ond most likely to report feeling fresh and rested. Education satisfaction in Romania was the highest in Europe (and this, it should be noted, did not represent a tendency to report being satisfied with everything \u2013 Romanians reported low health satisfaction). People in the Netherlands, followed by those in Finland, were the least likely to report feeling time pressure. Policy pointers As with many social indicators, it is the Scandinavian social democratic countries that lead the way in terms of well-being in Europe, despite their slight decreases in life satisfaction since 2007 (see Chapter 6). Their success is not just a result of eco- nomic prosperity \u2013 Denmark and Sweden have lower GDPs per capita than Ireland, and Finland has a lower GDP per capita than Germany. However, the results also strengthen the case for governments to pay closer attention to median household income, which is more closely correlated with life satisfaction than GDP per capita. Nonetheless, the data provide evidence of \u2018black spots\u2019 \u2013 areas with lower well-being \u2013 which might not necessarily have been identified using other data. Here comparisons have been made between countries, but later chapters look at other determi- nants, such as differences in well-being between urban and rural populations. This analysis may be useful in making deci- sions about where to direct resources, both at the national and the EU level. The use of various measures for overall well-being highlights the fact that differences do emerge for the different aspects of well-being. Strong decisions should not be made looking at just one indicator without first looking at the others. For exam- ple, Romania might seem to be faring better than Bulgaria in terms of life satisfaction, and therefore one might consider promoting policies where Romania differs from its neighbour. However, hedonic well-being is lower in Romania, and so such conclusions may be premature. The range of indicators for elements of well-being provide pointers for more specific lessons for individual countries. They highlight, for example, that the UK faces challenges in terms of vitality and neighbourhood belonging, that health is a par- ticular issue in Estonia, that high levels of stress and busyness are found in France, while Italy appears to have high levels of loneliness.

        "3rd European Quality of Life Survey Inequalities in well-being ChAPTER 3 ",
        "SUBJECTIVE WELL-BEING 36 15 The Gini coefficient is calculated as a number between 0 and 1, where 0 would indicate no inequality at all (everyone having the same income), and 1 would indicate maximum inequality (one person having all the wealth). Most countries in Europe have a Gini coefficient of between 0.25 and 0.35. Inequalities in well-being In the context of the economic crisis, it is more important than ever to consider distributional patterns. According to the Euro- pean Commission, the crisis has \u2018disproportionately hit those who are already vulnerable\u2019 (European Commission, 2011, p. 12) and has deepened inequalities (Vaughan-Whitehead, 2012). Inequality has always been an important moral issue, but recently there is growing evidence that it has a negative impact not just on the poorest in society, but on everybody (Wilkinson and Pickett, 2009). The recent Employment and social developments in Europe 2011 report suggests that inequality may have been a causal factor behind the financial crisis, as it spurred overconsumption and indebtedness (Euro- pean Commission, 2012b). With regard to measurement, both the Stiglitz Commission (Stiglitz et al, 2009) and the European Commission\u2019s \u2018GDP and beyond\u2019 Communication (European Commission, 2009) have made clear recommendations to go beyond merely presenting averages, and to include measures that capture the distributional aspect of outcomes. This chapter will do just that. It starts by introducing two new innovative measures that provide a summary assessment of overall well-being inequality within countries. These measures highlight which countries are the most unequal in terms of well- being, but they do not pinpoint where the inequalities come from \u2013 for instance, who are the people with low well-being and who are the people with high well-being? That will be the subject of the second part of this chapter, which presents aver- ages for different population subgroups (such as unemployed people, or particular age groups), and take a snapshot of the kinds of people who have very low or very high well-being. The final part of the chapter looks at how these patterns differ between countries \u2013 in which countries are well-being inequali- ties, such as the differences in well-being between poor and rich or between young and old, particularly acute? The analysis presents only descriptive statistics. The purpose is to identify which groups are in need of support, and which countries are doing best or worst in terms of spreading the impact of the crisis. In Chapter 4, multivariate regressions begin to draw some conclusions about the relative roles that demographic and other factors have in determining well-being. That analysis will help to draw some conclusions about what can be done to improve the well-being of Europeans. Overall inequality Indicators such as the Gini coefficient provide useful sum- mary statistics of the inequality of income in a country, without revealing who is rich and who is poor. 15 Until recently, such techniques have been predominantly applied to income, though a growing interest in health inequalities (Gakidou et al, 2000) and wealth inequalities is beginning to emerge (Davies, 2009). Techniques developed in a report produced for Eurostat in 2012 are used here to assess well-being inequality \u2013 meas- ures of the distribution of well-being within a country (Abdallah, 2012). Two measures are presented. The first is the difference in life satisfaction between the first and fifth well-being quin- tiles \u2013 that is, the difference between the 20% with the highest life satisfaction and the 20% with the lowest life satisfaction in each country. This is analogous to the quintile share ratio that Eurostat uses for income inequality. The second meas- ure is the mean pair distance, which is the average distance in life satisfaction between two individuals chosen at random. In computational terms, it is similar to the Gini coefficient, and one can be converted to the other relatively simply (Annex 2 explains why the Gini coefficient is not an appropriate measure for a non-ratio scale such as life satisfaction). Table 4 shows the ranking of EU Member States according to the quintile difference measure, but including mean pair dis- tance and mean life satisfaction. Figure 13 presents the mean pair distance plotted against mean life satisfaction. ",
        "inEQualitiEs in wEll-bEing 37 First, it is worth noting the large quintile differences. Even in France, one of the countries that performs averagely on this indicator, there is a difference of 5.3 points in life satisfaction on a 1\u201310 scale between the least satisfied quintile and the most satisfied quintile. In Romania, the most unequal country in terms of life satisfaction, the difference reaches 6.6 points.

        "SUBJECTIVE WELL-BEING 38 16 These methodologies are still preliminary, and caution should be taken in overinterpreting the results given the relatively small sample sizes in each country. For example, there were only slightly over 1,000 respondents sampled in most countries, meaning that the calculation for the Q1\u2013Q5 differences are based on about 400 people for each country. Cyprus and Hungary are other countries with particularly high life satisfaction inequality: Q1\u2013Q5 differences of just over 6.4 points are found. Meanwhile, Belgium, Italy and Portugal stand out as having relatively equal well-being distributions consid- ering their average levels of life satisfaction (Figure 13), while Cyprus, the UK and Austria all display relatively unequal well- being distributions despite their levels of life satisfaction being above the EU average of 7.1. The results for mean pair distance are relatively similar, which demonstrates the robustness of the Q1\u2013Q5 methodology. 16 Figure 13: Mean pair distance for life satisfaction versus mean life satisfaction, by country (scale of 1\u201310) DK FI SE LU NL AT ES IE BE UK MT FR DECY PL SI IT PT RO LT CZ SK EE LV EL HU BG 1.0 1.2 1.4 1.6 1.8 2.0 2.2 2.4 2.6 2.8 3.0 5.0 5.5 6.0 6.5 7.0 7.5 8.0 8.5 9.0 M e a n p a i r d i s t a n c e ( l i f e s a t i s f a c t i o n ) Life satisfaction (average) Note: Q30 All things considered, how satisfied would you say you are with your life these days? Please tell me on a scale of 1 to 10, where 1 means very dissatisfied and 10 means very satisfied. What differentiates people with low and high well-being? The results above leave open the question as to who are the people with lower and higher well-being in Europe. Figures 14 and 15 show mean life satisfaction and hedonic well- being for different demographic groups (see also Table A5 in Annex 3). Darker bars indicate groups that are significantly below the overall average, which is 7.1 for life satisfaction, and 7.3 for hedonic well-being (rescaled as it is). In summary, middle-aged people (35\u201364), poorer people, people who have not completed secondary education, unemployed peo- ple, non-EU citizens and those limited by illness all have lower life satisfaction than average. With the exception of non-EU citizens, they also all have lower hedonic well-being, and are joined in this context by those aged 75+. Women also have significantly lower hedonic well-being than men, despite having almost identical life satisfaction. The group with the lowest well- being on both measures are those severely limited by illness, with a mean life satisfaction of 5.9 out of 10. The pattern for age may be surprising for some \u2013 while most policymakers tend to see older and younger people as vul- nerable groups, it is actually those in the middle-aged groups (aged between 35 and 64) who have the lowest life satisfac- tion. This \u2018U-shaped\u2019 relationship between age and well-being has been well documented by previous well-being evidence (Eurofound, 2012b; Stoll et al, 2012; Dolan et al, 2006). It is ",

This age pattern holds for all country clusters, with two excep- tions. First, the 2007 accession cluster (Bulgaria and Romania see a pattern of almost linearly declining life satisfaction with age, and no increase in life satisfaction for the 65\u201374 age group. However, when other demographic factors are controlled for, the effect reappears \u2013 and the 65\u201374 age group actually does have significantly higher well-being than middle-aged groups even in those countries. It is likely that factors such as income are counter-balancing the effect. The other exception is for the social democratic countries (the Nordic countries and the Netherlands). Here the opposite is the case \u2013 when other demographic variables are not controlled for, there is a linear increase in well-being with age, with the highest life satisfac- tion found among those aged 65\u201374. However, this pattern stops being significant when other demographic variables are controlled for.

If those scoring 9 out of 10 were included in the high-scoring group, then that group would have included almost one in four respondents, which was considered to be too large a proportion. 18 Chi-square tests were used to test for significance.

The third EQLS overview report provides further analysis of demographic effects, for example the fact that the difference between high-income and low-income respondents is greater among older age groups than younger age groups (Eurofound, 2012b). Characteristics of the least and most satisfied Another way of looking at this is to \u2018zoom in\u2019 on the people with the lowest and highest levels of life satisfaction. Around 12% of survey respondents reported the highest possible life satisfac- tion, that is 10 out of 10, while a similar proportion reported life satisfaction scores of 1\u20134 out of 10. 17 Table 5 lists a range of factors and highlights characteristics that were significantly more likely to be found among respond- ents with very high life satisfaction or among those with low life satisfaction. 18 The analysis goes beyond pure demographics here, to identify a few broader factors of people\u2019s lives that are associated with low or high well-being (Table A4 in Annex 3 presents more details on this).

Looking at unemployment, 12.5% of the low scorers are unemployed, and have been so for 12 months or more, whereas only 3% of people with high life satisfaction are in this category. In addition, there is a much higher proportion of retirees in the high life satisfaction group: about a third of the people with high life satisfaction are retired compared to about a quarter in the low life satisfaction group.

        "inEQualitiEs in wEll-bEing 43 Risk factors for low well-being Demographic and socioeconomic factors clearly separate out people with poor well-being from people with high well-being. Might it be possible to identify a small number of clear and policy-relevant \u2018risk factors\u2019 that mark people out as being at risk of having low well-being? This would serve two purposes. First, it would clarify which factors policymakers should be looking for in attempting to identify people with low well-being. Second, it would provide a sense of how much can be done about improving population well-being. If a set of factors could be identified where at least one of which was relevant for every person with low well-being, this would be a very powerful tool. Figure 18 looks at eight key risk factors and shows the pro- portion of people with low life satisfaction that suffer each one (compared to everyone else). Five of them were mentioned ear- lier in this chapter. The other three (housing problems, arrears and not having close support) will be discussed in more detail in Chapter 4. Of these factors, material deprivation seemed to be the most important \u2013 66% of respondents with low life satisfaction could not afford at least two items on the material deprivation index. About 46% had completed no more than compulsory education (up to lower secondary education), and 35% were limited in their daily activities by illness or disability.

Of the remaining respondents with low life satisfaction (370 peo- ple), 39% (144 people) reported having poor work\u2013life balance, while a further 70 respondents had difficulties making ends meet (both variables will be discussed in more detail in Chap- ter 4). Once these two factors are considered, there were only 146 respondents with unexplained low life satisfaction out of a survey of over 36,000, highlighting that life satisfaction does indeed provide meaningful data about people\u2019s lives. It is also interesting to note that 29% of the respondents with low life satisfaction who did not have any risk factors lived in Austria or Germany. ",
        "SUBJECTIVE WELL-BEING 44 Box 1: Who is socially excluded and who is stressed? As well as looking at the characteristics of people with low life satisfaction, the study also looked to see if people who suffer par- ticularly acute social exclusion or are very stressed had specific characteristics. In terms of social exclusion , the following two contrasts were notable: \u2022 Long-term unemployed people made up 11.1% of those with high social exclusion scores, compared with only 1.4% of those with low social exclusion scores. \u2022 Retired people made up 33.7% of the group reporting high social exclusion, versus 20.9% of those reporting low social exclusion. Other factors such as marital status, education and income followed a similar pattern to that seen with life satisfaction. In terms of stress , the results diverged from those seen for life satisfaction on many counts: \u2022 Gender : 58% of those with high levels of stress were women, compared with only 46.4% of those with low levels of stress. \u2022 Age : People in the high-stress group were particularly likely to be middle-aged: 35.3% of people reporting high stress were aged 35\u201349, while only 17.6% of those feeling least stressed were this age (Figure 19). Conversely, 34.4% of the low-stress group were over the age of 65, while only 14.7% of the high-stress group were in this age category.

People who are least stressed are also far more likely to be retired: 40% of people reporting least stress are retired, compared to 19% of the those feeling most stressed. ",
        "inEQualitiEs in wEll-bEing 45 Various findings emerge from Table 6 (see Eurofound, 2013a for more analysis of this type). \u2022 Newer Member States dominate the table, with the most unequal country in each of the five rows being one of the EU12 countries (that joined the EU in 2004 or 2007). The differences are often stark. For example, being severely limited by health problems is associated with a 2.5-point disadvantage in terms of life satisfaction in Slovakia. \u2022 EU15 countries are found to have large differences for all five inequalities, though. Greece, the UK and Germany all have large well-being differences between rich and poor. Germany, Luxembourg and the Netherlands all have high well-being inequality associated with unemployment. This is probably associated with the low levels of unemploy- ment in those countries \u2013 previous research has highlighted that unemployment is most acutely felt when general 19 Education is not included here out of concern that subtle differences in how education levels are defined in different countries might skew the results. 20 For hedonic well-being, the data are rescaled so that the sizes are comparable with those for life satisfaction. Inequality patterns in different countries This chapter has shown that people with low well-being are distinguished by a range of factors including income, material deprivation, employment status, education, disability, marital status and age. However, these patterns are not the same everywhere. There are some inequalities between groups, in terms of well-being, that are more acute in some countries than others. Table 6 considers some key demographic contrasts and groups countries according to the size of the inequality in well-being for each contrast \u2013 large difference, some differ- ence or no significant difference. 19 For income, unemployment and being limited by illness, the analysis looked at differences in life satisfaction.

        "SUBJECTIVE WELL-BEING 46 unemployment rates are low (Luechinger et al, 2010; Di Tella et al, 2003 and 2001). Finland is ranked in the top three for inequality associated with disability \u2013 followed by the UK and Germany. In terms of gender, southern countries (including southeastern countries) are generally the most unequal, though surprisingly Sweden ranks fifth. \u2022 Almost all countries have one large inequality, highlight- ing that very few can be complacent about inequalities in well-being. The only exceptions are Austria, Belgium, Den- mark and Spain. In the case of Austria, the differences between different groups are not even significant. Most of these are relatively small countries, but the finding that Spain has no major well-being inequalities is interesting given its economic difficulties. Policy pointers Well-being data highlight the plight of a few groups known to have low well-being: unemployed people, those with illnesses/ disabilities that limit their activities, those on low incomes, those who are separated or divorced, and those with lower levels of education. But the data also highlight some results that may be surprising for those unfamiliar with the evidence on well- being \u2013 for example, the low well-being of middle-aged groups. For policymakers, it is important to know that these groups are in particular need of interventions to enhance well-being. Digging down to the country level, it is possible to identify countries where inequalities in well-being are particularly acute. Countries that need to pay greater attention include: \u2022 Bulgaria \u2013 the largest well-being differences between the top and bottom income quartiles, and between the oldest and the rest of the population. \u2022 Hungary \u2013 the largest effect on well-being associated with unemployment, and one of the highest levels of general well-being inequality. \u2022 Slovakia \u2013 the largest effect on well-being associated with suffering severe limitations from disability, and one of the largest well-being inequalities associated with age and income. \u2022 Cyprus \u2013 the largest gender inequality in well-being, and one of the countries with the highest well-being inequality, despite a respectable average. \u2022 Romania \u2013 the largest general well-being inequality, with the most satisfied 20% having a life satisfaction 6.6 points higher (scale of 1\u201310) than the least satisfied 20%. \u2022 UK \u2013 despite high average levels of life satisfaction, the difference between the most satisfied 20% and the least satisfied 20% is 6.2 points (scale of 1\u201310). There are also particularly large losses in well-being associated with dis- ability and low income. \u2022 Austria \u2013 no differences between demographic groups were significant, and yet the difference between the most satis- fied 20% and the least satisfied 20% was 6.1 points (scale of 1\u201310) \u2013 one of the highest levels. It is also worth noting that 9.2% of Austrians reported a life satisfaction score of 3 or less on the 10-point scale. ",
        "3rd European Quality of Life Survey Determinants of subjective well-being ChAPTER 4 ",
        "SUBJECTIVE WELL-BEING 48 21 Age and income were also significant, though they are not presented here as they have been discussed at length in the third EQLS overview report (Eurofound, 2012). Determinants of subjective well-being The previous chapter mostly described patterns of well-being without going into much detail regarding explanations. This chapter begins to attempt to explain the variation in well-being using a range of variables describing people\u2019s conditions of life, and multivariate regression analysis (see Chapter 1). This is important as it shows what conditions are most critical in determining people\u2019s experiences of life. This information pro- vides some answers to the questions about why people might have higher well-being than might be expected, and helps in identifying priority areas for policy. The relationship between subjective well-being and the con- ditions of one\u2019s life is complicated. Van Praag et al (2003) suggest using a two-stage model. Specific factors (such as job security or the amount of time spent with one\u2019s family) determine one\u2019s satisfaction with the relevant domains (in these cases, job satisfaction and family life satisfaction). In turn, these factors determine overall life satisfaction. This approach will be deployed here, but the analysis will also look to see how the specific factors determine life satisfaction directly, as this will enable direct comparisons between them. The chapter is divided into four sections. First, it looks at how the core demographic variables explored in Chapter 3 interact \u2013 to identify which are actually doing the work in terms of pre- dicting life satisfaction. Then, following van Praag, the analysis explores how relevant satisfaction with different domains of life is in predicting life satisfaction and hedonic well-being. Thirdly, the variables identified as most important in predicting well- being will be analysed, looking at how they predict a range of subjective well-being measures. Finally, each quality of life domain (as defined by Eurostat\u2019s Quality of Life Expert Group) will be explored in greater detail, as will the individual indicators. Demographic predictors of life satisfaction Bivariate analysis like that presented in Chapter 3 makes it possible to see who has high well-being and who has low well-being, but it does not help in understanding why they do. In a regression model, the analysis shows how well each factor predicts well-being. Table 7 presents a range of differ- ent demographic descriptors and the independent significant effect that they have on life satisfaction (Table A6 in Annex 3 presents the full regression results). 21 These core demographic variables were included in all further analyses in this chapter. Most of the factors discussed in Chapter 3 emerge again \u2013 with unemployment and being limited by health problems having the largest independent effects. The large effects of unemployment are interesting because they hold even after controlling for income. In other words, the importance of having a job, in terms of well-being, goes far beyond simply having an income. Academics have suggested that having a meaning- ful activity and having social networks may explain this finding (Powdthavee, 2012). The analysis also tested a model explor- ing whether living in a workless household was associated with low life satisfaction, given that different countries have different patterns of unemployment. In that model, the effect of unemployment was split. Living in a workless household was associated with a loss of 0.39 to life satisfaction, while the effect of one\u2019s own unemployment (of less than 12 months) was reduced to 0.63. Carrying out multivariate regressions meant that two factors appear greatly diminished. Being a non-EU citizen was not significant in any models, suggesting that the low well-being of this group is due to other factors (such as having lower incomes). Education, an important factor in Chapter 3, was also less prominent here. ",
        "dEtErminants oF subJEctivE wEll-bEing 49 22 These coefficients are based on a method whereby mean domain satisfaction was entered into the regression, together with seven difference variables (for example, difference between family life satisfaction and mean domain satisfaction). As the strongest predictor was standard of living, all other coefficients were calculated in contrast to it. The coefficients for hedonic well-being are scaled to reflect the smaller R2 of the regression on this outcomes variable. See Table A7 in Annex 3 for regression results on life satisfaction. A review of European policy has highlighted two specific ques- tions to be addressed with this data. First is the long-term impacts of youth unemployment. The effect of unemployment on present life satisfaction was similar for those aged 25 or under to the population at large. However, previous research has highlighted the scarring effect of youth unemployment on future well-being. Bell and Blanchflower (2011) analysed cohort data from the UK National Child Development Study (NCDS), finding that spells of unemployment before the age of 23 lower happiness at the age of 50; the extent of this decline in happiness increases with the number of months of unemployment as a youth. A second issue is the policy push towards active ageing and later retirement (European Commission, 2012b; Eurofound, 2012b). As can be seen, overall, retirement has a positive and independent effect on life satisfaction. All else being equal, being retired is associated with higher well-being for the indi- vidual in question. This result from the EQLS corroborates a longitudinal study conducted in the UK that found men- tal health improved among civil servants after they retired (at the age of 60) (Mein et al, 2003). This means that poli- cies that result in people retiring later may have a negative impact on well-being, at least during the extra years of work that those people then undertake. Furthermore, this is even the case when income loss is not controlled for. The reduced income associated with early retirement does have a detri- mental impact on well-being, but not enough to remove the well-being benefit from being retired. Interestingly, the effect is different for different age groups. Very early retirement (before the age of 55) does not have a positive impact on life satisfac- tion \u2013 presumably because it is often associated with having a long-term illness or disability. Over the age of 65, there is no positive effect of retirement either. However, between the ages of 55 and 65 the positive effect of retirement is strong \u2013 0.30 for those aged 55\u201360, and 0.25 for those aged 60\u201365. Effects are still significant when income is removed from the analysis. Policies that look to push the retirement age upwards should take this well-being impact into consideration. Domain satisfaction contributions Figure 20 shows the extent to which each of the eight domain satisfaction questions in the survey predict life satisfaction and hedonic well-being. 22 Standard of living satisfaction is the strong- est predictor of life satisfaction, followed by social life and family life. Education satisfaction is the weakest predictor. For hedonic well-being, health satisfaction is the strongest predictor, followed by standard of living and social life. Also, it is worth noting that the differences in effect sizes are not as sharp for hedonic well- being, and that, overall, domain satisfactions explain less variation in hedonic well-being than in life satisfaction. Table 7: Independent effects on life satisfaction of a range of demographic variables Effect sizes N unemployed 12 months or more -1.24 1,588 severely limited by health problems -1.16 2,212 unemployed less than 12 months -0.82 1,365 unable to work due to illness or disability -0.65 896 separated or divorced -0.58 4,078 widowed -0.44 4,325 limited to some extent by health problems -0.44 5,297 never married -0.33 8,002 single parent -0.18 1,681 no secondary education -0.18 3,393 Post-secondary education 0.10 10,009 retired 0.20 9,506 Note: Q30 All things considered, how satisfied would you say you are with your life these days?

        "SUBJECTIVE WELL-BEING 50 Figure 20: Independent effect sizes of domain satisfactions on life satisfaction and hedonic well-being (rescaled) (in points) 0.42 0.44 0.49 0.49 0.50 0.55 0.56 0.78 0.30 0.30 0.34 0.41 0.36 0.35 0.40 0.41 0.0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 Education Accommodation Economic situation Health Job Family life Social life Standard of living Effect size Hedonic well-being Life satisfaction Notes: Q30 (for question wording, see note to Table 7). Hedonic well-being index (rescaled) \u2013 see Chapter 1 and footnote 22. The effect size is the change in life satisfaction associated with a one-point difference in the independent variable in question, based on a linear regression model. So, an increase in satisfaction with social life of one point is associated with an increase in hedonic well-being of 0.4 points. As the satisfaction with social life scale runs from 1 to 10, its contribution to hedonic well-being can therefore vary by 3.6 points. Main predictors of subjective well-being Domain satisfaction questions are useful, but still leave unanswered the question of what exactly about each domain is important for well-being. Furthermore, domain satisfaction questions are affected by the same personality effects as other subjective well-being questions. So, someone who tends to look on the bright side is likely to report both higher life satis- faction and higher domain satisfactions than someone who is more pessimistic, creating a spurious correlation. That is why it is important also to ask more \u2018objective\u2019 questions, as these are less likely to be influenced by such positivity biases. As such, any correlations found here are more likely to be indica- tive of real effects. Furthermore, it is easier to consider how policies might influence actual objective conditions than sub- jective judgements. As Eurofound has already highlighted, the EQLS data are most useful when objective and subjective data are explored together (Eurofound, 2012, p. 10). Table 8 lists the top five predictor variables for life satisfac- tion and a broad range of other outcome variables (Table A8 in Annex 3 presents regression results in more detail). More details on the predictors can be found in the domain sec- tion below. In each case, the variables that explain the most variation are shown, not necessarily the ones that have the largest effect on any given individual. So, for example, the effect of being unemployed on any one person may be larger than the effect of a lack of time. But not having time affects more respondents, and so the effect size is larger. In essence, these data show where there is greatest possible opportunity for increasing well-being. ",
        "dEtErminants oF subJEctivE wEll-bEing 51 23 When looking at this table and comparing effect sizes between different variables, it is again important to recognise that subjective pre- dictor variables have a slight advantage over objective predictor variables as they are likely to be affected by the same personality factors that influence life satisfaction scores thus creating a spurious correlation. Table A8 in Annex 3 categorises variables as either objective (o), subjective (s) or somewhere in between (~). Overall, health, material conditions and relationship factors are the most important, corroborating the findings for the domain satisfaction regressions, and previous research on the key predictors of well-being (Stoll et al, 2012; Blanchflower and Oswald, 2011; Dolan et al, 2008). Two variables (the deprivation index, which counts the number of items a household cannot afford, and self-assessed health) feature in the top five for all nine outcome variables analysed. Work\u2013life balance features in the top five list in seven out of nine cases, and severely limited by health in five out of nine cases. Other predictors that feature in the lists more than once include being limited to some extent by health problems (two out of nine cases) and lack of time (two out of nine cases). Contact with friends/siblings was the third strongest predictor of social exclusion, while being widowed was the strongest predictor of loneliness. Other interesting findings from these regressions are high- lighted below. 23 \u2022 As already noted, some predictors have an effect across the board, including the deprivation index and self-assessed health. Other predictors that affect all aspects of well-being include housing problems, being in arrears, doing sports, not receiving support from friends or family, lack of time, work flexibility, work\u2013life balance and job insecurity. \u2022 In contrast, some variables had an effect on some aspects of subjective well-being, but not on others. This is particu- larly important when no effect is found on life satisfaction, which is the most commonly used measure of subjective well-being. This is the case in the following examples. \u25aa Although being a single parent did not seem to have a significant independent effect on life satisfaction, it did significantly reduce hedonic well-being and increase stress/busyness. \u25aa Being a full-time homemaker has no significant effect on life satisfaction, and actually seems to be associated with higher scores on the WHO-5 index and lower stress/ busyness. However, it is also associated with greater social exclusion and loneliness.

        "SUBJECTIVE WELL-BEING 52 24 This analysis was also carried out country-by-country, but the relatively small sample sizes in some countries, coupled with the large number of variables included in the analysis, requires caution in the interpretation of some of the results. \u25aa Living in a rented house is associated with a higher social exclusion index. However, once other factors are controlled for, living in social housing appeared to be positively associated with WHO-5 scores and negatively associated with stress/busyness levels. \u25aa Those attending religious services have slightly higher eudaimonic well-being but also report being more lonely. \u25aa Internet use is associated with lower social exclusion, but also lower WHO-5 scores, marginally lower levels of hedonic well-being and higher levels of stress/busyness. \u25aa Volunteering is associated with higher WHO-5 scores, marginally higher levels of eudaimonic well-being, but also higher levels of stress/busyness. \u25aa Accessibility of amenities does not independently pre- dict life satisfaction, but does have a positive impact for all other outcome variables, particularly reducing social exclusion and stress/busyness. \u25aa While the negative effect from working long hours is only marginal on life satisfaction, when controlling for other variables, it persists and is strong for stress/busyness, hedonic well-being and the overall well-being index. \u2022 Effects on stress/busyness ran opposite to the other well- being outcomes for many predictors, including long-term unemployment and the marital status variables. \u2022 Even when the direction of effects is consistent, one can compare their differential sizes. For example, local neigh- bourhood problems were most relevant for the social exclusion index, whereas work\u2013life balance had the great- est effect on hedonic well-being. \u2022 Once other indicators had been included, particularly mate- rial deprivation, income ceases to be a predictor of many aspects of well-being. It is important to note that this hap- pens even before subjective predictors such as \u2018difficulty making ends meet\u2019 were included. This does not mean that income is not important, just that its effect is mediated through other outcomes such as material deprivation, and these appear to be more important in understanding the effect on well-being. \u2022 In general, the regression models had a very good fit, mean- ing that, in using them, it was possible to explain a large amount of the variation in subjective well-being. For exam- ple, for the overall well-being index, 45% of the variation was explained by predictor variables. These results are particularly useful in combination with those presented in Chapter 2 \u2013 showing which countries do par- ticularly well or poorly on different aspects of well-being (see, for example, Table 3). For example, work\u2013life balance is the second strongest predictor of the social exclusion index \u2013 which was noted to be unusually high in Cyprus, Poland and the Czech Republic. Meanwhile, health factors are the most important determinants of hedonic well-being, which is lower in southern European countries. Differences between country clusters The analysis also looked at how the most important predictors of life satisfaction differed between country clusters (see Chap- ter 2). Table 9 shows the top five predictors for each country cluster (Table A9 in Annex 3 shows the full regression results). 24 The deprivation index was the only variable within the top five for all seven country clusters, with self-assessed health and dif- ficulty making ends meet appearing in six out of seven clusters (the exception in each case being the liberal cluster for self- assessed health and the corporatist cluster for making ends meet). Being severely limited by health or disability problems, public service satisfaction and institutional trust all also feature in the top five lists. A few variables that were not so important when consider- ing Europe as a whole emerge as important when looking at specific clusters. For example, trust in other people is in the top five for the corporatist, post-socialist corporatist and 2007 accession clusters. Not having close support and work flexibil- ity are in the top five for the liberal cluster. Engaging in physical activities is in the top five for southern European countries. All these findings suggest these are particularly important deter- minants of well-being in those particular contexts. Finally, it is important to note that all the top five predictors for life satisfaction in Europe as a whole are significant in each country cluster. There were a couple of exceptions where pre- dictors had contradictory effects in different clusters \u2013 that is, increasing well-being in some countries, but decreasing it in others \u2013 but in none of these were both effects strongly significant. ",
        "dEtErminants oF subJEctivE wEll-bEing 53 Policy pointers The key determinants of subjective well-being are material deprivation, health and being limited by disability, work\u2013life balance, public services and social relationships. As such, the evidence presented here suggests that the well-being of Euro- peans would benefit from: \u2022 a focus on efforts to tackle poverty and integrating people with disabilities; \u2022 strengthening the working hours directive, or other policies that could lead to reducing working hours and improving work\u2013life balance; \u2022 maintaining the quality of public services in the face of aus- terity, particularly, it seems, in southern Europe; \u2022 recognising the importance of relationships to people\u2019s well-being (see domain results below for more on this). It is proposed that the unintended well-being consequences of certain economic policies and urban planning should be considered. Meanwhile, it would seem that it is in the liberal cluster that social support is most important.

If a factor was associated with significant decreases, it is in an orange box with down- ward arrows. The shade of colour and the number of arrows indicate the strength of the effect. Where there was no effect, the box is left in grey.

As already highlighted, the deprivation index (a count of the number of items that a respondent reports they cannot afford) is the single strongest predictor of life satisfac- tion and the overall well-being index. If a respondent reports not being able to afford all six of the items in the index, then their life satisfaction can be expected to be 2.1 points lower than a person who could afford all six, holding all other vari- ables constant. In other words, the single thing that could be done to improve the average levels of life satisfaction in a country would be to ensure that nobody suffers from mate- rial deprivation. Combined with the other variables on material living condi- tions listed above, 20% of the variation in life satisfaction can be explained. When they are all controlled for, over two-thirds (70%) of the variation between countries is explained, high- lighting that material conditions are by far the strongest factor determining variation in life satisfaction between countries. As noted in the Introduction, well-being analysis can also help identify policy priorities within general areas. This domain looks at three sets of issues: the elements of the deprivation index, tenure and housing problems. With regard to the deprivation index, the largest effects were for the two items in the index related to social life (see Figure 21). Not being able to afford a week\u2019s annual holiday, which was the case for 37% of respondents overall, and up to two- thirds of respondents in many eastern European countries, was associated with a drop in life satisfaction of -0.40. The second largest effect was from not being able to afford to have guests round for a meal or drink (-0.38). This pattern is differ- ent to the results found when carrying out bivariate analyses just looking at individual deprivation items and life satisfaction (see third EQLS overview report: Eurofound, 2012). Because all deprivation items are included in one model, it is possible to see their differential and independent effects. It is impor- tant to note that it is not just a matter of seeing larger effects for \u2018less basic\u2019 items. The proportion of respondents not able to replace worn-out furniture was twice that for those who could not afford to have guests round, yet the effect of the lat- ter on life satisfaction was much greater. Rather, it highlights the importance of social elements of poverty, reinforcing the European Council\u2019s definition of poverty to include cultural and social concerns, and stressing the importance of social inclu- sion (European Commission, 2012b).

Even so, there is a marginally significant deficit in life satisfaction for people who own a house with a mortgage, versus those who own the house outright. Interestingly, if country dummy vari- ables are not controlled for then the opposite is seen \u2013 owning a house with a mortgage appears to result in higher life satis- faction than owning one without a mortgage. However, this can be explained by the high levels of outright ownership existing in central and eastern Europe. For example, in Bulgaria, the country with the lowest average life satisfaction, 87% of the population own houses without a mortgage, versus only 3% with a mortgage. By contrast, in Denmark, the country with the highest levels of life satisfaction, only 12% own houses outright, whereas 49% own a house with a mortgage. This is a clear example of the importance of looking at individual-level data. If one were to look only at the national averages, one might surmise that mortgages are preferable to outright ownership, as the countries with the greatest rates of outright ownership have the lowest levels of life satisfaction. Figure 22 shows the independent negative effects of six housing problems in the survey on both life satisfaction and housing satisfaction (the seventh problem \u2013 not having an indoor toilet \u2013 did not emerge as significant for either).

On average, 5.7% of respondents felt that it was either very or quite likely they would have to leave their accommodation, ranging from 13.7% in Greece to only 2.1% in the Netherlands. Interestingly, Denmark also scores poorly on this measure, with 5.4% feeling that it was very likely they would have to leave their accommodation, the same proportion as in Greece. Whether one will have to leave one\u2019s accommodation is a somewhat subjective judgement. Of the more \u2018objective\u2019 physi- cal problems, rot, which affected 9% of respondents across Europe, had the biggest impact on life satisfaction. The propor- tions suffering from this problem are as high as 26% in Latvia and 25% in Greece. But with respect to housing satisfaction, the biggest problem appears to be shortage of space (which affected 15% of respondents), reducing housing satisfaction by 1.35 on a scale of 1 to 10. This suggests that respondents, when asked about housing satisfaction thought more about overcrowding, whereas when not consciously drawn to think about housing, it was housing insecurity and rot that had a bigger impact on their experience of life. Policy pointers Policymakers are right to target material deprivation, and should note that the effect of material deprivation on well- being is greater than that of income. Furthermore, material deprivation is not just about the basics \u2013 being able to engage in social and leisure activities is also important. Regarding housing, it appears that well-being may be improved by policies that improve the situation for those renting and protect people against housing insecurity. Of a range of hous- ing problems, rot and a lack of bath/shower appear to be the strongest contributors to reduced life satisfaction \u2013 rot in particular could potentially be targeted by local government interventions.

        "dEtErminants oF subJEctivE wEll-bEing 57 In the Eurostat Quality of Life framework, this domain focuses exclusively on work \u2013 with other productive activities such as volunteering and caring for others included in the domain \u2018Lei- sure and social interactions\u2019 below. Methodologically, this is useful, as the analyses can focus on only those in paid labour. For those who are in a job, work often takes up half of the wak- ing day during the week. As such, the conditions of work play an integral role in people\u2019s experience of life. For employers, and the wider economy, the benefits of ensuring well-being at work include increased productivity and retention (Bevan, 2010; Ford et al, 2011). Previous research has highlighted that the five most important work factors that determine well-being are: working hours, sense of control, job fit and skill use, positive managerial behaviour and social relationships at work (Mahony, unpub- lished). The EQLS includes questions on working hours and work flexibility (which is part of control), as well as questions on job security and work\u2013life balance. The data suggest some tensions with policies striving to increase labour market flex- ibility, by favouring temporary contracts, and increase work intensity. Adding these variables to core demographic variables almost doubles the amount of variation in individual life satisfaction that can be explained, to 19%. Alone, job variables can explain 44% of the variation in life satisfaction between countries (for those in jobs, of course), highlighting their relevance to well-being. Of the more objective variables, the most important predic- tor of life satisfaction is contract type. It is already known that workers on temporary contracts have a level of income 14% lower than those on permanent contracts, once other factors are controlled for (European Commission, 2012b). Figure 23 shows that such contracts are also associated with a life sat- isfaction penalty beyond any impact resulting from the lower income. Having a temporary contract of less than 12 months has the largest negative impact \u2013 the difference in life satis- faction between people on temporary contracts and those on permanent contracts is 0.5 points. This is particularly worrying in the current economic context, when the majority of new jobs being created are with temporary contracts. There is also a significant reduction in life satisfaction asso- ciated with having no written contract. However, being on a contract through an employment agency does not seem to be associated with significantly lower life satisfaction. Also, being on a temporary contract of more than 12 months seems to have no negative impact on life satisfaction whatsoever.

        "SUBJECTIVE WELL-BEING 58 25 For example, the difference between working 35 hours and 55 hours a week is associated with a decrease of half a standard deviation in the work\u2013life balance measure.

Overall, 13% of respondents reported that they felt they were very likely or likely to lose their job in the next six months. The highest rates were in Greece (31%) and Latvia (25%). The third factor of interest was working hours. The third EQLS overview report found lower life satisfaction among those work- ing long hours (Eurofound, 2012, p. 23). This relationship held, even after other variables had been controlled for ( Figure 24). The highest levels of life satisfaction were found among those working 26\u201340 hours. Above that life satisfaction begins to decline (the one point above the x-axis for those working 51\u201355 hours is based on quite a small sample of respondents). The relationship remained significant even when excluding the top income quartile from the analysis, demonstrating that lower working hours are not just a luxury for the rich. In terms of work flexibility, being able to take a day off at short notice was the most important factor, corresponding with a life satisfaction increase of 0.3 points. Being able to vary one\u2019s start and finish times increased life satisfaction by 0.2 points. However, being able to accumulate overtime hours to take time off later had no effect. The survey also includes four items about work\u2013life balance, which were combined into a synthetic indicator. Of the four, the strongest predictor of life satisfaction was an item ask- ing about work interfering with family responsibilities. The work\u2013life balance synthetic variable was, in turn, strongly pre- dicted by working hours and work flexibility. 25 It is likely that the effect of working hours on life satisfaction is mediated by the work\u2013life balance synthetic variable, as its effect disap- pears from regression analysis when the synthetic variable is also included. As already noted in Chapter 3, unemployment has a huge impact on life satisfaction, associated with a drop of 0.8, or 1.2 when unemployment has lasted over 12 months. ",

Policy pointers The largest impact on well-being in the field of work is of course unemployment \u2013 this has to be a priority. But job security and work\u2013life balance factors were also found to be important. The improvement in well-being found to be associated with the difference between a temporary contract and a permanent contract is greater than that found to be associated with the difference between unemployment and a temporary contract of less than 12 months. As the majority of new jobs currently being created in the EU are with temporary contracts, this is a worrying result. Work flexibility and working hours were confirmed to be impor- tant determinants of life satisfaction, with those working 41 hours or over per week seeming to have lower well-being. Incentives for businesses to ensure lower working hours might therefore increase well-being. For example, in 2008, the national governments in Germany, Austria and Belgium paid firms to put staff on shorter working hours, rather than making them unemployed, and topped up salaries to compen- sate for some of the loss in income. This is likely to have had a much less detrimental effect on workers\u2019 well-being than if they were forced to enter unemployment. And it also meant that the workers were ready to return to full-time employment when the economy started to recover (Traynor, 2012). However, labour market economics is a complex area, and caution is needed before drawing any strong conclusions with regard to policies related to either labour flexibility or working hours. It is important to acknowledge that this analysis is lim- ited to analysing the relationship at one point in time, and only for the people directly affected. Further work is necessary to model the net impact of labour market policies on well-being, including indirect and long-term effects. For example, what if the short-term impact of reducing working hours was to improve well-being, but the long-term impact was to reduce productivity, competitiveness, economic output and thereby ultimately well-being? Similarly, raising the threshold for people entering paid work, by regulating contracts might result in an increase in unemployment. The well-being loss from this might offset any gain achieved for those in work. ",
        "SUBJECTIVE WELL-BEING 60 As already noted, health is one of the key determinants of sub- jective well-being, and the analysis has highlighted the strong negative impacts of being limited by health problems and being unable to work because of illness or disability. Self-assessed health is also known to be strongly associated with well-being, being the second strongest predictor of life satisfaction overall. The only other health-related item included in the analysis was related to frequency of physical activity and sport. Figure 25 shows the difference from the mean for people who do sports at different intensities, controlling for other variables. Figure 25: Differences from mean life satisfaction for people with different intensity of physical activity (in points) 0.27 0.17 -0.16 -0.10 -0.15 -0.20 -0.15 -0.10 -0.05 0.00 0.05 0.10 0.15 0.20 0.25 0.30 Every day or almost every day At least once a week One to three times a month Less often Never D i f f e r e n c e f r o m m e a n l i f e s a t i s f a c t i o n In other words, there is a 0.4-point increase in life satisfaction associated with moving from doing physical activity less than once a week, to doing it every day or almost every day. Across Europe, 60% of respondents reported doing physical activity less than once a week, with percentages ranging from 27% in Finland to 88% in Bulgaria.

        "dEtErminants oF subJEctivE wEll-bEing 61 Policy pointers Aside from highlighting the plight of people with severe ill- nesses or disabilities, the EQLS also reveals clear well-being opportunities in the field of physical activity. Policy interventions could be targeted at education, or, for example, in the promo- tion of active transport modes. Education Post-secondary education \uf0e1\uf0e1 no secondary education \uf0e2\uf0e2\uf0e2 This domain is not covered extensively by the EQLS report, the only relevant well-being driver being level of education. Figure 26 shows life satisfaction and education satisfaction for people in three categories: not having a complete secondary education, having a secondary education and having post- secondary education. Figure 26: Mean life satisfaction and education satisfaction for people with different levels of education (scale of 1\u201310) 6.97.1 7.5 6.3 7.2 8.2 4.5 5.0 5.5 6.0 6.5 7.0 7.5 8.0 8.5 No secondary education Secondary education Post-secondary education Education satisfaction Life satisfaction While the differences in life satisfaction are sharp, previous research has suggested that it is mostly explained by differ- ences in income and health \u2013 that is, people with a higher education have higher levels of life satisfaction purely because they have higher incomes and better health (Dolan et al, 2006; Diener et al, 1999). This study found that income and health alone were not enough to explain the differences in life sat- isfaction of people with different incomes, but that including other factors (for example, material deprivation and housing problems) did explain the differences. That said, education still had an independent effect on other outcome variables including hedonic well-being, the social exclusion index, eudaimonic well-being, stress/busyness and loneliness. The effect on eudaimonic well-being is the largest. ",
        "SUBJECTIVE WELL-BEING 62 Policy pointers The enabling effects of education in terms of helping individu- als achieve higher well-being through decent living conditions and good health should not be forgotten, particularly where they can be deployed to reduce social inequalities and pro- mote social mobility. As a measurement lesson, it is important to highlight that sev- eral measures of well-being are capturing effects not seen when using life satisfaction, which underlines the importance of using multiple measures.

In many ways, this is the area that policymakers know least about, and yet social interaction is considered by some academics to be the single most impor- tant determinant of well-being (Diener and Seligman, 2002). In terms of social life, policymakers may be wary of intervening too directly, but should be aware of the side effects of other policies on these issues, including policies relating to working hours, geographical labour mobility (Layard, 2005) and ine- quality. Meanwhile, there are other areas where policymakers may be able to intervene directly, such as promoting volun- teering, tailoring support for people without social networks, and providing facilities and opportunities for different activities. In this dataset, social and leisure variables explain 13% of the variation in individual life satisfaction. Across countries, 46% of the variation in life satisfaction can be explained by social and leisure factors. Aside from marital status, the most important social life items were related to access to close support. Researchers dis- tinguish between four types of social support \u2013 emotional, tangible, informational and companionship (Wills, 1991). The items in the third EQLS cover all these four domains (with two \u2018tangible\u2019 items \u2013 financial, and help around the house), and allow one to distinguish between social support provided by friends or family and that provided by institutions. All aspects of social support proved to be important to life satisfaction with the exception of informational support. The strongest effect came from not having anyone to help around the house when ill, followed by not having anyone to help out financially if nec- essary. Combined overall, not having any support for all five items was associated with a total decrease in life satisfaction of 1.2 points. The analysis also looked at the difference between people who were able to rely on friends or family for support and those who needed to rely on institutional support. When looking at this by item, there was only one area of support where having institutional support was significantly less beneficial for well- being \u2013 that of having someone to give advice on personal or family matters. Actual frequency of social contact was also significant in predicting life satisfaction. Most important was contact with friends or neighbours. Figure 27 presents differences from the mean life satisfaction, both in terms of face-to-face contact or indirect contact (via phone, internet or post). ",

All differences in Figure 27 for face-to-face contact were significant. For indirect contact, the only signifi- cantly different group were those who have contact every day or almost every day. Apart from friends and neighbours, the only other type of con- tacts that were associated with life satisfaction were those with siblings. Contact with children and parents made no difference to life satisfaction, when contact with other groups was con- trolled for, whether this was face-to-face or indirect. Moving beyond close networks, trust in other people in general was also a strong determinant of life satisfaction. The differ- ence between someone who reported the minimal level of trust in other people and someone who reported the highest level of trust was associated with a difference in life satisfac- tion of 0.6 points. The last set of social life items explored were also subjective \u2013 whether respondents felt they wanted more time to spend with family or social contacts. These two items were signifi- cant. Combined, people who said they did not have enough time for both family and social contacts reported a life satisfac- tion level of 0.4 points less than people who reported having time for both. When explaining variation in satisfaction with social life, the pat- terns were very similar, with face-to-face contact with friends and neighbours the strongest predictor, and important effects evident for not having social support. One difference is that indirect contact with friends was also positively associated with social life satisfaction. Unsurprisingly, when predicting family life satisfaction, face-to- face contact with parents and children did enter the regression significantly. However, it is interesting to note that it was still contact with friends and neighbours that was the strongest predictor of family life satisfaction. In addition to social life, there were several other questions that asked people about their time use including commuting ",
        "SUBJECTIVE WELL-BEING 64 time, social and political activities, housework and caring for others. Some of the results in this domain were quite coun- terintuitive. For example, while feeling that you did more than your fair share of housework was a strong negative predictor of life satisfaction (associated with a drop of 0.3 points), actual reported hours doing housework had a marginally significant positive correlation with life satisfaction. Caring for elderly persons or people with disabilities was neg- atively correlated with life satisfaction, such that someone spending 25 hours a week doing so would have a level of life satisfaction 0.1 points lower than someone who did not care for anyone elderly or with a disability. Conversely, hours spent caring for children was actually positively associated with life satisfaction, though again, the effect was small \u2013 someone spending 11 hours or more caring for children would have a life satisfaction of 0.16 points higher than someone who does not care for any children. It is plausible that the effect is asso- ciated with a positive sense of purpose resulting from raising children. Indeed, the effect of caring for children on responses to the question about feeling that what one does is worthwhile is twice as strong as that on life satisfaction. In view of this, policies that ensure that parents are able to spend some time with their children should have a moderate positive effect on parental well-being. While the effect on life satisfaction holds for both men and women, it appears to be strongest for men at work, highlighting the importance of paternal leave and mater- nal leave, and flexible working hours for both genders. The effect was not significant when looking only at women at work, suggesting that they are probably struggling to juggle work and childcare commitments. Of course, there is a separate debate about what is best for the children, where risks have been iden- tified with childcare starting at too early an age (UNICEF, 2008). More importantly, the data highlight the need to provide support for those caring for people who are elderly or have disabilities, which appears to have a greater well-being burden. This finding should be combined with the evidence from the EQLS that it is often elderly people and those with disabilities who themselves are providing care for other people in a similar situation (Eurofound, 2013a). The strongest effects on life satisfaction, however, in this domain, were the frequencies of various activities, including physical activity (mentioned earlier), social activities in clubs or societies, internet use and religious services. Figure 28 shows the relative strengths of each of these activities in predicting life satisfaction. Figure 28: Effect sizes on life satisfaction of frequencies of different activities (in points) 0.030.04 0.07 0.12 0.00 0.02 0.04 0.06 0.08 0.10 0.12 0.14 Internet use Religious services Club or society social activities Sport Effect size on life satisfaction Notes: See Figure 20 for an explanation of effect sizes. In this case, a one-point increase in frequency of sport or physical activity is associated with a 0.12-point increase in life satisfaction. Frequencies were assessed on a five-point scale from \u2018never\u2019 to \u2018every day\u2019. ",
        "dEtErminants oF subJEctivE wEll-bEing 65 The study shows a small, but significant effect of commuting time on life satisfaction, with people commuting up to 30 min- utes a day for a round trip having higher life satisfaction than people travelling over 30 minutes a day (a difference of 0.08 points). Other researchers have found stronger effects (Kah- neman et al, 2004; Stutzer and Frey, 2008). The findings also show a marginally significant negative relationship between commuting time and satisfaction with social life. This sup- ports previous research by Putnam (2000), which suggests that increasing commuting time is associated with a lowering of involvement in community affairs. Previous research has reported a significant positive relation- ship between volunteering and life satisfaction. In particular, Meier and Stutzer (2008) found that life satisfaction rose with the frequency of volunteering. While the analysis did not find an effect on life satisfaction, it did find a significant relationship with the WHO-5 index. Policy pointers The policy pointers related to this domain can be divided into proactive pointers \u2013 policies that can be enacted to increase well-being \u2013 and defensive pointers \u2013 identifying policies that risk leading to decreases in well-being. With regard to the former, potential interventions include: \u2022 increasing support for those without social networks, par- ticularly support around the house, and having someone to talk to. This could be delivered directly by the state, or provided by the voluntary sector; \u2022 fostering opportunities for physical activity, for example through active transport interventions; \u2022 setting up clubs and societies; \u2022 providing support for people who have to care for elderly/ disabled people \u2013 the well-being evidence indicates that policymakers should pay particular attention to this, and that it should not be overshadowed by the debate on giv- ing support to people providing childcare. \u2022 promoting volunteering. With regard to the potential risks to well-being highlighted in this section, potentially harmful impacts include: \u2022 geographical labour mobility on social networks, particu- larly related to family, and particularly given that indirect contact does not have the same positive well-being value as actual face-to-face contact. There is also evidence that geographical mobility is associated with lower trust and sense of empowerment (David et al, 2010; DiPasquale and Glaeser, 1999; Soroka et al, 2003); \u2022 longer working hours, in terms of limiting the time that peo- ple have for discretionary activities; \u2022 inequality, in terms of decreasing social trust (Helliwell, 2006, 2003; Helliwell and Putnam, 2004). In all cases, the need to consider the well-being impacts of these policies is evident. It may be that in some cases the inclusion of well-being in the policy assessment might shift the weight of argument for or against such policies. In other cases, it may be possible to apply supplementary policies to mitigate negative effects on social relationships. Finally, social relationships go beyond family \u2013 in fact, it is often contact with friends that is most important for well-being. This should not be conflated with family policy. ",
        "SUBJECTIVE WELL-BEING 66 The domain of economic and physical safety relates to secu- rity and the vulnerability of one\u2019s situation. The potential and fear of something negative happening (for example, facing the repercussions of not resolving a debt, or becoming the victim of a crime) is almost as bad as the event actually happening. Uncontrollable debts, or arrears, have been known to have a strong negative impact on mental health (Cummins et al, 2004). Here, the most severe impacts were from informal loans (-0.20) and utility bills (-0.18; see Figure 29). There was no significant effect from consumer loans or rent/mortgage pay- ment arrears, when all items were included together (although all items were significant predictors of life satisfaction when tested separately). It is worth linking these results to those found when looking at housing tenure \u2013 for instance, other factors controlled for, living in a house with a mortgage did convey a slight negative effect on life satisfaction, but not as large an effect as living in rented accommodation. Figure 29: Effect sizes on life satisfaction of different types of arrears (in points) 0.06 0.10 0.18 0.20 0.00 0.05 0.10 0.15 0.20 Rent or mortgage payments Consumer loans Utility bills Informal loans Effect size on life satisfaction Crime and vandalism is included in the survey in a series of questions about the local environment. Perceiving a prob- lem with crime is associated with a large 0.7-point drop in life satisfaction \u2013 it is the most important neighbourhood problem in terms of life satisfaction. Policy pointers The evidence here provides some interesting lessons in terms of the negative impacts of debt. On the one hand, the nega- tive impacts of holding debts point to the need to regulate the credit market in general, and to provide financial literacy for those at risk of getting into debt. On the other hand, regulations might drive people away from consumer loans and towards informal loans, which actually have the largest negative effect on life satisfaction. The results also highlight the importance of tackling crime for people\u2019s well-being. Economic and physical safety arrears in payments \uf0e2\uf0e2\uf0e2 crime and vandalism \uf0e2\uf0e2\uf0e2 ",
        "dEtErminants oF subJEctivE wEll-bEing 67 Within this domain, the analysis looks at two sets of variables \u2013 satisfaction with public services and trust in institutions. Satisfaction with public services explains 9% of the variation in individual life satisfaction. All services were significant predictors of life satisfaction when entered separately, but housing ser- vice satisfaction ceased to be significant when all services were entered together. Education, health and childcare service satis- faction are the most important determinants of life satisfaction. The analysis also explored the relationship between these driv- ers and satisfaction with the economic situation in the country, and with the satisfaction with standard of living. While the pat- tern for standard of living satisfaction was not that dissimilar from overall life satisfaction, it was interesting that ratings of public services played a very different role when it came to satisfaction with the economic situation. Figure 30 shows the effect sizes for each public service on life satisfaction, satis- faction with standard of living and satisfaction with economic situation. It is worth noting that public service satisfaction explains more of the variation in satisfaction with the economic situation than with the other two variables, suggesting that it is more related to perceptions of the wider economy (for further analysis, see Eurofound, 2013b). Figure 30: Effect sizes of satisfaction with public services on life satisfaction, satisfaction with standard of living and satisfaction with the economic situation (in points) 0.00 0.05 0.10 0.15 0.20 0.25 Health service rating Education system rating Public transport rating Childcare rating Long-term care rating Housing rating State pension rating E f f e c t s i z e Life satisfaction Satisfaction with standard of living Satisfaction with economic situation The patterns also differ for different population groups. Figure 31 shows the amount of variation in life satisfaction explained by satisfaction with public services for a selection of different groups. As can be seen, a larger proportion of the variation is explained in the cases of respondents over 65, those limited by health problems and those who do not have EU citizenship. The services that are most important also vary from group to group. For those over 65, unsurprisingly, health and pension services are most important. For those aged 18 to 24, educa- tion services are most important. Interestingly, for those who are not EU citizens, social care services are by far the most important.

However, in this case, two items appeared not to be important to life satisfaction \u2013 trust in the parliament and trust in the press. For example, when creating a syn- thetic indicator for average institutional trust excluding these two institutions, this appeared to be a slightly better predictor of life satisfaction than a synthetic indicator that included them. Of those that were significant, by far the strongest predictors were trust in the police and trust in local authorities, suggesting that people are more affected by those institutions with which they have a more direct experience. It is also worth noting that, when carrying out analysis at the country level, Transparency International\u2019s corruption percep- tions index (2012) is the only variable that significantly predicts average life satisfaction once GDP has been controlled for. Policy pointers Public services are important to the well-being of the popu- lation, and particularly to those in vulnerable situations such as seriously ill/disabled people, migrants and elderly people. Well-being may be improved by raising trust in institutions, par- ticularly the police and local authorities. The question remains as to whether trust in these two more proximal institutions can lead to any improvement in the level of trust in more distal ones such as government and legal systems. ",

This is lower than some of the other variable sets, but it is worth noting that this domain fea- tured less \u2018subjective\u2019 variables, and therefore does not suffer from the positivity biases that might drive up the correlations in other domains.

The figures shown represent the differ- ence one would expect between someone reporting no problems and someone reporting major problems in each of the six areas. As can be seen, and as noted in the \u2018Economic and physical safety domain\u2019, the biggest impact on life satisfaction comes from problems with crime and vandalism (almost 0.7 points).

The other set of items in this section were five questions on accessibility of amenities. Combined, they represent a significant predictor of life satisfaction. Of the five amenities, the largest predictor of life satisfaction was accessibility of rec- reational or green spaces. Figure 34 shows that, all else being equal, people who can access such amenities only with diffi- culty had a level of life satisfaction 0.6 points lower than people who can access them very easily.

Accessibility of cul- ture and postal services were significant when entered into regression separately, but not when the items were entered into regression simultaneously with the other items in this set. Policy pointers The data highlight the independent positive effect of living in more rural areas. This may be used in a couple of ways. First, the findings convey the importance of maintaining opportuni- ties for living in rural areas \u2013 particularly in terms of ensuring there are employment opportunities and access to amenities. Secondly, the analysis highlights the opportunity to identify the elements of rural life that increase people\u2019s well-being, to see if lessons can be learned for more urban contexts. Access to green space and sense of community are likely to play a role in this. The data also provide clear indicators of the kind of neigh- bourhood problems that influence well-being, with crime and vandalism being the most important. This provides some indications towards funding priorities for local and central governments, particularly in a context of constrained public budgets. That said, litter, water and air quality are all significant predictors of life satisfaction. Finally, the data also show that accessibility of amenities is important \u2013 local authorities have a role, through planning policy, to ensure that amenities such as banking facilities and public transport are available to all.

So, for example, being a single parent has the same negative impact on life satisfaction as having an income 25% lower. Not having any contact with friends (compared to having contact once a week) is associated with a loss in life satisfaction equivalent to having an income 75% lower, that is dividing one\u2019s income by four.

        "SUBJECTIVE WELL-BEING 74 Protective factors For some variables, there is a strong and well-established neg- ative relationship with subjective well-being. For example, low income, unemployment, divorce and poor health are known to be some of the most important drivers of low well-being (Stoll et al, 2012; Dolan et al, 2008). However, there may be other factors that can \u2018protect\u2019 against the negative impact of these conditions. For example, the negative impact of a very low income may be mitigated somewhat if an individual has strong social relationships. Such interactions provide policy- makers with both a more nuanced picture of which population groups suffer low well-being and an indication of which factors may protect these groups from low well-being. This chapter explores whether there is empirical evidence of these protec- tive factors. To do this, the analysis first looked to the well-being litera- ture to generate some hypotheses of protective factors. These hypotheses were then tested by carrying out regressions that include interaction variables (for example, Extremera et al, 2009; Boyce et al, 2010; Hurley and Kwon, 2012; see Annex 2). By carrying out this kind of analysis, it is possible to see whether the effect of an independent variable (such as income) on life satisfaction is moderated or modified by the effect of another variable (such as strong social relationships). This involved testing several hypotheses for protective factors: \u2022 that lack of debt, job security, strong family and social relationships, being married and active leisure time are pro- tective against a low income; \u2022 that being married, volunteering, strong family and social relationships and active leisure time are protective against being unemployed; \u2022 that a high level of satisfaction with the quality of national health services, strong family and social relationships and being married are protective against having a physical or mental health problem, illness or disability; \u2022 that strong family and social relationships, being employed and active leisure time are protective against being divorced. The chapter only reports those results that were found to be significant. If a hypothesis is not discussed, this means that the variable was not found to be significantly protective. Protective factors against the well-being impact of low income No debt The analysis involved testing the hypothesis that not having any debt may be a protective factor against low income. Debt is a well-known cause of low mental health; for example, credit card debt is associated with lower well-being (Brown et al, 2005; Cummins et al, 2004), and Chapter 4 highlighted its detrimental impact on life satisfaction. Figure 35 shows that not being in debt did appear to be a pro- tective factor against low income. People in the lowest income quartile who reported that they had four types of arrears had an average life satisfaction of 5.5 out of 10, whereas those in the same income quartile who had no arrears had an average life satisfaction of 6.7 out of 10. That is a 1.2-point difference. By the time one reaches the highest quartile the detrimen- tal impact of debt is less important \u2013 there is a difference of 0.5 points in life satisfaction between those in the highest income quartile who have no debt (7.7 out of 10) and those who have four types of debt (7.2 out of 10).

For those in the bottom income quartile, even just hav- ing arrears of one type reduces life satisfaction by 1.2 points. This strongly highlights the importance of having policies that particularly help people on low incomes to avoid falling into debt of any kind. Policies like this may help to mitigate the neg- ative well-being impact already associated with a low income. Meanwhile, the effect of debt on people with higher incomes, while still important, is less dramatic. Job security Well-being research has already shown that job insecurity is linked to low well-being (Blanchflower and Oswald, 2011), but could high levels of job security be protective against the well- being impact of low incomes? If so, this may point to policies that prioritise security and stability at work for those on lower wages. Figure 36 illustrates how a more secure employment contract can protect people from the negative impact on life satisfaction of having a low income. Those people in the lowest income quartile with an unlimited permanent contract reported an average life satisfaction of 6.8 out of 10. People in the same income quartile but who were on a fixed-term contract of less than a year reported an average life satisfaction of 5.8. That is a 1.0-point difference in life satisfaction. Interestingly, the life satisfaction of people in the lowest income quartile who were on a fixed-term contract of less than a year was actually lower than the life satisfaction of those people in the same income quartile who did not have a written contract (which was 6.6 out of 10). This evidence supports policies that aim to promote perma- nent and fixed-term contracts of more than a year, and raises concerns about policies that may increase the volume of work- ers on temporary contracts. There is potential for policies to make a huge difference. ",
        "SUBJECTIVE WELL-BEING 76 27 Note that the question specifically asks respondents to exclude contact with family members with whom they actually live.

There is also some evidence to suggest that good social relationships can buffer the negative impact of stress (Huppert 2004; House et al, 1988). The testing here focused on the hypothesis that good fam- ily and social relationships may be a protective factor among those people with a low income. Figures 37 and 38 show that more frequent face-to-face con- tact with parents and more frequent face-to-face contact with siblings were both factors that protected against the effects on well-being of having a very low income. 27 Seeing family often can help to reduce the negative impacts of a low house- hold income. This has implications for economic policies that encourage high levels of geographic mobility and flexibility in the workforce. Interestingly, the frequency of people\u2019s face- to-face contact with friends or neighbours, which was one of the stronger predictors of life satisfaction in Chapter 4, did not offer a specific protective effect for those on low income (it contributes to life satisfaction for people in all income quartiles).

        "SUBJECTIVE WELL-BEING 78 Activities Participation in sports or physical exercise, and participation in social activities of a club, society or an association, were significantly protective against low income, though the effects were less striking. Protective factors against the well-being impact of illness Strong family and social relationships For the same reasons as with low income, the analysis tested whether frequent face-to-face contact with friends and family are protective factors when an individual is severely limited by physical or mental problems, illnesses or disability. The analysis showed that there is a significant protective effect of face-to-face contact with siblings, friends and neighbours, as well as being married/living with a partner, on the life satisfaction of those people who are severely lim- ited by illness. For example, Figure 39 shows that the life satisfaction of someone severely limited by illness but who has face-to-face contact with their children once a week or more is 0.8 points higher than someone with the same level of illness but who only sees their children less than once a month. For people who have no illness, this difference is only 0.1 points.

Frequent contact with friends and neighbours follows a similar pattern and can be translated into a significant benefit in life satisfaction terms of 0.9 points for those severely limited by illness.

This has implications not only for economic policies that impact on geographic mobility of the workforce, but also points to policies that support the kind of informal care and support that many people may be providing to friends and families with illnesses. Figure 40 shows the protective well-being effect that being married or living with a partner can give to people who are severely limited by illness. Figure 40: Life satisfaction for different degrees of limitation by illness, and different marital statuses (scale of 1\u201310) 5.0 5.5 6.0 6.5 7.0 7.5 8.0 No illness Illness but not limited Slightly limited by illness Severely limited by illness Married or living with partner Separated or divorced and not living with partner Widowed and not living with partner Never married and not living with partner The mean life satisfaction of people severely limited by illness is 6.2 if they are married or living with a partner compared to 5.3 if they have never been married and are not living with a partner and 5.5 if they are separated or divorced and not living with a partner. This is a difference of 0.9 points in life satisfac- tion between those who are married and those who have never been married, and 0.7 points between those who are married and those who are separated or divorced. It is important to emphasise that the married category includes people who are not married but are living with a partner, and the three other categories include people who are not living with a partner. This seems to suggest that it is not being married as such that protects against the negative well-being effects of poor health, but having the kind of close support associated with living with a partner. For those people who have no illness, the \u2018benefits\u2019 of being married are not as great: there is a difference of 0.3 points in life satisfaction between those people with no illness who are married, and those who have never married and do not live with a partner. Protective factors against the well-being impact of unemployment Although analyses were carried out for a range of factors \u2013 being married, volunteering, participation in social activities, and frequent face-to-face contact with family, friends and neighbours \u2013 none were significantly protective against the very large negative well-being impact of being unemployed. This finding in itself has important policy implications: if there is no way to temper the destructive impact of unemployment on well-being, then minimising unemployment must remain a priority in national and European employment policy. ",
        "SUBJECTIVE WELL-BEING 80 Protective factors against the well-being impact of divorce When testing the hypotheses that strong family and social relationships, being employed, and active leisure time were protective against the well-being impact of being divorced, it emerged that the only protective factor that was significant was participation in social activities. For those who are divorced and not living with a partner, the difference between participating in the social activities of a club, society or an association once a week or more, versus less frequently than once a month is equivalent to a difference in life satisfaction of 0.9 points. The analysis also showed that this level of social participation was a protective factor for those who are widowed and not living with a partner. Additional analysis was conducted to test whether being employed and more frequent contact with friends and neighbours, parents, children and siblings were significantly protective against the well-being impact of being divorced but there was no evidence to suggest that this was the case. Policy pointers The policy pointers pertaining to this chapter relate to groups that are already particularly vulnerable to experiencing low levels of well-being, because they have low incomes, are unemployed, have physical and/or mental problems, illnesses or disabilities, or are divorced. With regard to policies targeted at these groups, the well-being evidence points towards interventions such as: \u2022 policies that specifically target people on low incomes to help them to avoid getting into debt; \u2022 providing a framework that works towards ensuring less precarious employment for those on low incomes; \u2022 fostering opportunities for physical activity, for example through active transport interventions; \u2022 setting up clubs and societies and prioritising policies that increase accessibility for all members of the community; \u2022 considering the effects of geographical labour mobil- ity on social networks, particularly family networks, and particularly the likely effects on the frequency of face-to- face contact with family. Face-to-face contact with family appears to protect against many of the factors that decrease well-being among the most vulnerable groups in society. In all cases, as with other policy areas, the well-being evi- dence presented here needs to be considered alongside other effects, such as those on productivity and unemploy- ment rates. It emerged from the analysis that there were no protective fac- tors against the negative well-being impact of unemployment, which emphasises the need to prioritise policies that reduce unemployment.

        "SUBJECTIVE WELL-BEING 82 Changes in well- being since 2007 The period leading up to the third wave of the EQLS in 2011 represents the most marked economic downturn in Europe since the Great Depression, with declining industries, rising unemployment rates and mounting public debt. Austerity pro- grammes are in place everywhere. One might expect these events to have had a sharp impact on people\u2019s well-being. However, as Eurofound (2009) has argued, subjective well- being measures may not be the most sensitive to economic conditions. Indeed, while some measures of subjective well- being show significant falls in many countries, life satisfaction has risen overall in Europe since 2007, including in some coun- tries that have supposedly been worst hit by the economic crisis, such as Spain and Italy. This chapter starts by presenting background macroeconomic data for Europe as a whole, and then for different countries. It then presents a picture of the changes in subjective well-being in Europe between 2007 and 2011, exploring different patterns for different countries and country clusters (as defined in Chap- ter 2), different measures and for different demographic groups. Efforts are then made to weave these two types of data (mac- roeconomic and subjective) together to build an understanding of why well-being has changed in the way it has where it has. Macroeconomic and socioeconomic development: 2007\u20132011 The financial and economic crisis reached its peak in 2009 when the GDP of the EU27 went down by 4.3% (compared with the previous year), transforming the real economy vis- ibly and forcing most European Member States to radically restructure public finances. Europe\u2019s economy has drastically changed between the two EQLS waves in 2007 and 2011: unemployment, perhaps the most visible factor of the crisis, rose from 7.2% to 9.7%; the real GDP growth rate reached only 1.5% in 2011 compared to 3.2% in 2007; total social expendi- ture of the EU27 reached 29.3% of GDP compared to 26.1% in 2007; and the total EU27 public deficit grew from 0.9% of GDP to 4.4% of GDP. Table 11 shows how these indicators have changed in each country. In the social democratic countries, the economic impact of the crisis seems to be rather moderate: the GDP growth rates decreased on average by 1.4 percentage points, while unemployment rates increased slightly, as did the risk of poverty and social exclusion. Net disposable household income grew by between 2.5% in the Netherlands and 21.5% in Sweden. The same is true for the corporatist cluster. GDP growth rates decreased only slightly, unemployment rates even fell in Germany and remained stable in Belgium and Austria. Net disposable income increased by between 7.7% in Austria and 10.4% in Belgium. The liberal regime shows considerable decreases of GDP growth rates, rapidly rising unemployment (up to 15% in Ire- land) and also decreasing net incomes. In both the southern European and the post-socialist liberal regime, the situation of the labour market deteriorated severely between 2007 and 2011. Unemployment rates grew by up to 13.4 percentage points in Spain and 11.5 percentage points in Lithuania. However, with the exception of Greece all countries of the southern European and the post-socialist liberal regime show a moderate to slow income growth with the highest rates in Lithuania and Cyprus. The risk of poverty and exclusion, however, increased in most of the southern European and post-socialist liberal countries. In the post-socialist corporatist countries, the situation in the labour market deteriorated slightly in most countries except Poland. In Poland, poverty was significantly reduced since 2007, but it increased in Hungary and Slovenia. The highest growth rates of net disposable income are observed in the Czech Republic (+25.7%) and Slovakia (+33.5%). Incomes also grew considerably in Poland and Slovenia, while they remained nearly unchanged in Hungary. ",
        "cHangEs in wEll-bEing sincE 2007 83 Finally, the 2007 accession cluster, which includes the poor- est Member States (Bulgaria and Romania), shows progress on the poverty front: the risk of poverty or social exclusion declined by 11.6 percentage points in Bulgaria and by 5.6 percentage points in Romania. There are no data on net dis- posable income available for either country. However, gross incomes increased considerably in Bulgaria (2007\u20132010) but decreased slightly in Romania. In both countries, GDP growth rates of 2007 (+6.5%) decreased in 2011 by about 4.5 percent- age points. Unemployment rose in Bulgaria by 4.4 percentage points.

        "SUBJECTIVE WELL-BEING 84 The poor economic climate is visible in the results of the EQLS, when looking at two indicators \u2013 the number of items that households are unable to afford (the deprivation index) and the assessment of how difficult it is to make ends meet (Table 12). Table 12 shows that the percentage of Europeans who could afford all items on the deprivation index list fell from 62% in 2007 to 55% in 2011. Meanwhile, only 25% of Europeans say that their household is able to make ends meet very easily or easily, compared with 33% in 2007.

        "cHangEs in wEll-bEing sincE 2007 85 28 See Eurofound (2013c) for an analysis of the change from 2003 to 2007. 29 The correlation between change in life satisfaction and change in GDP growth rate was R = 0.31, and between change in life satisfaction and change in poverty rate it was R = -0.45. Europeans were also less optimistic in 2011. Some 26% strongly disagreed or disagreed when asked if they were optimistic about the future, which was four percentage points higher than in 2007. Meanwhile, 34% of the European popu- lation said that the financial situation of their household was worse than 12 months previously, while only 11% said that it was better now. Similarly, around 30% expect their financial situation to deteriorate for the 12 months to come, while 15% expect the situation to improve. Changes in well-being since 2007 How do these changes compare with changes in subjec- tive well-being? Figure 41 shows life satisfaction in 2007 and 2011. 28 Overall, life satisfaction rose across Europe, from 7.0 in 2007 to 7.1 in 2011. However, there were different patterns for different countries. The eight countries with the highest aver- age life satisfaction in 2007 all saw drops in 2011. In four cases (Sweden, Finland, the Netherlands and Malta), these drops were significant. This was despite the relatively benign eco- nomic climate in these countries. However, at the same time, many countries that previously had lower levels of well-being (Bulgaria, Hungary, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Portugal and Romania) have seen their life satisfaction increasing. In some newer Member States (for example, Bulgaria, Latvia, Lithuania and Poland), this represents the continuation of a trend that had begun before 2007. In the cases of Italy and Por- tugal, as well as Spain (which also saw a significant increase in life satisfaction), the rise happened despite apparently severe economic difficulties. Overall, however, there are mild correlations between the changes in life satisfaction for each country and the changes in macroeconomic conditions \u2013 the countries that have suf- fered the biggest deteriorations tending to be the ones that saw decreases in life satisfaction, or the smallest increases. 29 For example, the three countries whose GDP growth rates fell most sharply (Greece, Slovakia and Slovenia) all suffered sig- nificant declines in life satisfaction. Figure 41: Life satisfaction as measured in 2007 and 2011, by country (scale of 1\u201310) 4.5 5.0 5.5 6.0 6.5 7.0 7.5 8.0 8.5 9.0 BG* HU* EL* LV* EE* SK* CZ* LT* RO* PT* IT* SI* PL* CY DE FR MT* UK BE IE ES* AT* NL* LU SE* FI* DK L i f e s a t i s f a c t i o n 2011 2007 Note: * The change is significant at the 0.05 level. In Table 13, the data also include changes in other subjective well-being outcomes and material deprivation for all EU coun- tries clustered by welfare regime. When life satisfaction is put alongside other well-being indicators, the picture for Europe looks less healthy. Overall, happiness decreased across Europe, while the social exclusion index rose. There was no significant change in the WHO-5 index in either direction. Furthermore, if one creates a synthetic indicator combining the happiness measure and life satisfaction, there was no sig- nificant change either. In other words, subjective well-being was stagnant in Europe. Looking at the data by country, a few clear winners appear \u2013 specifically Denmark, Austria, Italy, Portugal, Bulgaria and ",
        "SUBJECTIVE WELL-BEING 86 Romania. These countries all see significant improvements in some or all areas of subjective well-being, without seeing any concomitant falls. Poland also does not suffer any significant fall in well-being, though it only sees a significant increase in life satisfaction. At the other end of the spectrum, Finland, the Netherlands, Sweden, Belgium, Luxembourg, the UK, Greece, Malta, the Czech Republic, Slovenia, Slovakia, and Estonia all suffer significant falls in at least two measures. In the cases of the Netherlands, Sweden and Greece, there are significant drops in well-being in all measures. Meanwhile, Germany and France fare reasonably well, each seeing a significant fall in only one subjective well-being measure. Looking at the country clusters, the social democratic regime sees a significant fall in all four well-being measures. The cor- poratist, liberal, post-socialist corporatist and post-socialist liberal welfare regime countries also fare poorly overall. The only country cluster that does well overall is the 2007 acces- sion regime (Bulgaria and Romania). Surprisingly, southern Europe also does well in terms of life satisfaction and the WHO- 5, though it suffers a significant increase in perceived social exclusion, as do most parts of Europe. How do these patterns compare with the macroeconomic story? Two anomalies are most striking. First, there have been consistent falls in subjective well-being in the social democratic countries (with the exception of Denmark) despite a relatively benign economic climate. Most notable in this respect is Swe- den, which saw a decrease in life satisfaction of 0.3 points, despite a 21.5% increase in median household income, and the fact that the growth rate in 2011 was actually slightly higher than that in 2007. As has been suggested elsewhere, this may be the result of perceived dangers/risks of the economic crisis (Eurofound, 2012). However, it may also reflect other changes in social democratic regimes not covered by these data, such as a new increase in economic inequality in the Nordic coun- tries (OECD, 2011). Secondly, the severe economic problems in southern Europe are not reflected in the subjective well-being patterns \u2013 which are generally positive in the region (with the exception of Greece). Box 2: A question of survey design Why has happiness fallen more consistently than life satisfaction? One potential explanation may unfortunately be related to questionnaire design. Responses to the overall life satisfaction question are influenced by what questions come before in the survey. In the 2007 EQLS, life satisfaction directly followed the social exclusion index items, which are all negatively worded. In 2011, however, a question on feeling close to people in one\u2019s local area was inserted between the social exclusion index ques- tions and the life satisfaction question. This positively worded question might have reset people\u2019s responses, meaning that they responded more positively to the life satisfaction question. This change in response bias might have offset the fall in well-being that was seen in other indicators such as the happiness question.

        "SUBJECTIVE WELL-BEING 88 Changes for different demographic groups As well as exploring different patterns for different countries, the analysis explores how the crisis has affected different pop- ulation groups. Have certain population groups been affected more by the crisis than others? Does increasing life satisfaction in transitional economies affect different age groups in different ways? The study first looks at the EU as a whole, before look- ing at these patterns in different country clusters. Table 15 illustrates changes in four subjective well-being indi- cators for the EU27 as a whole. The pattern is consistently negative for the 18\u201324 age group and for the 50\u201364 age group. Both show deterioration in happiness and the WHO-5. The older group, furthermore, reported considerable increases in perceived social exclusion. People in the lowest income quartile also fare poorly, with significant decreases in happi- ness and the WHO-5, as do students. The income quartile that fares best is the third quartile, with significant increases in life satisfaction and the WHO-5, and only a small decrease in happiness. Meanwhile, in central and eastern European countries, the pat- terns seem more coherent. Romania and Bulgaria have seen improving living conditions, and this has been matched by increasing subjective well-being. Meanwhile, the post-socialist liberal countries have suffered considerably from the crisis, and this is matched by generally declining subjective well-being. The analysis also looked at changes in satisfaction with vari- ous domains of life for Europe as a whole (Table 14). Scores for satisfaction with accommodation and with social life increased by 0.1 points, while there was no change in satisfaction in rela- tion to two domains: education and standard of living. The mean level of satisfaction with family life and health declined by 0.1 points. In 2011, the EQLS also asked Europeans about their satisfaction with the economic situation in their country. This item shows by far the lowest average score (4.1).

        "SUBJECTIVE WELL-BEING 90 Patterns in different welfare regimes \u2013 age groups Both improvements and deteriorations in life satisfaction affect age groups differently according to welfare regime: deteriora- tions in the social democratic regime were experienced mostly by the 25\u201334 age group, which had decreases in life satisfac- tion and happiness and also reported the highest increases of social exclusion, while in the liberal regime drops in well-being were the most pronounced for people in late working life aged between 50 and 64. This group saw falls in life satisfaction, happiness and the WHO-5 from 2007 to 2011. Conversely, people aged 65 and older in the liberal regime had increased life satisfaction and lowered feelings of social exclusion. In Greece, the youngest age group (18\u201324) and people in their early (25\u201334) and late (50\u201364) working life experienced the biggest drops in well-being. Improvements in life satisfaction and happiness, however, were particularly reported by the middle-aged (35\u201349) and the old-aged group (65+) in the southern European regime. Both groups also saw significant increases in the WHO-5, while the youngest age group in the southern countries saw no changes in life satisfaction and happiness but increased feelings of social exclusion. Positive change in life satisfaction in the Baltic countries (post- socialist liberal) is observed above all in the youngest age group (18\u201324), while happiness decreased for people aged 65 or older. Most pronounced increases in life satisfaction in Romania and Bulgaria (2007 accession cluster) were expe- rienced by young people aged 18\u201324 and 25\u201334. Those in the latter age group in the accession countries also had the biggest drops of perceived social exclusion and the largest increases of the WHO-5. Patterns in different welfare regimes \u2013 employment status In the southern European cluster, people at work enjoyed some of the biggest increases in life satisfaction, happiness and the WHO-5. In the 2007 accession cluster, people in education or students also experienced clear improvements in well-being. In the southern European cluster, retired people were also among those who improved their well-being considerably, with higher values of life satisfaction and the WHO-5 than in 2007. The large decrease in life satisfaction affected practically all groups in Greece. Patterns in different welfare regimes \u2013 income Some very interesting developments can be observed by look- ing at income quartiles. Looking at Europe overall, there is an indication that the crisis was having a differential effect on the well-being of people in different income quartiles \u2013 with improv- ing well-being for the third quartile and the largest deterioration for people in the bottom quartile. Looking at different country clusters (Table 16), this pattern is particularly characteristic of two country clusters \u2013 the liberal countries and southern Europe (including Greece). Table 16: Changes in well-being, by country cluster and income quartile Social democratic regime Liberal regime Southern regime Post- socialist liberal regime Accession countries Greece Measure Income quartile Life satisfaction lowest - -0.4 - - 0.7 -1.0 second - - - - 0.4 -0.7 third -0.2 - 0.2 - 0.5 - Highest - 0.2 0.3 - - - ",
        "cHangEs in wEll-bEing sincE 2007 91 For example, in Greece, average life satisfaction fell by 1.0 for people in the bottom quartile, and 0.7 for people in the second quartile, while it did not fall significantly for the top two income quartiles. For happiness, the two lowest income quartiles have bigger drops than the third and the top income quartiles. For the WHO-5 indicator, falls were only significant for the lowest income quartile. In the rest of southern Europe, significant increases in life satisfaction and happiness, and decreases in the social exclu- sion index are found only in the top two income quartiles. The second income quartile suffered significant increases in social exclusion and decreases in happiness. In other words, it is not true to say that southern European countries are enjoy- ing increasing well-being despite the economic crisis. Rather, higher income quartiles are enjoying increasing well-being in those countries, whereas the bottom half of society is either remaining constant or indeed suffering deteriorating well-being (see Table 17). A similar pattern can be seen in the liberal cluster. For exam- ple, the bottom income quartile in the liberal cluster saw a significant drop in life satisfaction of 0.4, while the top quartile saw a significant increase in life satisfaction of 0.2. Similarly, happiness and the WHO-5 fell significantly only for those in the bottom quartile. These patterns are not seen across Europe. For example, in the 2007 accession cluster, the opposite has taken place, with the greatest increases in life satisfaction and the WHO-5 enjoyed by the bottom income quartile. In the social demo- cratic regime, decreases in happiness appear to have affected all income quartiles evenly.

        "cHangEs in wEll-bEing sincE 2007 93 Other variables that were found partly to explain the increase in life satisfaction in southern Europe were the domain satisfac- tions \u2013 with large increases in satisfaction with social life, family life and accommodation. Social and family life satisfaction between them explain over half of the increase in life satisfac- tion. Might it be that, despite the economic crisis, people\u2019s family and social lives have improved in southern European countries (again, excluding Greece) and that this has more than compensated for the economic hardship? For example, Stefano Bartolini argues that changes in social capital explain changes in subjective well-being better than economic indi- cators do (Bartolini and Bilancini, 2010). However, one should be somewhat wary about over-interpreting these results. It was not possible to compare more \u2018objective\u2019 social indica- tors between the survey waves, and any biases influencing life satisfaction responses might also be influencing responses to other satisfaction questions. Conclusions The preliminary finding of a significant increase in life satis- faction in Europe may be surprising at first sight, but further analysis reveals nuances and details that provide more clues. \u2022 The increase in life satisfaction came alongside an increase in perceived social exclusion and a decrease in reported happiness. It was not possible to explain the different direc- tions of change for life satisfaction and happiness, but the difference highlights the importance of looking at more than one indicator when assessing subjective well-being. In this context, it suggests that well-being did not increase across Europe overall between 2007 and 2011, and that social exclusion indeed increased. \u2022 The pattern varied considerably across Europe. While signif- icant increases in well-being were seen in southern Europe (with the exception of Greece) and in the 2007 accession cluster of Bulgaria and Romania, all other clusters saw a Linking changes in life satisfaction with other changes The EQLS includes a rich selection of information that might help explain the changes in life satisfaction from 2007 to 2011. Including this information in multivariate regression helps in exploring why life satisfaction increased for some people, par- ticularly those in southern Europe. Controlling for demographics and core variables (see Chapter 4), people in the EU27 in 2011 had a life satisfaction score of 0.05 points higher than people in 2007 with the same characteristics (Table 18). In southern Europe, the difference was 0.12, and in the 2007 accession cluster it was 0.06. Including four indicators of material living conditions into the regression model, the impact of the year is reduced, but not eliminated, particularly in the 2007 accession cluster. In other words, some of the increase in life satisfaction in the 2007 accession cluster can be explained by improvements in reported material living conditions.

        "SUBJECTIVE WELL-BEING 94 general decrease, particularly the social democratic clus- ter, but also the corporatist and the liberal clusters. Overall, the pattern is intuitive \u2013 with countries that have suffered the biggest falls in GDP growth also suffering significant decreases in life satisfaction. This applies both between and within clusters. For example, Poland and Germany do better than many of their neighbours both in terms of mac- roeconomic measures and subjective well-being measures. \u2022 However, there are some apparent anomalies \u2013 specifi- cally the rising life satisfaction in many southern European countries, and the declines in life satisfaction in the social democratic countries (with the exception of Denmark), despite relatively mild economic difficulties. \u2022 The pattern also differed according to demographic and socioeconomic groups. In terms of age, it appeared to be people at both ends of the working-age population that suffered the most, namely those aged 18\u201324 and those aged 50\u201364. Students also suffered significant decreases in subjective well-being. \u2022 In terms of income, the well-being gap between the rich- est and poorest in southern Europe, liberal countries and post-socialist liberal countries increased. Indeed, with the exception of the 2007 accession cluster, the well-being of those in the bottom income quartile did not increase any- where under any measure. In summary, the economic crisis may not be affecting every- one\u2019s well-being equally, nor all aspects of well-being. It is the poorest people in Europe, particularly in southern Europe, the post-socialist liberal countries and the liberal countries, that are suffering the most in terms of personal subjective well-being. A sense of social exclusion is affecting a broader constituency. Furthermore, while the social democratic countries appear to be doing well on standard macroeconomic measures such as GDP and median income, the data for subjective well-being suggest a growing disquiet in those countries that is affecting most socioeconomic groups. Policy pointers In many countries, the economic crisis is affecting the well- being of lower income groups more than wealthier groups. As well as defying the EU\u2019s stated intentions of reducing inequal- ity, this pattern could potentially lead to growing instability and social strife \u2013 something that is already happening in southern Europe, where the phenomenon is strongest. National and European policymakers should therefore work to ensure that the pains of the crisis are shared more equally (European Com- mission, 2012b, p. 11). The results also provide a warning signal for social democratic countries. While GDP growth and income growth has not been damaged as much in these countries, subjective well-being has fallen on all measures and across the income spectrum. Might this also be associated with the rising inequality in many of these countries? Meanwhile, the increases in well-being in Bulgaria and Roma- nia show that economic improvements there are bearing rewards. Most promising is that it is the lower income quartiles that are seeing the fastest rises in well-being. Nevertheless, Bulgaria is still the country with the lowest well-being in Europe and obviously has some way to go. Falling well-being among those aged 18\u201324 and those aged 50\u201364 might reflect a situation where these two groups are being squeezed out of the labour market. Youth unemployment is already a key priority in EU policy \u2013 these results highlight its relevance to well-being. For those aged 50\u201364, falling well- being is particularly worrying given their low starting point. In the liberal regime, where this group are among the most affected, measures should be taken to address their needs and to assure that their skills and experiences can be fruitfully used as a social and economic resource.

        "SUBJECTIVE WELL-BEING 96 Conclusions The collection of well-being data on a large scale is now becoming established. This report has attempted to link the findings of well-being research with a wide range of policy areas, something that to date has not happened enough. Well- being data alone cannot result in policy decisions. But the findings highlighted in this report all provide important evidence to be considered in policymaking. Sometimes the findings sup- port existing policies. At other times, they highlight potential difficulties with dominant thinking. Where the latter is the case, it should not be expected that the results change policy over- night. Nonetheless, if well-being is to be taken seriously, then it is exactly in these areas where the greatest consideration should be given to the evidence, and where the greatest efforts should be made to develop the overall picture of well-being, by bringing together longitudinal data, and by modelling indirect and long-term effects. Who has low well-being? First, this report identified the countries that have low or decreasing well-being. For instance, Bulgaria, Greece and Hungary were found to have the lowest levels of life satisfac- tion in Europe (see Chapter 2). Cyprus and Latvia also have particularly low scores on several measures of overall well- being. Meanwhile, certain countries do poorly on particular aspects of well-being \u2013 for example, high levels of stress and busyness are found in France, high levels of loneliness in Italy and low levels of vitality in the UK. The analysis in Chapter 6, which looked at changes since 2007, sounds warning bells for Finland, the Netherlands and Sweden \u2013 all having falling subjective well-being scores despite the effects of the eco- nomic crisis appearing relatively benign. It is Estonia and Greece, however, that have suffered the sharpest falls in well- being since 2007. Specific population groups with low or falling well-being have also been identified. Targeted policies may be helpful to improve the well-being of these groups. The study identified a few groups as having consistently low well-being: unemployed people; people with illnesses or disabilities that limit their daily activities; people with lower levels of education; people who are separated or divorced; and people in the bottom income quar- tile (Chapter 3). It also confirmed earlier findings that Europeans aged 35\u201350 have the lowest well-being, with both younger people and older people enjoying higher levels. The data also show that people living in rural areas have higher well-being, particularly in the older EU15 Member States. Meanwhile, the trend analysis showed that the rather confused pattern in terms of changes in average well-being since 2007 hides a much clearer pattern in many parts of Europe, when one breaks the analysis up into income quartiles (Chapter 6). Doing so reveals that lower income quartiles have suffered the highest well-being declines, while the top income quartiles have seen their well-being rise in several countries, including in southern Europe. The well-being of students, those aged 18\u201324 and those aged 50\u201364 has also fallen since 2007. In the latter case, this is particularly the case for countries in the liberal cluster (Ireland and the UK). In considering specific countries, the analysis looked at where inequalities in well-being are the largest. For example, the larg- est well-being difference between the top and bottom income quartiles are to be found in Bulgaria, although the difference has decreased since 2007. Cyprus suffers the largest ine- quality in well-being between men and women, while it is in Slovakia that people with severe limitations from health prob- lems suffer the largest well-being penalty. Overall, the highest amount of well-being inequality was found in Romania \u2013 with the most satisfied 20% of the population reporting average life satisfaction (on a scale of 1\u201310) that was 6.6 points higher than the least satisfied 20%. Who has high well-being? Well-being data are not just about identifying problems \u2013 they can also help identify models of success. At the national level, it is the countries in the social democratic cluster \u2013 Denmark, followed by Finland, Sweden and the Netherlands \u2013 that have the highest levels of well-being on most measures. The Neth- erlands also has the lowest level of well-being inequality in Europe. It is important to note that these countries do not perform well just because they are wealthy. Denmark and Swe- den have lower GDPs per capita than Ireland, and Finland has a lower GDP per capita than Germany. Meanwhile, further down the spectrum, Poland scores much higher in life satis- faction than Hungary, despite having a slightly lower level of GDP per capita. These differences provide important lessons. ",
        "conclusions 97 Whereas policymakers seeking to maximise GDP might look to Germany, Hungary and Ireland for lessons, those seeking to increase well-being would do better looking at Denmark, Finland, Poland or Sweden. In the economic crisis, few countries can be said to be doing well in terms of well-being. While the countries in the southern European cluster, with the exception of Greece, have seen average well-being rise, this rise has benefited only higher income quartiles. Beyond that group, only five countries have seen relatively positive well-being transformations since 2007. Bulgaria and Romania have seen increases in well-being, and these rises have been greatest in lower income quartiles. Aus- tria has seen large increases in well-being, but there is reason to suspect that the results for Austria in 2007 may be an anom- aly. The only other countries to do relatively well are Denmark and Poland. In Chapter 5, analysis of individual-level data helped to explore protective factors \u2013 characteristics associated with having rela- tively high well-being despite suffering from some risk factor, such as low income or bad health. Protective factors against low income and poor health included not being in debt, having a permanent employment contract, engaging in physical activ- ity or social activities, and having regular face-to-face contact with family members. Policymakers can use these findings to ensure that relevant policies focus on those who would ben- efit from them most. What are the key policy areas for well-being? As outlined in Chapter 4, the key determinants of subjective well-being are: material deprivation, health and being limited by disability, work\u2013life balance, public services and social rela- tionships. As such, the evidence presented here suggests that the well-being of Europeans would benefit from: \u2022 a focus on efforts to tackle poverty and integrate people with disabilities; \u2022 strengthening the working hours directive, or other policies that could lead to reducing working hours and improving work\u2013life balance; \u2022 maintaining the quality of public services in the face of aus- terity, particularly, it seems, in southern Europe; \u2022 recognising the importance of relationships to people\u2019s well- being. For example, social support is weakest in countries in the liberal cluster. It is proposed that the unintended well- being consequences of certain economic policies should be considered. What specific lessons can be drawn for well-being? Chapter 4 also provided a wealth of more detailed lessons related to specific policy areas and the eight domains of qual- ity of life covered in the research. Some of the most interesting lessons are noted below. They are structured according to standard policy areas so that the improvement of well-being can be considered as one objective among several across all the policy areas mentioned below. Macroeconomic policy \u2022 Well-being evidence suggests a clear benefit of reducing income inequalities within a country. The relationship between income and well-being is one of diminishing returns, meaning that income increases for poorer people will have a larger well-being benefit than income increases for wealthier people. The fact that material deprivation was a much stronger predictor of well-being than income high- lights that it is the bottom of the distribution where material gains are most likely to be important for well-being. Further- more, evidence exists of a correlation between inequality and trust in others \u2013 a factor that was shown to strongly determine well-being in the EQLS. Rising inequality may be an explanatory factor behind falling well-being in the countries belonging to the social democratic cluster, despite rising average incomes. \u2022 Being unemployed has one of the biggest negative effects of any single factor on well-being. This highlights the impor- tance that macroeconomic policy should place on reducing unemployment. Labour market policy \u2022 The report points to a distinction between the well-being relevance of reducing unemployment versus increasing employment. While those who are unemployed or unable to work have very low well-being, students, retired people and homemakers do not suffer any overall well-being penalty. In fact, all other things being equal, retirement had a positive impact on well-being for those aged 55 to 65, compared with people at work (though this pattern was not found in the clusters formed from central and eastern European countries). The argument for raising the retirement age is grounded in concerns about maintaining economic activity, which in turn has an effect on well-being. Further analysis is necessary to understand the longer-term and indirect effect that changes to retirement policy can have on well- being. Only then can one assess the relative importance of the potential negative effect on well-being found in this ",
        "SUBJECTIVE WELL-BEING 98 study. It may be that the net long-term effect on well-being of increasing the retirement age is positive. \u2022 There is a large well-being penalty for people on temporary contracts of less than 12 months. Indeed the difference in life satisfaction between being on a permanent contract and being on a short-term temporary contract is bigger than the difference between being on a short-term temporary con- tract and being unemployed. Again, long-term and indirect effects need to be considered, but the findings do highlight the need to evaluate the balance of the positive and nega- tive impacts of changes to labour market policy. \u2022 Work flexibility, work\u2013life balance and working hours were confirmed to be important determinants of life satisfaction, with those working over 41 hours a week seeming to suf- fer in terms of their reported well-being. Most likely, the negative effects on well-being of working long hours are mediated by having less time to spend on social interac- tions and leisure activities \u2013 two of the strongest drivers of well-being. The evidence suggests that policies to curtail the numbers of people working very long hours would increase average well-being. \u2022 Given the vital importance of personal relationships, caution is needed when it comes to policies designed to increase economic activity and productivity as these might have unintended consequences. For example, what is the impact of increasing geographical labour mobility in terms of social networks, family and neighbourhood belonging? Based on available evidence, it is important to consider the wider implications for subjective well-being, and the trade-offs implied by particular approaches, at an early stage in the policy design process. Social protection and social care \u2022 Material deprivation is not just about the basics \u2013 being able to engage in social and leisure activities appears to be as important, if not more so. \u2022 It is important to provide support for people who have to care for elderly or disabled people, especially in the demo- graphic context of population ageing. \u2022 Not having support from social networks has a strong effect on well-being. State provision of such support can help, but is not always a substitute for more personal support. An area where it is of particular importance, and where institutions may be able to contribute, is support with housekeeping when people are too ill or frail to manage by themselves. Local government, planning and transport \u2022 The data highlight the independent positive effect on well- being of living in more rural areas. This knowledge enables urban policymakers to examine which positive elements of rural life may be transferable to urban contexts. For example, access to green space was found to be a strong predictor of life satisfaction. The findings also highlight the importance of maintaining opportunities for living in rural areas, particularly in terms of ensuring there are employ- ment opportunities. \u2022 The research provides clear indicators of the kind of neigh- bourhood problems that influence well-being: crime and vandalism being the most important. This provides some indications towards policy priorities for local and central governments, particularly in a context of reducing fiscal space. Even so, litter and water quality are both significant predictors of life satisfaction. \u2022 Three findings were relevant in relation to transport planning. First, noise and poor air quality had important detrimental impacts on well-being. Second, aside from recreational and green space, one of the most important amenities for well-being was access to public transport. Third, physi- cal activity had a surprisingly strong positive effect on well-being. These three findings combined point towards transport policy that provides greater public transport facili- ties and facilitates more active transport modes such as cycling and walking. Regional policy \u2022 Well-being data can provide evidence of \u2018black spots\u2019 \u2013 areas with lower well-being \u2013 which might not neces- sarily have been identified using other data. This process of identification may be useful for decisions about where to direct resources, both at the national and the EU level. For example, people living in urban areas reported having lower well-being than might be anticipated using standard objective measures. Culture and citizen engagement \u2022 Besides physical activity, attendance of club or society social activities also had a positive effect on well-being, while access to cultural amenities was a significant predic- tor. The challenge during difficult economic times is not to lose sight of the importance of providing opportunities for those kinds of cultural and social activities. \u2022 The findings point to a positive effect of volunteering on the mental well-being index (WHO-5). Providing opportunities ",
        "conclusions 99 to volunteer may also be important in helping achieve other policy goals, such as providing the care and social support that have been noted to be important. Education \u2022 Physical activity is a habit learned young \u2013 as such, it is a central part of the school day, both encouraging children to use active travel to get to school, and in terms of timetabled activities within school. \u2022 Being in arrears was one of the key characteristics of people with low well-being, and not being in arrears was found to be an important protective factor for those on low incomes. Financial literacy training might help people understand the risks and pitfalls of getting into unmanageable debt. \u2022 Education was not found to be an independent predictor of life satisfaction, once other factors were controlled for (though it did predict other measures of well-being such as the elements of the eudaimonia index). Nevertheless, it is an important predictor of income and health \u2013 both of which are very relevant to well-being. Access to education plays an important role in ensuring the social mobility that will guarantee that those born into lower-income families do not stay at the bottom of the ladder. Finance and banking \u2022 Access to banking services was, perhaps surprisingly, a significant predictor of life satisfaction. This is particularly relevant in a context where many services are moving away from the high street and onto the internet. \u2022 Aside from financial literacy education (as mentioned above), another way to tackle debt may be through poli- cies aimed at reducing the unsustainable use of personal loans. Often, those on low incomes are only able to access credit at very high rates of interest or through more informal arrangements. The data from this study highlighted that having such informal loans is actually the biggest predictor of low well-being. ",

        "SUBJECTIVE WELL-BEING 108 Annex 2: Statistical techniques used This report is based on statistical analyses of EQLS data. Most of these analyses were carried out using SPSS statistical soft- ware. The descriptions below explain the principles behind these analyses. Factor analysis To examine whether different variables can be grouped together, factor analysis is conducted. Factor analysis is a sta- tistical method used to discover if there are a few \u2018factors\u2019 that reflect the variations among a larger group of variables. This can happen when there are unobserved variables that explain variations in a larger set of observed variables. In this case, the variables \u2018load on\u2019 to the factors. Factor analysis was used in this report to establish if any of the subjective well-being variables were related to each other. For example, when factor analysis was carried out on the third EQLS data, it was found that four variables \u2013 time pressure (Q29d), autonomy (Q29c), calm and relaxed (Q45b), and tense (Q46a) \u2013 loaded together on a factor. This means that this one factor \u2013 interpreted here as a \u2018stress and busyness\u2019 fac- tor \u2013 could successfully explain variation in the four individual variables. Several other factors were discovered in the analy- sis, many of which were used to create synthetic variables (see synthetic subjective well-being indicators). Standardising scores Standardising scores is a statistical technique to allow com- parisons to be made across different measures, by converting scores into the number of standard deviations an observa- tion is above or below the mean. As there are now no scales attached to the measures, the two scores can be compared. This technique was used in the analysis for this report, for example in order to combine variables into synthetic subjec- tive well-being indicators. Standardised scores are also known as z-scores. Multivariate regression analysis To assess the relative importance of different factors for subjec- tive well-being, this report used multivariate regression analysis. Multivariate regression analysis examines the separate effects of a number of independent variables on a single dependent variable (for the purposes of this report, this was usually one of the measures of subjective well-being) to identify the factors that are statistically related, controlling for the effects of the other variables, and to compare their relative strength. In addition to indicating the predictive value of the overall model, regression analysis indicates how well each independ- ent variable predicts the dependent variable, controlling for each of the other independent variables. These are shown by the size of the B and beta coefficients\u2013 either non-standardised or standardised (see standardising scores) \u2013 the larger the coefficient, the stronger the effect of the independent variable in predicting the dependent variable. In this report, regression analyses were carried out for several dif- ferent dependent variables, including life satisfaction, perceived social exclusion, the WHO-5 mental well-being index, loneliness, hedonic well-being, eudaimonic well-being, stress and happiness. Independent variables included demographic, social, economic and other variables, all of which are listed in Annex 1. Calculating interaction variables In some cases, the effect of an independent variable on the dependent variable is moderated or modified by the effect of another variable. For example, the effect of income on some- body\u2019s life satisfaction may be moderated by the effect of their employment status. To test whether the interaction of these two variables (in this example the interaction between income and employment) is a good predictor of the dependent variable (in this example life satisfaction), an interaction variable is con- structed. The interaction variable is the product of the original variables (income x unemployment). This interaction variable is then added to the regression analysis to see whether it is indeed a predictor of the dependent variable. ",
        "ANNEx 2: stAtistiCAL tECHNiQuEs usED 109 Interaction variables were used in this report to explore whether there are protective factors that moderate the negative effect on life satisfaction of having a low income (see Chapter 6). Comparing means and t-tests The comparison of means was used several times in this report, particularly when considering the patterns of different types of subjective well-being across the EU. Statistical software is used to compare the average value of a variable, for example life satisfaction or income, between different groups of respond- ents, for example by country, age group, or educational level. To assess whether the means of two groups are statistically different from each other, a t-test is carried out. This tests the difference between their means relative to the spread or vari- ability of their scores and is used in this report in many cases when establishing that two averages are statistically different from each other. Unlike multivariate regression analysis, t-tests are bi variate \u2013 in other words, they ignore the effect of other vari- ables that might be important in explaining a difference. Residuals (difference from mean after controlling other variables) The residual, for any given individual in the survey, is the dif- ference between their reported well-being and the well-being they would be expected to have given the regression model \u2013 the difference from the mean for any individuals after con- trolling for other variables. This makes it possible to control for differences in a range of variables (depending on the analysis required) and a comparison between the well-being of different groups on a like-for-like basis to look at the effects of specific determinants. For example, groups of individuals with different levels of education may have different mean life satisfaction scores, but when other variables are controlled for, such as income and health, the residuals show the effect that educa- tion may have on life satisfaction beyond the other differences between the two groups, so the two groups compared are now the same in every respect apart from their level of education. Calculation of means for quintiles For the life satisfaction scale, the mean for quintiles was cal- culated. Since there are only 10 possible responses on the life satisfaction scale, it is rarely the case that response categories fit neatly into 20% bands. For example, if 15% of respond- ents respond 1\u20135, and 10% respond 6, then the mean life satisfaction of the bottom quintile needs to be the average of those responding 1\u20135 and half of those responding 6. Therefore, to calculate the mean, all respondents in each country were ordered by life satisfaction. Respondents with the same life satisfaction scores were ranked randomly. The rank function was used in SPSS to assign respondents into equally sized quintiles for each country. This was done with within-country weightings. In this way, all the quintiles for each country had the same N +-1. Mean life satisfaction scores were then calculated for each quintile for each country. Mean pair distance The mean pair distance is a measure of inequality within a population. For any given variable (for example life satisfaction), it is the average difference between two randomly selected people within the population. It can be calculated with a basic frequency table, simply working out all the differences between each pair of respondents, summing them all up, and dividing that by the number of possible combinations of respondents. As is mentioned in Chapter 3, it is related to the Gini coefficient, which is widely used with income distributions. To calculate the mean pair distance from the Gini coefficient, one must simply multiply the Gini by twice the mean of the population. So if the Gini coefficient of income for a country is 0.3, and the mean income is \u20ac15,000, then the mean pair distance is \u20ac9,000. That means that if any two people in the population are selected, the average difference in income between them would be \u20ac9,000. As discussed in Abdallah (2012), the mean pair distance is more appropriate for a measure such as life satisfaction because it is not a ratio measure. It is meaningful to say that \u20ac400 is twice as much as \u20ac200, but it is not meaningful to say that a life satisfaction score of 4 is twice as much as 2. Weighting For all cross-country analyses, w5_EU27 was used. This weighting variable combines the within-country design weights with a weighting so that all data from each country are weighted according to the size of the country (so data from Germany are weighted higher than data from Luxembourg). This method was also applied in cluster analyses where countries of different population sizes were pooled together and in order to ensure that small countries did not influence results unduly. W4 was used for analyses whereby a separate figure for each country (or for one country only) was calculated. ",

        "This report assesses the impact of the crisis on the subjective well-being of Europeans. In 2011, GDP per capita in 22 out of the then 27 EU Member States was below 2008 levels, and unemployment rates were higher in 25 out of the 27. These indicators demonstrate worrying trends, but the report goes deeper, trying to answer various questions: What is the real impact on people\u2019s lives? Who has been hit hardest? Where have there been positive well- being patterns? What explains the variation in well-being across Europe? How can policy increase or stem the fall in well-being in the future? It concludes that the crisis may not be affecting everyone\u2019s well-being equally, nor all aspects of well-being. Well-being has fallen in many EU countries, remaining highest in northern countries. However, falls in well- being in many western EU countries have been matched by increases in eastern countries. Population groups with low well-being include those limited by disability or illness and unemployed people. T J - 03 - 13 - 423 - E N - C "
