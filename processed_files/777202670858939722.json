        "REGULATION (EC) No 1717/2006 OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL of 15 November 2006 establishing an Instrument for Stability THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION, Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Articles 179(1) and 181a thereof, Having regard to the proposal from the Commission, Acting in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 251 of the Treaty ( 1 ), Whereas: (1) The Community is a major provider of economic, financial, technical, humanitarian and macroeconomic assistance to third countries. The promotion of stable conditions for human and economic development and the promotion of human rights, democracy and fundamental freedoms remains one of the prime objectives of European Union (hereinafter referred to as \u2018the EU\u2019) external action to which Community instruments for external assistance contribute. The Council and the Representatives of the Governments of the Member States meeting within the Council, in their November 2004 Conclusions on the effec \u00ad tiveness of EU External Action, concluded that \u2018peace, security and stability as well as human rights, democracy and good governance, are essential elements for sustainable economic growth and poverty eradication\u2019. (2) The EU Programme for the Prevention of Violent Conflicts, endorsed by the European Council, underlines the EU's \u2018political commitment to pursue conflict prevention as one of the main objectives of the EU's external relations\u2019 and states that Community development cooperation instruments can contribute to this goal and to the development of the EU as a global player. (3) Measures taken under this Regulation in pursuit of the objectives of Articles 177 and 181a of the Treaty establishing the European Community (hereinafter referred to as \u2018the EC Treaty\u2019) may be complementary to and should be consistent with measures adopted by the EU in pursuit of Common Foreign and Security Policy objectives within the framework of Title V and measures adopted within the framework of Title VI of the Treaty on European Union (hereinafter referred to as \u2018the EU Treaty\u2019). The Council and the Commission should cooperate to ensure such consistency, each in accordance with their respective powers. \u25bc B 2006R1717 \u2014 EN \u2014 14.12.2006 \u2014 000.001 \u2014 2 ( 1 ) Opinion of the European Parliament delivered on 6 July 2006 (not yet published in the Official Journal) and Council Decision of 7 November 2006. ",
        "(4) The European Consensus on Development, adopted by the Council and the Representatives of the Governments of the Member States meeting within the Council, the European Parliament and the Commission on 22 November 2005 and welcomed by the European Council on 15 and 16 December 2005, states that the Community, within the respective competences of its institutions, will develop a comprehensive prevention approach to State fragility, conflict, natural disasters and other types of crises, to which goal this Regulation should contribute. (5) The European Council approved the European Security Strategy on 12 December 2003. (6) The European Council Declaration on Combating Terrorism of 25 March 2004 called for counter-terrorist objectives to be inte \u00ad grated into external assistance programmes. Moreover, the EU Millennium Strategy on the prevention and control of organised crime, adopted by the Council on 27 March 2000, calls for closer cooperation with third countries. (7) Post-crisis stabilisation requires a sustained and flexible engagement from the international community, in particular in the first years after a crisis, on the basis of integrated transition strategies. (8) Implementation of programmes of assistance in times of crisis and political instability requires specific measures to ensure flexi \u00ad bility in decision-making and budget allocation, as well as enhanced measures to ensure coherence with bilateral aid and mechanisms for the pooling of donor funds, including the delegation of public authority tasks through indirect centralised management. (9) The Resolutions of the European Parliament and the Conclusions of the Council following the Commission Communications on the Linking of Relief, Rehabilitation and Development emphasise the need to ensure effective bridging between operations financed from different Community financing instruments in the context of crisis. (10) In order to address the above issues in an effective and timely manner specific financial resources and financing instruments are required that can work in a manner complementary to humani \u00ad tarian aid and long-term cooperation instruments. Humanitarian aid should continue to be delivered under Council Regulation (EC) No 1257/96 of 20 June 1996 concerning humanitarian aid ( 1 ). (11) In addition to the measures agreed with partner countries in the context of the policy framework for cooperation established under the related Community instruments for external assistance, the Community must be able to provide assistance which addresses major global and transnational issues having a potentially destabi \u00ad lising effect. \u25bc B 2006R1717 \u2014 EN \u2014 14.12.2006 \u2014 000.001 \u2014 3 ( 1 ) OJ L 163, 2.7.1996, p. 1.

        "(12) The 2001 \u2018Guidelines for strengthening operational coordination between the Community, represented by the Commission, and the Member States in the field of external assistance\u2019 emphasise the need for enhanced coordination of EU external assistance. (13) This Regulation establishes for the period 2007 to 2013 a financial envelope which constitutes the prime reference amount for the budgetary authority according to point 37 of the Inter \u00ad institutional Agreement of 17 May 2006 between the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission on budgetary discipline and sound financial management ( 1 ). (14) The measures necessary for the implementation of this Regulation should be adopted in accordance with Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission ( 2 ). (15) This Regulation aims at covering the scope of and replacing a number of existing Regulations concerning Community external assistance; those Regulations should therefore be repealed. (16) Since the objectives of this Regulation cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States, because of the need for concerted multilateral response in the areas defined in this Regu \u00ad lation, and can therefore be better achieved at Community level, taking account of the scale and global effects of the measures provided for herein, the Community may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the EC Treaty. In accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in that Article, this Regulation does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve these objectives, HAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION: TITLE I OBJECTIVES AND SCOPE Article 1 Objectives 1.
