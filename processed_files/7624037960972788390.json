Increase of the SFF Innovation, quality and increased value added were the focus of the new strategic orientations endorsed by the Board of Governors in 2005. In line with this strategy, there has since been a strong emphasis on financing projects under the Structured Finance Facility (SFF), which allows the Bank to finance projects with a higher degree of risk. To keep the momentum go- ing, the Governors decided to make additional SFF resources available. The SFF was originally established in 2001 with an overall indicative ceil- ing set at EUR 750m. It was designed as a special financial instrument for the Bank to finance the higher risk end of the investment grade spectrum and non-investment grade investments. Under the SFF, the Bank can pro- vide financial products such as senior loans, mezzanine and subordinated debt, as well as financing investment funds with equity-type instruments. The SFF provides high added value, especially for research and innovation projects and for Trans-European Networks. The Governors decided to increase the provision for the Bank\u2019s SFF from EUR 750m to EUR 1 250m, to be financed from the Bank\u2019s surplus. In addi- tion, it also approved an overall ceiling for future SFF capital allocations of EUR 3 750m . JASPERS/JEREMIE The Governors gave their full support to JASPERS (Joint Assistance to Support Projects in European Regions) and JEREMIE (Joint European Resources for Micro-to-Medium Enterprises), two joint policy initiatives of the EIB Group, the European Commission (Regional Policy Directorate) and, in the case of EIB Board of Governors\u2019 2006 annual meeting reviews progress 1 4th meeting of the FEMIP Committee of Experts: foreign direct investment and energy at the heart of the discussions 5 FEMIP deepens its expertise on economic issues in the Euro-Mediterranean region 7 The Republic of Maldives Signature of framework agreement and post-tsunami line of credit to Ministry of Finance 9 Reconstruction after the October 2005 earthquake in Pakistan 10 2005 : a fruitful year for EIF Innovative finance to finance innovation 11 Public consultation on public disclosure policy 13 Innovation and cohesion: a happy partnership 15 Science Parks\u2013 a tool for the development of the knowledge economy? 16 EIB Universities Research Action 18 EIB finances 72% of Rijeka-Zagreb Croatian motorway 20 EIB voted \u201cMost impressive borrower\u201d for the second consecutive year 21 EIB Senior Management Cadre appointments 22 EIB finance for 10 schools in the Highlands 23 New EIB publications 24 ",

JASPERS and JEREMIE are aimed at maximising the impact of structural and cohesion fund support in the programming period 2007-2013. EU Commissioner for Economic and Mon- etary Affairs Joaqu\u00edn Almunia, representing the Commission at the EIB Board of Gover- nors\u2019 meeting, underlined the importance of JEREMIE for supporting SMEs, a core EIB operational priority. JEREMIE will enable Eu- ropean Member States and regions to use part of their structural funds to obtain a set of financial instruments that are specifically designed to support micro and small and medium-sized enterprises. This initiative will contribute to growth and employment in line with the renewed Lisbon agenda agreed in March 2005. Renewable energy The Board of Governors also applauded re- cent initiatives of the Bank in the sector of energy savings and renewable energy (RE). The EIB aims to increase the share of RE in total new electricity generation capacity financed by the Bank in the EU to 50% by 2010. This includes a greater share for new technologies (other than wind and hydro schemes) and is in line with the EU\u2019s tar- get of 22% of electricity generation being met from RE by 2010. To this end, the Bank is stepping up its funding of RE projects Towards an increase in EIF\u2019s capital Also on the agenda of the Board of Governors\u2019 meeting was an increase of the European Investment Fund\u2019s capital. The Governors voted unanimously in fa- vour of issuing up to 1 000 new EIF shares, which would increase the subscribed capital of the EIF by 50% to EUR 3 000m. The EIB\u2019s participation in the increased paid-in capital would be EUR 200m. The Commission is launching a proposal to the Council and the European Parliament. EIF\u2019s General Meeting will receive a proposal on which to formally vote later this year. involving new and innovative technolo- gies that can demonstrate that they have the potential to become economically vi- able within a reasonable timeframe. Such projects are also important in the context of the Lisbon agenda. The road ahead outside the EU The President also drew attention to im- portant decisions that need to be taken later this year, in particular the renewal of the Bank\u2019s external mandates for the peri- od 2007-2013 and a decision on the future set-up of the EIB\u2019s financing activities in the Mediterranean.

Partner- ships for infrastructure financing in Africa are being established with the goal of lever- aging budgetary funds with EIB loans. Corporate governance Greater transparency on how it makes deci- sions, works and implements EU policies is a continuing corporate objective of the EIB, President Maystadt underlined at the meet- ing. In 2005, the Bank implemented most of the commitments laid down in its trans- parency policy. In particular, it redrafted its disclosure policy in consultation with civil society. The disclosure policy is based on a presumption of disclosure, limited only in specific cases by rules of confidentiality to protect clients\u2019 commercial interests. A Code of Conduct for Members of the Manage- ment Committee has also been established, along the lines of the provisions applicable to European Commissioners. \u00ae 4 EIB Information 2 \u2013 2006 The EIB\u2019s Annual Report was presented to the Board of Governors at its annual meeting on 7 June 2006.

        "FEMIP: in addition to financing, a forum for dialogue and exchange FEMIP brings together all the EIB\u2019s support mechanisms for economic develop- ment in the Mediterranean partner countries. In operation since October 2002, it has financed more than 77 projects totalling over EUR 7.2 billion. Forming part of the Barcelona Process, FEMIP encourages the economies of the Mediterranean partner countries to modernise and open up. To that end, it fo- cuses on private sector development and the creation of a favourable climate for investment. FEMIP also pursues a policy of dialogue with its Mediterranean partners. It holds an annual Ministerial Committee meeting bringing together the Finance Minis- ters of the EU and the partner countries, whose deliberations are prepared by a committee of experts that meets twice a year. 3 The CDM is based on the implementation of projects enabling public or private sector entities in industrialised countries to invest in activities that reduce greenhouse gas emissions in developing countries in return for carbon credits. an attractive investment climate. There was a detailed presentation of successful expe- riences in the new EU Member States, the Netherlands, Jordan and Tunisia. The Neth- erlands example particularly caught the at- tention of the participants, who suggested forming a working group within the finance ministry of each Mediterranean partner country with a mandate to introduce meas- ures to simplify the type of administrative procedures that discourage the local and foreign entrepreneurs. The participants also invited FEMIP to help the Mediterranean partners identify the priority reforms necessary to cut red tape and called on professional associations and chambers of commerce to formulate enter- prise development services. Increasing energy interconnection projects and supporting renewable energy The second workshop on energy empha- sised the need to strike a balance between sustainable development, competitiveness and security of supply, in accordance with the EU\u2019s Green Paper on energy, published in March 2006. As investment require- ments in the energy sector are deemed to be huge (estimated at some EUR 30 billion for electricity generation alone in the next five years), the participants agreed on the need to press ahead with energy sector re- form in the Mediterranean countries in line with the most recent EU directives. This es- pecially entails liberalising the electricity and gas sectors with the aim of improving energy efficiency and ensuring a supply of affordable energy. With this in mind, the experts asked the Bank to continue playing, through FEMIP, its leading role in the electricity and natural gas sectors, in close cooperation with other financial institutions, by financing energy interconnection projects and the enhance- ment of national energy infrastructure. They also called on FEMIP to continue support- ing renewable energy projects and schemes under the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) as defined by the Kyoto Protocol 3 . Following a lively debate, the participants unanimously stressed the need to follow up more closely the meetings of the FEMIP Committee of Experts, which has gradu- ally developed into a genuine Euro-Medi- terranean think tank on economic and fi- nancial issues. In the closing session of the meeting, the experts agreed to submit their recommen- dations to the Euro-Mediterranean Finance Ministers, who will be meeting in Tunis on 25 and 26 June. \u00ae The Euro-Mediterranean Ecofin and FEMIP Ministerial Meeting was held in Tunis on 25 and 26 June.

In 2003-2005, these two instruments under- pinned some 50 operations aimed at bol- stering the financial and banking sector of the partner countries (31% of financing) or involving environmental protection (32%), infrastructure (32%) or human capital for- mation (5%). In the framework of its Trust Fund, FEMIP recently completed the first benchmark study on remittances made by Mediterra- nean migrant workers from Europe to their In addition to its financing operations, FEMIP aims to make available to the participants in the Euro- Mediterranean Partnership the analytical data required to understand the challenges of development and, in particular, the factors strengthening the financial and banking sector of the partner countries.

In parallel, on 13 March the EIB signed a framework cooperation agreement with the FEMISE university net- work, which specialises in studying eco- nomic issues in the Euro-Mediterranean Partnership area. Putting migrant remittances to the Mediterranean region to better use The study on migrant workers\u2019 remittanc- es 1 reveals the extent of the phenomenon \u2013 some EUR 7bn is \u201cofficially\u201d transferred each year from Europe to eight Mediterra- nean countries. It also shows that the trans- fer methods used prevent the funds from being put to sufficiently good use in order to finance productive investment. A number of obstacles (low level of bank usage by migrants and recipients, exclusive contracts between money transfer compa- nies 2 and the postal services, non-transpar- ency of costs, etc.) impose high transaction costs \u2013 either transfer costs (which can be as much as 18% of the sum transferred) or costs connected with the foreign exchange terms applied to the recipients. By virtue of the range of issues addressed and recommendations made, the study provides a sound basis for engaging in a process of information and consultation on the measures to be taken to improve the terms offered to migrant workers and increase the impact of remittances on fi- nancing the development of the Mediterra- nean partner countries. Accordingly, FEMIP intends to place this issue on the agenda of a future Committee of Experts meeting and raise awareness among banks in both the Member States and the partner countries with which it has dealings so as to explore the feasibility of the following proposals: \u2022 encourage increased use of banks by those sending and receiving remittances and de- vise savings or investment products cou- pled with transfer methods using modern technology; \u2022 improve the efficiency of payment systems by modernising those of the partner coun- tries and linking them to European and in- ternational systems; \u2022 improve banks\u2019 refinancing terms in the partner countries by helping to intro- duce remittance-backed securitisation mechanisms. These would enable banks in the Mediterranean countries to ac- cess the international capital markets on keener terms than those offered by the refinancing methods currently available to them, which, in any event, are limited by the credit rating of the country of the issuing bank; \u2022 provide migrant workers with better in- formation on ways to access remittance services by introducing new instruments (such as websites) and involving emigrant organisations in the design of tailored products.

        "The Republic of Maldives Signature of framework agreement and post-tsunami line of credit to Ministry of Finance On 5 April 2006, the first ever loan agreement between the Republic of Maldives and the European Investment Bank was signed by Mr Jean Louis Biancarelli, Director General for Lending Operations outside Europe, and H.E. Gasim Ibrahim, Finance Minister. From the EIB, Mr Biancarelli was accompanied by Ms Regan Wylie-Otte and Ms Sunita Nilles-Lukkhoo. By Sunita NILLES-LUKKHOO Asia and Latin America Department The President, H.E Gayoom, and Mr Jean-Louis Biancarelli T he signature was preceded, as a precondition, by the inclusion of the Republic of Maldives as an eli- gible country under the mandate conferred on the EIB by the Council of the European Union. Furthermore, the conclu- sion of a framework agreement for finan- cial cooperation between the Republic of Maldives and EIB was also necessary. These two acts paved the way for possible future operations. The tsunami in the Indian Ocean region on 26 December 2004 caused widespread dam- age to certain coastal regions in surround- ing countries. In its wake, the EIB promptly identified potential projects in the most seriously affected countries, including Mal- dives, which could benefit entities that had suffered direct or indirect losses as a result of the tsunami. This was by far the great- est natural catastrophe ever experienced by Maldives, which was moreover the only country to be hit by the disaster on a nation- wide scale. Although the loss of life was for- tunately low, there was nonetheless wide- spread damage to infrastructure. The agreement signed represents the EIB\u2019s concrete response to the destruction caused by the tsunami. It will enable the financing of projects in areas such as the rehabilita- tion, replacement or reconstruction of infra- structure and business facilities (mainly in the tourism sector) as well as environmental improvement and disaster prevention. Despite the extraordinary response to the catastrophe by the international communi- ty, none of the funds pledged appeared to target the tourism sector, which on its own suffered substantial damage and losses. Overall macroeconomic developments have been affected by the pace of the restoration of tourism, as well as by the amount and timeliness of the external assistance that is being made available. The EIB funding provided will contribute to the rapid reestablishment of tourism as a tsunami-affected sector and will thus rep- resent a first step towards long-term and fruitful cooperation between the Repub- lic of Maldives and the European Invest- ment Bank. \u00ae EIB Information 2 \u2013 2006 9 ",

        "\u00cb 2005 : a fruitful year for EIF Innovative finance to finance innovation by Delphine Munro Corporate Affairs and Finance EIF: focus on SME financing As the only European Community institu- tion with a specialised focus on SME financ- ing, the European Investment Fund has an essential role to play in pursuing core EU objectives such as innovation, research and development, entrepreneurship, growth and job creation. Within the Community policies, the Lisbon Strategy for European competitiveness re- mains a key driver of EIF\u2019s activities. The European Research Area objectives, which revolve around maximising Europe\u2019s con- siderable research potential in science and technology and encouraging greater pri- vate investment in R&D, are also of increas- ing importance. Furthermore, in March 2006 the Lisbon Co- ordination Group stressed the need to rein- force the financial instruments operated by EIF on behalf of the Commission in order to enhance SME finance with venture capital and guarantees and extend its activities to the financing of technology transfer. EIF: contributor to the EIB\u2019s strategic priorities As part of the EIB Group, EIF is a significant contributor to three of the European Invest- ment Bank\u2019s five strategic priorities: the \u201cIn- novation 2010 Initiative\u201d, SMEs, and cohe- sion and regional policy. As such, EIF is a pillar of the newly-adopted Group strategy, approved by the EIB\u2019s Board of Governors in June 2005, which aims at better operational coordination and an increasing number of joint operations, as already initiated through joint securitisation deals in 2005. By devel- oping such instruments, both institutions are in a better position to increase the value added of their operations for clients as well as to address the financing requirements of SMEs more effectively. Highlights 2005 was another positive year for EIF in terms of both investment activity and the institution\u2019s growth and ability to respond to new opportunities. Broadening of venture capital investment activities In 2005, venture capital commitments ran to EUR 468m invested in some 24 funds. This compares to EUR 358m committed in 2004. VC commitments amounted to EUR 3.2bn at end-2005. With investments in some 220 funds, EIF is a leading player in Euro- pean venture capital, due to the scale and scope of its investments, especially in the high-tech and early-stage segments, and its policy of taking positions alongside private sector investors. EIF has established itself as a key institution in promoting innovative financial instruments for SMEs developing best practice and corporate governance. EIF has continued to broaden its invest- ment activities beyond early-stage funds, adding mid- and later-stage funds. How- ever, in terms of sector, EIF\u2019s VC portfolio still concentrates on technology (primarily information and communications technolo- gies - ICT) and life sciences, which account for 56% of the portfolio. EIF was closely associated with one of the 2005 success stories through its invest- ment in Skype (voice over internet) via the first fund managed by Luxembourg-based Mangrove. Having supported Mangrove since its inception, this also confirms EIF\u2019s competence in identifying successful new fund management in the technology seg- ment. EIF\u2019s expertise and breadth of portfolio ena- bles it to specifically target niche strategies in European venture funding, as demon- strated by its investment in Nordic Biotech. Nordic Biotech is a special situation inves- tor in life science companies aimed at as- sembling late-stage assets in newly-estab- lished firms to achieve critical mass in their market position.

        "1 Undertaken for EVCA by the Center for Entrepreneurial and Fiscal Studies (CEFS) at Munich Technical University, and published in November 2005, the study examines both the current levels of employment by private equity and venture capital-financed companies as well as the new jobs created by the industry in recent years. Federal Ministry of Economics and Tech- nology (BMWi) and The European Recov- ery Programme \u2013 is exceeding expecta- tions. EUR 115m was committed in four funds, which in turn helped raise another EUR 554m from private investors, highlight- ing EIF\u2019s leveraging effect on the market. In 2005, an investment mandate with a first close of almost EUR 200m, managed by EIF in collaboration with CDTI (the innovative technologies development centre of the Spanish Ministry of Industry), was set up to support investments in Spanish SMEs fostering innovation and research and de- velopment together with a range of private sector corporate investors. In a still uneven macro-economic environ- ment, the private equity and venture capital industry is actively contributing to job crea- tion in the EU\u2019s 25 countries, as highlighted by a recent study published by EVCA 1 . In this context, EIF\u2019s commitment has substantially impacted the creation of jobs in Europe. With a strong improvement in exit oppor- tunities, the portfolios managed by EIF have yielded stronger capital gains and reflows from realisations during 2005 and early 2006. EIF is set to continue performing a signifi- cant role in European VC as a steady and reliable player in technology investments alongside private investors, while develop- ing support for technology transfer. The guarantees portfolio SME guarantees for EUR 1.7bn were is- sued in 2005 bringing the total portfolio to EUR 9.3bn at year-end 2005. EIF\u2019s guar- antee activity is conducted with EIF\u2019s own resources and under mandates from the European Commission. EIF offers two main product lines for its SME guarantee activity: credit enhancement for securitisation and credit insurance/re-insur- ance (including for micro-finance). Under EIF\u2019s own resource activity, some EUR 457m worth of credit enhancement operations were signed and one credit insurance deal for EUR 15m was completed. EIF\u2019s role in securitisations is to enhance SMEs\u2019 access to debt finance by facilitat- ing credit risk transfer from the originat- ing banks to the capital markets. This is achieved by guaranteeing certain risks. EIF\u2019s top credit rating and MDB status make possible reduced regulatory capital allo- cation on assets guaranteed by EIF and thereby enable financial institutions to expand their lending capacity. When op- portunities arise, this activity is conducted in cooperation with banks, especially EIF shareholders, with EIF often taking mezza- nine tranches. This was the case in the BPI (Banco Portugu\u00eas do Investimento) trans- action in Portugal in early 2005, where EIF was advisor and guarantor alongside the EIB and KfW as investors. In 2005, EIF signed 24 guarantee operations amounting to EUR 1.2bn under the guaran- tee window of the current EU programme of DG Enterprise (MAP \u2013 Multi-Annual Pro- gramme for SMEs 2001-2006). Over 260 000 SMEs have benefited from this programme and its predecessor. We estimate that, since inception, the guar- antees issued by EIF on these programmes have helped to generate loans worth at least 15 times the accountable EU budgetary commitment; this leverage effect has been key to the financing of SMEs in Europe, par- ticularly small SMEs and those in the new Member States and Acceding Countries. The micro-finance guarantee facility in- cluded in this MAP window supports en- trepreneurs and micro-enterprises with up to 10 employees, guaranteeing micro-loans of up to EUR 25 000. It is aimed at entrepre- neurs who are starting a business and face particular difficulties in gaining access to financing due to the relatively higher risk they represent and the insufficient security they can provide to lenders. Guarantee com- mitments have reached roughly EUR 147m, a substantial amount considering that the size of the micro-loans is on average just below EUR 10 000. In a groundbreaking operation in Europe, EIF structured and co-arranged the secu- ritisation of loans to micro-finance institu- tions (MFIs). This is a very significant trans- action involving several countries, mostly in southern Europe. Through this asset-backed funding deal, MFIs will secure long-term funding to support continued growth in their micro-lending. Despite the small size of the micro-loans, there is high potential in terms of business productivity gains and job creation supported by this important niche lending activity. It is estimated that this transaction will result in the direct fi- nancing of at least some 20 000 new micro- loans. Total note issuance was for EUR 30m. Another similar transaction was completed in early 2006, for EUR 50m. Developments EIF has developed its role in technical as- sistance in the SME sector, notably with na- tional and regional authorities implement- ing early-stage venture capital schemes. Examples include the assessment of ven- ture capital funds and schemes in Andalu- sia and Flanders. The JEREMIE (Joint European Resources for Micro to Medium Enterprises) initiative was set in motion in late 2005 by the European Commission\u2019s DG Regional Policy and EIF to enhance SME access to finance in the EU regions. Member States and regional authorities can outsource the management of structural funds for financial engineering/SME finance programmes to EIF, thus transforming parts of the ERDF (structural funds) grants into a range of financial products for SMEs. These products will include equity, venture capi- tal, guarantees and technical assistance, and will allow a multiplier effect on the budget. Special emphasis may be given to micro-finance. In 2006-2007, EIF\u2019s implementation team and the national or regional programme au- thorities will assess the gaps between sup- ply and demand for SME access to finance in cooperation with national institutions and agree on operational action plans. Follow- ing this phase, EIF will help implement the financing schemes in close cooperation with lending institutions such as the EIB, other 12 EIB Information 2 \u2013 2006 ",

The policy is now published in all the official EU languages on the EIB\u2019s website. Before Board consideration, the draft disclosure policy went through a public consultation process, which started in May 2005. This was the first consultation on an EIB policy. A public consultation report, outlining the consultation process and summarising the stakeholder contributions and the EIB\u2019s comments on these has also been posted on the Bank\u2019s website 1 . by Matilde del Valle Serrano Communication and Information Department The consultation process The consultative process focused on a re- vised proposal for the Bank\u2019s disclosure pol- icy. The Bank adopted a flexible approach in terms of timetable and procedures to allow as full a consultation as possible. The consul- tation process formally started in May 2005 1 The Public Disclosure Policy and the Public Consultation Report may be consulted at www. eib.org. EIB Information 2 \u2013 2006 13 ",
        "and ended in July 2005. A revised draft dis- closure policy (Draft I) was posted on the website for comments with a time limit for reception of responses of 45 working days. At the same time, the draft was sent by mail to over 200 organisations and indi- viduals who had shown a particular inter- est in the Bank\u2019s disclosure and information policy, including members of the European Parliament and the European Economic and Social Committee, think tanks, academics, NGOs and other civil society organisations (CSOs). Following written comments from and dis- cussions with interested stakeholders, the Bank launched a second 20 working day consultation process on a re-edited draft policy that took into account public contri- butions received during the first consulta- tion period. The second round of consulta- tion started in October 2005, when the new draft was posted on the Bank\u2019s website for public comment. Stakeholder contributions (7) in the first round of consultation were published on the EIB\u2019s website for informa- tion. After completion of the second round, the more than 30 contributions received during this period were also published on the Bank\u2019s website. Review panel A review panel was set up within the EIB to consider all stakeholder contributions and examine the extent to which these could be taken into account. The panel\u2019s evaluations of the contributions provided the framework for re-drafting and editing the draft policy. The stakeholder proposals and comments are listed in the public consultation report. A table indicates whether or not the Bank has taken them into account. Where com- ments were not considered, the reasons for this are also set out. Public consultation meetings In addition to the web-based consultation process, the Bank held two public consul- tation meetings to discuss its policy review with interested stakeholders. The first was held in Brussels in June 2005, chaired by Peter Sedgwick, EIB Vice-President with re- sponsibility for transparency. The meeting brought together some 20 people, includ- ing representatives from NGOs and think tanks, consultants, observers from EU and international financing institutions, and EIB staff members. The second meeting was held in Brussels in November 2005, chaired by the Deputy Secretary General. Among the 20 attend- ees were 12 NGO representatives and staff from the EIB, the European Parliament and the World Bank. Stakeholder proposals and comments voiced during the public meetings were then submitted to the re- view panel. Internal consultation As part of the consultation process, inter- nal stakeholders were also encouraged to comment. The draft policy and details of the consultation process were distributed within the Bank. EIB Directorates had an op- portunity to submit contributions, as had all EIB staff members. They were invited to discuss the policy draft with Vice-President Peter Sedgwick and the Deputy Secretary General in a seminar. End of the consultation process The final draft disclosure policy and consul- tation report were submitted for approval to the Management Committee in February 2006. In March 2006, the Board of Directors approved the revised policy. Formal reviews of the disclosure policy will take place every three years. The EIB will also review the public disclosure policy VP Peter Sedgwick and Deputy SG R\u00e9my Jacob held an open forum on the Bank\u2019s public disclosure policy.

        "I t is a well known fact that, at the Lisbon Council of March 2000, the European Union set itself the goal of establishing a competitive, knowledge-based econ- omy by 2010. It is sometimes forgotten that the ultimate purpose of this new economy is to create sustainable growth, with more and better jobs, and greater social cohesion. The European Investment Bank\u2019s Innovation 2010 Initiative (i2i), which underpins the Lisbon Strategy, finances investment that both stimulates innovation and promotes social cohesion. The EIB\u2019s i2i lending focuses on three broad categories: a) research, development and innovation (RDI); b) education and train- ing; and c) the diffusion of technologies and development of information and commu- nication technology (ICT). Since i2i was set up in 2000, the Bank has lent EUR 34.7bn for innovative investment projects. Of this amount, EUR 25bn (72%) went to projects in the European Union\u2019s poorest regions. Financing innovation in the regions helps to offset the tendency for such investment to be concentrated in the wealthiest parts of the EU. The focus on the regions is testi- mony to the high value added of the EIB\u2019s involvement and its commitment to the transfer of knowledge to areas of the Un- ion that are lagging behind. 2005 was a top year for innovation and cohesion In 2005, EUR 8.8bn of the EIB\u2019s lending for projects furthering economic and social cohesion also supported the Lisbon Strat- egy. Or, putting it the other way around, of the EUR 10.4bn in loans for innovation, 84% went to projects in the less developed regions. Research, development and innovation ac- counted for EUR 5.8bn, an impressive 95% of all RDI financed by the Bank in 2005. In- vestment at research institutes in assisted areas in Germany attracted EUR 3.2bn, go- ing inter alia to basic and applied research at independent national research institutions such as the Max Planck Gesellschaft and Fraunhofer-Gesellschaft; research activities in three leading science centres in Bavaria; the construction of a research, development and production site for semiconductors in Dresden; and research activities at univer- sities and university colleges of technology in Lower Saxony. EUR 650m went to R&D- driven investment in the automotive sector in the Czech Republic and Slovakia. The EIB recognises that education plays a significant role in stimulating long-term eco- Innovation and cohesion: a happy par tnership by Cees Post Communication and Information Department nomic growth as well. Of a total of EUR 2.2bn for i2i investment in education in 2005, close to EUR 1bn (44%) went to assisted areas. Projects included the construction, refur- bishment and maintenance of schools, for example in North Lanarkshire and Argyll and Bute, but also innovative schemes such as the Hungary Student Loan Centre, Di\u00e1khitel K\u00f6zpont, which is channelling EUR 100m in Bank funds as student loans to higher educa- tion students on favourable terms and con- ditions. Hungary\u2019s higher education system has undergone massive changes in recent years. Undergraduate and graduate num- bers have more than doubled over the last decade, reflecting an evolution towards a more inclusive educational system. In 2005, EIB lending for information and communication technology networks, the third category of i2i investment, which is cru- cial for the diffusion of innovation and the sharing of data, was heavily concentrated in assisted areas. Loans in the regions totalled more than EUR 1.8m, equivalent to fully 97% of all ICT networks financed. The rollout of broadband access networks, for example, attracted EUR 400m in Spain, EUR 350m in southern Italy and EUR 500m in Germany\u2019s eastern L\u00e4nder. Continuing a dual strategy The extreme concentration of lending for RDI and ICT projects in assisted areas in 2005 is not likely to be repeated in the years to come: much depends on the availability of investment opportunities in any given year. Nevertheless, the EIB will continue to com- bine cohesion policy and the implementa- tion of the Lisbon Agenda whenever possi- ble. The i2i experience has shown that these two mutually reinforcing strategies have been able to create sustainable growth and high-quality jobs. \u00ae EIB Information 2 \u2013 2006 15 ",
        "by Luisa Ferreira Laura Piovesan Patrick Vanhoudt Projects Directorate Science Parks \u2013 a tool for the development of the knowledge economy? N obody would deny the role of sci- ence and innovation in the con- text of the knowledge economy. Buzzwords like R&D, venture capi- tal, incubators and industrial clusters have gained the attention of policy makers and business managers worldwide. In the perspective of stimulating innovation, Science and Technology Parks (STPs) \u2013 com- plex real estate developments with strong scientific, production and service compo- nents \u2013 constitute one type of organisational response. Following their emergence in the US in the 1960s, STPs have been established at an increasing rate across Europe, mainly since the 1980s, with the task of encouraging the growth of knowledge-based industries by offering state-of-the-art infrastructure and a range of services to high-tech firms and by If the EU wishes to maintain and further improve its living standards, it has to safeguard its competitive edge in the global technology race. On 18 May a conference organised by the Projects Directorate of the EIB examined the role and impact of science parks in the development of the knowledge economy. facilitating links with universities and research centres. The diversity of levels of economic development, as well as of national and re- gional cultural and legal frameworks, has led to the creation of a broad array of STP mod- els. Also, the success rate of science parks as drivers of the transformation of knowledge into technology has been rather uncertain, as some have turned out to be successful, while others have either remained under- utilised or developed into heavily subsidised industrial zones. Currently, STPs are spurring renewed in- terest. One may wonder whether this is a fashion that is here to stay or whether it could be too much of a good thing. Conse- quently, the Bank\u2019s Industry and Services Department took the initiative of studying the role and impact of science parks in the development of the knowledge economy. 16 EIB Information 2 \u2013 2006 ",
        "As part of the study and in order to validate its findings, a conference was organised in collaboration with the International Asso- ciation of Science Parks (IASP). The conference was divided into three ses- sions. The first dealt with innovation policy in general (D. Pilat, OECD) and the econom- ic rationale for science parks in particular (P. Vanhoudt, EIB). The second session start- ed off with a discussion on the appraisal of science parks, for which L. Sanz (IASP) pre- sented an application being developed called \u201cStrategigram\u201d. This was followed by an overview of the financial instruments available from the EIB Group to support sound science park projects and the chal- lenges faced in this respect (F. Riedl, EIF; and T. Barrett, EIB). In the afternoon, the conference continued with lessons learnt from particular case studies, both in the EU (L. Ferreira and L. Piovesan, EIB) and out- side the EU, in Tunisia, where the EIB has financed several technopoles (Ph. Guinet, EIB, and S. Harbi, Tunisian Government). The conference concluded with a round table debate on the critical factors and bottle- necks for science parks to become a suc- cess (M. Baccanti, San Raffaele, Italy; A. de Oliveira, TagusPark, Portugal; P. Huuskonen, Technopolis, Finland; K. Plate, Heidelberg, Germany; L. Sanz, IASP; and P. de Visscher, Icoms Communications, Belgium). Key messages of the conference Four key messages emerged from the con- ference: \u2022 Firstly, science parks need to be thought of in the context of a wider technology trans- fer strategy. A consequence of this is that it may neither be desirable nor feasible to equip all urban regions and cities with a science park. Also, contemporary science parks should be demand-led, not supply- driven. This makes it likely for science park developments to follow regional economic growth, as opposed to preceding it. It may thus be preferable to support emerging winners, rather than trying to pick poten- tial champions in advance or attempting to merely replicate successes seen else- where. In fact, given that science parks typically require a long time to mature, political interference, possibly connected with short-term political cycles and targets, was perceived as one of the barriers to the success of science parks. \u2022 Secondly, management is at the core of any successful science park. In the end, the quality of a science park depends on the success of its tenant companies, and it is the role of the science park manager to attract, select, retain and support compa- nies with a high potential. Yet the complex- ity of stakeholders requires a science park manager to combine the knowledge of a scientist, the expertise of a businessman and the acumen of a politician in one sin- gle person. This calls for dedicated training programmes of a type which is so far non- existent. The IASP has recently recognised this lacuna and will be acting on it. \u2022 Thirdly, successful science parks turn out to be those that are embedded in a suf- ficiently strong economic fabric that in- cludes the majority of specialised services and productive enterprises. While close cooperation with a university or research centre plays a crucial role in the efficacy of a science park, a formal association with either of these is perceived as desirable, but by no means an essential element of success. \u2022 Fourthly, different science parks are faced with different financial needs, and no sin- gle financing model fits all. Broadly speak- ing, the required type of finance follows the three distinct phases in the life cycle of a science park. The first is the provision of the infrastructure, for which long-term loans seem to be a suitable instrument. The second phase is that of financing start-up companies on-site, which often necessitates the availability of seed capi- tal. The third phase is that of deployment and initial industrial-scale production of spin-offs, possibly accompanied by a move off-site. Here accessibility to both venture capital and traditional loans would seem to be an enabler. In conclusion: science parks constitute a suitable tool in the palette of innovation policy for the development of the knowl- edge-based economy, if they are well de- signed, form part of a dedicated regional innovation strategy, are well managed, and can benefit from access to appropriate capi- tal markets in each of their phases.

        "T o broaden its long-term university relationships and channel EIB sup- port to European universities more systematically, the Bank recently launched a Universities Research Action. This Action will provide a more coherent response to the numerous requests, no- tably for financial assistance but also for research inputs, from a multiplicity of aca- demic centres. It will also create a channel for some of the academic and research ex- pectations of staff. The Action consists of three separate pro- grammes: EIBURS, the EIB University Research Spon- sorship programme, which provides grants to EU university research centres working on research topics and themes of major inter- est to the Bank. STAREBEI, Stages de Recherche BEI, a pro- gramme for financing young researchers working on joint EIB-university projects. EIB Universities Research Ac tion by Alain Javeau General Secretariat EIB University Networks, a mechanism for sponsoring university networks, focused on areas of interest to the EIB. A specific committee (Comit\u00e9 BEI-Univer- sit\u00e9s \u2013 CBU), chaired by the President of the Bank, is supervising the Action 1 . The EIB University Research Sponsorship (EIBURS) programme The EIBURS programme will provide sup- port to EU university research centres work- ing on research themes of major interest to the Bank and become a vehicle for facili- tating research and continuous education for EIB staff. Sponsorship will be awarded through a competitive process to interested univer- sity departments \u2013 or research centres as- sociated with universities in EU, Acceding and Accession Countries \u2013 with recognised expertise in topics of direct interest to the Bank. An EIBURS sponsorship will entitle the beneficiary (the EIBURS centre) to obtain up to EUR 100 000 per year, for a period of three years, in exchange for a commitment to develop activities additional to those nor- mally carried out by the centre. These will be jointly agreed and entail the delivery of a variety of outputs (research, education, net- working, dissemination of results, etc.) that will be the subject of a contractual agree- ment with the Bank. The initiative for aca- demic and research activities is expected to come from the university. The Bank could, however, propose some specific activities, in particular relating to research and continu- ous education involving EIB staff. For its first year of operation, the programme has selected the following four lines of re- search: 1 Comit\u00e9 BEI-Universit\u00e9s: Philippe MAYSTADT, Chairman (President of the Bank); Matteu TURR\u00d3, Coordinator (management team); Hugo WOESTMANN, Roderick DUNNETT, Eric PEREE, Jacques LILLI, EIF; Alain JAVEAU, Secretary (management team) 18 EIB Information 2 \u2013 2006 ",
        "\u2022 Financial and economic valuation of envi- ronmental impacts \u2022 Technology assessment and acceleration of innovation \u2022 Public-private partnerships \u2022 Social dimensions of sustainable devel- opment These lines of research must fall within one of the main areas of interest of the can- didate centre. The calibre of the research carried out in the centre, the quality of the activities proposed, the staff assigned and the management structure of the EIBURS centre, along with the capacity to host and work with EIB staff and the potential to send trainees to the EIB, are the main crite- ria that the selection committee will apply in appraising bids. Stages de recherche BEI (STAREBEI) a programme for financing young researchers working on joint EIB-university projects The STAREBEI programme supports the joint interests of university centres and EIB staff by providing traineeships for jun- ior researchers interested in carrying out research projects proposed by the Bank under the joint supervision of a university tutor and an EIB tutor. This synergy be- tween the academic world and the Bank\u2019s professionals is designed to produce re- search outputs that help to improve the know-how of both the Bank and the aca- demics involved, raise the Bank\u2019s profile, motivate its staff and provide a rich expe- rience for young researchers. In contrast to EIBURS, which is based on activities pro- posed by the university centres, research initiatives under STAREBEI must originate from the Bank. Main features of STAREBEI The programme supports university re- searchers for periods of between six months and one year. Traineeships will be chan- nelled through the university and involve some presence on the Bank\u2019s premises, but most working time will be spent at the uni- versity centre. The STAREBEI programme has a different approach than the traditional EIB train- eeship. It is research-oriented and has stronger academic requirements. The programme will also finance certain ex- penditures linked to the research and, in particular, necessary travel expenses both for the trainee and his/her tutor at the university. STAREBEI could provide for some eight to ten research traineeships per year. Each will involve a contract between the EIB and the university supporting the research. Any university located in the EU and award- ing doctorate level degrees in line with the Bologna process is eligible to participate in the STAREBEI programme. Whilst universi- ties must be EU-based, there are no con- straints on the nationality of the researchers proposed by the university, provided that they have the proper status (connection with the university, visa, etc.). The EIB tutor will supervise the work of the trainee, in close cooperation with the univer- sity tutor. Tutors are required to ensure that the work is carried out appropriately. The desired outcome of the exercise is a thesis and/or research paper (preferably publish- able), which should usually be co-authored by the tutors. The CBU team supervises and administers the programme. Sponsoring of university networks using the \u201cEIB University Network\u201d label The EIB Group has established a mechanism for sponsoring university networks present- ing characteristics that are of particular rel- evance to supporting the Group\u2019s objectives. These networks will be used by the EIB as preferred vehicles for publicising EIBURS and STAREBEI and meeting other research requests from departments that cannot be accommodated by these two programmes. They will provide the Bank with information relevant to its activities. Where appropriate, universities will be entitled to use the \u201cEIB label\u201d in their promotion. Main features of the network sponsoring mechanism The \u201cEIB University Network\u201d label will be available to any university network, defined as a cooperative network for educational, research and development activities with a specific purpose. The network should have an academic focus, even though it could in- clude non-university organisations. To ob- tain the label, the main purpose of the net- work and the activities it supports must be of direct interest to the EIB Group. The net- work must also prove that it has worked ad- equately for a period of at least three years. Proposals received from university networks should provide sufficient information on their activities, indicate their expectations from the envisaged collaboration with the EIB and propose the procedures that the association would use, notably indicating a focal point for EIB communications with the network. The Comit\u00e9 BEI-Universit\u00e9s (CBU) will accept or reject the proposals. Approved proposals will be the object of a specific agreement with the network through a Memorandum of Understanding that will have similar fea- tures for all sponsored networks. Whilst the fact of belonging to a sponsored network will be considered a positive aspect in the selection processes of EIBURS and STAREBEI, all EIB programmes will comply rigorously with transparent and non-dis- criminatory selection procedures. \u00ae For further information go to: www.eib.org/universities EIB Information 2 \u2013 2006 19 ",
        "EIB finances 72% of Rijeka-Zagreb Croatian motor way by Fabio Bargagli-Petrucci Adriatic Sea Department W ith a EUR 210m loan to Autoces- ta Rijeka-Zagreb d.d. (ARZ), the EIB recently financed the doubling and upgrading to full motorway standard of 44 km of exist- ing 2-lane road between Stara Susica and Kikovica in Croatia. The EIB loan represents about 72% of total project cost \u2013 in percentage terms the most substantial financing effort in relation to to- tal project cost ever made by the Bank in the transport sector in the region. Croatia became an Accession Country on 4 October 2005 and is therefore eligible for fi- nancing on equal terms with the full Mem- ber States. In the context of implementation of the European Growth Initiative, the Bank, on an exceptional basis and depending on the urgency of the investment, is willing to finance up to 75% of project costs. The remaining 28% of the upgrading of the Rijeka-Zagreb motorway will be covered by the EBRD (EUR 50m or 18%) and by the own funds of ARZ (EUR 30m or 10%). The project is of particular importance to the Croatian Republic. In order to speed up investments, the Ministry of Finance asked the Bank to increase its financing share above the usual limit of 50%. Underlining the urgency of the investment, the Republic will also provide a State guarantee in order to be able to accelerate the investment in this high priority project. The EIB has also been asked to finance a maximum share in view of the scarcity of alternative long-term funds, including Structural Funds, available in the market. The Rijeka-Zagreb motorway forms part of Pan-European Corridor V, branch B, linking Budapest to Zagreb and Rijeka. Developing major trans-European transport networks, both rail and road, is one of the main pri- orities of EU transport policy. Completing Croatia\u2019s main motorway will benefit trade, industry and tourism by reducing journey times and operating costs while improving safety for travellers. Traffic on the Zagreb-Rijeka motorway has been growing steadily at a rate of some 8% per year. In 2004, around 9 500 vehicles per day used the section between Karlovac and Rijeka. The proportion of heavy vehicle traffic is some 20%. Traffic almost doubles during the three summer months when the tourism season is at its peak, demonstrat- ing the importance of this route to local and international tourism flows to the Adriatic coast. Demand for new road capacity along this route is forecast to remain strong, grow- ing at a similar sustained rate and thus re- sulting in a flow of some 20 000 vehicles per day by 2015. \u00ae 20 EIB Information 2 \u2013 2006 ",
        "\u201cThe EIB is proud to support the rehabilita- tion and upgrading of Croatia\u2019s transport infrastructure. This project will accelerate the country\u2019s economic development and strengthen its economic integration into the European Union\u201d, said EIB Vice-President Wolfgang Roth upon signing the financing contract in Rijeka on 9 March. The transport sector is a traditional area of EIB activity in the Balkan region. The develop- ment of transport infrastructure is essential to stimulate economic activities \u2013 including pri- vate sector industrial investments \u2013 and en- sure the balanced development of the pan- European corridors crossing the region (V, VII, VIII and X). The EIB began its involvement in 1978 with a highway rehabilitation project in former Yugoslavia. From the early 1990s, the Bank has financed transport projects in almost every Balkan country with a view to modernising this sector. In Croatia, the Bank has since 2001 financed 16 projects for a total amount of EUR 911m. Half of these projects were in the transport sector and include roads, motorways and air traffic control. \u00ae EIB voted \u201cMost impressive borrower\u201d for the second consecutive year T he market\u2019s positive reception for the Bank\u2019s funding strategy and ac- tivities in 2005 was reflected in the annual Euroweek poll, where mar- ket participants voted EIB the top borrower overall, in the form of the award for \u201cMost Im- pressive Borrower\u201d. This and other flagship awards for \u201cMost Innovative Borrower\u201d and \u201cBest Supranational or Agency Borrower\u201d were achieved for the second consecutive year. For an individual transaction, the Bank obtained the award for \u201cEuro Supranational or Agency bond\u201d for the second consecu- tive year, receiving this for the 30-year EUR benchmark issue. Euroweek\u2019s evaluation of its market poll ex- plained how \u201cRace leader EIB stays ahead of the pack\u201d. The combination of achieve- ments that made EIB \u201cborrower of the year\u201d was deemed \u201cno mean feat, considering the competition it faced from other prestigious issuers such as the Republic of France, the Republic of Italy or GE capital.\u201d In its com- mentary on these results, Euroweek high- lighted the Bank\u2019s coordinated approach to benchmark and tailor-made issuance. It in particular underlined the Bank\u2019s achieve- ments in its core currencies. Among the achievements highlighted in these three currencies was the innovation of the 30- year EUR benchmark transaction; the posi- tion achieved in USD as the largest non-US issuer, and as a provider of liquid bench- marks across the yield curve; and in GBP, the maintenance of EIB\u2019s role as the largest and most frequent non-Gilt issuer. In terms of tailor-made issuance, the poll evaluation singled out the fact that EIB \u201cwas particularly active in the structured notes market\u201d, rais- ing EUR 8bn in EUR alone. Achievements in other currencies were also emphasized, both in developed markets, such as the debut in the Global yen market, and in emerging markets. Euroweek singled out the building of the first ever Turkish lira yield curve going out 10 years, as well as is- suance in several new currencies \u2013 the de- buts in Latin American currencies (Mexican pesos, synthetic Brazilian real), in synthetic Russian rouble and in Icelandic krona. \u00ae by Peter Munro Head of Division Investor Relations & Marketing EIB Information 2 \u2013 2006 21 ",

        "EIB finance for 10 schools in the Highlands T he United Kingdom is one of the coun- tries that have attracted the bulk of the Bank\u2019s financing in the education sec- tor. Since education projects became eligible for EIB financing in 1997 1 , the Bank has signed loans for a total of EUR 10.7bn, of which over EUR 1.1bn in the UK. All of the Bank\u2019s education investments in the UK have been made in public-private partnership (PPP) projects. Five of these were financed using the Structured Finance Facility 2 . The EIB recently advanced a GBP 60m (around EUR 86m) loan for the Highland Council Education Service\u2019s second PPP schools project. This will involve the con- struction and maintenance of three new secondary schools, five new primary schools (including one that will use Gaelic as teach- ing language), one combined primary and secondary school and a new school for chil- dren with special educational needs. The majority of the schools, which will be locat- ed throughout Scotland\u2019s Highland region, will incorporate a range of sports, lifelong learning and other facilities for use by the local community. This operation is expected to contribute to the economic growth and development of the Highland region, an EU transitional Ob- jective 1 area. The project meets two of the five main operational priorities of the Bank (regional development and implementa- tion of the EIB\u2019s Innovation 2010 Initiative (i2i). The focus on improving educational opportunities and sustaining communities in a disadvantaged area will enhance eco- nomic and social cohesion within the Un- ion. The project will also contribute directly to the implementation of i2i by improving education and training. Through its lend- ing activities, the EIB is an active promoter of this EU-wide policy. The project will take the form of a public-pri- vate partnership (PPP) under the UK Govern- ment\u2019s private finance initiative. EIB funds will be provided directly to a special purpose concession company, Alpha Schools (High- land) Project plc, jointly sponsored by Morri- son Project Investments Limited and North- ern Infrastructure Investments plc. These private partners have extensive knowledge and experience of implementing UK educa- tion PPP projects and will design, construct and manage the project under a concession of up to 31 years granted by the public part- ner, the Highland Council. The remainder of the project\u2019s finance will come from up to GBP 100m worth of senior bonds (for which RBC Capital Markets acted as lead manager), together with junior sub- ordinated loan stock and ordinary shares. Ambac Assurance Limited will provide a guarantee for the scheduled payments of principal and interest on the bonds and the EIB loan. \u00ae 1 Providing finance for investment in health and education has been a feature of the EIB\u2019s activity since 1997, when the Amsterdam Council asked the Bank to widen the scope of its lending to include human capital. 2 In order to match the types of funding to the requirements of projects with a high-risk profile and to pursue its equity financing and guarantee operations in favour of large-scale infrastructure schemes, the EIB established a Structured Finance Facility (SFF) in 2001. The Bank can provide a broad mix of financial products under this heading: senior loans and guarantees incorporating pre-completion and early operational risk; subordinated loans and guarantees ranking ahead of shareholder subordinated debt; mezzanine finance, including high-yield debt for industrial companies in transition from SME scale or in the course of restructuring; project-related derivatives. EIB Information 2 \u2013 2006 23 Mr Stephen Wright has been appointed Associate Director (Human Capital Division) in the Industry and Services Department of the Projects Directorate.

He joined the Bank from the private sector in 1987 to work on energy projects and was sub- sequently put in charge of industrial sector project appraisal before launching the analytical prepara- tion of the Bank\u2019s involvement in health and education in 1997. This position was formalised when he became Head of PJ\u2019s new Human Capital Division in June 2000. ",

Since 1997, under the ALA mandate the EIB has committed some EUR 1 132 million for projects of mutual interest to the EU and Brazil in sectors as diverse as energy, telecommunications, fores- try and industry. Framework for lending The framework agreement signed between the Federative Repub- lic of Brazil and the EIB on 19/12/1994 and ratified by the National Congress in 30/05/1995 (Decreto legislativo n\u00b085) governs the op- erations of the EIB in Brazil and recognises preferential access to foreign exchange and beneficial tax treatment for debt servicing to the EIB. Supporting mutual interest projects The 1994 Plano Real, combined with privatisation, made it pos- sible to overcome the economic imbalances which severely affec- ted Brazil during the 1980s and early 1990s. The economic stabili- sation that followed resulted in an unprecedentedly large inflow of European investment into Brazil. During the last decade, Brazil was the principal destination of EU foreign direct investment in Latin America and also the main bene- ficiary of EIB lending in this region, attracting around 50% of total loans in Latin America. As projects financed by the EIB must serve the interests of both the European Union and Brazil, particular emphasis has been placed on supporting EU investment in Brazil (subsidiaries of EU companies or joint ventures between EU and Brazilian firms).
