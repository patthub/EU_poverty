        "2 Summay / abstract Coverage, or the capacity to reach persons in need, is an important element of the effectiveness of social protection schemes. This paper deals with the measurement of coverage rates for income support schemes aimed at replacing the lack of primary income for the working age population, focusing on unemployment benefits and minimum income support. While a number indicators based on models or survey data are available to evaluate the adequacy and incentive structure of cash benefits (such as risk of poverty of unemployed, replacement rates, net income of benefit recipients, marginal effective tax rates) the data to assess the coverage of benefits is scarce and there is no consensus on how to measure it. This paper aims at clarifying the concepts and discusses the data sources and options for the measurement of coverage of unemployment benefits and \"non-coverage\" of minimum income support ; their potential use is illustrated with examples of analysis. A review of the methodological challenges of measuring Unemployment Benefit coverage with the available data sources (administrative and survey based) at EU level indicates that indicators based on the Labour Force Survey provide the most comparable and timely estimates. Analysis shows that the coverage of unemployment benefits varies across Member States and population groups (age, educational level, gender). Low coverage results from a variety of reasons, linked to the design of the benefits, the structure of the unemployed population and the characteristics of the labour market. Prevailing reasons vary across countries. The paper also explores the issue of non-coverage of social benefits in working age, using SILC data as they include data on all benefits. The three main aspects to be decided are the definition of the target population, the definition of coverage and the selection of benefits. After performing some sensitivity analyses, the proposed option focuses on the jobless poor as reference population, 10% as cut-off and all benefits received by working age persons excluding family/child benefits. The results show that non-coverage of people in need of last resort support increased during the crisis and that it is a considerable issue in countries such as Greece, Italy, Bulgaria and Romania. It also shows that in some countries, family and child benefits de facto play the role of last resort schemes, as a significant share of jobless poor households rely primarily on such benefits, which are not linked to activation.

        "3 1 Introduction Social protection smoothes and redistributes incomes over the life-cycle, insures people against the financial implications of social risks, such as ill health, old age or job loss, and contributes to prevent and alleviate poverty. Support is provided in cash to replace or supplement work income (unemployment benefits, pensions, child benefits) or in kind through the provision of services such as health care, child care, training or job search assistance. Beyond income smoothing, well designed social protection systems also aim to facilitate participation to the labour market, by avoiding financial disincentives to work while providing enabling services such as child care. Social protection systems also contribute to the development of human capital and to a better allocation of the labour force by allowing workers to participate in education and training and devote time to search for a job matching their skills. Beyond the protection of individuals, social protection plays a stabilising role for the economy (maintaining incomes in case of unemployment shocks) and an investment role by enhancing the quality and allocation of human capital. For all three functions of protection, stabilisation and investment, the performance of systems will depend to various degrees on - the adequacy of benefits (replacement rates), - the capacity of the system to reach all individuals in need of support (coverage), - the (dis)incentives built into the systems that may facilitate/discourage labour market participation (unemployment or inactivity traps, conditionality), - the effectiveness of individual programs, including the quality of services and their interaction with other types of intervention. This paper focuses on the measurement of coverage rates for income support benefits primarily aimed at replacing the lack of primary income for the working age population . 1.1 Focus on cash benefits for the working age The function of income support measures is i) to replace (or supplement) income of individuals that have insufficient or no access to employment income temporarily (unemployment, illness, long-term exclusion) ii) to replace (or supplement) income of individuals that have insufficient or no access to employment permanently (old age, disability 1 ). 1 Disability is not always considered as a \"permanent\" status and may be reassessed over time. In addition, disability benefits usually contain an income replacement component aimed at providing income support to those who cannot work, and a \"supplementary\" income component aimed at compensating the specific costs related to disability, which is paid regardless of the employment status. ",
        "4 1. iii) to supplement income to respond to specific needs, such as those linked to the presence of children in the household (family benefits), or to the lack of access to affordable housing (housing), or disability. In this paper, we focus on the benefits of the first category, namely unemployment and social assistance benefits, that have as a primary aim to replace income while people are temporarily out of work, and for which a policy objective is also to maintain (or establish) a link to the labour market . The specific case of disability benefits and of \"working age\" pensions will be discussed along the paper as they have an income replacement function that can interfere when we try to measure the coverage rate of unemployment benefits (UB) and social assistance benefits (SA), but they are not the focus of this paper as their primary aim is not to temporarily maintain employment incomes. We focus on unemployment and social assistance benefits for several reasons. At the individual level, the lack of replacement income during unemployment spells can translate into an increased risk of poverty, with a potential loss of human capital and adverse long-term impacts, for example on children. They also play a key role in stabilizing the economy, by evening out fluctuations in household income. Income support may also improve the efficiency of the labour markets and the economy. It can improve skills matching in the labour market, as in the absence of benefits, people may accept jobs which do not match their skills (reservation wage) or rely on the informal economy (with adverse feedback on public finances and the access to social protection, such as pension and health). Moreover, well-designed income support schemes can enhance individuals' participation in training and job search through activation measures and support from public employment services. 1.2 Focus on coverage A number of tools and indicators are available to evaluate the adequacy and incentive structure of cash benefits (risk of poverty of unemployed, replacement rates, net income of benefit recipients, marginal effective tax rates, etc). They are based on survey data (SILC) and models (Euromod, EC/OECD tax and benefit model). However, data to assess the coverage of benefits is scarce and there is no consensus on the best indicator and source to measure it. For instance, Table 1 below illustrates that available sources of data (LFS, SILC, administrative data) provide quite different estimates of the share of unemployed receiving benefits and indicate large country variations. It is thus important to review the concepts used and the data sources available, and to identify robust indicators that can be used to assess the coverage of benefits, as it is an important dimension of their effectiveness, besides adequacy and incentive structures.

(*) The administrative data is presented both including and excluding unemployment assistance schemes, which play an important role in some countries, e.g. Germany). See section3.2 for more detail on sources. Improving information on coverage rates can strengthen the monitoring of social policy. Table 2 illustrates the importance of looking jointly at adequacy and coverage indicators when assessing the effectiveness of benefits. It reveals that, while some benefits offer relatively high replacement rates, they reach only a small share of the unemployed. For instance, the data suggests that low coverage rates partly explain why the risk of poverty of the unemployed is high in BG and IT, despite quite high replacement rates. Such data, together with more detailed information on the characteristics and performance of the systems, have been used recently by the Commission to underpin \"Country Specific Recommendations\" to improve the coverage of the main working age benefits in a few Member States where it appeared especially low (see examples of CSRs and extracts of staff working documents in Annex).

It discusses ways to measure the coverage of unemployment benefits as well as the non-coverage of working age benefits. The potential use of these indicators is illustrated with examples of analysis. Section 2 describes the main characteristics of unemployment benefits and the availability of last resort schemes in EU Member States, with a focus on the features that are most likely to impact on coverage.

        "7 weakness of Member States in terms of coverage (strong requirement, short duration of benefits, labour market problems). Section 3 reviews and discusses existing data sources and the way they can be adapted to proxy effective coverage rates of unemployment benefits. It provides an overview of the pros and the cons of using each data source and discusses resulting definitions of coverage rates and necessary hypotheses. Attempts to combine the data sources are also considered and discussed. Section 4 provides a similar approach to describe gaps in income support for those out of work, body-able of working age (non-coverage of social benefits). The last section illustrates some of the possible uses of the indicators presented in this paper. 2 A brief overview of income support schemes across Europe 2.1 The main types of income support schemes Workers who lose their job or are looking for a job may have access to three main types of schemes, depending on the country: 1 unemployment insurance/allowance, 2 unemployment assistance, 3 social assistance. Table 3 summarizes the availability of the three tiers of income support in EU Member States. The first tier intervention in case of job loss is represented by unemployment benefits, which are available under various forms in all Member States. The second tier of intervention (unemployment assistance) is targeted at the unemployed and is generally means-tested ; it is available in less than half of the countries. Almost all countries have social assistance schemes. The few countries which lack social assistance schemes (Greece and Italy), introduced pilot projects during the crisis which may still be weak compared to other countries. In Italy, for instance, the pilot is limited to households with children with recent employment spells. ",
        "8 Table 3 - Availability of income support schemes Source: MISSOC extraction at 1/7/14. Access to each of the three schemes is based on different eligibility criteria, with social assistance targeting a broader pool of people (generally based on citizenship and means-testing) than unemployment benefits, which are reserved to people with eligible work histories. The eligibility criteria are also reflected in the contributory nature of benefits: a) First tier: Unemployment insurance is based on the payment of social security contributions on a compulsory or voluntary base, as in Denmark. In FI and SE, there is a voluntary scheme to top up a compulsory flat-rate allowance. While unemployment insurance benefits generally depend on previous earnings, in countries such as the UK, MT and IE unemployment allowance is flat-rate (it may vary according to other circumstances such as age and marital status). It is traditionally restricted to employees, but an increasing number of countries are extending it to self-employed. b) Second tier: Unemployment assistance is usually based upon citizenship, means-tested and increasingly linked to activation measures. c) Third tier: Social assistance benefits can be viewed as last resort schemes for unemployed who lost their entitlement to unemployment benefits, although past employment is not necessary and are generally available to a larger segment of the population. 1st tier 2nd tier last tier type means-test insurance type means-test name translation conditionsduration Austria insurance compulsory X X Needs-oriented guaranteed minimum resources residency unlimited Belgium insurance compulsory Right to social integration nationalityunlimited Bulgaria insurance compulsory Social Assistance \u2026 unlimited Croatia insurance compulsory Social Assistance unlimited Cyprus insurance compulsory Social Welfare Services unlimited Czech Republic insurance compulsory Allowance for Living unlimited Denmark insurance+basic allowance voluntarcompulsory Social Assistance unlimited Estonia insurance compulsory X X Subsistance benefit unlimited Finland insurance+basic allowance optional+compulsorcompulsory X X Social Assistance unlimited France insurance compulsory X X Active solidarity income residency 3 months, renewable?

        "9 2.2 Different approaches to the measurement of coverage rates Coverage can be measured in terms of A) potential or B) effective beneficiaries. A) According to a first approach, coverage can be assessed as the share of the population or the labour force potentially covered (but not yet unemployed) based on existing formal rules (legal or protective approach). This approach is useful for a first round assessment of the availability of income support for working age individuals in case of job loss. Nevertheless, the legal or protective approach has some drawbacks. First, the composition of the employed population varies considerably across countries, with various shares of employees, self-employed and precarious workers who may benefit from different degrees of income support 2 . Second, it does not reflect the fact that all employed persons do not face the same risk to be unemployed. It is often those with the weakest protection who are also facing greater risk of unemployment (precarious workers). Third, the duration of benefits is not taken into account. This is especially an issue for the long-term unemployed. Fourth, it does not inform on the number of people entitled. Figure 1 and Figure 2 below present some data based on this approach. Figure 1 - Coverage rates of UB based on the potential approach - I Source: ILO 2 To cope with this issue, protective coverage rates can be computed on the basis of a labour force adjusted principle (see Esser et al. 2013). ",
        "10 Figure 2 -Coverage rates of UB base on the potential approach (2010) \u2013 II Source: Esser et al. (2013), Social Policy Indicator Database (SPIN). Note: This indicates the proportion of the labour force that is covered under an unemployment insurance that would entitle them to a future insurance benefit should they become unemployed. It is enough to be covered by a basic benefit to be included as long as the basic benefit is paid without means- or income-testing. A caveat of this approach is that it might include double counting, and doesn't allow to check whether people would actually be eligible to a benefit. B) The second approach measures the proportion of people actually receiving benefits among a defined relevant population (ILO-unemployed, for example, for UB coverage). This measure goes beyond potential legal entitlements and is a picture of the actual coverage of a certain population at a given point in time. Compared to the other approach, the effective approach reflects also the duration of benefits, the previous working history and possible non-take-up of benefits of the defined target population. This approach is particularly relevant as the stabilization function of benefits and their effect on incomes and poverty depend on effective and not on theoretical coverage. This paper focuses on the measurement of coverage following the effective approach. However, effective coverage is sensitive to the choice of the relevant population (in the measure used in this paper, for instance, we exclude from coverage working people who may be receiving benefits). 2.3 The design of unemployment schemes and factors that impact on coverage The effective coverage of unemployment benefits (which includes insurance and assistance) depends on: 1 The strictness of the eligibility rules (or qualifying conditions), 2 The duration of UB (minimum and maximum) and availability of second resort schemes, 3 The labour market situation and corresponding regulations in UB schemes (share of self- employment, pattern of working histories, type of work contracts), ",
        "11 4 The non-take-up rate, 5 Other factors. Table 4 summarises the main characteristics of unemployment benefits in EU Member States in terms of eligibility and duration of UB and Table 3 summarizes the availability of second resort schemes. 1 The eligibility for unemployment benefits generally depends on previous periods of contributions in a given reference period, which vary considerably among Member States. In terms of eligibility, Slovakia has the most stringent regulation with a requirement of having worked at least 2.2 years (in the last 3.3 years), while Greece has formally the most accessible unemployment benefits requiring a bit more than 4 months of past employment in the last 15 months. Table 4 (OECD) reports a broader set of characteristics of UB and their strictness, with Portugal, Slovakia and Romania having the most stringent system and Austria, Cyprus and Finland having the most relaxed. While in Finland and Slovakia the strictness of UB is consistent with their coverage rate (respectively, very high and very low), it is not necessarily the case for other countries. For instance, Portugal has the strictest system but a coverage rate almost double than Cyprus, which has one of the least strict system of UB. 2 In terms of basic entitlements ( minimum duration of unemployment benefits), Denmark has the most generous duration of unemployment benefits (2 years), with the exception of Belgium where the duration of UB was unlimited in 2014, while Slovenia has the shortest (only 2 months). The duration of unemployment benefits generally depends on previous working history and, in a smaller number of countries, on age and other factors. Therefore, a more realistic indication of the duration of unemployment benefits, which affects coverage, can be estimated for typical workers. This allows comparing the entitlement and duration of unemployment benefits for similar workers across countries. We consider two cases: a 24 year-old with a previous working experience of 11 months and a 40 year-old with a previous working experience of 17 years. Table 4 shows that the 24 year-old is not entitled to unemployment benefits in most Member States, due to his short working history in comparison to the eligibility requirements. Finland (in principle) provides the longest unemployment benefits for young people with short working histories. The 40 year-old with a longer work record is covered in most Member States, although the duration of the unemployment benefits varies widely, with the longest duration available in Belgium (unlimited) and in the Netherlands. Figure 3 shows the gap between the maximum duration of unemployment benefits and the effective duration for these two cases (young and old). While the duration of UB in some MSs can be low, in some of these, unemployed may access unemployment assistance which prolong de facto the duration of unemployment insurance. While Finland combines an equal treatment of young and older people with a high coverage rate of unemployment benefits (see Table 4), in other Member States (e.g. Cyprus) this equal treatment does not help in explaining the low coverage rate. 3 The eligibility criteria and duration of UB are not necessarily sufficient to identify which MS have potentially the highest coverage rates as it also depends on some labour market ",
        "12 characteristics and how these interplay with the legal framework of Unemployment Benefits. For instance, high shares of self-employment affects the coverage on unemployment benefits and the ability of social protection to reduce poverty, as generally self-employed have weaker entitlements to benefits than employees, in particular for UB. Table 6 reports the share of self-employment in each MS and whether and at which conditions UB are accessible also to self-employed. In some countries where the share of self-employed is high they are not covered by UB (RO, BG, IT), while in others where it is already low they are also covered (e.g. SE). The types of jobs, and especially the extent of temporary employment may affect the average tenure in the job of some categories of workers and their capacity to accumulate the necessary work history to be eligible for benefits. The social security coverage of temporary workers is lower than for permanent workers, all other things being equal. 3 4 Non-take up of benefits also affects the observed coverage of benefits. Non-take up is linked to multiple factors, such as the amount and duration of the expected benefit 4 , information and transaction costs of applying for social assistance and factors affecting individual stigma or its perception (see IZA (2010) 5 and Eurofound (2015) 6 ). Several studies underline the difficulty of measuring non-take up but all conclude to quite significant levels. Estimates of take-up rates are available in Eurofound (2015) and in Social Situation Monitor (2013) 7 . In Italy, for instance, the non-take up of UB is estimated to be as high as 89%, in UK 37%, while for social assistance it is estimated to be above 60% in Belgium, Germany and Lithuania. 5 Other factors include the reason for becoming unemployed. For instance, Matsaganis et al. (2014) show that in most MS those who were dismissed are more often covered than those who became unemployed because their temporary job came to an end (50% versus 36% at EU level). In some MS (e.g. IT, SK, BG, PL, LV) this deficit in covering people on temporary job is considerable. A few exceptions to this general observation are represented by DK, AT and HU. Strict conditionality of unemployment benefits on activation may also reduce coverage rates. 3 Alphametrics (2009), \u2018Flexicurity: Indicators on the coverage of certain social protection benefits for persons in flexible employment in the European Union\u2019, 4 In countries where the benefits is set at a flat rate, or capped at a low level in comparison to the average wage (e.g. UK, PL, MT, DK, BE) the incentive to claim the benefit is low for high wage earners, especially if they expect to quickly find a job again. 5 Bargain, Himmervol, Viitam\u00e4ki, \"No Claim, No Pain: Measuring the Non-Take-up of Social Assistance Using Register Data\"; IZA DP No. 5355, December 2010 6 Dubois and Ludwineck; Eurofound (2015), Access to social benefits: Reducing non-take-up, Publications Office of the European Union, Luxembourg. 7 Matsaganis, Ozdemir, Ward (2014) \"The coverage rate of social benefits\" - SSM Research note 9/2013 ",

        "16 The following analysis will focus on individuals aged 18-59. Indeed, the age group aged 60-64 is more specific as a large part of individuals across Member states are already retired, and to varying extent over Europe, which makes the situation more difficult to assess. This point is left for future analysis. The analysis will be based on unemployment spells longer than 3 months only. Indeed, the period before 3 months of unemployment is specific. As underlined in Matsaganis et al. (2013), coverage rates are often peaking up only after this duration. This might be due to several blurring factors, such as administrative delays in payments of benefits, but also large non take up during initial phases of unemployment (due to stigma, but also to trust in quick return to employment). 3.2 Comparisons of existing tools In the case of unemployment benefits, for varying reasons, target population and recipients are difficult to measure through existing statistical sources: administrative data, the EU Labour Force Survey (EU-LFS), and the EU-SILC survey. Each of them presents pros and cons. Combining them to estimate the ratio would also be an issue as using the best data source to estimate the recipient and target population will not necessarily provide a reliable ratio. The target population should actually refer to those unemployed as defined by the commonly agreed International Labour Organization (ILO) definition. The only data source allowing this estimation is the Labour Force Survey. As regards the recipient population, the EU-LFS contains some information on unemployment benefits recipiency. However this information is self-declared and can be blurred by measurement issues. Administrative data on unemployment benefit recipients can be considered as the best source to measure recipient population . However, it does not allow any complementary information on the beneficiaries, especially the ILO status. It does also not include any information on non-recipients. This is an issue, as some unemployed according to the ILO-definition might not be registered in the administrative data (if they are not receiving any benefits, for example if they are not entitled to them) and more importantly some recipients of UB according the administrative data might not be considered as unemployed as from the ILO definition (for example if they are not available for a job within the next two weeks). The EU-SILC measures both benefits recipiency and unemployment status. Howeveras regards the target population , the EU-SILC survey does not measure ILO-unemployed but self-declared unemployed. As regards benefit recipients, the EU-SILC measure provides a full description of incomes including unemployment benefits at individual level. However, income data in SILC refer to a whole reference year with no monthly breakdown. This is an issue as regards the duration of benefits. Indeed, one will only be able to identify unemployed having received some benefits over the reference period. An 8 month unemployed not entitled to any benefits, but who still was entitled two months ago would be considered as a covered unemployed. Therefore, the link between unemployment spells and benefit recipiency remains fragile. Table 7 summarises the pros and cons of using different sources to estimate the effective coverage of unemployment benefits ",

Good source but no infra-annual breakdown Source: DG EMPL 3.2.1 Administrative sources An intuitive idea to cope with the drawbacks would be to combine the best available sources to compute the ratio between target population (EU-LFS) and recipient population (administrative). So- called \"pseudo-coverage rates\" can be calculated by relating the number of benefit recipients derived from administrative records to the number of unemployed as defined by the ILO. Table 8 relates to unemployment insurance schemes only. Table 9 relates to both unemployment insurance and unemployment assistance schemes where they exist (means-tested and received only when people are not entitled to unemployment insurance). \"Pseudo-coverage rates\" vary greatly across countries. When excluding unemployment assistance schemes, rates vary from less than 15% in Hungary, Malta and Slovakia to more than 100% in some countries. Rates can exceed 100% in cases where some recipients continue to receive UB even if they work a little, or on the contrary if they are not working and declare that they are not available for work or not searching actively for work. For instance, in Italy the ratio may be overerestimated as benefits recipients include a non-negligible number of employed working reduced hours. On the other hand, in Germany, the Grundsicherung f\u00fcr Arbeitssuchende covers both schemes \"Arbeitslosengeld II\" (unemployment assistance) and \"Sozialgeld\" which is very similar to a pure social assistance scheme even though it has an activation component.

The description of schemes and detailed number of recipients are available at http://www.oecd.org/social/soc/recipients.htm. However, computing such a ratio presents several drawbacks: \uf0b7 The reference periods might differ. The administrative data provide estimates of the recipients population at one point in time (generally 31/12) while the recipients data are generally a yearly average. This is especially a matter of concern in times of rapid economic changes (or in case of seasonal fluctuations). \uf0b7 Such a method presents the risk to add up the measurement errors in both population sizes. This might be an issue as statistical surveys always do better in terms of estimating a proportion rather than a population size. As a matter of fact, the results empirically suggest that there are some issues in particular since pseudo coverage rates are often higher than 100%. 3.2.2 LFS Estimating the ratio between both populations within a single data source avoids the statistical weakness linked to the combination of data sources. As discussed earlier, the LFS is the official source to measure ILO unemployment rates. Therefore, the measurement of the target population measurement (ILO unemployed) is good. Benefit recipients are identified in EU-LFS through a variable indicating whether a person is registered or not at a public employment office and receives benefits or assistance 8 . Information on recipiency is measured jointly with unemployment duration. For a more detailed explanation of this variable and the calculation of the coverage of unemployment benefits based on LFS data see annex 8.2 Nevertheless, the LFS explanatory notes mention that \" in this context, benefits are limited to allowances linked with unemployment status (not other social benefits) \" (see Annex). The difficulty is that the benefit which the unemployed report as receiving or not receiving is not defined but left to individual respondents to interpret. Consequently, it may be the case that some people receiving benefits do not report on it because it is not labelled as unemployment benefit. 8 REGISTER variable. ",
        "20 Another issue relates to the fact that there are a few countries for which data are not available or at least not in a suitable form. These are Ireland (for which it is not available) and the Netherlands (for which it is not accurate). For the UK there was a problem with the relevant LFS variable (REGISTER) in 2009 and 2010, as no distinction was made between people receiving and people not receiving benefits for those registered at a public employment office (Matsaganis et al., 2014) . 3.2.3 SILC The EU SILC survey allows getting information at individual level on unemployment spells and the receipt of unemployment benefits over a year. Unemployment spells as measured in EU SILC: some censorship issues The EU SILC also contains detailed information on the activity status on a monthly basis over the reference year. A retrospective calendar of activity describes for each month of the reference period whether the interviewee was working, unemployed or inactive 9 . This data structure makes it possible to identify the duration of unemployment spells over the reference period (number of months consecutive spent in unemployment). In the methodology developed here, the longest unemployment spell over the year is extracted. This raises some issues that would deserve further investigation for the cases of repeated unemployment spells over the year. Indeed, the first spell could result in eligibility while the second one could correspond to non-eligibility without any chance to measure it with the data. We assume currently that these cases remain limited in the sample population. The calendar structure has also the major disadvantage of left and right censorship of the data linked to the beginning and end of the year. An individual unemployed from July y-1 to February y will not be identified as being 8 months' unemployed but as a 2 months' unemployed (since only year y data is available). Similarly, an individual unemployed from September y to March y+1 will not be identified as being a 7 months' unemployed but as a 3 months' unemployed.

Income information cannot be broken down into shorter durations than one year 11 . Household income is built on the basis of several income sources, as described in the table below. Some are collected at individual level and others at household level. Unemployment benefits, is of course of particular interest in this exercise. Its precise definition is provided in annex.

This implies however some problems, in particular since it is implicitly assumed that an unemployed person is covered by unemployment benefits if he/she received some benefits over the reference period (e.g. a person who is unemployed for 10 months, actually covered during the first 3 months but not during the last seven months, will be identified as a covered person).

Therefore, this indicator does not allow to distinguish between non take-up 12 or non-eligibility. 3.3 Summary of coverage estimated with SILC and LFS Table 12 recaps the pros and cons of each data source. Given the larger number of advantages of using LFS data to estimate coverage of UB, we prefer to choose this data source to estimate the coverage rate of UB. On the other hand, SILC data represents the only source to assess the coverage of a wider set of benefits. The measurement of non-coverage of social benefits using SILC is discussed in section 5. Moreover, LFS data have a better timeliness than EU-SILC and larger sample size.

        "23 The ranking of Member States in terms of the coverage rate of unemployment benefits is generally consistent between LFS and SILC measures. For a number of countries (DE, EE, EL, ES, HR, PT, SE, SI, UK) SILC and LFS estimates are very close. As explained above estimates based on SILC tend to be higher than the coverage rate estimates based on LFS (see Figure 4), with the exception of Croatia and, especially, Romania. This can be explained by several factors and in particular exhaustion of rights is better captured in the method using LFS than in the one relying on EU SILC. Indeed, an unemployed receiving benefits at an early stage during the year will be considered as covered during the whole year (because benefits are available on an annual basis only in SILC). Similarly, individuals experiencing several spells of unemployment over the year might be covered during the first spell, but not during the following ones as they might have exhausted their rights.

        "26 4 Unemployment benefits coverage rates (based on LFS) 4.1 Trends over time While unemployment expenditure increased in the first phase of the crisis mostly due to the increased number of unemployed, since 2011 it has declined due to a fall in average expenditure per unemployed. This can be explained by the end of stimulus measures put in place at the beginning of the crisis, the tightening of benefits calculation rules and the phasing out of benefits for long-term unemployed (see ESDE 2014 and 2013). These factors contribute in explaining the fall in the coverage rate over the crisis. Many countries took bold measures to expand unemployment benefit coverage in order to mitigate the effect of the crisis. However, others adopted fiscal consolidation measures including a tightening of entitlement conditions for unemployment benefits even in the early stages of the global crisis (ILO, 2012). Between 2007 and 2014 a few Member States (Finland and, more importantly, Ireland) tightened the qualifying conditions for UB, while some others (Denmark, France, Latvia Portugal, Slovenia and, more considerably, Italy and Slovakia) relaxed these qualifying conditions (see ILO,Social security world report). The UK relaxed the wealth ceiling for the means-test. Some countries extended coverage to workers previously excluded, such as non-regular workers in Germany, the self-employed in Austria (Bonnet, Saget and Weber, 2012). Italy introduced in 2014 a scheme ( Mini Aspi ) aimed at covering young unemployed with a discontinuous working history, which characterized the relatively high share of atypical workers. Duration was increased in Latvia and Spain and reduced in Portugal and Czech Republic (ILO, 2012). As for the duration of UB for persons with the lowest entitlement, only Italy extended the duration, while Ireland, Romania, Poland, France, Czech Republic, Portugal (depending on age and working history) and, especially, Denmark) reduced it (ESDE, 2014). Some countries (e.g. Spain and UK) strengthened the activation of unemployment benefits (ILO, 2012). Between 2007 and 2013 coverage of UB increased in the majority of MS (see Chart XX), including those who extended coverage to non-regular workers such as Germany (for Italy the potential impact of the reform is not visible yet in these data as they refer to 2013). In some others, coverage decreased, for instance, in Portugal where both the entitlement and duration of benefits were tightened. ",

In Member states with short duration (such as Slovakia, Poland, the Czech Republic), the coverage is decreasing rapidly with time spent in unemployment. In Belgium, Finland and to some extent Germany and the UK, where unemployment insurance or unemployment assistance is not limited in duration, the coverage rate tends to increase over time 13 . 13 For some MS the coverage rate of LTU is higher than for STU. This may be explained by the fact that in systems where UB is set a basic level (not proportional to wage, or capped at low level: BE, FI, UK, MT, DK), many unemployed who are likely to find a job quickly do not claim the benefit. In such cases, STU coverage may be lower than LTU coverage. ",

One average across EU countries, women tend to be less covered than men. In 2013, Malta reports a significantly lower coverage rate for women (Figure 10). In some Member States, women are more covered than men, especially in Estonia. This may depend by the distribution of women and men across different sectors (e.g. public and private), type of employment (e.g. self-employment) or contract (precarious versus permanent), etc. Figure 10 - Coverage of UB by gender, 2013 Source: LFS.

        "30 The level of education has a different impact on coverage rates depending on Member States (Figure 11). In some countries (especially in the periphery) low-skilled tend to be better covered, while in others (especially in Finland and Denmark) high skilled are better covered. This again may depend by the distribution of different educational across different types of jobs and by the decision to contribute to unemployment benefits in voluntary schemes. Figure 11 - Coverage rates of UB by level of education, 2013 Source: LFS Coverage is generally lower for the young unemployed (15-24 years) as compared to for instance 25- 34 or 35 years old or more (Figure 12). This probably reflects shorter work records and as a result a lower share of eligible unemployed to benefits. The lower coverage rate for 35 years old and more compared to 25-34 years old probably reflects a higher share of long term unemployed in this age bracket. 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100 IT HR SI LT MT ES PT HU UK EL CY CZ SE LU FR BE DE SK BG PL RO LV EE DK FI low skilled better covered medium skilled better covered high skilled better covered UB coverage by level of education low medium high ",

        "32 Box 1 - The low coverage in Sweden and Italy \u2013 cautious interpretation Sweden The level of the estimated coverage for Sweden is low. A possible reason pertains individuals in activation, as their benefits might not be self-declared as unemployment benefits or assistance but treated as wages, while those individuals can be counted as unemployed. This is confirmed by the table below: administrative recipients of UB are estimated at 141 240 in 2010, divided by ILO unemployed estimated at 423 700 (33% of coverage, a bit higher than SILC/LFS estimates of 25%). ILO (2014) provides similar figures, with a coverage rate below 33%. Whether such outcomes reflect problems in the coverage of unemployment benefits is not straightforward. However, recent changes in policy rules as from 2007 lead to a lower number of people covered by unemployment insurance. This shortcoming in the definition of benefits in the LFS suggests a re-definition of the REGISTER variable in order to include also such cases. Table 15 - Programmes included in SOCR - Sweden 2009 2010 Unemployment Basic unemployment insurance 12 058 10 043 Complementary income-related insurance 151 406 131 197 Unemployment Total 163 464 141 240 In-work Activity support programs 88 442 124 696 Part-time and temporary work loose 85 649 77 930 In-work Total 174 091 202 626 Other-Social Social allowance 299 897 309 627 Other-Social Total 299 897 309 627 Incapacity Care Allowance 42 093 42 984 Disability Allowance 61 661 61 509 Sickness / activity compensation (Former Disability Pension) 498 301 442 812 Incapacity Total 602 055 547 305 Source: OECD. Comment: Unemployment figures are annual averages. Disability pensions and social assistance stocks reflect the situation at 31 December. Totals by branch are not adjusted for double counting. Italy For Italy, coverage rates are low and the difference between SILC and LFS estimates is very large: 33% and 7%, respectively, in 2012 (this value is much lower than the estimates based on administrative data). Both the low level of coverage and the large difference between the estimates based on SILC and LFS data can be explained by a peculiar type of income support measure ( Cassa Integrazione Guadagni ), which represents a considerable share of unemployment spending in Italy. This type of income support aims at compensating incomes for reducing working hours and is, in fact, a partial unemployment benefit. People receiving partial unemployment benefits do not need to be registered at a public employment office. Therefore, the variable used in the LFS for the calculation of coverage (REGISTER) does not capture these people. The low values obtained even with SILC data are explained by the fact that the denominator used for the measurement of coverage (unemployed) excludes most people actually receiving (partial) unemployment benefits. However, our chosen indicator of coverage still signals that a large share of unemployed are not receiving income support. ",
        "33 Drivers of low coverage As illustrated in section 1 some MS have strict legal requirement for the eligibility of UB and a short duration of benefits, especially for young people who normally have a short working history. In some other MS, while the overall legal framework of UB is not particularly stringent the low coverage may be explained by a legal framework which is particularly strict in particular for people with a short working history. In some other MS, while the legal framework of UB is not particularly strict the coverage of unemployed is still low. In some of these countries the explanation can be due to the characteristics of the labour market, for instance to an important share of self-employed workers who are generally not entitled or not to the same extent as employee to UB. Table below summarizes the principal drivers of low coverage of UB in EU countries. Low coverage is an issue?

        "34 4.3 Widely available unemployment benefits schemes do not discourage transitions to employment Unemployment benefit systems are intended to provide income replacement and resources for the unemployed to enable them to both maintain acceptable living standards and search for adequate job matches. However, higher levels of benefits can also carry financial disincentives to work, as illustrated in the form of high marginal effective tax rates (unemployment traps indicators). The following analysis shows that broad coverage and relatively high net replacement rate of unemployment benefits are in fact associated with lower rates of entries into poverty and that they do not prevent, and even in certain circumstances facilitate, returns to employment, and thereby are associated with better exits from poverty. There seems to be no relationship between the level of financial disincentives (as measured by the average unemployment trap) and the chances to get back to work for the unemployed. Figure 12 and Figure 13 show the extent of diversity that exists across the Member States. Countries that, by combining relatively broad coverage with high income replacement rates, such as Denmark, Austria and the Netherlands, tend to achieve low rates of entry into poverty, high returns to employment, and high exit rates out of poverty. In Bulgaria, Poland and the UK, the low coverage and low net replacement rates of their unemployment benefit schemes are associated with larger entries into poverty. However, returns to employment and exit rates from poverty are much higher in the case of the UK 14 than they are in Poland or Bulgaria. The case of Spain stands out in that there is a high rate of entries into poverty despite rather high replacement rates and a medium level of coverage.

        "36 5 Non-coverage of social benefits As the crisis years extended, an increasing number of workers lost their entitlements to unemployment benefits, or did not acquire enough rights to become eligible. In most countries, means-tested \"last resort\" schemes are available to support financially the working age people that have insufficient access to resources, and are not entitled to other benefits. These individuals have insufficient access to market income, because themselves or their partner do not work (or work very little) and they do not have assets on which to rely. However, it appears that a significant number of such individuals who would \"in principle\" be in need of some form of income support do not receive any kind of benefit. In such cases, in the absence of social transfer, they are likely to rely on family solidarity (multi-generation households, inter-household transfers) or on the informal economy. Such situations are likely to undermine efforts to bring the workers back to (formal) employment, as there are no incentives to participate in training or to actively search for a job. During the crisis, a number of national and international reports alerted on the growing importance of the problem, due to rising long-term unemployment, and in some cases to the tightening of the eligibility criteria of minimum income schemes. However, there is no established indicator measuring the extent of the phenomenom. This section aims to measure the extent of the \"non-coverage\" of social benefits primarily aimed at replacing/supplementing the income of the working age population, and to document the different sources of income on which the non-covered population tend to rely. For the estimation of the non-coverage rate of social benefits we use the EU-SILC data, which contain information on a broad range of social benefits. In order to estimate non-coverage we need to make three choices: A) on the definition of the target population; B) on the selection of social benefits to be considered; C) on the definition of the concept of non-coverage. D) We also analyse the income sources of non-covered people in order to have a better understanding of the population in need and possibly refining our definition of non-coverage. 5.1 Definition of the target population From a policy point of view, what matters is the share of the working age population in need that is left uncovered by social benefits. Working age people with no job may be a first target of social benefits. However, many jobless people can rely on the income of other members of the household. While eligibility for unemployment benefits is in most cases mainly depending on the individual situation of the worker, benefits such as social assistance are means-tested, and often take account of the total income and potential assets of the household. In order to define the population in need, several options can be envisaged: \uf0b7 Option 1 is to concentrate on jobless households (households with a very low work intensity) and possibly on those among them who are poor (see remark below on how to define the poor). This option concentrates on the income replacement function of benefits. In this option, the definition of insufficient access to resources is centered around the lack of work ",
        "37 income, and could be refined by further excluding those who rely on other types of primary income \u2013 e.g. property income (see section 5.4). \uf0b7 Option 2 would be to also include working age individuals living in households with higher work intensity who may also be poor and in need of income support to supplement low earnings. This option would take account of the fact that some benefits are also designed to supplement insufficient income. In this option, insufficient access to resources is the main criteria, and results will be sensitive to the choice of the proxy to define what level of income is insufficient (e.g. AROPE, AROP or SMD). Figure 14 reports the sensitivity of the non-coverage rate to the definition of the target population. As the definition of poverty in based on disposable income after social benefits, some welfare systems may pull some households in need out of our definition of the target population. For this reason, we also consider jobless poor before social transfers. Non-coverage is generally higher among people at-risk of poverty or exclusion (AROPE), followed by severely deprived, jobless and poor before social transfers, jobless poor and jobless. In some MS (CY, EL, BG, IT, RO) the non- coverage measures is very sensitive to the choice of the target population, while in others it is not very sensitive (e.g. in FI, FR, LU, NL). A further issue linked to the definition of the target population is the sample size in the EU-SILC data. In some MS (in particular in those with fewer people \"in need\"), restricting too much the population in need shrinks too much the sample size and make results non reliable. We decided to define the target population as working age jobless poor (option 1). The lack of replacement income for such people would suggest a lack of effectiveness of the benefit system in reaching a first round assessment of vulnerable jobless. However, this measurement does not consider the coverage of in-work poor, an important factor highlighted also by Matsaganis et al. (2014). Figure 14 - Sensitivity of non-coverage to the definition of the target population Source: EU-SILC, DG EMPL calculations. ",
        "38 5.2 Selection of benefits - An approach based on the whole set of benefits Contrary to unemployment benefits, in the case of social assistance, neither the target population of those in need of a last resort scheme nor those who are eligible can be precisely defined in comparative way. Moreover, the individual may receive other benefits than social assistance that provide adequate resources. The suggested indicator refers to all benefits received at an individual level by household members as measured in EU-SILC (unemployment, sickness, disability, education-related allowances, family/children benefits, and old age and survivors\u2019 benefits received by household members aged less than 60). We are interested in benefits which are linked to working age individuals and may possibly allow activating them. For this reason, we consider family/child allowances and pension received by other members of the household separately. This means that a non-working household that would only receive child or housing benefits as the main source of income support is not considered covered, because such income support is not primarily meant as income replacement and is not likely to be linked to activation. We nevertheless calculate the indicator including child benefits separately, to illustrate that in some countries child and housing benefits act, de facto, as last resort schemes (see above). Chart reports non-coverage rates with and without family/child benefits. In some MS (notably RO, BG, IE, HR, MT) the inclusion of family/child benefits makes a considerable difference in the extent of non-coverage. In these MS the income support of poor and jobless households is mainly through child benefits, while in MS like DK or FI the non-coverage rate is quite insensitive to the inclusion of family/child benefits. Figure 15 - Non-coverage with/without family/child benefits Source: 2012 EU-SILC UDB, DG EMPL calculations. Pensions (old age and survivors\u2019 benefits) received by individuals aged less than 60 are included in the scope of benefits, as they provide income support and are sometimes used as safety nets despite ",
        "39 this not being their original aim. Pensions received by the elderly present in the household are not included in the calculation, since they are not received by working age adults, and their primary aim is not to alleviate poverty in working age; they are considered as a separate income source (Part 3). Figure 16 illustrates the composition of income support of working age jobless poor by type of benefit. From this chart, it is possible to check the relative importance of specific benefits in supporting jobless poor. In DK, for instance, educational allowances have a considerable importance (also due to the importance of young single households). In the UK housing benefits also have a considerable importance.

        "40 Table 16 - Types of social benefit in EU-SILC Source: Eurostat 5.3 The definition of non-coverage We suggest to consider that individuals are non-covered if they receive only weak income support. For example, we suggest considering the limit of 10% of annual net disposable income coming from income support. Figure 17 reports the sensitivity of the non-coverage rate by three different thresholds (10%, 20%, 30%). Consistently with previous sensitivity tests, in some MS measurement of non-coverage is quite robust to the choice of definitions (DK, FI), while in others the choice of, for instance, different thresholds makes a considerable difference (as in HU, BG and FR).

Notes: the target population is jobless poor. 5.4 Income sources of non-covered households Figure 18 reports the level and composition by income source of covered and non-covered people. This chart helps to shed some light on how non-covered people live and to better assess the population in need. We can identify three groups of countries. In the first (DK, FI, NL, SE) a large component of income of non-covered derives from rent, so from an underlying asset. These households may be excluded from benefits by means-testing. In the second group there is a strong dependence from family benefits (e.g. IE, HU) and pensions of older members (e.g. SI, LT, LU). In the third group of countries non-covered people strongly depends on inter-household transfers (AT, DE, UK). The target population could be refined by excluding those households owning assets above a certain value. This is possible by setting absolute ceilings for the income from rent and interests. In order to take also into account the main residence we would need to consider imputed rent. Due to the methodological problems linked to imputed rent, in particular in EUSILC data, we decide not to implement this refinement of the target population. ",

Notes: covered households are jobless poor receiving more than 10% of gross income from benefits (excluding child/family benefits). Following these sensitivity analyses, we decided to define the non-coverage rate as the share of individuals aged 18\u201359, who live in a jobless household and are at risk of poverty, but whose total benefits/allowances received is less than 10 % of their total household gross income. 5.5 Results In 2013, 20 % of adults living in poor and jobless households receive less than 10 % of their income from social benefits, on average in the EU, when child benefits are included, and when child benefits are excluded the rate increases to 24 %.

MS are sorted in ascending order in the non-coverage rate excluding child benefits. Non-coverage increased in the EU, on average, over the crisis. The increase in jobless poor and tightening of benefits in some Member States contribute to explain this trend. Non-coverage increased particularly in CY and BG between 2008 and 2013 (above 10 pps). On the other hand, the share of non-covered household was substantially reduced in LT, ES and MT (by more than 10 pps) (see chart and table in Appendix).

        "44 5.6 Lack of income support and households relying on pensions Some vulnerable households receive little support from the state. Beside, in some countries, significant shares of working age adults tend to rely more heavily on pensions, including elderly pensions received by other household members. Such situations are not supportive of returns to employment because they are not associated to any incentive structures (activation, conditionality, etc). As an illustration, a significant proportion of households contain household members over 60 years of age who receive pensions which represent more than 25 % of the household income 15 . In the EU as a whole, 9 % of the people aged 18\u201359 and at-risk-of-poverty are living in a household where more than 25 % of the total household income comes from the pensions received by a 60+ year-old household member. In Denmark, the Netherlands, Finland and Germany, the share is very low \u2014 less than 1 %, but it is much higher in Bulgaria, Greece, Cyprus, Spain and Poland (15\u201320 %). Figure 21 - Proportion of the 18 \u2013 59 population living in a household where at least 25 % of annual income comes from pensions of 60+ year-old household members and the share of the population with 60+ year- old household members (multigenerational households) Source: DG EMPL calculations based on Eurostat, EU-SILC 2011 Figure 22 shows that, in Member States with low coverage rates of social benefits, the share of individuals at-risk-of-poverty who are relying on pensions from 60+ year-old household members is much larger. This is the case in Greece, Cyprus, Bulgaria, Poland and the Baltic States, as well as in Spain and Italy, while the incidence is very low in Continental and Northern Europe. As illustrated above, a large proportion of individuals not covered by social transfers are found in countries with large numbers of multi-generational households. This may be explained in so far as individuals rely on family solidarity in the absence of adequate income support. This may not facilitate the return of working age people to employment, as those without individual income 15 These countries are generally those where a large proportion of working age adults are living in multigenerational households, which is especially the case for those living in jobless and poor households, see Figure 21.

Another coping \u2018strategy\u2019 that those without access to income support may adopt is to seek work in the informal economy. This cannot be observed directly in standard statistics, but available evidence 16 tends to show that undeclared work is widespread in the countries indicated above.

The results show that countries with the lowest levels of persistent poverty are those where the non-coverage of jobless and poor households is low, and where the adequacy of social assistance benefits is high (see Figure 23). It has to be noted, that, in most countries, it is not social assistance in itself that lifts people out of poverty, since it is only in Sweden, Denmark, and the Netherlands that safety nets cover almost all those living in jobless and poor households, and provide net incomes for those living on social assistance that are above the poverty threshold. By contrast, Romania, Greece and Bulgaria are 16 See Chapter 3 of ESDE 2013 on undeclared work. ",
        "46 characterised by a very low coverage of the population living in jobless and poor households and very low adequacy of social assistance, resulting in very high rates of persistent poverty. Higher inactivity traps are associated with lower persistence of poverty, suggesting that such theoretical financial disincentives do not materialise into actual barriers to work. Figure 23 - Non-coverage and adequacy of social transfers and the dynamics of poverty Source: DG EMPL calculations based on Eurostat, EU-SILC 2009\u201310\u201311 longitudinal data 6 Final remarks Consistently with recent CSR for some MS, this paper focuses on the importance of the coverage of UB and other income support measures, in order to complement other measures on the adequacy of benefits and their link to activation. The structure of income support schemes generally consist in two/three layers. UB schemes are quite different across MS, with some imposing more stringent requirements for eligibility and a short duration. For young people, who normally have a short working history eligibility to UB is difficult in most MS, with exceptions such as in Cyprus and Finland. We discussed the methodological challenges of measuring UB coverage with the available data sources at EU level and we concluded that the measurement based on LFS data is to preferred, because ILO unemployed can only be identified with LFS data. The coverage of UB varies across population groups (age, educational level, gender) and by MS. Low coverage results from a variety of reasons, linked to the design of the benfits, the structure of the unemployed population and the characteristics of the labour market. Prevailing reasons vary across countries. The paper also explores the issue of non-coverage of social benefits, using SILC data as they include data on all benefits. The three main aspects to be decided are the definition of the target population, the definition of coverage and the selection of benefits. After performing some sensitivity analyses we chose jobless poor as reference population, 10% as cut-off and all benefits received by working age persons excluding family/child benefits. The results show that non-coverage of people in need increased during the crisis and it is a considerable issue in countries such as Greece, Italy, Bulgaria and Romania. ",

As the outflow from this scheme to the open labour market is limited, the unemployed easily find themselves outside of the open labour market for long periods.

Italy has seen the number of people at risk of poverty and social exclusion increase from 17.1 million in 2011 to 18.2 million in 2012, one of the largest increases in the EU, and to a level that is well above the 12.9 million Europe 2020 target. Also, the level of gross household disposable income further deteriorated. The share of people affected by severe material deprivation more than doubled between 2010 and 2012,32 particularly affecting children under 16 years. In-work poverty also increased in recent years.33 Social expenditure in Italy is largely oriented towards the elderly and dominated by pension expenditure, which represented 17% of GDP in 2012, the highest share in the EU. This leaves little scope for the other functions of social rotection, namely to support families and children and address the risk of social exclusion and poverty. Social assistance expenditure is fragmented and there is no nation-wide minimum income scheme in place. As a result, Italy has the third highest share of people living in poor or jobless households that are not covered by social transfers, and a large share of the working age population is dependent on the pension income of a family member.\" SWD- \"Following the 2013 country-specific recommendation, the steps taken towards a strengthened protection against poverty go in the right direction, but close monitoring is warranted. An updated and nationally harmonised criterion informing the means-testing ",
        "50 system was approved in December 2013 to improve the selection of those most in need of social assistance. The government has taken further action to facilitate access to housing for people in difficult economic conditions.34A new measure \u2014 Support for Active Inclusion \u2014was also introduced as a pilot project to support those in the most disadvantaged situations by means of the \u2018new social card\u2019, already in use in the 12 largest cities and in southern areas. It is expected to gradually replace the old support (purchase card) in force since 2008 with an approach combining monetary support with compulsory activation and social services programmes. The new scheme represents a significant step in the right direction. However, its strict eligibility requirements, which limit it to households with children and with recent employment spells, and the uneven quality of services provided by the public employment and social services across different regions, limit its effectiveness as a social safety net and activating tool. Given Italy's important budgetary constraints, the extension of this measure to the entire Italian territory, as announced in the national reform programme, requires adequate and efficient allocation of the available financial resources through a recalibration of the social expenditure and appropriate targeting of the beneficiaries, in particular families with children.\" Hungary CSR - \"Improve the adequacy and coverage of social assistance while strengthening the link to activation\" SWD \u2013 \"In 2013, [severe material deprivation] affected more than a quarter of all Hungarian residents (more than a third of all children). Housing deprivation among children is growing and despite some improvement in 2013 the share of children living in low work intensity households is still higher than EU average. The stagnating economy is one cause. The other main causes were: the inability of the social protection system to respond to social needs; a persistent level of unemployment; frozen social transfers since 2008; reduced amount of employment substitute benefit (HUF 22 800 per month) with tightened eligibility criteria; and a reduction in the maximum duration of unemployment benefit to three months (the shortest in the EU). Social assistance benefits are among the lowest in the EU, while the capacity of the social safety net to alleviate poverty decreased significantly between 2007 and 2012.38 This is reflected in increasing relative poverty rates after cash transfers are accounted for, despite decreasing relative poverty rates before cash transfers.\" Lithuania CSR- \"Ensure adequate coverage of those most in need and continue to strengthen the links between cash social assistance and activation measures\" SWD \u2013 \"A reform to social assistance benefits piloted in five municipalities has significantly reduced the number of people receiving benefits and thus also overall social expenditure. The effects of the reform on social activation and on poverty reduction are less clear however. Following a pilot project, the management of social benefit schemes has been moved to municipal level as of 2014. This allows municipalities to exercise discretion in granting social benefits, with a view to increasing efficiency. The effects of the reform may require careful monitoring to ensure that there is equal access to social assistance in all municipalities. As municipalities have the right to transfer unused funds allocated to social assistance to other programmes, adverse incentives may arise, which ",
        "51 could affect the most vulnerable in society. Only limited progress has been made in extending the coverage of activation measures. While these measures have been extended to recipients of benefits without children, the activation measures continue to be mainly focused on public service employment schemes and employment for socially useful activities and thus have only a limited impact on future employability.\" Latvia CSR \u2013 \"Reform social assistance and its financing further to ensure better coverage, adequacy of benefits, strengthened activation and targeted social services. Increase coverage of active labour market policies. Improve the cost-effectiveness, quality and accessibility of the health care system.\" SWD \u2013 \"The coverage and adequacy of social assistance is low and the incentives to work for some groups of social assistance recipients could be improved. Many benefit recipients face barriers to employment such as poor health, low skills, caring obligations, addictions, low regional mobility, and low motivation. The weak capacity of social services limits the success of bringing benefit recipients into active employment.\" Portugal CSR \u2013 \"Increase the threshold for the eligibility for the minimum income scheme. Ensure adequate coverage of social assistance, while ensuring effective activation of benefit recipients.\" SWD \u2013 \"The social protection system is characterised by a high non-coverage rate of jobless poor, which at 42.3% is the 4th highest after Italy, Greece (which have no national minimum income schemes) and Bulgaria. In particular, the income threshold for eligibility of the Minimum Income Scheme (Rendimento Social de Inser\u00e7\u00e3o) has been lowered in 2010 and again in 201219, effectively reducing coverage especially for large families. In particular, since 2011. The income threshold for eligibility for unemployment assistance (Subs\u00eddio Social de Desemprego) has also decreased in 2010 as a consequence of a change in the equivalent scale.\" Source: Authors, based on http://ec.europa.eu/europe2020/making-it-happen/country-specific- recommendations/index_en.htm 8.2 Calculation of the coverage rate of unemployment benefits based on LFS data The coverage rate of unemployment benefits is calculated as the ratio between the number of a) persons registered or not at a public employment office and receiving benefits or assistance and the number of b) ILO unemployed. a) In the LFS data unemployment benefit recipients are identified through the variable REGISTER.

Unemployment benefits (PY090G) Unemployment benefits refer to benefits that replace in whole or in part income lost by a worker due to the loss of gainful employment; provide a subsistence (or better) income to persons entering or re-entering the labour market; compensate for the loss of earnings due to partial unemployment; replace in whole or in part income lost by an older worker who retires from gainful employment before the legal retirement age because of job reductions for economic reasons; contribute to the cost of training or re-training people looking for employment; or help unemployed persons meet the cost of travelling or relocating to obtain employment; It includes: \u2013 Full unemployment benefits: benefits compensating for loss of earnings where a person is capable of working and available for work but is unable to find suitable employment, including persons who had not previously been employed. \u2013 Partial unemployment benefits: benefits compensating for the loss of wages or salary due to formal short-time working arrangements, and/or intermittent work schedules, irrespective of their cause (business recession or slow-down, breakdown of equipment, climatic conditions, accidents and so on), and where the employer/employee relationship continues. \u2013 Early retirement for labour market reasons: periodic payments to older workers who retire before reaching standard retirement age due to unemployment or to job reductions caused by economic measures such as the restructuring of an industrial sector or of a business enterprise. These payments normally cease when the beneficiary becomes entitled to an old age pension. \u2013 Vocational training allowance: payments by social security funds or public agencies to targeted groups of persons in the labour force who take part in training schemes intended to develop their potential for employment. \u2013 Mobility and resettlement: payments by social security funds or public agencies to unemployed persons to encourage them to move to another locality or change their occupation in order to seek or to obtain work. \u2013 Severance and termination payments (benefits compensating employees for employment ending before the employee has reached the normal retirement age for that job) . ",
        "59 \u2013 Redundancy compensation: capital sums paid to employees who have been dismissed through no fault of their own by an enterprise that is ceasing or cutting down its activities. \u2013 Other cash benefits: other financial assistance, particularly payments to the long-term unemployed It excludes: d under \u2018Family/children related allowances\u2019 (HY050G)). Unemployment benefits (PY090N) The net income component correspond to the gross income components but the tax at source, the social insurance contributions or both ( if applicable) are deducted. Comments about unemployment benefits - There are two concepts related to vocational training allowance under the unemployment benefit function: The vocational training allowance, i.e. payment by social security funds or public agencies to targeted groups of persons in the labour force who take part in training schemes intended to develop their potential for employment. This is considered as benefit in cash and thus included in PY090. A benefit (in-kind) related to vocational training, i.e. payments by social security funds or public agencies to institutions that provide training courses to unemployed people. This benefits are excluded from EU-SILC.

In particular, if the person combines different part-time jobs as employee leading to an equivalent full-time work, the person should consider his/herself as employee working full-time (code 1 should be ticked for the month). If more than one type of activities occur in the same month, priority should be given to economic activity (\u201cmain activity: work\u201d) over non-economic activity and over inactivity. On the basis of this principle, the following rules may be used: - If the respondent worked, at least during 2 weeks of the month, then code 1, 2, 3 or 4 should be ticked for the month. - If more than one of the other codes apply in the same month, the respondent will select one on the basis of self-assessment. The criterion of most time spent may be useful where applicable.
