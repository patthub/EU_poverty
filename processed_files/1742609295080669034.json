        "I (Acts adopted under the EC Treaty/Euratom Treaty whose publication is obligatory) REGULATIONS REGULATION (EC) No 713/2009 OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL of 13 July 2009 establishing an Agency for the Cooperation of Energy Regulators (Text with EEA relevance) THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EURO\u00ad PEAN UNION, Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Commu\u00ad nity, and in particular Article 95 thereof, Having regard to the proposal from the Commission, Having regard to the Opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee ( 1 ) OJ C 211, 19.8.2008, p. 23. ( Having regard to the Opinion of the Committee of the Regions ( 2 ) OJ C 172, 5.7.2008, p. 55. ( Acting in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 251 of the Treaty ( 3 ) Opinion of the European Parliament of 18 June 2008 (not yet pub\u00ad lished in the Official Journal), Council Common Position of 9 January 2009 (OJ C 75 E, 31.3.2009, p. 1) and Position of the European Par\u00ad liament of 22 April 2009 (not yet published in the Official Journal). Council Decision of 25 June 2009. ( Whereas: (1) The Communication of the Commission of 10 January 2007 entitled \u2018An Energy Policy for Europe\u2019 highlighted the importance of completing the internal markets in electric\u00ad ity and natural gas. Improving the regulatory framework at Community level was identified as a key measure to achieve that objective. (2) An independent advisory group on electricity and gas, called the European Regulators Group for Electricity and Gas (ERGEG) was established by Commission Decision 2003/796/EC ( 4 ) OJ L 296, 14.11.2003, p. 34. ( a n a n and cooperation between the regulatory bodies in Mem\u00ad ber States, and between those bodies and the Commission, with a view to consolidating the internal markets in elec\u00ad tricity and natural gas. That group is composed of repre\u00ad sentatives of the national regulatory authorities established pursuant to Directive 2003/54/EC of the European Parlia\u00ad ment and of the Council of 26 June 2003 concerning com\u00ad mon rules for the internal market in electricity ( 5 ) OJ L 176, 15.7.2003, p. 37. ( an Directive 2003/55/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 26 June 2003 concerning common rules for the internal market in natural gas ( 6 ) OJ L 176, 15.7.2003, p. 57. ( (3) The work undertaken by the ERGEG since its establish\u00ad ment has made a positive contribution to the internal mar\u00ad kets in electricity and natural gas. However, it is widely recognised by the sector, and has been proposed by the ERGEG itself, that voluntary cooperation between national regulatory authorities should now take place within a Community structure with clear competences and with the power to adopt individual regulatory decisions in a num\u00ad ber of specific cases. (4) The European Council of 8 and 9 March 2007 invited the Commission to propose measures to set up an indepen\u00ad dent mechanism for national regulators to cooperate. (5) \u0422he Member States should cooperate closely, eliminating obstacles to cross-border exchanges of electricity and natu\u00ad ral gas with a view to achieving the objectives of Commu\u00ad nity energy policy. On the basis of the impact assessment of the resource requirements for a central entity, it was concluded that an independent central entity offered a number of long-term advantages over other options. An Agency for the Cooperation of Energy Regulators (the 1 / 1 1 2 L n o i n U n a e p o r u E e h t f o l a n r u o J l a i c i f f O N E 9 0 0 2 . 8 . 4 1 . ) 6 d ) 5 n o i t a n i d r o o c , o i t t l u s o c e t a t i l i c f o t ) 4 , ) 3 , ) 2 , ) 1 ",
        "Agency) should be established in order to fill the regula\u00ad tory gap at Community level and to contribute towards the effective functioning of the internal markets in electricity and natural gas. The Agency should also enable national regulatory authorities to enhance their cooperation at Community level and participate, on a mutual basis, in the exercise of Community-related functions. (6) The Agency should ensure that regulatory functions per\u00ad formed by the national regulatory authorities in accor\u00ad dance with Directive 2009/72/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 13 July 2009 concerning common rules for the internal market in electricity ( 1 ) See page 55 of this Official Journal. ( an Directive 2009/73/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 13 July 2009 concerning common rules for the internal market in natural gas ( 2 ) See page 94 of this Official Journal. ( a nated and, where necessary, completed at the Community level. To that end, it is necessary to guarantee the indepen\u00ad dence of the Agency from electricity and gas producers, transmission and distribution system operators, whether public or private, and consumers and to ensure the con\u00ad formity of its actions with Community law, its technical and regulatory capacities and its transparency, amenability to democratic control and efficiency. (7) The Agency should monitor regional cooperation between transmission system operators in the electricity and gas sectors as well as the execution of the tasks of the Euro\u00ad pean Network of Transmission System Operators for Elec\u00ad tricity (ENTSO for Electricity), and the European Network of Transmission System Operators for Gas (ENTSO for Gas). The involvement of the Agency is essential in order to ensure that the cooperation between transmission sys\u00ad tem operators proceeds in an efficient and transparent way for the benefit of the internal markets in electricity and natural gas. (8) The Agency should monitor, in cooperation with the Com\u00ad mission, the Member States and relevant national authori\u00ad ties, the internal markets in electricity and natural gas and inform the European Parliament, the Commission and national authorities of its findings where appropriate. Those monitoring tasks of the Agency should not dupli\u00ad cate or hamper monitoring by the Commission or national authorities, in particular national competition authorities. (9) The Agency has an important role in developing frame\u00ad work guidelines which are non-binding by nature (frame\u00ad work guidelines) with which network codes must be in line. It is also considered appropriate for the Agency, and consistent with its purpose, to have a role in reviewing net\u00ad work codes (both when created and upon modification) to ensure that they are in line with the framework guidelines, before it may recommend them to the Commission for adoption. (10) It is appropriate to provide an integrated framework within which national regulatory authorities are able to partici\u00ad pate and cooperate. That framework should facilitate the uniform application of the legislation on the internal mar\u00ad kets in electricity and natural gas throughout the Commu\u00ad nity. As regards situations concerning more than one Member State, the Agency should be granted the power to adopt individual decisions. That power should under cer\u00ad tain conditions cover technical issues, the regulatory regime for electricity and natural gas infrastructure that connects or that might connect at least two Member States and, as a last resort, exemptions from the internal market rules for new electricity interconnectors and new gas infra\u00ad structure located in more than one Member State. (11) Since the Agency has an overview of the national regula\u00ad tory authorities, it should have an advisory role towards the Commission, other Community institutions and national regulatory authorities as regards the issues relat\u00ad ing to the purpose for which it was established. It should also be required to inform the Commission where it finds that the cooperation between transmission system opera\u00ad tors does not produce the results which are needed or that a national regulatory authority whose decision is not in compliance with the Guidelines does not implement the opinion, recommendation or decision of the Agency appropriately. (12) The Agency should also be able to make recommendations to assist regulatory authorities and market players in shar\u00ad ing good practices. (13) The Agency should consult interested parties, where appropriate, and provide them with a reasonable opportu\u00ad nity to comment on proposed measures, such as network codes and rules. (14) The Agency should contribute to the implementation of the guidelines on trans-European energy networks as laid down in Decision No 1364/2006/EC of the European Par\u00ad liament and of the Council of 6 September 2006 laying down guidelines for trans-European energy networks ( 3 ) OJ L 262, 22.9.2006, p. 1. ( particular when providing its opinion on the non-binding Community-wide ten-year network development plans (Community-wide network development plans) in accor\u00ad dance with Article 6(3) of this Regulation. (15) The Agency should contribute to the efforts of enhancing energy security. (16) The structure of the Agency should be adapted to meet the specific needs of energy regulation. In particular, the spe\u00ad cific role of the national regulatory authorities needs to be taken fully into account and their independence guaranteed. 9 0 0 2 . 8 . 4 1 n o i n U n a e p o r u E e h t f o l a n r u o J l a i c i f f O N E 2 / 1 1 2 L n i , ) 3 - i d r o o c y l r e p o r p e r ) 2 d ) 1 ",
        "(17) The Administrative Board should have the necessary pow\u00ad ers to establish the budget, check its implementation, draw up internal rules, adopt financial regulations and appoint a Director. A rotation system should be used for the renewal of the members of the Administrative Board who are appointed by the Council so as to ensure a balanced participation of Member States over time. The Administra\u00ad tive Board should act independently and objectively in the public interest and should not seek or follow political instructions. (18) The Agency should have the necessary powers to perform its regulatory functions in an efficient, transparent, rea\u00ad soned and, above all, independent manner. The indepen\u00ad dence of the Agency from electricity and gas producers and transmission and distribution system operators is not only a key principle of good governance but also a fundamen\u00ad tal condition to ensure market confidence. Without preju\u00ad dice to its members\u2019 acting on behalf of their respective national authorities, the Board of Regulators should there\u00ad fore act independently from any market interest, should avoid conflicts of interests and should not seek or follow instructions or accept recommendations from a govern\u00ad ment of a Member State, from the Commission or another public or private entity. The decisions of the Board of Regulators should, at the same time, comply with Commu\u00ad nity law concerning energy, such as the internal energy market, the environment and competition. The Board of Regulators should report its opinions, recommendations and decisions to the Community institutions. (19) Where the Agency has decision-making powers, interested parties should, for reasons of procedural economy, be granted a right of appeal to a Board of Appeal, which should be part of the Agency, but independent from its administrative and regulatory structure. In the interest of continuity, the appointment or renewal of the members of the Board of Appeal should allow for partial replacement of the members of the Board of Appeal. The decisions of the Board of Appeal may be subject to appeal before the Court of Justice of the European Communities. (20) The Agency should be mainly financed from the general budget of the European Union, by fees and by voluntary contributions. In particular, the resources currently pooled by regulatory authorities for their cooperation at Commu\u00ad nity level should continue to be available to the Agency. The Community budgetary procedure should remain applicable as far as any subsidies chargeable to the general budget of the European Union are concerned. Moreover, the auditing of accounts should be undertaken by the Court of Auditors in accordance with Article 91 of Com\u00ad mission Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 2343/2002 of 19 November 2002 on the framework Financial Regula\u00ad tion for the bodies referred to in Article 185 of Council Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 1605/2002 on the Financial Regulation applicable to the general budget of the Euro\u00ad pean Communities ( 1 ) OJ L 357, 31.12.2002, p. 72. ( (21) After the establishment of the Agency, its budget should be assessed by the budgetary authority on an ongoing basis, with reference to the Agency\u2019s workload and performance. The budgetary authority should ensure that the best stan\u00ad dards of efficiency are met. (22) The Agency should have highly professional staff. In par\u00ad ticular, it should benefit from the competence and experi\u00ad ence of staff seconded by the national regulatory authorities, the Commission and the Member States. The Staff Regulations of Officials of the European Communi\u00ad ties (the Staff Regulations) and the Conditions of employ\u00ad ment of other servants of the European Communities (the Conditions of Employment), laid down in Regulation (EEC, Euratom, ECSC) No 259/68 ( 2 ) OJ L 56, 4.3.1968, p. 1. ( an jointly by the European Community institutions for the purpose of applying those regulations should apply to the staff of the Agency. The Administrative Board, in agree\u00ad ment with the Commission, should adopt appropriate implementing rules. (23) The Agency should apply the general rules regarding pub\u00ad lic access to documents held by Community bodies. The Administrative Board should establish the practical mea\u00ad sures to protect commercially sensitive data and personal data. (24) The Agency should be accountable to the European Parlia\u00ad ment, the Council and the Commission, where appropriate. (25) Countries which are not members of the Community should be able to participate in the work of the Agency in accordance with appropriate agreements to be concluded by the Community. (26) The measures necessary for the implementation of this Regulation should be adopted in accordance with Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers con\u00ad ferred on the Commission ( 3 ) OJ L 184, 17.7.1999, p. 23. ( (27) In particular, the Commission should be empowered to adopt the Guidelines necessary in situations in which the Agency becomes competent to decide upon the terms and conditions for access to and operational security of cross- border infrastructure. Since those measures are of general scope and are designed to amend non-essential elements of this Regulation, by supplementing it with new non- essential elements, they must be adopted in accordance with the regulatory procedure with scrutiny provided for in Article 5a of Decision 1999/468/EC. 3 / 1 1 2 L n o i n U n a e p o r u E e h t f o l a n r u o J l a i c i f f O N E 9 0 0 2 . 8 . 4 1 . ) 3 d e t p o d a s e l u r e h t d ) 2 . ) 1 ",
        "(28) The Commission should submit to the European Parlia\u00ad ment and to the Council by three years after the first direc\u00ad tor has taken up his duties, and every four years thereafter, a report on the Agency\u2019s specific tasks and the results achieved, accompanied by any appropriate proposals. In that report, the Commission should make suggestions on additional tasks for the Agency. (29) Since the objectives of this Regulation, namely the partici\u00ad pation and cooperation of national regulatory authorities at Community level, cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States and can therefore be better achieved at Community level, the Community may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty. In accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in that Article, this Regulation does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve those objectives, HAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION: CHAPTER I ESTABLISHMENT AND LEGAL STATUS Article 1 Subject matter 1.

Council Decision of 25 June 2009. ( Whereas: (1) The internal market in electricity, which has been progres\u00ad sively implemented since 1999, aims to deliver real choice for all consumers in the Community, be they citizens or businesses, new business opportunities and more cross- border trade, so as to achieve efficiency gains, competitive prices and higher standards of service, and to contribute to security of supply and sustainability. (2) Directive 2003/54/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 26 June 2003 concerning common rules for the internal market in electricity ( 4 ) OJ L 176, 15.7.2003, p. 37.

( a made significant contributions towards the creation of such an internal market in electricity. (3) However, at present, there are obstacles to the sale of elec\u00ad tricity on equal terms, without discrimination or disadvan\u00ad tage in the Community. In particular, non-discriminatory network access and an equally effective level of regulatory supervision do not yet exist in each Member State, and iso\u00ad lated markets persist. (4) The Communication of the Commission of 10 January 2007 entitled \u2018An Energy Policy for Europe\u2019 highlighted the importance of completing the internal market in electric\u00ad ity and creating a level playing field for all electricity under\u00ad takings in the Community. The Communications of the Commission of 10 January 2007 entitled \u2018Prospects for the internal gas and electricity market\u2019 and \u2018Inquiry pursuant to Article 17 of Regulation (EC) No 1/2003 into the Euro\u00ad pean gas and electricity sectors (Final Report)\u2019 demon\u00ad strated that the present rules and measures neither provide the necessary framework nor provide for the creation of interconnection capacities to achieve the objective of a well-functioning, efficient and open internal market. (5) In addition to thoroughly implementing the existing regu\u00ad latory framework, the regulatory framework for the inter\u00ad nal market in electricity set out in Regulation (EC) No 1228/2003 should be adapted in line with those communications. (6) In particular, increased cooperation and coordination among transmission system operators is required to create network codes for providing and managing effective and transparent access to the transmission networks across borders, and to ensure coordinated and sufficiently forward-looking planning and sound technical evolution of the transmission system in the Community, including the creation of interconnection capacities, with due regard to the environment. Those network codes should be in line with framework guidelines, which are non-binding in nature (framework guidelines) and which are developed by the Agency for the Cooperation of Energy Regulators established by Regulation (EC) No 713/2009 of the Euro\u00ad pean Parliament and of the Council of 13 July 2009 estab\u00ad lishing an Agency for the Cooperation of Energy Regulators ( 6 ) See page 1 of this Official Journal.

        "Official Journal of the European Union 14.8.2009 Network of Transmission System Operators for Electricity (the ENTSO for Electricity), should be established. The tasks of the ENTSO for Electricity should be carried out in compliance with Community competition rules which remain applicable to the decisions of the ENTSO for Elec\u00ad tricity. The tasks of the ENTSO for Electricity should be well-defined and its working method should ensure effi\u00ad ciency, transparency and the representative nature of the ENTSO for Electricity. The network codes prepared by the ENTSO for Electricity are not intended to replace the nec\u00ad essary national network codes for non-cross-border issues. Given that more effective progress may be achieved through an approach at regional level, transmission system operators should set up regional structures within the overall cooperation structure, whilst ensuring that results at regional level are compatible with network codes and non-binding ten-year network development plans at Com\u00ad munity level. Member States should promote cooperation and monitor the effectiveness of the network at regional level. Cooperation at regional level should be compatible with progress towards a competitive and efficient internal market in electricity. (8) All market participants have an interest in the work expected of the ENTSO for Electricity. An effective consul\u00ad tation process is therefore essential and existing structures that are set up to facilitate and streamline the consultation process, such as the Union for the Coordination of Trans\u00ad mission of Electricity, national regulators or the Agency, should play an important role. (9) In order to ensure greater transparency regarding the entire electricity transmission network in the Community, the ENTSO for Electricity should draw up, publish and regu\u00ad larly update a non-binding Community-wide ten-year net\u00ad work development plan (Community-wide network development plan). Viable electricity transmission net\u00ad works and necessary regional interconnections, relevant from a commercial or security of supply point of view, should be included in that network development plan. (10) This Regulation should lay down basic principles with regard to tarification and capacity allocation, whilst pro\u00ad viding for the adoption of Guidelines detailing further rel\u00ad evant principles and methodologies, in order to allow rapid adaptation to changed circumstances. (11) In an open, competitive market, transmission system operators should be compensated for costs incurred as a result of hosting cross-border flows of electricity on their networks by the operators of the transmission systems from which cross-border flows originate and the systems where those flows end. (12) Payments and receipts resulting from compensation between transmission system operators should be taken into account when setting national network tariffs. (13) The actual amount payable for cross-border access to the system can vary considerably, depending on the transmis\u00ad sion system operator involved and as a result of differences in the structure of the tarification systems applied in Mem\u00ad ber States. A certain degree of harmonisation is therefore necessary in order to avoid distortions of trade. (14) A proper system of long-term locational signals is neces\u00ad sary, based on the principle that the level of the network access charges should reflect the balance between genera\u00ad tion and consumption of the region concerned, on the basis of a differentiation of the network access charges on producers and/or consumers. (15) It would not be appropriate to apply distance-related tar\u00ad iffs or, provided appropriate locational signals are in place, a specific tariff to be paid only by exporters or importers in addition to the general charge for access to the national network. (16) The precondition for effective competition in the internal market in electricity is non-discriminatory and transparent charges for network use including interconnecting lines in the transmission system. The available capacity of those lines should be set at the maximum levels consistent with the safety standards of secure network operation. (17) It is important to avoid distortion of competition resulting from the differing safety, operational and planning stan\u00ad dards used by transmission system operators in Member States. Moreover, there should be transparency for market participants concerning available transfer capacities and the security, planning and operational standards that affect the available transfer capacities. (18) Market monitoring undertaken over recent years by the national regulatory authorities and by the Commission has shown that current transparency requirements and rules on access to infrastructure are not sufficient to secure a genuine, well-functioning, open and efficient internal mar\u00ad ket in electricity. (19) Equal access to information on the physical status and effi\u00ad ciency of the system is necessary to enable all market par\u00ad ticipants to assess the overall demand and supply situation and identify the reasons for movements in the wholesale price. This includes more precise information on electric\u00ad ity generation, supply and demand including forecasts, network and interconnection capacity, flows and mainte\u00ad nance, balancing and reserve capacity.

        "(20) To enhance trust in the market, its participants need to be sure that those engaging in abusive behaviour can be sub\u00ad ject to effective, proportionate and dissuasive penalties. The competent authorities should be given the competence to investigate effectively allegations of market abuse. To that end, it is necessary that competent authorities have access to data that provides information on operational decisions made by supply undertakings. In the electricity market, many relevant decisions are made by the genera\u00ad tors, which should keep information in relation thereto available to and easily accessible by the competent authori\u00ad ties for a fixed period of time. The competent authorities should, furthermore, regularly monitor the compliance of the transmission system operators with the rules. Small generators with no real ability to distort the market should be exempt from that obligation. (21) There should be rules on the use of revenues flowing from congestion-management procedures, unless the specific nature of the interconnector concerned justifies an exemp\u00ad tion from those rules. (22) The management of congestion problems should provide correct economic signals to transmission system operators and market participants and should be based on market mechanisms. (23) Investments in major new infrastructure should be pro\u00ad moted strongly while ensuring the proper functioning of the internal market in electricity. In order to enhance the positive effect of exempted direct current interconnectors on competition and security of supply, market interest dur\u00ad ing the project-planning phase should be tested and congestion-management rules should be adopted. Where direct current interconnectors are located in the territory of more than one Member State, the Agency should handle as a last resort the exemption request in order to take better account of its cross-border implications and to facilitate its administrative handling. Moreover, given the exceptional risk profile of constructing those exempt major infrastruc\u00ad ture projects, undertakings with supply and production interests should be able to benefit from a temporary dero\u00ad gation from the full unbundling rules for the projects con\u00ad cerned. Exemptions granted under Regulation (EC) No 1228/2003 continue to apply until the scheduled expiry date as decided in the granted exemption decision. (24) To ensure the smooth functioning of the internal market in electricity, provision should be made for procedures which allow the adoption of decisions and Guidelines with regard, inter alia, to tarification and capacity allocation by the Commission whilst ensuring the involvement of Mem\u00ad ber States\u2019 regulatory authorities in that process, where appropriate through their European association. Regula\u00ad tory authorities, together with other relevant authorities in the Member States, have an important role to play in con\u00ad tributing to the proper functioning of the internal market in electricity. (25) National regulatory authorities should ensure compliance with the rules contained in this Regulation and the Guide\u00ad lines adopted pursuant thereto. (26) The Member States and the competent national authorities should be required to provide relevant information to the Commission. Such information should be treated confi\u00ad dentially by the Commission. Where necessary, the Com\u00ad mission should have an opportunity to request relevant information directly from undertakings concerned, pro\u00ad vided that the competent national authorities are informed. (27) Member States should lay down rules on penalties appli\u00ad cable to infringements of the provisions of this Regulation and ensure that they are implemented. Those penalties must be effective, proportionate and dissuasive. (28) The measures necessary for the implementation of this Regulation should be adopted in accordance with Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers con\u00ad ferred on the Commission ( 1 ) OJ L 184, 17.7.1999, p. 23. ( (29) In particular, the Commission should be empowered to establish or adopt the Guidelines necessary for providing the minimum degree of harmonisation required to achieve the aims of this Regulation. Since those measures are of general scope and are designed to amend non-essential ele\u00ad ments of this Regulation, by supplementing it with new non-essential elements, they must be adopted in accor\u00ad dance with the regulatory procedure with scrutiny pro\u00ad vided for in Article 5a of Decision 1999/468/EC. (30) Since the objective of this Regulation, namely the provi\u00ad sion of a harmonised framework for cross-border exchanges of electricity, cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States and can therefore be better achieved at Community level, the Community may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity, as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty. In accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in that Article, this Regulation does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve that objective. (31) Given the scope of the amendments that are being made herein to Regulation (EC) No 1228/2003, it is desirable, for reasons of clarity and rationalisation, that the provisions in question should be recast by bringing them all together in a single text in a new Regulation, HAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION: Article 1 Subject-matter and scope This Regulation aims at: (a) setting fair rules for cross-border exchanges in electricity, thus enhancing competition within the internal market in electricity, taking into account the particular characteristics 7 1 / 1 1 2 L n o i n U n a e p o r u E e h t f o l a n r u o J l a i c i f f O N E 9 0 0 2 . 8 . 4 1 . ) 1 ",
        "of national and regional markets. This will involve the estab\u00ad lishment of a compensation mechanism for cross-border flows of electricity and the setting of harmonised principles on cross-border transmission charges and the allocation of available capacities of interconnections between national transmission systems; (b) facilitating the emergence of a well-functioning and transpar\u00ad ent wholesale market with a high level of security of supply in electricity. It provides for mechanisms to harmonise the rules for cross-border exchanges in electricity. Article 2 Definitions 1. For the purpose of this Regulation, the definitions contained in Article 2 of Directive 2009/72/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 13 July 2009 concerning common rules for the internal market in electricity ( 1 ) See page 55 of this Official Journal. ( a the definition of \u2018interconnector\u2019 which shall be replaced by the following: \u2014 \u2018interconnector\u2019 means a transmission line which crosses or spans a border between Member States and which connects the national transmission systems of the Member States. 2. The following definitions shall apply: (a) \u2018regulatory authorities\u2019 means the regulatory authorities referred to in Article 35(1) of Directive 2009/72/EC; (b) \u2018cross-border flow\u2019 means a physical flow of electricity on a transmission network of a Member State that results from the impact of the activity of producers and/or consumers outside that Member State on its transmission network; (c) \u2018congestion\u2019 means a situation in which an interconnection linking national transmission networks cannot accommodate all physical flows resulting from international trade requested by market participants, because of a lack of capacity of the interconnectors and/or the national transmission systems concerned; (d) \u2018declared export\u2019 means the dispatch of electricity in one Member State on the basis of an underlying contractual arrangement to the effect that the simultaneous correspond\u00ad ing take-up (declared import) of electricity will take place in another Member State or a third country; (e) \u2018declared transit\u2019 means a circumstance where a declared export of electricity occurs and where the nominated path for the transaction involves a country in which neither the dis\u00ad patch nor the simultaneous corresponding take-up of the electricity will take place; (f) \u2018declared import\u2019 means the take-up of electricity in a Mem\u00ad ber State or a third country simultaneously with the dispatch of electricity (declared export) in another Member State; (g) \u2018new interconnector\u2019 means an interconnector not completed by 4 August 2003. For the purpose of the inter-transmission system operator com\u00ad pensation mechanism referred to in Article 13 only, where trans\u00ad mission networks of two or more Member States form part, in whole or in part, of a single control block, the control block as a whole shall be considered as forming part of the transmission net\u00ad work of one of the Member States concerned, in order to avoid flows within control blocks being considered as cross-border flows under point (b) of the first subparagraph of this paragraph and giving rise to compensation payments under Article 13. The regulatory authorities of the Member States concerned may decide which of the Member States concerned shall be that of which the control block as a whole is to be considered to form part. Article 3 Certification of transmission system operators 1. The Commission shall examine any notification of a deci\u00ad sion on the certification of a transmission system operator as laid down in Article 10(6) of Directive 2009/72/EC as soon as it is received. Within two months of the day of receipt of such notifi\u00ad cation, the Commission shall deliver its opinion to the relevant national regulatory authority as to its compatibility with Article 10(2) or Article 11, and Article 9 of Directive 2009/72/EC. When preparing the opinion referred to in the first subparagraph, the Commission may request the Agency to provide its opinion on the national regulatory authority\u2019s decision. In such a case, the two-month period referred to in the first subparagraph shall be extended by two further months. In the absence of an opinion by the Commission within the peri\u00ad ods referred to in the first and second subparagraphs, the Com\u00ad mission shall be deemed not to raise objections to the regulatory authority\u2019s decision. 2. Within two months of receiving an opinion of the Commis\u00ad sion, the national regulatory authority shall adopt its final deci\u00ad sion regarding the certification of the transmission system operator, taking the utmost account of that opinion. The regula\u00ad tory authority\u2019s decision and the Commission\u2019s opinion shall be published together. 3.

        "Official Journal of the European Union 14.8.2009 Article 10 Consultations 1. While preparing the network codes, the draft Community- wide network development plan and the annual work programme referred to in Article 8(1), (2) and (3), the ENTSO for Electricity shall conduct an extensive consultation process, at an early stage and in an open and transparent manner, involving all relevant market participants, and, in particular, the organisations repre\u00ad senting all stakeholders, in accordance with the rules of procedure referred to in Article 5(1). That consultation shall also involve national regulatory authorities and other national authorities, sup\u00ad ply and generation undertakings, system users including custom\u00ad ers, distribution system operators, including relevant industry associations, technical bodies and stakeholder platforms. It shall aim at identifying the views and proposals of all relevant parties during the decision-making process. 2. All documents and minutes of meetings related to the con\u00ad sultations referred to in paragraph 1 shall be made public. 3. Before adopting the annual work programme and the net\u00ad work codes referred to in Article 8(1), (2) and (3), the ENTSO for Electricity shall indicate how the observations received during the consultation have been taken into consideration. It shall provide reasons where observations have not been taken into account. Article 11 Costs The costs related to the activities of the ENTSO for Electricity referred to in Articles 4 to 12 shall be borne by the transmission system operators and shall be taken into account in the calcula\u00ad tion of tariffs. Regulatory authorities shall approve those costs only if they are reasonable and proportionate. Article 12 Regional cooperation of transmission system operators 1. Transmission system operators shall establish regional cooperation within the ENTSO for Electricity to contribute to the activities referred to in Article 8(1), (2) and (3). In particular, they shall publish a regional investment plan every two years, and may take investment decisions based on that regional investment plan. 2. Transmission system operators shall promote operational arrangements in order to ensure the optimum management of the network and shall promote the development of energy exchanges, the coordinated allocation of cross-border capacity through non- discriminatory market-based solutions, paying due attention to the specific merits of implicit auctions for short-term allocations, and the integration of balancing and reserve power mechanisms. 3. For the purposes of achieving the goals set in paragraphs 1 and 2 of this Article, the geographical area covered by each regional cooperation structure may be defined by the Commis\u00ad sion, taking into account existing regional cooperation structures. Each Member State shall be allowed to promote cooperation in more than one geographical area. The measure referred to in the first sentence, designed to amend non-essential elements of this Regulation by supplementing it, shall be adopted in accordance with the regulatory procedure with scrutiny referred to in Article 23(2). For that purpose, the Commission shall consult the Agency and the ENTSO for Electricity. Article 13 Inter-transmission system operator compensation mechanism 1. Transmission system operators shall receive compensation for costs incurred as a result of hosting cross-border flows of elec\u00ad tricity on their networks. 2. The compensation referred to in paragraph 1 shall be paid by the operators of national transmission systems from which cross-border flows originate and the systems where those flows end. 3. Compensation payments shall be made on a regular basis with regard to a given period of time in the past. Ex-post adjust\u00ad ments of compensation paid shall be made where necessary, to reflect costs actually incurred. The first period of time for which compensation payments shall be made shall be determined in the Guidelines referred to in Article 18. 4. The Commission shall decide on the amounts of compen\u00ad sation payments payable. That measure, designed to amend non- essential elements of this Regulation by supplementing it, shall be adopted in accordance with the regulatory procedure with scru\u00ad tiny referred to in Article 23(2). 5. The magnitude of cross-border flows hosted and the mag\u00ad nitude of cross-border flows designated as originating and/or end\u00ad ing in national transmission systems shall be determined on the basis of the physical flows of electricity actually measured during a given period of time. 6. The costs incurred as a result of hosting cross-border flows shall be established on the basis of the forward-looking long-run average incremental costs, taking into account losses, investment in new infrastructure, and an appropriate proportion of the cost of existing infrastructure, in so far as such infrastructure is used for the transmission of cross-border flows, in particular taking into account the need to guarantee security of supply. When establishing the costs incurred, recognised standard-costing meth\u00ad odologies shall be used. Benefits that a network incurs as a result of hosting cross-border flows shall be taken into account to reduce the compensation received. N E 2 2 / 1 1 2 L ",
        "Official Journal of the European Union L 211/23 Article 14 Charges for access to networks 1. Charges applied by network operators for access to net\u00ad works shall be transparent, take into account the need for net\u00ad work security and reflect actual costs incurred insofar as they correspond to those of an efficient and structurally comparable network operator and are applied in a non-discriminatory man\u00ad ner. Those charges shall not be distance-related. 2. Where appropriate, the level of the tariffs applied to pro\u00ad ducers and/or consumers shall provide locational signals at Com\u00ad munity level, and take into account the amount of network losses and congestion caused, and investment costs for infrastructure. 3. When setting the charges for network access, the following shall be taken into account: (a) payments and receipts resulting from the inter-transmission system operator compensation mechanism; (b) actual payments made and received as well as payments expected for future periods of time, estimated on the basis of past periods. 4. Setting the charges for network access under this Article shall be without prejudice to charges on declared exports and declared imports resulting from congestion management referred to in Article 16. 5. There shall be no specific network charge on individual transactions for declared transits of electricity. Article 15 Provision of information 1. Transmission system operators shall put in place coordina\u00ad tion and information exchange mechanisms to ensure the secu\u00ad rity of the networks in the context of congestion management. 2. The safety, operational and planning standards used by transmission system operators shall be made public. The infor\u00ad mation published shall include a general scheme for the calcula\u00ad tion of the total transfer capacity and the transmission reliability margin based upon the electrical and physical features of the net\u00ad work. Such schemes shall be subject to the approval of the regu\u00ad latory authorities. 3. Transmission system operators shall publish estimates of available transfer capacity for each day, indicating any available transfer capacity already reserved. Those publications shall be made at specified intervals before the day of transport and shall include, in any event, week-ahead and month-ahead estimates, as well as a quantitative indication of the expected reliability of the available capacity. 4. Transmission system operators shall publish relevant data on aggregated forecast and actual demand, on availability and actual use of generation and load assets, on availability and use of the networks and interconnections, and on balancing power and reserve capacity. For availability and actual use of small genera\u00ad tion and load units, aggregated estimate data may be used. 5. The market participants concerned shall provide the trans\u00ad mission system operators with the relevant data. 6. Generation undertakings which own or operate generation assets, where at least one generation asset has an installed capac\u00ad ity of at least 250 MW, shall keep at the disposal of the national regulatory authority, the national competition authority and the Commission, for five years all hourly data per plant that is nec\u00ad essary to verify all operational dispatching decisions and the bid\u00ad ding behaviour at power exchanges, interconnection auctions, reserve markets and over-the-counter-markets. The per-plant and per hour information to be stored shall include, but shall not be limited to, data on available generation capacity and committed reserves, including allocation of those committed reserves on a per-plant level, at the times the bidding is carried out and when production takes place. Article 16 General principles of congestion management 1. Network congestion problems shall be addressed with non- discriminatory market-based solutions which give efficient eco\u00ad nomic signals to the market participants and transmission system operators involved. Network congestion problems shall preferen\u00ad tially be solved with non-transaction based methods, i.e. methods that do not involve a selection between the contracts of individual market participants. 2. Transaction curtailment procedures shall only be used in emergency situations where the transmission system operator must act in an expeditious manner and re-dispatching or coun\u00ad tertrading is not possible. Any such procedure shall be applied in a non-discriminatory manner. Except in cases of force majeure, market participants who have been allocated capacity shall be compensated for any curtailment. 3. The maximum capacity of the interconnections and/or the transmission networks affecting cross-border flows shall be made available to market participants, complying with safety standards of secure network operation. 4. Market participants shall inform the transmission system operators concerned a reasonable time in advance of the relevant operational period whether they intend to use allocated capacity. Any allocated capacity that will not be used shall be reattributed to the market, in an open, transparent and non-discriminatory manner. N E 9 0 0 2 . 8 . 4 1 ",
        "5. Transmission system operators shall, as far as technically possible, net the capacity requirements of any power flows in opposite direction over the congested interconnection line in order to use that line to its maximum capacity. Having full regard to network security, transactions that relieve the congestion shall never be denied. 6. Any revenues resulting from the allocation of interconnec\u00ad tion shall be used for the following purposes: (a) guaranteeing the actual availability of the allocated capacity; and/or (b) maintaining or increasing interconnection capacities through network investments, in particular in new interconnectors. If the revenues cannot be efficiently used for the purposes set out in points (a) and/or (b) of the first subparagraph, they may be used, subject to approval by the regulatory authorities of the Member States concerned, up to a maximum amount to be decided by those regulatory authorities, as income to be taken into account by the regulatory authorities when approving the methodology for calculating network tariffs and/or fixing net\u00ad work tariffs. The rest of revenues shall be placed on a separate internal account line until such time as it can be spent on the purposes set out in points (a) and/or (b) of the first subparagraph. The regulatory authority shall inform the Agency of the approval referred to in the second subparagraph. Article 17 New interconnectors 1. New direct current interconnectors may, upon request, be exempted, for a limited period of time, from the provisions of Article 16(6) of this Regulation and Articles 9, 32 and Article 37(6) and (10) of Directive 2009/72/EC under the follow\u00ad ing conditions: (a) the investment must enhance competition in electricity supply; (b) the level of risk attached to the investment is such that the investment would not take place unless an exemption is granted; (c) the interconnector must be owned by a natural or legal per\u00ad son which is separate at least in terms of its legal form from the system operators in whose systems that interconnector will be built; (d) charges are levied on users of that interconnector; (e) since the partial market opening referred to in Article 19 of Directive 96/92/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 19 December 1996 concerning common rules for the internal market in electricity ( 1 ) OJ L 27, 30.1.1997, p. 20.

Paragraph 1 shall also apply, in exceptional cases, to alter\u00ad nating current interconnectors provided that the costs and risks of the investment in question are particularly high when com\u00ad pared with the costs and risks normally incurred when connect\u00ad ing two neighbouring national transmission systems by an alternating current interconnector. 3. Paragraph 1 shall also apply to significant increases of capacity in existing interconnectors. 4. The decision on the exemption under paragraphs 1, 2 and 3 shall be taken on a case-by-case basis by the regulatory authori\u00ad ties of the Member States concerned. An exemption may cover all or part of the capacity of the new interconnector, or of the exist\u00ad ing interconnector with significantly increased capacity. Within two months from the date on which the request for exemption was received by the last of the regulatory authorities concerned, the Agency may submit an advisory opinion to those regulatory authorities which could provide a basis for their decision. In deciding to grant an exemption, consideration shall be given, on a case-by-case basis, to the need to impose conditions regard\u00ad ing the duration of the exemption and non-discriminatory access to the interconnector. When deciding those conditions, account shall, in particular, be taken of additional capacity to be built or the modification of existing capacity, the time-frame of the project and national circumstances. Before granting an exemption, the regulatory authorities of the Member States concerned shall decide upon the rules and mecha\u00ad nisms for management and allocation of capacity. Congestion- management rules shall include the obligation to offer unused capacity on the market and users of the facility shall be entitled to trade their contracted capacities on the secondary market. In the assessment of the criteria referred to in points (a), (b) and (f) of paragraph 1, the results of the capacity-allocation procedure shall be taken into account. Where all the regulatory authorities concerned have reached agreement on the exemption decision within six months, they shall inform the Agency of that decision. 9 0 0 2 . 8 . 4 1 n o i n U n a e p o r u E e h t f o l a n r u o J l a i c i f f O N E 4 2 / 1 1 2 L r o l a t i p a c e h t f o t r p o n , ) 1 ",

Within a period of two months from the day following receipt of notification under paragraph 7, the Commission may take a decision requesting the notifying bodies to amend or with\u00ad draw the decision to grant an exemption. That two-month period may be extended by an additional period of two months where further information is sought by the Commission. That additional period shall begin on the day following receipt of the complete information. The initial two-month period may also be extended by consent of both the Commission and the notifying bodies. When the requested information is not provided within the period set out in the request, the notification shall be deemed to be with\u00ad drawn unless, before the expiry of that period, either the period is extended by consent of both the Commission and the notifying bodies, or the notifying bodies, in a duly reasoned statement, inform the Commission that they consider the notification to be complete. The notifying bodies shall comply with a Commission decision to amend or withdraw the exemption decision within one month and shall inform the Commission accordingly. The Commission shall preserve the confidentiality of commer\u00ad cially sensitive information. The Commission\u2019s approval of an exemption decision shall expire two years after the date of its adoption in the event that construc\u00ad tion of the interconnector has not yet started by that date, and five years after the date of its adoption if the interconnector has not become operational by that date, unless the Commission decides that any delay is due to major obstacles beyond the control of the person to whom the exemption has been granted. 9.

        "ANNEX I GUIDELINES ON THE MANAGEMENT AND ALLOCATION OF AVAILABLE TRANSFER CAPACITY OF INTERCONNECTIONS BETWEEN NATIONAL SYSTEMS 1. General Provisions 1.1. Transmission system operators (TSOs) shall endeavour to accept all commercial transactions, including those involv\u00ad ing cross-border-trade. 1.2. When there is no congestion, there shall be no restriction of access to the interconnection. Where this is usually the case, there need be no permanent general allocation procedure for access to a cross-border transmission service. 1.3. Where scheduled commercial transactions are not compatible with secure network operation, the TSOs shall allevi\u00ad ate congestion in compliance with the requirements of network operational security while endeavouring to ensure that any associated costs remain at an economically efficient level. Curative re-dispatching or countertrading shall be envisaged in case lower cost measures cannot be applied. 1.4. If structural congestion appears, appropriate congestion-management methods and arrangements defined and agreed upon in advance shall be implemented immediately by the TSOs. The congestion-management methods shall ensure that the physical power flows associated with all allocated transmission capacity comply with network security standards. 1.5. The methods adopted for congestion management shall give efficient economic signals to market participants and TSOs, promote competition and be suitable for regional and Community-wide application. 1.6. No transaction-based distinction shall be applied in congestion management. A particular request for transmission service shall be denied only when the following cumulative conditions are fulfilled: (a) the incremental physical power flows resulting from the acceptance of that request imply that secure operation of the power system may no longer be guaranteed, and (b) the monetary value of the request in the congestion-management procedure is lower than all other requests intended to be accepted for the same service and conditions. 1.7. When defining appropriate network areas in and between which congestion management is to apply, TSOs shall be guided by the principles of cost-effectiveness and minimisation of negative impacts on the internal market in elec\u00ad tricity. Specifically, TSOs shall not limit interconnection capacity in order to solve congestion inside their own con\u00ad trol area, save for the abovementioned reasons and reasons of operational security ( 1 ) Operational security means \u2018keeping the transmission system within agreed security limits\u2019. ( a n shall be described and transparently presented by the TSOs to all the system users. Such a situation shall be tolerated only until a long-term solution is found. The methodology and projects for achieving the long-term solution shall be described and transparently presented by the TSOs to all the system users. 1.8. When balancing the network inside the control area through operational measures in the network and through re-dispatching, the TSO shall take into account the effect of those measures on neighbouring control areas. 1.9. By 1 January 2008, mechanisms for the intra-day congestion management of interconnector capacity shall be estab\u00ad lished in a coordinated way and under secure operational conditions, in order to maximise opportunities for trade and to provide for cross-border balancing. 9 2 / 1 1 2 L n o i n U n a e p o r u E e h t f o l a n r u o J l a i c i f f O N E 9 0 0 2 . 8 . 4 1 s i h t , s r u c c o o i t a u t i s h c u s f I . ) 1 ",
        "Official Journal of the European Union 14.8.2009 1.10. The national regulatory authorities shall regularly evaluate the congestion-management methods, paying particular attention to compliance with the principles and rules established in this Regulation and those Guidelines and with the terms and conditions set by the regulatory authorities themselves under those principles and rules. Such evalu\u00ad ation shall include consultation of all market participants and dedicated studies. 2. Congestion-management methods 2.1. Congestion-management methods shall be market-based in order to facilitate efficient cross-border trade. For that purpose, capacity shall be allocated only by means of explicit (capacity) or implicit (capacity and energy) auctions. Both methods may coexist on the same interconnection. For intra-day trade continuous trading may be used. 2.2. Depending on competition conditions, the congestion-management mechanisms may need to allow for both long and short-term transmission capacity allocation. 2.3. Each capacity-allocation procedure shall allocate a prescribed fraction of the available interconnection capacity plus any remaining capacity not previously allocated and any capacity released by capacity holders from previous allocations. 2.4. TSOs shall optimise the degree to which capacity is firm, taking into account the obligations and rights of the TSOs involved and the obligations and rights of market participants, in order to facilitate effective and efficient competi\u00ad tion. A reasonable fraction of capacity may be offered to the market at a reduced degree of firmness, but the exact conditions for transport over cross-border lines shall, at all times, be made known to market participants. 2.5. The access rights for long and medium-term allocations shall be firm transmission capacity rights. They shall be sub\u00ad ject to the use-it-or-lose-it or use-it-or-sell-it principles at the time of nomination. 2.6. TSOs shall define an appropriate structure for the allocation of capacity between different timeframes. This may include an option for reserving a minimum percentage of interconnection capacity for daily or intra-daily allocation. Such an allocation structure shall be subject to review by the respective regulatory authorities. In drawing up their proposals, the TSOs shall take into account: (a) the characteristics of the markets; (b) the operational conditions, such as the implications of netting firmly declared schedules; (c) the level of harmonisation of the percentages and timeframes adopted for the different capacity-allocation mechanisms in place. 2.7. Capacity allocation shall not discriminate between market participants that wish to use their rights to make use of bilateral supply contracts or to bid into power exchanges. The highest value bids, whether implicit or explicit in a given timeframe, shall be successful. 2.8. In regions where forward financial electricity markets are well developed and have shown their efficiency, all inter\u00ad connection capacity may be allocated through implicit auctioning. 2.9. Other than in the case of new interconnectors which benefit from an exemption under Article 7 of Regulation (EC) No 1228/2003 or Article 17 of this Regulation, establishing reserve prices in capacity-allocation methods shall not be allowed. 2.10. In principle, all potential market participants shall be permitted to participate in the allocation process without restric\u00ad tion. To avoid creating or aggravating problems related to the potential use of dominant position of any market player, the relevant regulatory and/or competition authorities, where appropriate, may impose restrictions in general or on an individual company on account of market dominance. 2.11. Market participants shall firmly nominate their use of the capacity to the TSOs by a defined deadline for each time\u00ad frame. That deadline shall be such that TSOs are able to reassign unused capacity for reallocation in the next relevant timeframe \u2014 including intra-day sessions. N E 0 3 / 1 1 2 L ",
        "Official Journal of the European Union L 211/31 2.12. Capacity shall be freely tradable on a secondary basis, provided that the TSO is informed sufficiently in advance. Where a TSO refuses any secondary trade (transaction), this must be clearly and transparently communicated and explained to all the market participants by that TSO and notified to the regulatory authority. 2.13. The financial consequences of failure to honour obligations associated with the allocation of capacity shall be attrib\u00ad uted to those who are responsible for such a failure. Where market participants fail to use the capacity that they have committed to use, or, in the case of explicitly auctioned capacity, fail to trade on a secondary basis or give the capac\u00ad ity back in due time, they shall lose the rights to such capacity and pay a cost-reflective charge. Any cost-reflective charges for the non-use of capacity shall be justified and proportionate. Likewise, if a TSO does not fulfil its obliga\u00ad tion, it shall be liable to compensate the market participant for the loss of capacity rights. No consequential losses shall be taken into account for that purpose. The key concepts and methods for the determination of liabilities that accrue upon failure to honour obligations shall be set out in advance in respect of the financial consequences, and shall be subject to review by the relevant national regulatory authority or authorities. 3. Coordination 3.1. Capacity allocation at an interconnection shall be coordinated and implemented using common allocation proce\u00ad dures by the TSOs involved. In cases where commercial exchanges between two countries (TSOs) are expected to affect physical flow conditions in any third-country (TSO) significantly, congestion-management methods shall be coordinated between all the TSOs so affected through a common congestion-management procedure. National regu\u00ad latory authorities and TSOs shall ensure that no congestion-management procedure with significant effects on physi\u00ad cal electric power flows in other networks is devised unilaterally. 3.2. A common coordinated congestion-management method and procedure for the allocation of capacity to the market at least annually, monthly and day-ahead shall be applied by 1 January 2007 between countries in the following regions: (a) Northern Europe (i.e. Denmark, Sweden, Finland, Germany and Poland), (b) North-West Europe (i.e. Benelux, Germany and France), (c) Italy (i.e. Italy, France, Germany, Austria, Slovenia and Greece), (d) Central Eastern Europe (i.e. Germany, Poland, Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary, Austria and Slovenia), (e) South-West Europe (i.e. Spain, Portugal and France), (f) UK, Ireland and France, (g) Baltic states (i.e. Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania). At an interconnection involving countries belonging to more than one region, the congestion-management method applied may differ in order to ensure the compatibility with the methods applied in the other regions to which those countries belong. In that case, the relevant TSOs shall propose the method which shall be subject to review by the relevant regulatory authorities. 3.3. The regions referred to in point 2.8. may allocate all interconnection capacity through day-ahead allocation. 3.4. Compatible congestion-management procedures shall be defined in all those seven regions with a view to forming a truly integrated internal market in electricity. Market participants shall not be confronted with incompatible regional systems. 3.5. With a view to promoting fair and efficient competition and cross-border trade, coordination between TSOs within the regions set out in point 3.2. shall include all the steps from capacity calculation and optimisation of allocation to secure operation of the network, with clear assignments of responsibility. Such coordination shall include, in particular: (a) the use of a common transmission model dealing efficiently with interdependent physical loop-flows and hav\u00ad ing regard to discrepancies between physical and commercial flows, N E 9 0 0 2 . 8 . 4 1 ",
        "Official Journal of the European Union 14.8.2009 (b) allocation and nomination of capacity to deal efficiently with interdependent physical loop-flows, (c) identical obligations on capacity holders to provide information on their intended use of the capacity, i.e. nomi\u00ad nation of capacity (for explicit auctions), (d) identical timeframes and closing times, (e) identical structure for the allocation of capacity among different timeframes (for example, 1 day, 3 hours, 1 week, etc.) and in terms of blocks of capacity sold (amount of power in MW, MWh, etc.), (f) consistent contractual framework with market participants, (g) verification of flows to comply with the network security requirements for operational planning and for real- time operation, (h) accounting and settlement of congestion-management actions. 3.6. Coordination shall also include the exchange of information between TSOs. The nature, time and frequency of infor\u00ad mation exchange shall be compatible with the activities set out in point 3.5 and the functioning of the electricity mar\u00ad kets. That information exchange shall, in particular, enable the TSOs to make the best possible forecast of the global network situation in order to assess the flows in their network and the available interconnection capacities. Any TSO collecting information on behalf of other TSOs shall give back to the participating TSO the results of the collection of data. 4. Timetable for market operations 4.1. The allocation of the available transmission capacity shall take place sufficiently in advance. Prior to each allocation, the involved TSOs shall, jointly, publish the capacity to be allocated, taking into account where appropriate the capac\u00ad ity released from any firm transmission rights and, where relevant, associated netted nominations, along with any time periods during which the capacity will be reduced or not available (for the purpose of maintenance, for example). 4.2. Having full regard to network security, the nomination of transmission rights shall take place sufficiently in advance, before the day-ahead sessions of all the relevant organised markets and before the publication of the capacity to be allocated under the day-ahead or intra-day allocation mechanism. Nominations of transmission rights in the oppo\u00ad site direction shall be netted in order to make efficient use of the interconnection. 4.3. Successive intra-day allocations of available transmission capacity for day D shall take place on days D-1 and D, after the issuing of the indicated or actual day-ahead production schedules. 4.4. When preparing day-ahead network operation, the TSOs shall exchange information with neighbouring TSOs, includ\u00ad ing their forecast network topology, the availability and forecasted production of generation units, and load flows in order to optimise the use of the overall network through operational measures in compliance with the rules for secure network operation. 5. Transparency 5.1. TSOs shall publish all relevant data related to network availability, network access and network use, including a report on where and why congestion exists, the methods applied for managing the congestion and the plans for its future management. 5.2. TSOs shall publish a general description of the congestion-management method applied under different circum\u00ad stances for maximising the capacity available to the market, and a general scheme for the calculation of the inter\u00ad connection capacity for the different timeframes, based upon the electrical and physical realities of the network. Such a scheme shall be subject to review by the regulatory authorities of the Member States concerned. 5.3. The congestion management and capacity-allocation procedures in use, together with the times and procedures for applying for capacity, a description of the products offered and the obligations and rights of both the TSOs and the party obtaining the capacity, including the liabilities that accrue upon failure to honour obligations, shall be described in detail and made available in a transparent manner to all potential network users by TSOs.

That document shall also be subject to review of the national regulatory authorities. 5.5. TSOs shall publish all relevant data concerning cross-border trade on the basis of the best possible forecast. In order to fulfil that obligation the market participants concerned shall provide the TSOs with the relevant data. The manner in which such information is published shall be subject to review by the regulatory authorities. TSOs shall publish at least: (a) annually: information on the long-term evolution of the transmission infrastructure and its impact on cross- border transmission capacity; (b) monthly: month- and year-ahead forecasts of the transmission capacity available to the market, taking into account all relevant information available to the TSO at the time of the forecast calculation (for example, impact of summer and winter seasons on the capacity of lines, maintenance of the network, availability of production units, etc.); (c) weekly: week-ahead forecasts of the transmission capacity available to the market, taking into account all rel\u00ad evant information available to the TSOs at the time of calculation of the forecast, such as the weather forecast, planned network maintenance work, availability of production units, etc.; (d) daily: day-ahead and intra-day transmission capacity available to the market for each market time unit, taking into account all netted day-ahead nominations, day-ahead production schedules, demand forecasts and planned network maintenance work; (e) total capacity already allocated, by market time unit, and all relevant conditions under which that capacity may be used (for example, auction clearing price, obligations on how to use the capacity, etc.), so as to identify any remaining capacity; (f) allocated capacity as soon as possible after each allocation, as well as an indication of prices paid; (g) total capacity used, by market time unit, immediately after nomination; (h) as closely as possible to real time: aggregated realised commercial and physical flows, by market time unit, including a description of the effects of any corrective actions taken by the TSOs (such as curtailment) for solv\u00ad ing network or system problems; (i) ex-ante information on planned outages and ex-post information for the previous day on planned and unplanned outages of generation units larger than 100 MW. 5.6. All relevant information shall be available for the market in due time for the negotiation of all transactions (such as the time of negotiation of annual supply contracts for industrial customers or the time when bids have to be sent into organised markets). 5.7. The TSO shall publish the relevant information on forecast demand and on generation according to the timeframes referred to in points 5.5 and 5.6. The TSO shall also publish the relevant information necessary for the cross-border balancing market. 5.8. When forecasts are published, the ex post realised values for the forecast information shall also be published in the time period following that to which the forecast applies or at the latest on the following day (D + 1). 5.9. All information published by the TSOs shall be made freely available in an easily accessible form. All data shall also be accessible through adequate and standardised means of information exchange, to be defined in close cooperation with market participants. The data shall include information on past time periods with a minimum of two years, so that new market entrants may also have access to such data. 5.10. TSOs shall exchange regularly a set of sufficiently accurate network and load flow data in order to enable load flow calculations for each TSO in their relevant area. The same set of data shall be made available to the regulatory authori\u00ad ties and to the Commission upon request. The regulatory authorities and the Commission shall ensure the confiden\u00ad tial treatment of that set of data, by themselves and by any consultant carrying out analytical work for them on the basis of those data.

(3) Experience gained in the implementation and monitoring of a first set of Guidelines for Good Practice, adopted by the European Gas Regulatory Forum (the Madrid Forum) in 2002, demonstrates that in order to ensure the full imple\u00ad mentation of the rules set out in those guidelines in all Member States, and in order to provide a minimum guar\u00ad antee of equal market access conditions in practice, it is necessary to provide for them to become legally enforceable. (4) A second set of common rules entitled \u2018the Second Guide\u00ad lines for Good Practice\u2019 was adopted at the meeting of the Madrid Forum on 24 and 25 September 2003 and the pur\u00ad pose of this Regulation is to lay down, on the basis of those guidelines, basic principles and rules regarding network access and third party access services, congestion manage\u00ad ment, transparency, balancing and the trading of capacity rights.

The rules set out in this Regulation do not therefore require modification of the organisation of national transmission and distribution systems that are consistent with the relevant provisions of that Directive. (6) High-pressure pipelines linking up local distributors to the gas network which are not primarily used in the context of local distribution are included in the scope of this Regulation. (7) It is necessary to specify the criteria according to which tar\u00ad iffs for access to the network are determined, in order to ensure that they fully comply with the principle of non- discrimination and the needs of a well-functioning inter\u00ad nal market and take fully into account the need for system integrity and reflect the actual costs incurred, insofar as such costs correspond to those of an efficient and struc\u00ad turally comparable network operator and are transparent, whilst including appropriate return on investments, and, where appropriate, taking account of the benchmarking of tariffs by the regulatory authorities. (8) In calculating tariffs for access to networks, it is important to take account of the actual costs incurred, insofar as such costs correspond to those of an efficient and structurally comparable network operator, and are transparent, as well as of the need to provide appropriate return on invest\u00ad ments and incentives to construct new infrastructure, including special regulatory treatment for new investments as provided for in Directive 2009/73/EC. In that respect, and in particular if effective pipeline-to-pipeline competi\u00ad tion exists, the benchmarking of tariffs by the regulatory authorities will be a relevant consideration.

(11) At present, there are obstacles to the sale of gas on equal terms, without discrimination or disadvantage in the Com\u00ad munity. In particular, non-discriminatory network access and an equally effective level of regulatory supervision do not yet exist in each Member State, and isolated markets persist. (12) A sufficient level of cross-border gas interconnection capacity should be achieved and market integration fos\u00ad tered in order to complete the internal market in natural gas. (13) The Communication of the Commission of 10 January 2007 entitled \u2018An Energy Policy for Europe\u2019 highlighted the importance of completing the internal market in natural gas and creating a level playing field for all natural gas undertakings in the Community. The Communications of the Commission of 10 January 2007 entitled \u2018Prospects for the internal gas and electricity market\u2019 and \u2018Inquiry pursu\u00ad ant to Article 17 of Regulation (EC) No 1/2003 into the European gas and electricity sectors (Final Report)\u2019 demon\u00ad strated that the present rules and measures neither provide the necessary framework nor provide for the creation of interconnection capacities to achieve the objective of a well-functioning, efficient and open internal market. (14) In addition to thoroughly implementing the existing regu\u00ad latory framework, the regulatory framework for the inter\u00ad nal market in natural gas set out in Regulation (EC) No 1775/2005 should be adapted in line with those communications. (15) In particular, increased cooperation and coordination among transmission system operators is required to create network codes for providing and managing effective and transparent access to the transmission networks across borders, and to ensure coordinated and sufficiently for\u00ad ward looking planning and sound technical evolution of the transmission system in the Community, including the creation of interconnection capacities, with due regard to the environment. The network codes should be in line with framework guidelines which are non-binding in nature (framework guidelines) and which are developed by the Agency for the Cooperation of Energy Regulators estab\u00ad lished by Regulation (EC) No 713/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 13 July 2009 establish\u00ad ing an Agency for the Cooperation of Energy Regulators ( 1 ) See page 1 of this Official Journal. ( (the Agency). The Agency should have a role in reviewing, based on matters of fact, draft network codes, including their compliance with the framework guidelines, and it should be enabled to recommend them for adoption by the Commission. The Agency should assess proposed amendments to the network codes and it should be enabled to recommend them for adoption by the Commission. Transmission system operators should operate their net\u00ad works in accordance with those network codes. (16) In order to ensure optimal management of the gas trans\u00ad mission network in the Community a European Network of Transmission System Operators for Gas (the ENTSO for Gas), should be established. The tasks of the ENTSO for Gas should be carried out in compliance with Community competition rules which remain applicable to the decisions of the ENTSO for Gas. The tasks of the ENTSO for Gas should be well-defined and its working method should ensure efficiency, transparency and the representative nature of the ENTSO for Gas. The network codes prepared by the ENTSO for Gas are not intended to replace the nec\u00ad essary national network codes for non cross-border issues. Given that more effective progress may be achieved through an approach at regional level, transmission system operators should set up regional structures within the overall cooperation structure, whilst ensuring that results at regional level are compatible with network codes and non-binding ten-year network development plans at Com\u00ad munity level. Cooperation within such regional structures presupposes effective unbundling of network activities from production and supply activities. In the absence of such unbundling, regional cooperation between transmis\u00ad sion system operators gives rise to a risk of anti- competitive conduct. Member States should promote cooperation and monitor the effectiveness of the network operations at regional level. Cooperation at regional level should be compatible with progress towards a competitive and efficient internal market in gas. (17) All market participants have an interest in the work expected of the ENTSO for Gas. An effective consultation process is therefore essential and existing structures set up to facilitate and streamline the consultation process, such as the European Association for the Streamlining of Energy Exchange, national regulators or the Agency should play an important role. (18) In order to ensure greater transparency regarding the devel\u00ad opment of the gas transmission network in the Commu\u00ad nity, the ENTSO for Gas should draw up, publish and regularly update a non-binding Community-wide ten-year network development plan (Community-wide network development plan). Viable gas transmission networks and necessary regional interconnections, relevant from a com\u00ad mercial or security of supply point of view, should be included in that network development plan. 7 3 / 1 1 2 L n o i n U n a e p o r u E e h t f o l a n r u o J l a i c i f f O N E 9 0 0 2 . 8 . 4 1 ) 1 ",
        "Official Journal of the European Union 14.8.2009 (19) To enhance competition through liquid wholesale markets for gas, it is vital that gas can be traded independently of its location in the system. The only way to do this is to give network users the freedom to book entry and exit capacity independently, thereby creating gas transport through zones instead of along contractual paths. The preference for entry-exit systems to facilitate the development of com\u00ad petition was already expressed by most stakeholders at the 6th Madrid Forum on 30 and 31 October 2002. Tariffs should not be dependent on the transport route. The tariff set for one or more entry points should therefore not be related to the tariff set for one or more exit points, and vice versa. (20) References to harmonised transport contracts in the con\u00ad text of non-discriminatory access to the network of trans\u00ad mission system operators do not mean that the terms and conditions of the transport contracts of a particular system operator in a Member State must be the same as those of another transmission system operator in that Member State or in another Member State, unless minimum require\u00ad ments are set which must be met by all transport contracts. (21) There is substantial contractual congestion in the gas net\u00ad works. The congestion-management and capacity- allocation principles for new or newly negotiated contracts are therefore based on the freeing-up of unused capacity by enabling network users to sublet or resell their contracted capacities and the obligation of transmission system opera\u00ad tors to offer unused capacity to the market, at least on a day-ahead and interruptible basis. Given the large propor\u00ad tion of existing contracts and the need to create a true level playing field between users of new and existing capacity, those principles should be applied to all contracted capac\u00ad ity, including existing contracts. (22) Although physical congestion of networks is, at present, rarely a problem in the Community, it may become one in the future. It is important, therefore, to provide the basic principle for the allocation of congested capacity in such circumstances. (23) Market monitoring undertaken over recent years by the national regulatory authorities and by the Commission has shown that current transparency requirements and rules on access to infrastructure are not sufficient to secure a genuine, well-functioning, open and efficient internal mar\u00ad ket in gas. (24) Equal access to information on the physical status and effi\u00ad ciency of the system is necessary to enable all market par\u00ad ticipants to assess the overall demand and supply situation and to identify the reasons for movements in the whole\u00ad sale price. This includes more precise information on sup\u00ad ply and demand, network capacity, flows and maintenance, balancing and availability and usage of storage. The impor\u00ad tance of that information for the functioning of the mar\u00ad ket requires alleviating existing limitations to publication for confidentiality reasons. (25) Confidentiality requirements for commercially sensitive information are, however, particularly relevant where data of a commercially strategic nature for the company are concerned, where there is only one single user for a stor\u00ad age facility, or where data are concerned regarding exit points within a system or subsystem that is not connected to another transmission or distribution system but to a single industrial final customer, where the publication of such data would reveal confidential information as to the production process of that customer. (26) To enhance trust in the market, its participants need to be sure that those engaging in abusive behaviour can be sub\u00ad jected to effective, proportionate and dissuasive penalties. The competent authorities should be given the competence to investigate effectively allegations of market abuse. To that end, it is necessary that competent authorities have access to data that provides information on operational decisions made by supply undertakings. In the gas market, all those decisions are communicated to the system opera\u00ad tors in the form of capacity reservations, nominations and realised flows. System operators should keep information in relation thereto available to and easily accessible by the competent authorities for a fixed period of time. The com\u00ad petent authorities should, furthermore, regularly monitor the compliance of the transmission system operators with the rules. (27) Access to gas storage facilities and liquefied natural gas (LNG) facilities is insufficient in some Member States, and therefore the implementation of the existing rules needs to be improved. Monitoring by the European Regulators\u2019 Group for Electricity and Gas concluded that the voluntary guidelines for good third-party access practice for storage system operators, agreed by all stakeholders at the Madrid Forum, are being insufficiently applied and therefore need to be made binding. (28) Non-discriminatory and transparent balancing systems for gas, operated by transmission system operators, are impor\u00ad tant mechanisms, particularly for new market entrants which may have more difficulty balancing their overall sales portfolio than companies already established within a relevant market. It is therefore necessary to lay down rules to ensure that transmission system operators operate such mechanisms in a manner compatible with non- discriminatory, transparent and effective access conditions to the network. (29) The trading of primary capacity rights is an important part of developing a competitive market and creating liquidity. This Regulation should therefore lay down basic rules relating to such trading. N E 8 3 / 1 1 2 L ",
        "(30) National regulatory authorities should ensure compliance with the rules contained in this Regulation and the Guide\u00ad lines adopted pursuant thereto. (31) In the Guidelines annexed to this Regulation, specific detailed implementing rules are defined on the basis of the Second Guidelines for Good Practice. Where appropriate, those rules will evolve over time, taking into account the differences of national gas systems. (32) When proposing to amend the Guidelines annexed to this Regulation, the Commission should ensure prior consulta\u00ad tion of all relevant parties concerned with the Guidelines, represented by the professional organisations, and of the Member States within the Madrid Forum. (33) The Member States and the competent national authorities should be required to provide relevant information to the Commission. Such information should be treated confi\u00ad dentially by the Commission. (34) This Regulation and the Guidelines adopted in accordance with it are without prejudice to the application of the Community rules on competition. (35) The measures necessary for the implementation of this Regulation should be adopted in accordance with Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers con\u00ad ferred on the Commission ( 1 ) OJ L 184, 17.7.1999, p. 23. ( (36) In particular, the Commission should be empowered to establish or adopt the Guidelines necessary for providing the minimum degree of harmonisation required to achieve the aims of this Regulation. Since those measures are of general scope and are designed to amend non-essential ele\u00ad ments of this Regulation, inter alia by supplementing it with new non-essential elements, they must be adopted in accordance with the regulatory procedure with scrutiny provided for in Article 5a of Decision 1999/468/EC. (37) Since the objective of this Regulation, namely the setting of fair rules for access conditions to natural gas transmission networks, storage and LNG facilities cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States and can therefore be better achieved at Community level, the Community may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity, as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty. In accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in that Article, this Regulation does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve that objective. (38) Given the scope of the amendments that are being made herein to Regulation (EC) No 1775/2005, it is desirable, for reasons of clarity and rationalisation, that the provisions in question should be recast by bringing them all together in a single text in a new Regulation, HAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION: Article 1 Subject matter and scope This Regulation aims at: (a) setting non-discriminatory rules for access conditions to natural gas transmission systems taking into account the spe\u00ad cial characteristics of national and regional markets with a view to ensuring the proper functioning of the internal mar\u00ad ket in gas; (b) setting non-discriminatory rules for access conditions to LNG facilities and storage facilities taking into account the special characteristics of national and regional markets; and (c) facilitating the emergence of a well-functioning and transpar\u00ad ent wholesale market with a high level of security of supply in gas and providing mechanisms to harmonise the network access rules for cross-border exchanges in gas.

Before adopting the annual work programme and the net\u00ad work codes referred to in Article 8(1), (2) and (3), the ENTSO for Gas shall indicate how the observations received during the con\u00ad sultation have been taken into consideration. It shall provide rea\u00ad sons where observations have not been taken into account. Article 11 Costs The costs related with the activities of the ENTSO for Gas referred to in Articles 4 to 12 shall be borne by the transmission system operators and shall be taken into account in the calculation of tar\u00ad iffs. Regulatory authorities shall approve those costs only if they are reasonable and proportionate. Article 12 Regional cooperation of transmission system operators 1. Transmission system operators shall establish regional cooperation within the ENTSO for Gas to contribute to the tasks referred to in Article 8(1), (2) and (3). In particular, they shall pub\u00ad lish a regional investment plan every two years, and may take investment decisions based on that regional investment plan. 2. Transmission system operators shall promote operational arrangements in order to ensure the optimum management of the network and shall promote the development of energy exchanges, the coordinated allocation of cross-border capacity through non- discriminatory market-based solutions, paying due attention to the specific merits of implicit auctions for short-term allocations and the integration of balancing mechanisms. 3. For the purposes of achieving the goals set in paragraphs 1 and 2, the geographical area covered by each regional coopera\u00ad tion structure may be defined by the Commission, taking into account existing regional cooperation structures. Each Member State shall be allowed to promote cooperation in more than one geographical area. The measure referred to in the first sentence, designed to amend non-essential elements of this Regulation by supplementing it, shall be adopted in accordance with the regu\u00ad latory procedure with scrutiny referred to in Article 28(2). For that purpose, the Commission shall consult the Agency and the ENTSO for Gas. Article 13 Tariffs for access to networks 1. Tariffs, or the methodologies used to calculate them, applied by the transmission system operators and approved by the regu\u00ad latory authorities pursuant to Article 41(6) of Directive 2009/73/EC, as well as tariffs published pursuant to Article 32(1) of that Directive, shall be transparent, take into account the need for system integrity and its improvement and reflect the actual costs incurred, insofar as such costs correspond to those of an efficient and structurally comparable network operator and are transparent, whilst including an appropriate return on invest\u00ad ments, and, where appropriate, taking account of the benchmark\u00ad ing of tariffs by the regulatory authorities. Tariffs, or the methodologies used to calculate them, shall be applied in a non- discriminatory manner. N E 4 4 / 1 1 2 L ",
        "Official Journal of the European Union L 211/45 Member States may decide that tariffs may also be determined through market-based arrangements, such as auctions, provided that such arrangements and the revenues arising therefrom are approved by the regulatory authority. Tariffs, or the methodologies used to calculate them, shall facili\u00ad tate efficient gas trade and competition, while at the same time avoiding cross-subsidies between network users and providing incentives for investment and maintaining or creating interoper\u00ad ability for transmission networks. Tariffs for network users shall be non-discriminatory and set sepa\u00ad rately for every entry point into or exit point out of the transmis\u00ad sion system. Cost-allocation mechanisms and rate setting methodology regarding entry points and exit points shall be approved by the national regulatory authorities. By 3 September 2011, the Member States shall ensure that, after a transitional period, network charges shall not be calculated on the basis of contract paths. 2. Tariffs for network access shall neither restrict market liquidity nor distort trade across borders of different transmission systems. Where differences in tariff structures or balancing mechanisms would hamper trade across transmission systems, and notwithstanding Article 41(6) of Directive 2009/73/EC, transmission system operators shall, in close cooperation with the relevant national authorities, actively pursue convergence of tar\u00ad iff structures and charging principles, including in relation to balancing.

In regard to point (a) of the first subparagraph, where a transmis\u00ad sion system operator offers the same service to different custom\u00ad ers, it shall do so under equivalent contractual terms and conditions, either using harmonised transport contracts or a com\u00ad mon network code approved by the competent authority in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 41 of Direc\u00ad tive 2009/73/EC. 2. Transport contracts signed with non-standard start dates or with a shorter duration than a standard annual transport contract shall not result in arbitrarily higher or lower tariffs that do not reflect the market value of the service, in accordance with the principles laid down in Article 13(1). 3. Where appropriate, third-party access services may be granted subject to appropriate guarantees from network users with respect to the creditworthiness of such users. Such guaran\u00ad tees shall not constitute undue market-entry barriers and shall be non-discriminatory, transparent and proportionate. Article 15 Third-party access services concerning storage and LNG facilities 1. LNG and storage system operators shall: (a) offer services on a non-discriminatory basis to all network users that accommodate market demand; in particular, where an LNG or storage system operator offers the same service to different customers, it shall do so under equivalent contrac\u00ad tual terms and conditions; (b) offer services that are compatible with the use of the inter\u00ad connected gas transport systems and facilitate access through cooperation with the transmission system operator; and (c) make relevant information public, in particular data on the use and availability of services, in a time-frame compatible with the LNG or storage facility users\u2019 reasonable commer\u00ad cial needs, subject to the monitoring of such publication by the national regulatory authority. 2.

In the event that physical congestion exists, non- discriminatory, transparent capacity-allocation mechanisms shall be applied by the transmission system operator or, as appropri\u00ad ate, by the regulatory authorities. 5. Transmission system operators shall regularly assess mar\u00ad ket demand for new investment. When planning new invest\u00ad ments, transmission system operators shall assess market demand and take into account security of supply. Article 17 Principles of capacity-allocation mechanisms and congestion-management procedures concerning storage and LNG facilities 1. The maximum storage and LNG facility capacity shall be made available to market participants, taking into account system integrity and operation. 2. LNG and storage system operators shall implement and publish non-discriminatory and transparent capacity-allocation mechanisms which shall: (a) provide appropriate economic signals for the efficient and maximum use of capacity and facilitate investment in new infrastructure; (b) be compatible with the market mechanism including spot markets and trading hubs, while being flexible and capable of adapting to evolving market circumstances; and (c) be compatible with the connected network access systems. 3. LNG and storage facility contracts shall include measures to prevent capacity-hoarding, by taking into account the following principles, which shall apply in cases of contractual congestion: (a) the system operator must offer unused LNG facility and stor\u00ad age capacity on the primary market without delay; for stor\u00ad age facilities this must be at least on a day-ahead and interruptible basis; (b) LNG and storage facility users who wish to re-sell their con\u00ad tracted capacity on the secondary market must be entitled to do so.

That information shall also be communicated to the transmission system operator, which shall make it public on an aggregated level per system or subsystem defined by the relevant points. The information shall be updated at least daily. In cases in which a storage system user is the only user of a stor\u00ad age facility, the storage system user may submit to the national regulatory authority a reasoned request for confidential treatment of the data referred to in the first subparagraph. Where the national regulatory authority comes to the conclusion that such a request is justified, taking into account, in particular, the need to balance the interest of legitimate protection of business secrets, the disclosure of which would negatively affect the overall com\u00ad mercial strategy of the storage user, with the objective of creating a competitive internal gas market, it may allow the storage sys\u00ad tem operator not to make public the data referred to in the first subparagraph, for a duration of up to one year. The second subparagraph shall apply without prejudice to the obligations of communication to and publication by the transmis\u00ad sion system operator referred to in the first subparagraph, unless the aggregated data are identical to the individual storage system data for which the national regulatory authority has approved non-publication. 5.

Capacity-allocation mechanisms and congestion-management procedures shall facilitate the development of compe\u00ad tition and liquid trading of capacity and shall be compatible with market mechanisms including spot markets and trad\u00ad ing hubs. They shall be flexible and capable of adapting to evolving market circumstances. 2. Those mechanisms and procedures shall take into account the integrity of the system concerned as well as security of supply. N E 0 5 / 1 1 2 L ",

They shall not prevent market participants, including new market entrants and companies with a small market share, from competing effectively. 4. Those mechanisms and procedures shall provide appropriate economic signals for efficient and maximum use of tech\u00ad nical capacity and facilitate investment in new infrastructure. 5. Network users shall be advised about the type of circumstance that could affect the availability of contracted capacity. Information on interruption should reflect the level of information available to the transmission system operator. 6. Should difficulties in meeting contractual delivery obligations arise due to system integrity reasons, transmission sys\u00ad tem operators should notify network users and seek a non-discriminatory solution without delay. Transmission system operators shall consult network users regarding procedures prior to their implementation and agree them with the regulatory authority. 2.2. Congestion-management procedures in the event of contractual congestion 1. In the event that contracted capacity goes unused, transmission system operators shall make that capacity available on the primary market on an interruptible basis via contracts of differing duration, as long as that capacity is not offered by the relevant network user on the secondary market at a reasonable price. 2. Revenues from released interruptible capacity shall be split according to rules laid down or approved by the relevant regulatory authority. Those rules shall be compatible with the requirement of an effective and efficient use of the system. 3. A reasonable price for released interruptible capacity may be determined by the relevant regulatory authorities taking into account the specific circumstances prevailing. 4. Where appropriate, transmission system operators shall make reasonable endeavours to offer at least parts of the unused capacity to the market as firm capacity. 3.

Council Decision of 25 June 2009. ( Whereas: (1) The internal market in electricity, which has been progres\u00ad sively implemented throughout the Community since 1999, aims to deliver real choice for all consumers of the European Union, be they citizens or businesses, new busi\u00ad ness opportunities and more cross-border trade, so as to achieve efficiency gains, competitive prices, and higher standards of service, and to contribute to security of sup\u00ad ply and sustainability. (2) Directive 2003/54/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 26 June 2003 concerning common rules for the internal market in electricity ( 4 ) OJ L 176, 15.7.2003, p. 37. ( a contribution towards the creation of such an internal mar\u00ad ket in electricity. (3) The freedoms which the Treaty guarantees the citizens of the Union \u2014 inter alia, the free movement of goods, the freedom of establishment and the freedom to provide ser\u00ad vices \u2014 are achievable only in a fully open market, which enables all consumers freely to choose their suppliers and all suppliers freely to deliver to their customers. (4) However, at present, there are obstacles to the sale of elec\u00ad tricity on equal terms and without discrimination or dis\u00ad advantages in the Community. In particular, non- discriminatory network access and an equally effective level of regulatory supervision in each Member State do not yet exist. (5) A secure supply of electricity is of vital importance for the development of European society, the implementation of a sustainable climate change policy, and the fostering of competitiveness within the internal market. To that end, cross-border interconnections should be further developed in order to secure the supply of all energy sources at the most competitive prices to consumers and industry within the Community. (6) A well-functioning internal market in electricity should provide producers with the appropriate incentives for investing in new power generation, including in electricity from renewable energy sources, paying special attention to the most isolated countries and regions in the Communi\u00ad ty\u2019s energy market. A well-functioning market should also provide consumers with adequate measures to promote the more efficient use of energy for which a secure supply of energy is a precondition. (7) The Communication of the Commission of 10 January 2007 entitled \u2018An Energy Policy for Europe\u2019 highlighted the importance of completing the internal market in electric\u00ad ity and of creating a level playing field for all electricity undertakings established in the Community. The Commu\u00ad nications of the Commission of 10 January 2007 entitled \u2018Prospects for the internal gas and electricity market\u2019 and \u2018Inquiry pursuant to Article 17 of Regulation (EC) No 1/2003 into the European gas and electricity sectors (Final Report)\u2019 showed that the present rules and measures do not provide the necessary framework for achieving the objective of a well-functioning internal market. 5 5 / 1 1 2 L n o i n U n a e p o r u E e h t f o l a n r u o J l a i c i f f O N E 9 0 0 2 . 8 . 4 1 t n a c i f i n g i s a e d a m s h ) 4 , ) 3 , ) 2 , ) 1 ",
        "(8) In order to secure competition and the supply of electric\u00ad ity at the most competitive price, Member States and national regulatory authorities should facilitate cross- border access for new suppliers of electricity from differ\u00ad ent energy sources as well as for new providers of power generation. (9) Without effective separation of networks from activities of generation and supply (effective unbundling), there is an inherent risk of discrimination not only in the operation of the network but also in the incentives for vertically inte\u00ad grated undertakings to invest adequately in their networks. (10) The rules on legal and functional unbundling as provided for in Directive 2003/54/EC have not, however, led to effective unbundling of the transmission system operators. At its meeting on 8 and 9 March 2007, the European Council therefore invited the Commission to develop leg\u00ad islative proposals for the \u2018effective separation of supply and generation activities from network operations\u2019. (11) Only the removal of the incentive for vertically integrated undertakings to discriminate against competitors as regards network access and investment can ensure effec\u00ad tive unbundling. Ownership unbundling, which implies the appointment of the network owner as the system operator and its independence from any supply and pro\u00ad duction interests, is clearly an effective and stable way to solve the inherent conflict of interests and to ensure secu\u00ad rity of supply. For that reason, the European Parliament, in its resolution of 10 July 2007 on prospects for the internal gas and electricity market ( 1 ) OJ C 175 E, 10.7.2008, p. 206. ( dling at transmission level as the most effective tool by which to promote investments in infrastructure in a non- discriminatory way, fair access to the network for new entrants and transparency in the market. Under ownership unbundling, Member States should therefore be required to ensure that the same person or persons are not entitled to exercise control over a generation or supply undertaking and, at the same time, exercise control or any right over a transmission system operator or transmission system. Conversely, control over a transmission system or trans\u00ad mission system operator should preclude the possibility of exercising control or any right over a generation or supply undertaking. Within those limits, a generation or supply undertaking should be able to have a minority sharehold\u00ad ing in a transmission system operator or transmission system. (12) Any system for unbundling should be effective in remov\u00ad ing any conflict of interests between producers, suppliers and transmission system operators, in order to create incentives for the necessary investments and guarantee the access of new market entrants under a transparent and efficient regulatory regime and should not create an overly onerous regulatory regime for national regulatory authorities. (13) The definition of the term \u2018control\u2019 is taken from Council Regulation (EC) No 139/2004 of 20 January 2004 on the control of concentrations between undertakings (the EC Merger Regulation) ( 2 ) OJ L 24, 29.1.2004, p. 1. ( (14) Since ownership unbundling requires, in some instances, the restructuring of undertakings, Member States that decide to implement ownership unbundling should be granted additional time to apply the relevant provisions. In view of the vertical links between the electricity and gas sectors, the unbundling provisions should apply across the two sectors. (15) Under ownership unbundling, to ensure full independence of network operation from supply and generation interests and to prevent exchanges of any confidential information, the same person should not be a member of the managing boards of both a transmission system operator or a trans\u00ad mission system and an undertaking performing any of the functions of generation or supply. For the same reason, the same person should not be entitled to appoint members of the managing boards of a transmission system operator or a transmission system and to exercise control or any right over a generation or supply undertaking. (16) The setting up of a system operator or a transmission operator that is independent from supply and generation interests should enable a vertically integrated undertaking to maintain its ownership of network assets whilst ensur\u00ad ing effective separation of interests, provided that such independent system operator or such independent trans\u00ad mission operator performs all the functions of a system operator and detailed regulation and extensive regulatory control mechanisms are put in place. (17) Where, on 3 September 2009, an undertaking owning a transmission system is part of a vertically integrated under\u00ad taking, Member States should therefore be given a choice between ownership unbundling and setting up a system operator or transmission operator which is independent from supply and generation interests. (18) To preserve fully the interests of the shareholders of verti\u00ad cally integrated undertakings, Member States should have the choice of implementing ownership unbundling either by direct divestiture or by splitting the shares of the inte\u00ad grated undertaking into shares of the network undertaking and shares of the remaining supply and generation under\u00ad taking, provided that the requirements resulting from own\u00ad ership unbundling are complied with. 9 0 0 2 . 8 . 4 1 n o i n U n a e p o r u E e h t f o l a n r u o J l a i c i f f O N E 6 5 / 1 1 2 L . ) 2 - n u b n u p i h s r e n w o o t d e r r e f e r ) 1 ",
        "Official Journal of the European Union L 211/57 (19) The full effectiveness of the independent system operator or independent transmission operator solutions should be ensured by way of specific additional rules. The rules on the independent transmission operator provide an appro\u00ad priate regulatory framework to guarantee fair competition, sufficient investment, access for new market entrants and the integration of electricity markets. Effective unbundling through the independent transmission operator provisions should be based on a pillar of organisational measures and measures relating to the governance of transmission sys\u00ad tem operators and on a pillar of measures relating to investment, connecting new production capacities to the network and market integration through regional coopera\u00ad tion. The independence of the transmission operator should also, inter alia, be ensured through certain \u2018cooling- off\u2019 periods during which no management or other rel\u00ad evant activity giving access to the same information as could have been obtained in a managerial position is exer\u00ad cised in the vertically integrated undertaking. The indepen\u00ad dent transmission operator model of effective unbundling is in line with the requirements laid down by the European Council at its meeting on 8 and 9 March 2007. (20) In order to develop competition in the internal market in electricity, large non-household customers should be able to choose their suppliers and enter into contracts with sev\u00ad eral suppliers to secure their electricity requirements. Such customers should be protected against exclusivity clauses the effect of which is to exclude competing or complemen\u00ad tary offers. (21) A Member State has the right to opt for full ownership unbundling in its territory. Where a Member State has exercised that right, an undertaking does not have the right to set up an independent system operator or an indepen\u00ad dent transmission operator. Furthermore, an undertaking performing any of the functions of generation or supply cannot directly or indirectly exercise control or any right over a transmission system operator from a Member State that has opted for full ownership unbundling. (22) Under this Directive different types of market organisation will exist in the internal market in electricity. The measures that Member States could take in order to ensure a level playing field should be based on overriding requirements of general interest. The Commission should be consulted on the compatibility of the measures with the Treaty and Community law. (23) The implementation of effective unbundling should respect the principle of non-discrimination between the public and private sectors. To that end, the same person should not be able to exercise control or any right, in violation of the rules of ownership unbundling or the independent sys\u00ad tem operator option, solely or jointly, over the composi\u00ad tion, voting or decision of the bodies of both the transmission system operators or the transmission systems and the generation or supply undertakings. With regard to ownership unbundling and the independent system opera\u00ad tor solution, provided that the Member State in question is able to demonstrate that the requirement is complied with, two separate public bodies should be able to control gen\u00ad eration and supply activities on the one hand and transmis\u00ad sion activities on the other. (24) Fully effective separation of network activities from sup\u00ad ply and generation activities should apply throughout the Community to both Community and non-Community undertakings. To ensure that network activities and supply and generation activities throughout the Community remain independent from each other, regulatory authori\u00ad ties should be empowered to refuse certification to trans\u00ad mission system operators that do not comply with the unbundling rules. To ensure the consistent application of those rules across the Community, the regulatory authori\u00ad ties should take utmost account of the Commission\u2019s opin\u00ad ion when the former take decisions on certification. To ensure, in addition, respect for the international obliga\u00ad tions of the Community, and solidarity and energy secu\u00ad rity within the Community, the Commission should have the right to give an opinion on certification in relation to a transmission system owner or a transmission system operator which is controlled by a person or persons from a third country or third countries. (25) The security of energy supply is an essential element of public security and is therefore inherently connected to the efficient functioning of the internal market in electricity and the integration of the isolated electricity markets of Member States. Electricity can reach the citizens of the Union only through the network. Functioning electricity markets and, in particular, the networks and other assets associated with electricity supply are essential for public security, for the competitiveness of the economy and for the well-being of the citizens of the Union. Persons from third countries should therefore be allowed to control a transmission system or a transmission system operator only if they comply with the requirements of effective separation that apply inside the Community. Without prejudice to the international obligations of the Commu\u00ad nity, the Community considers that the electricity trans\u00ad mission system sector is of high importance to the Community and therefore additional safeguards are neces\u00ad sary regarding the preservation of the security of supply of energy to the Community to avoid any threats to public order and public security in the Community and the wel\u00ad fare of the citizens of the Union. The security of supply of energy to the Community requires, in particular, an assess\u00ad ment of the independence of network operation, the level of the Community\u2019s and individual Member States\u2019 depen\u00ad dence on energy supply from third countries, and the treat\u00ad ment of both domestic and foreign trade and investment in energy in a particular third country. Security of supply N E 9 0 0 2 . 8 . 4 1 ",
        "Official Journal of the European Union 14.8.2009 should therefore be assessed in the light of the factual cir\u00ad cumstances of each case as well as the rights and obliga\u00ad tions arising under international law, in particular the international agreements between the Community and the third country concerned. Where appropriate the Commis\u00ad sion is encouraged to submit recommendations to negoti\u00ad ate relevant agreements with third countries addressing the security of supply of energy to the Community or to include the necessary issues in other negotiations with those third countries. (26) Non-discriminatory access to the distribution network determines downstream access to customers at retail level. The scope for discrimination as regards third-party access and investment, however, is less significant at distribution level than at transmission level where congestion and the influence of generation or supply interests are generally greater than at distribution level. Moreover, legal and func\u00ad tional unbundling of distribution system operators was required, pursuant to Directive 2003/54/EC, only from 1 July 2007 and its effects on the internal market in elec\u00ad tricity still need to be evaluated. The rules on legal and functional unbundling currently in place can lead to effec\u00ad tive unbundling provided they are more clearly defined, properly implemented and closely monitored. To create a level playing field at retail level, the activities of distribu\u00ad tion system operators should therefore be monitored so that they are prevented from taking advantage of their ver\u00ad tical integration as regards their competitive position on the market, in particular in relation to household and small non-household customers. (27) Member States should encourage the modernisation of dis\u00ad tribution networks, such as through the introduction of smart grids, which should be built in a way that encour\u00ad ages decentralised generation and energy efficiency. (28) In the case of small systems it may be necessary that the provision of ancillary services is ensured by transmission system operators interconnected with small systems. (29) To avoid imposing a disproportionate financial and admin\u00ad istrative burden on small distribution system operators, Member States should be able, where necessary, to exempt the undertakings concerned from the legal distribution unbundling requirements. (30) Where a closed distribution system is used to ensure the optimal efficiency of an integrated energy supply requir\u00ad ing specific operational standards, or a closed distribution system is maintained primarily for the use of the owner of the system, it should be possible to exempt the distribu\u00ad tion system operator from obligations which would constitute an unnecessary administrative burden because of the particular nature of the relationship between the dis\u00ad tribution system operator and the users of the system. Industrial, commercial or shared services sites such as train station buildings, airports, hospitals, large camping sites with integrated facilities or chemical industry sites can include closed distribution systems because of the specia\u00ad lised nature of their operations. (31) Authorisation procedures should not lead to an adminis\u00ad trative burden disproportionate to the size and potential impact of electricity producers. Unduly lengthy authorisa\u00ad tion procedures may constitute a barrier to access for new market entrants. (32) Further measures should be taken in order to ensure trans\u00ad parent and non-discriminatory tariffs for access to net\u00ad works. Those tariffs should be applicable to all system users on a non-discriminatory basis. (33) Directive 2003/54/EC introduced a requirement for Mem\u00ad ber States to establish regulators with specific compe\u00ad tences. However, experience shows that the effectiveness of regulation is frequently hampered through a lack of inde\u00ad pendence of regulators from government, and insufficient powers and discretion. For that reason, at its meeting on 8 and 9 March 2007, the European Council invited the Com\u00ad mission to develop legislative proposals providing for fur\u00ad ther harmonisation of the powers and strengthening of the independence of national energy regulators. It should be possible for those national regulatory authorities to cover both the electricity and the gas sectors. (34) Energy regulators need to be able to take decisions in rela\u00ad tion to all relevant regulatory issues if the internal market in electricity is to function properly, and to be fully inde\u00ad pendent from any other public or private interests. This precludes neither judicial review nor parliamentary super\u00ad vision in accordance with the constitutional laws of the Member States. In addition, approval of the budget of the regulator by the national legislator does not constitute an obstacle to budgetary autonomy. The provisions relating to the autonomy in the implementation of the allocated budget of the regulatory authority should be implemented in the framework defined by national budgetary law and rules. While contributing to the independence of the national regulatory authority from any political or eco\u00ad nomic interest through an appropriate rotation scheme, it should be possible for Member States to take due account of the availability of human resources and of the size of the board. (35) In order to ensure effective market access for all market players, including new entrants, non-discriminatory and cost-reflective balancing mechanisms are necessary. As soon as the electricity market is sufficiently liquid, this N E 8 5 / 1 1 2 L ",
        "should be achieved through the setting up of transparent market-based mechanisms for the supply and purchase of electricity, needed in the framework of balancing require\u00ad ments. In the absence of such a liquid market, national regulatory authorities should play an active role to ensure that balancing tariffs are non-discriminatory and cost- reflective. At the same time, appropriate incentives should be provided to balance the in-put and off-take of electric\u00ad ity and not to endanger the system. Transmission system operators should facilitate participation of final customers and final customers\u2019 aggregators in reserve and balancing markets. (36) National regulatory authorities should be able to fix or approve tariffs, or the methodologies underlying the cal\u00ad culation of the tariffs, on the basis of a proposal by the transmission system operator or distribution system opera\u00ad tor(s), or on the basis of a proposal agreed between those operator(s) and the users of the network. In carrying out those tasks, national regulatory authorities should ensure that transmission and distribution tariffs are non- discriminatory and cost-reflective, and should take account of the long-term, marginal, avoided network costs from distributed generation and demand-side management measures. (37) Energy regulators should have the power to issue binding decisions in relation to electricity undertakings and to impose effective, proportionate and dissuasive penalties on electricity undertakings which fail to comply with their obligations or to propose that a competent court impose such penalties on them. Energy regulators should also be granted the power to decide, irrespective of the application of competition rules, on appropriate measures ensuring customer benefits through the promotion of effective com\u00ad petition necessary for the proper functioning of the inter\u00ad nal market in electricity. The establishment of virtual power plants \u2014 electricity release programmes whereby electricity undertakings are obliged to sell or to make avail\u00ad able a certain volume of electricity or to grant access to part of their generation capacity to interested suppliers for a certain period of time \u2014 is one of the possible measures that can be used to promote effective competition and ensure the proper functioning of the market. Energy regu\u00ad lators should also be granted the power to contribute to ensuring high standards of universal and public service in compliance with market opening, to the protection of vul\u00ad nerable customers, and to the full effectiveness of con\u00ad sumer protection measures. Those provisions should be without prejudice to both the Commission\u2019s powers con\u00ad cerning the application of competition rules including the examination of mergers with a Community dimension, and the rules on the internal market such as the free move\u00ad ment of capital. The independent body to which a party affected by the decision of a national regulator has a right to appeal could be a court or other tribunal empowered to conduct a judicial review. (38) Any harmonisation of the powers of national regulatory authorities should include the powers to provide incentives to electricity undertakings, and to impose effective, pro\u00ad portionate and dissuasive penalties on electricity undertak\u00ad ings or to propose that a competent court impose such penalties. Moreover, regulatory authorities should have the power to request relevant information from electricity undertakings, make appropriate and sufficient investiga\u00ad tions and settle disputes. (39) The internal market in electricity suffers from a lack of liquidity and transparency hindering the efficient allocation of resources, risk hedging and new entry. There is a need for enhancement of competition and security of supply through facilitated integration of new power plants into the electricity network in all Member States, in particular encouraging new market entrants. Trust in the market, its liquidity and the number of market participants needs to increase, and, therefore, regulatory oversight of undertak\u00ad ings active in the supply of electricity needs to be increased. Such requirements should be without prejudice to, and compatible with, existing Community law in relation to the financial markets. Energy regulators and financial mar\u00ad ket regulators need to cooperate in order to enable each other to have an overview over the markets concerned.

Those customers should also have access to choice, fairness, representation and dispute settlement mechanisms. (43) Nearly all Member States have chosen to ensure competi\u00ad tion in the electricity generation market through a trans\u00ad parent authorisation procedure. However, Member States should ensure the possibility to contribute to security of supply through the launching of a tendering procedure or an equivalent procedure in the event that sufficient elec\u00ad tricity generation capacity is not built on the basis of the authorisation procedure. Member States should have the possibility, in the interests of environmental protection and the promotion of new infant technologies, of tender\u00ad ing for new capacity on the basis of published criteria. Such new capacity includes, inter alia, electricity from renewable energy sources and combined heat and power. (44) In the interests of security of supply, the balance between supply and demand in individual Member States should be monitored, and such monitoring should be followed by a report on the situation at Community level, taking account of interconnection capacity between areas. Such monitor\u00ad ing should be carried out sufficiently early to enable appro\u00ad priate measures to be taken if security of supply is compromised. The construction and maintenance of the necessary network infrastructure, including interconnec\u00ad tion capacity, should contribute to ensuring a stable elec\u00ad tricity supply. The maintenance and construction of the necessary network infrastructure, including interconnec\u00ad tion capacity and decentralised electricity generation, are important elements in ensuring a stable electricity supply. (45) Member States should ensure that household customers and, where Member States deem it appropriate, small enterprises, enjoy the right to be supplied with electricity of a specified quality at clearly comparable, transparent and reasonable prices. In order to ensure the maintenance of the high standards of public service in the Community, all measures taken by Member States to achieve the objec\u00ad tive of this Directive should be regularly notified to the Commission. The Commission should regularly publish a report analysing measures taken at national level to achieve public service objectives and comparing their effectiveness, with a view to making recommendations as regards mea\u00ad sures to be taken at national level to achieve high public service standards. Member States should take the necessary measures to protect vulnerable customers in the context of the internal market in electricity. Such measures may dif\u00ad fer according to the particular circumstances in the Mem\u00ad ber States in question and may include specific measures relating to the payment of electricity bills, or more general measures taken in the social security system. Where uni\u00ad versal service is also provided to small enterprises, mea\u00ad sures to ensure that such universal service is provided may differ according to whether they are aimed at household customers or small enterprises. (46) Respect for the public service requirements is a fundamen\u00ad tal requirement of this Directive, and it is important that common minimum standards, respected by all Member States, are specified in this Directive, which take into account the objectives of consumer protection, security of supply, environmental protection and equivalent levels of competition in all Member States. It is important that the public service requirements can be interpreted on a national basis, taking into account national circumstances and subject to the respect of Community law. (47) It should be possible for Member States to appoint a sup\u00ad plier of last resort. That supplier may be the sales division of a vertically integrated undertaking, which also performs the functions of distribution, provided that it meets the unbundling requirements of this Directive. (48) It should be possible for measures implemented by Mem\u00ad ber States to achieve the objectives of social and economic cohesion to include, in particular, the provision of adequate economic incentives, using, where appropriate, all existing national and Community tools. Such tools may include liability mechanisms to guarantee the necessary investment. (49) To the extent to which measures taken by Member States to fulfil public service obligations constitute State aid under Article 87(1) of the Treaty, there is an obligation under Article 88(3) of the Treaty to notify them to the Commission. (50) The public service requirements, including as regards the universal service, and the common minimum standards that follow from them need to be further strengthened to make sure that all consumers, especially vulnerable ones, are able to benefit from competition and fair prices. The public service requirements should be defined at national level, taking into account national circumstances; Commu\u00ad nity law should, however, be respected by the Member States. The citizens of the Union and, where Member States deem it appropriate, small enterprises, should be able to enjoy public service obligations, in particular with regard N E 0 6 / 1 1 2 L ",
        "to security of supply, and reasonable prices. A key aspect of supplying customers is access to objective and transpar\u00ad ent consumption data. Thus, consumers should have access to their consumption data and associated prices and services costs so that they can invite competitors to make an offer based on those data. Consumers should also have the right to be properly informed about their energy con\u00ad sumption. Prepayments should reflect the likely consump\u00ad tion of electricity and different payment systems should be non-discriminatory. Information on energy costs provided to consumers frequently enough will create incentives for energy savings because it will give customers direct feed\u00ad back on the effects of investment in energy efficiency and change of behaviour. In this respect, full implementation of Directive 2006/32/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 5 April 2006 on energy end-use effi\u00ad ciency and energy services ( 1 ) OJ L 114, 27.4.2006, p. 64. ( reduce their energy costs. (51) Consumer interests should be at the heart of this Directive and quality of service should be a central responsibility of electricity undertakings. Existing rights of consumers need to be strengthened and guaranteed, and should include greater transparency. Consumer protection should ensure that all consumers in the wider remit of the Community benefit from a competitive market. Consumer rights should be enforced by Member States or, where a Member State has so provided, the regulatory authorities. (52) Clear and comprehensible information should be made available to consumers concerning their rights in relation to the energy sector. The Commission should establish, after consulting relevant stakeholders including Member States, national regulatory authorities, consumer organisa\u00ad tions and electricity undertakings, an accessible, user- friendly energy consumer checklist providing consumers with practical information about their rights. That check\u00ad list should be provided to all consumers and should be made publicly available. (53) Energy poverty is a growing problem in the Community. Member States which are affected and which have not yet done so should therefore develop national action plans or other appropriate frameworks to tackle energy poverty, aiming at decreasing the number of people suffering such situation. In any event, Member States should ensure the necessary energy supply for vulnerable customers. In doing so, an integrated approach, such as in the framework of social policy, could be used and measures could include social policies or energy efficiency improvements for hous\u00ad ing. At the very least, this Directive should allow national policies in favour of vulnerable customers. (54) Greater consumer protection is guaranteed by the availabil\u00ad ity of effective means of dispute settlement for all consum\u00ad ers. Member States should introduce speedy and effective complaint handling procedures. (55) It should be possible to base the introduction of intelligent metering systems on an economic assessment. Should that assessment conclude that the introduction of such meter\u00ad ing systems is economically reasonable and cost-effective only for consumers with a certain amount of electricity consumption, Member States should be able to take this into account when implementing intelligent metering systems. (56) Market prices should give the right incentives for the devel\u00ad opment of the network and for investing in new electricity generation. (57) Promoting fair competition and easy access for different suppliers and fostering capacity for new electricity genera\u00ad tion should be of the utmost importance for Member States in order to allow consumers to take full advantage of the opportunities of a liberalised internal market in electricity. (58) With a view to creating an internal market in electricity, Member States should foster the integration of their national markets and the cooperation of system operators at Community and regional level, also incorporating iso\u00ad lated systems forming electricity islands that persist in the Community. (59) The development of a true internal market in electricity, through a network connected across the Community, should be one of the main goals of this Directive and regu\u00ad latory issues on cross-border interconnections and regional markets should, therefore, be one of the main tasks of the regulatory authorities, in close cooperation with the Agency where relevant. (60) Securing common rules for a true internal market and a broad supply of electricity accessible to all should also be one of the main goals of this Directive. To that end, undis\u00ad torted market prices would provide an incentive for cross- border interconnections and for investments in new power generation while leading, in the long term, to price convergence. (61) Regulatory authorities should also provide information on the market to permit the Commission to exercise its role of observing and monitoring the internal market in elec\u00ad tricity and its short, medium and long-term evolution, 1 6 / 1 1 2 L n o i n U n a e p o r u E e h t f o l a n r u o J l a i c i f f O N E 9 0 0 2 . 8 . 4 1 o t s r e m u s n o c p l e h l l i w ) 1 ",

National regulatory authorities should report to the competition authorities and the Com\u00ad mission those Member States in which prices impair com\u00ad petition and proper functioning of the market. (62) Since the objective of this Directive, namely the creation of a fully operational internal electricity market, cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States and can there\u00ad fore be better achieved at Community level, the Commu\u00ad nity may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty. In accor\u00ad dance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in that Article, this Directive does not go beyond what is nec\u00ad essary in order to achieve that objective.

( achieve the necessary degree of harmonisation. Such Guidelines, which constitute binding implementing mea\u00ad sures, are, also with regard to certain provisions of this Directive, a useful tool which can be adapted quickly where necessary. (64) The measures necessary for the implementation of this Directive should be adopted in accordance with Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers con\u00ad ferred on the Commission ( 2 ) OJ L 184, 17.7.1999, p. 23. ( (65) In particular, the Commission should be empowered to adopt the Guidelines necessary for providing the minimum degree of harmonisation required to achieve the aim of this Directive. Since those measures are of general scope and are designed to amend non-essential elements of this Direc\u00ad tive, by supplementing it with new non-essential elements, they must be adopted in accordance with the regulatory procedure with scrutiny provided for in Article 5a of Deci\u00ad sion 1999/468/EC.

CHAPTER II GENERAL RULES FOR THE ORGANISATION OF THE SECTOR Article 3 Public service obligations and customer protection 1. Member States shall ensure, on the basis of their institu\u00ad tional organisation and with due regard to the principle of sub\u00ad sidiarity, that, without prejudice to paragraph 2, electricity undertakings are operated in accordance with the principles of this Directive with a view to achieving a competitive, secure and environmentally sustainable market in electricity, and shall not discriminate between those undertakings as regards either rights or obligations. 2. Having full regard to the relevant provisions of the Treaty, in particular Article 86 thereof, Member States may impose on undertakings operating in the electricity sector, in the general eco\u00ad nomic interest, public service obligations which may relate to security, including security of supply, regularity, quality and price of supplies and environmental protection, including energy effi\u00ad ciency, energy from renewable sources and climate protection. Such obligations shall be clearly defined, transparent, non- discriminatory, verifiable and shall guarantee equality of access for electricity undertakings of the Community to national consum\u00ad ers. In relation to security of supply, energy efficiency/demand- side management and for the fulfilment of environmental goals and goals for energy from renewable sources, as referred to in this paragraph, Member States may introduce the implementation of long-term planning, taking into account the possibility of third parties seeking access to the system. 3. Member States shall ensure that all household customers, and, where Member States deem it appropriate, small enterprises (namely enterprises with fewer than 50 occupied persons and an annual turnover or balance sheet not exceeding EUR 10 million), enjoy universal service, that is the right to be supplied with elec\u00ad tricity of a specified quality within their territory at reasonable, easily and clearly comparable, transparent and non- discriminatory prices. To ensure the provision of universal ser\u00ad vice, Member States may appoint a supplier of last resort. Member States shall impose on distribution companies an obligation to connect customers to their network under terms, conditions and tariffs set in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 37(6). Nothing in this Directive shall prevent Member States from strengthening the market position of the household, small and medium-sized consumers by promoting the possibili\u00ad ties of voluntary aggregation of representation for that class of consumers. The first subparagraph shall be implemented in a transparent and non-discriminatory way and shall not impede the opening of the market provided for in Article 33. 4. Member States shall ensure that all customers are entitled to have their electricity provided by a supplier, subject to the sup\u00ad plier\u2019s agreement, regardless of the Member State in which the supplier is registered, as long as the supplier follows the applicable trading and balancing rules. In this regard, Member States shall take all measures necessary to ensure that administrative proce\u00ad dures do not discriminate against supply undertakings already registered in another Member State. 5. Member States shall ensure that: (a) where a customer, while respecting contractual conditions, wishes to change supplier, the change is effected by the operator(s) concerned within three weeks; and (b) customers are entitled to receive all relevant consumption data. Member States shall ensure that the rights referred to in points (a) and (b) are granted to customers in a non-discriminatory manner as regards cost, effort or time. 9 0 0 2 . 8 . 4 1 n o i n U n a e p o r u E e h t f o l a n r u o J l a i c i f f O N E 4 6 / 1 1 2 L , ) 1 ",

Member States shall take appropriate measures to protect final customers, and shall, in particular, ensure that there are adequate safeguards to protect vulnerable customers. In this con\u00ad text, each Member State shall define the concept of vulnerable customers which may refer to energy poverty and, inter alia, to the prohibition of disconnection of electricity to such customers in critical times. Member States shall ensure that rights and obli\u00ad gations linked to vulnerable customers are applied. In particular, they shall take measures to protect final customers in remote areas. They shall ensure high levels of consumer protection, par\u00ad ticularly with respect to transparency regarding contractual terms and conditions, general information and dispute settlement mechanisms. Member States shall ensure that the eligible cus\u00ad tomer is in fact able easily to switch to a new supplier. As regards at least household customers, those measures shall include those set out in Annex I. 8. Member States shall take appropriate measures, such as for\u00ad mulating national energy action plans, providing benefits in social security systems to ensure the necessary electricity supply to vul\u00ad nerable customers, or providing for support for energy efficiency improvements, to address energy poverty where identified, includ\u00ad ing in the broader context of poverty. Such measures shall not impede the effective opening of the market set out in Article 33 or market functioning and shall be notified to the Commission, where relevant, in accordance with the provisions of paragraph 15 of this Article. Such notification may also include measures taken within the general social security system. 9. Member States shall ensure that electricity suppliers specify in or with the bills and in promotional materials made available to final customers: (a) the contribution of each energy source to the overall fuel mix of the supplier over the preceding year in a comprehensible and, at a national level, clearly comparable manner; (b) at least the reference to existing reference sources, such as web pages, where information on the environmental impact, in terms of at least CO 2 emissions and the radioactive waste resulting from the electricity produced by the overall fuel mix of the supplier over the preceding year is publicly available; (c) information concerning their rights as regards the means of dispute settlement available to them in the event of a dispute. As regards points (a) and (b) of the first subparagraph with respect to electricity obtained via an electricity exchange or imported from an undertaking situated outside the Community, aggregate figures provided by the exchange or the undertaking in question over the preceding year may be used. The regulatory authority or another competent national author\u00ad ity shall take the necessary steps to ensure that the information provided by suppliers to their customers pursuant to this Article is reliable and is provided, at a national level, in a clearly compa\u00ad rable manner. 10. Member States shall implement measures to achieve the objectives of social and economic cohesion and environmental protection, which shall include energy efficiency/demand-side management measures and means to combat climate change, and security of supply, where appropriate. Such measures may include, in particular, the provision of adequate economic incen\u00ad tives, using, where appropriate, all existing national and Commu\u00ad nity tools, for the maintenance and construction of the necessary network infrastructure, including interconnection capacity. 11. In order to promote energy efficiency, Member States or, where a Member State has so provided, the regulatory authority shall strongly recommend that electricity undertakings optimise the use of electricity, for example by providing energy manage\u00ad ment services, developing innovative pricing formulas, or intro\u00ad ducing intelligent metering systems or smart grids, where appropriate. 12. Member States shall ensure the provision of single points of contact to provide consumers with all necessary information concerning their rights, current legislation and the means of dis\u00ad pute settlement available to them in the event of a dispute. Such contact points may be part of general consumer information points. 13. Member States shall ensure that an independent mecha\u00ad nism such as an energy ombudsman or a consumer body is in place in order to ensure efficient treatment of complaints and out- of-court dispute settlements. 14. Member States may decide not to apply the provisions of Articles 7, 8, 32 and/or 34 insofar as their application would obstruct the performance, in law or in fact, of the obligations imposed on electricity undertakings in the general economic interest and insofar as the development of trade would not be affected to such an extent as would be contrary to the interests of the Community. The interests of the Community include, inter alia, competition with regard to eligible customers in accordance with this Directive and Article 86 of the Treaty. 15. Member States shall, upon implementation of this Direc\u00ad tive, inform the Commission of all measures adopted to fulfil uni\u00ad versal service and public service obligations, including consumer protection and environmental protection, and their possible effect on national and international competition, whether or not such measures require a derogation from this Directive.

Such monitoring shall, in particular, cover the balance of supply and demand on the national market, the level of expected future demand and envisaged additional capacity being planned or under construction, and the quality and level of main\u00ad tenance of the networks, as well as measures to cover peak demand and to deal with shortfalls of one or more suppliers. The competent authorities shall publish every two years, by 31 July, a report outlining the findings resulting from the monitoring of those issues, as well as any measures taken or envisaged to address them and shall forward that report to the Commission forthwith. Article 5 Technical rules The regulatory authorities where Member States have so provided or Member States shall ensure that technical safety criteria are defined and that technical rules establishing the minimum tech\u00ad nical design and operational requirements for the connection to the system of generating installations, distribution systems, directly connected consumers\u2019 equipment, interconnector circuits and direct lines are developed and made public. Those technical rules shall ensure the interoperability of systems and shall be objective and non-discriminatory. The Agency may make appro\u00ad priate recommendations towards achieving compatibility of those rules, where appropriate. Those rules shall be notified to the Com\u00ad mission in accordance with Article 8 of Directive 98/34/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 June 1998 laying down a procedure for the provision of information in the field of technical standards and regulations and of rules on Information Society services ( 1 ) OJ L 204, 21.7.1998, p. 37. ( Article 6 Promotion of regional cooperation 1. Member States as well as the regulatory authorities shall cooperate with each other for the purpose of integrating their national markets at one or more regional levels, as a first step towards the creation of a fully liberalised internal market. In par\u00ad ticular, the regulatory authorities where Member States have so provided or Member States shall promote and facilitate the coop\u00ad eration of transmission system operators at a regional level, including on cross-border issues, with the aim of creating a com\u00ad petitive internal market in electricity, foster the consistency of their legal, regulatory and technical framework and facilitate inte\u00ad gration of the isolated systems forming electricity islands that per\u00ad sist in the Community. The geographical areas covered by such regional cooperation shall include cooperation in geographical areas defined in accordance with Article 12(3) of Regulation (EC) No 714/2009. Such cooperation may cover other geographical areas. 2. The Agency shall cooperate with national regulatory authorities and transmission system operators to ensure the com\u00ad patibility of regulatory frameworks between the regions with the aim of creating a competitive internal market in electricity. Where the Agency considers that binding rules on such cooperation are required, it shall make appropriate recommendations. 3. Member States shall ensure, through the implementation of this Directive, that transmission system operators have one or more integrated system(s) at regional level covering two or more Member States for capacity allocation and for checking the secu\u00ad rity of the network. 4. Where vertically integrated transmission system operators participate in a joint undertaking established for implementing such cooperation, the joint undertaking shall establish and imple\u00ad ment a compliance programme which sets out the measures to be taken to ensure that discriminatory and anticompetitive conduct is excluded. That compliance programme shall set out the specific obligations of employees to meet the objective of excluding dis\u00ad criminatory and anticompetitive conduct. It shall be subject to the approval of the Agency. Compliance with the programme shall be independently monitored by the compliance officers of the verti\u00ad cally integrated transmission system operators. CHAPTER III GENERATION Article 7 Authorisation procedure for new capacity 1. For the construction of new generating capacity, Member States shall adopt an authorisation procedure, which shall be con\u00ad ducted in accordance with objective, transparent and non- discriminatory criteria. 2. Member States shall lay down the criteria for the grant of authorisations for the construction of generating capacity in their territory. In determining appropriate criteria, Member States shall consider: (a) the safety and security of the electricity system, installations and associated equipment; 9 0 0 2 . 8 . 4 1 n o i n U n a e p o r u E e h t f o l a n r u o J l a i c i f f O N E 6 6 / 1 1 2 L . ) 1 ",
        "(b) the protection of public health and safety; (c) the protection of the environment; (d) land use and siting; (e) the use of public ground; (f) energy efficiency; (g) the nature of the primary sources; (h) the characteristics particular to the applicant, such as techni\u00ad cal, economic and financial capabilities; (i) compliance with measures adopted pursuant to Article 3; (j) the contribution of the generating capacity to meeting the overall Community target of at least a 20 % share of energy from renewable sources in the Community\u2019s gross final con\u00ad sumption of energy in 2020 referred to in Article 3(1) of Directive 2009/28/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 April 2009 on the promotion of the use of energy from renewable sources ( 1 ) OJ L 140, 5.6.2009, p. 16. ( an (k) the contribution of generating capacity to reducing emissions. 3. Member States shall ensure that specific authorisation pro\u00ad cedures exist for small decentralised and/or distributed generation, which take into account their limited size and potential impact. Member States may set guidelines for that specific authorisation procedure. National regulatory authorities or other competent national authorities including planning authorities shall review those guidelines and may recommend amendments thereto. Where Member States have established particular land use permit procedures applying to major new infrastructure projects in gen\u00ad eration capacity, Member States shall, where appropriate, include the construction of new generation capacity within the scope of those procedures and shall implement them in a non- discriminatory manner and within an appropriate time-frame. 4. The authorisation procedures and criteria shall be made public. Applicants shall be informed of the reasons for any refusal to grant an authorisation. Those reasons shall be objective, non- discriminatory, well-founded and duly substantiated. Appeal pro\u00ad cedures shall be made available to the applicant. Article 8 Tendering for new capacity 1. Member States shall ensure the possibility, in the interests of security of supply, of providing for new capacity or energy efficiency/demand-side management measures through a tender\u00ad ing procedure or any procedure equivalent in terms of transpar\u00ad ency and non-discrimination, on the basis of published criteria. Those procedures may, however, be launched only where, on the basis of the authorisation procedure, the generating capacity to be built or the energy efficiency/demand-side management measures to be taken are insufficient to ensure security of supply. 2. Member States may ensure the possibility, in the interests of environmental protection and the promotion of infant new tech\u00ad nologies, of tendering for new capacity on the basis of published criteria. Such tendering may relate to new capacity or to energy efficiency/demand-side management measures. A tendering pro\u00ad cedure may, however, be launched only where, on the basis of the authorisation procedure the generating capacity to be built or the measures to be taken, are insufficient to achieve those objectives. 3. Details of the tendering procedure for means of generating capacity and energy efficiency/demand-side management mea\u00ad sures shall be published in the Official Journal of the European Union at least six months prior to the closing date for tenders. The tender specifications shall be made available to any interested undertaking established in the territory of a Member State so that it has sufficient time in which to submit a tender. With a view to ensuring transparency and non-discrimination, the tender specifications shall contain a detailed description of the contract specifications and of the procedure to be followed by all tenderers and an exhaustive list of criteria governing the selection of tenderers and the award of the contract, including incentives, such as subsidies, which are covered by the tender. Those speci\u00ad fications may also relate to the fields referred to in Article 7(2). 4. In invitations to tender for the requisite generating capac\u00ad ity, consideration must also be given to electricity supply offers with long-term guarantees from existing generating units, pro\u00ad vided that additional requirements can be met in this way. 5. Member States shall designate an authority or a public or private body independent from electricity generation, transmis\u00ad sion, distribution and supply activities, which may be a regula\u00ad tory authority referred to in Article 35(1), to be responsible for the organisation, monitoring and control of the tendering proce\u00ad dure referred to in paragraphs 1 to 4 of this Article. Where a transmission system operator is fully independent from other activities not relating to the transmission system in ownership terms, the transmission system operator may be designated as the body responsible for organising, monitoring and controlling the tendering procedure. That authority or body shall take all neces\u00ad sary steps to ensure confidentiality of the information contained in the tenders. 7 6 / 1 1 2 L n o i n U n a e p o r u E e h t f o l a n r u o J l a i c i f f O N E 9 0 0 2 . 8 . 4 1 d ; ) 1 ",

Member States may allow for derogations from points (b) and (c) of paragraph 1 until 3 March 2013, provided that trans\u00ad mission system operators are not part of a vertically integrated undertaking. 5. The obligation set out in paragraph 1(a) shall be deemed to be fulfilled in a situation where two or more undertakings which own transmission systems have created a joint venture which acts as a transmission system operator in two or more Member States for the transmission systems concerned. No other undertaking may be part of the joint venture, unless it has been approved under Article 13 as an independent system operator or as an inde\u00ad pendent transmission operator for the purposes of Chapter V. 6. For the implementation of this Article, where the person referred to in points (b), (c) and (d) of paragraph 1 is the Member State or another public body, two separate public bodies exercis\u00ad ing control over a transmission system operator or over a trans\u00ad mission system on the one hand, and over an undertaking performing any of the functions of generation or supply on the other, shall be deemed not to be the same person or persons. 7. Member States shall ensure that neither commercially sen\u00ad sitive information referred to in Article 16 held by a transmission system operator which was part of a vertically integrated under\u00ad taking, nor the staff of such a transmission system operator, is transferred to undertakings performing any of the functions of generation and supply. 8. Where on 3 September 2009, the transmission system belongs to a vertically integrated undertaking a Member State may decide not to apply paragraph 1. In such case, the Member State concerned shall either: (a) designate an independent system operator in accordance with Article 13; or (b) comply with the provisions of Chapter V. 9. Where, on 3 September 2009, the transmission system belongs to a vertically integrated undertaking and there are arrangements in place which guarantee more effective indepen\u00ad dence of the transmission system operator than the provisions of Chapter V, a Member State may decide not to apply paragraph 1. 10. Before an undertaking is approved and designated as a transmission system operator under paragraph 9 of this Article, it shall be certified according to the procedures laid down in Article 10(4), (5) and (6) of this Directive and in Article 3 of Regu\u00ad lation (EC) No 714/2009, pursuant to which the Commission shall verify that the arrangements in place clearly guarantee more effective independence of the transmission system operator than the provisions of Chapter V. 9 0 0 2 . 8 . 4 1 n o i n U n a e p o r u E e h t f o l a n r u o J l a i c i f f O N E 8 6 / 1 1 2 L r t \u2018 s m e t e h d , ) 1 ",

Undertakings performing any of the functions of genera\u00ad tion or supply shall not in any event be able to directly or indi\u00ad rectly take control over or exercise any right over unbundled transmission system operators in Member States which apply paragraph 1. Article 10 Designation and certification of transmission system operators 1. Before an undertaking is approved and designated as trans\u00ad mission system operator, it shall be certified according to the pro\u00ad cedures laid down in paragraphs 4, 5 and 6 of this Article and in Article 3 of Regulation (EC) No 714/2009. 2. Undertakings which own a transmission system and which have been certified by the national regulatory authority as having complied with the requirements of Article 9, pursuant to the cer\u00ad tification procedure below, shall be approved and designated as transmission system operators by Member States. The designation of transmission system operators shall be notified to the Commis\u00ad sion and published in the Official Journal of the European Union . 3. Transmission system operators shall notify to the regulatory authority any planned transaction which may require a reassess\u00ad ment of their compliance with the requirements of Article 9. 4. Regulatory authorities shall monitor the continuing com\u00ad pliance of transmission system operators with the requirements of Article 9. They shall open a certification procedure to ensure such compliance: (a) upon notification by the transmission system operator pur\u00ad suant to paragraph 3; (b) on their own initiative where they have knowledge that a planned change in rights or influence over transmission sys\u00ad tem owners or transmission system operators may lead to an infringement of Article 9, or where they have reason to believe that such an infringement may have occurred; or (c) upon a reasoned request from the Commission. 5. The regulatory authorities shall adopt a decision on the cer\u00ad tification of a transmission system operator within a period of four months from the date of the notification by the transmission system operator or from the date of the Commission request. After expiry of that period, the certification shall be deemed to be granted. The explicit or tacit decision of the regulatory authority shall become effective only after the conclusion of the procedure set out in paragraph 6. 6. The explicit or tacit decision on the certification of a trans\u00ad mission system operator shall be notified without delay to the Commission by the regulatory authority, together with all the rel\u00ad evant information with respect to that decision. The Commission shall act in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 3 of Regulation (EC) No 714/2009. 7. The regulatory authorities and the Commission may request from transmission system operators and undertakings perform\u00ad ing any of the functions of generation or supply any information relevant for the fulfilment of their tasks under this Article. 8. Regulatory authorities and the Commission shall preserve the confidentiality of commercially sensitive information. Article 11 Certification in relation to third countries 1. Where certification is requested by a transmission system owner or a transmission system operator which is controlled by a person or persons from a third country or third countries, the regulatory authority shall notify the Commission. The regulatory authority shall also notify to the Commission without delay any circumstances that would result in a person or persons from a third country or third countries acquiring control of a transmission system or a transmission system operator. 2. The transmission system operator shall notify to the regu\u00ad latory authority any circumstances that would result in a person or persons from a third country or third countries acquiring con\u00ad trol of the transmission system or the transmission system operator. 3. The regulatory authority shall adopt a draft decision on the certification of a transmission system operator within four months from the date of notification by the transmission system operator. It shall refuse the certification if it has not been demonstrated: (a) that the entity concerned complies with the requirements of Article 9; and (b) to the regulatory authority or to another competent author\u00ad ity designated by the Member State that granting certification will not put at risk the security of energy supply of the Mem\u00ad ber State and the Community. In considering that question the regulatory authority or other competent authority so des\u00ad ignated shall take into account: (i) the rights and obligations of the Community with respect to that third country arising under international law, including any agreement concluded with one or more third countries to which the Community is a party and which addresses the issues of security of energy supply; N E 9 0 0 2 . 8 . 4 1 ",

Member States shall provide for the regulatory authority or the designated competent authority referred to in paragraph 3(b), before the regulatory authority adopts a decision on the certifica\u00ad tion, to request an opinion from the Commission on whether: (a) the entity concerned complies with the requirements of Article 9; and (b) granting certification will not put at risk the security of energy supply to the Community. 6. The Commission shall examine the request referred to in paragraph 5 as soon as it is received. Within a period of two months after receiving the request, it shall deliver its opinion to the national regulatory authority or, if the request was made by the designated competent authority, to that authority. In preparing the opinion, the Commission may request the views of the Agency, the Member State concerned, and interested par\u00ad ties. In the event that the Commission makes such a request, the two-month period shall be extended by two months. In the absence of an opinion by the Commission within the period referred to in the first and second subparagraphs, the Commis\u00ad sion shall be deemed not to raise objections to the decision of the regulatory authority. 7. When assessing whether the control by a person or persons from a third country or third countries will put at risk the secu\u00ad rity of energy supply to the Community, the Commission shall take into account: (a) the specific facts of the case and the third country or third countries concerned; and (b) the rights and obligations of the Community with respect to that third country or third countries arising under interna\u00ad tional law, including an agreement concluded with one or more third countries to which the Community is a party and which addresses the issues of security of supply. 8.

Article 15 Dispatching and balancing 1. Without prejudice to the supply of electricity on the basis of contractual obligations, including those which derive from the tendering specifications, the transmission system operator shall, where it has such a function, be responsible for dispatching the generating installations in its area and for determining the use of interconnectors with other systems. 2. The dispatching of generating installations and the use of interconnectors shall be determined on the basis of criteria which shall be approved by national regulatory authorities where com\u00ad petent and which must be objective, published and applied in a non-discriminatory manner, ensuring the proper functioning of the internal market in electricity. The criteria shall take into account the economic precedence of electricity from available generating installations or interconnector transfers and the tech\u00ad nical constraints on the system. 3. A Member State shall require system operators to act in accordance with Article 16 of Directive 2009/28/EC when dis\u00ad patching generating installations using renewable energy sources. They also may require the system operator to give priority when dispatching generating installations producing combined heat and power. 4. A Member State may, for reasons of security of supply, direct that priority be given to the dispatch of generating instal\u00ad lations using indigenous primary energy fuel sources, to an extent not exceeding, in any calendar year, 15 % of the overall primary energy necessary to produce the electricity consumed in the Mem\u00ad ber State concerned. 5. The regulatory authorities where Member States have so provided or Member States shall require transmission system operators to comply with minimum standards for the mainte\u00ad nance and development of the transmission system, including interconnection capacity. 6. Transmission system operators shall procure the energy they use to cover energy losses and reserve capacity in their sys\u00ad tem according to transparent, non-discriminatory and market- based procedures, whenever they have such a function. 7. Rules adopted by transmission system operators for balanc\u00ad ing the electricity system shall be objective, transparent and non- discriminatory, including rules for charging system users of their networks for energy imbalance. The terms and conditions, includ\u00ad ing the rules and tariffs, for the provision of such services by transmission system operators shall be established pursuant to a methodology compatible with Article 37(6) in a non- discriminatory and cost-reflective way and shall be published. Article 16 Confidentiality for transmission system operators and transmission system owners 1. Without prejudice to Article 30 or any other legal duty to disclose information, each transmission system operator and each transmission system owner shall preserve the confidentiality of commercially sensitive information obtained in the course of car\u00ad rying out its activities, and shall prevent information about its own activities which may be commercially advantageous from being disclosed in a discriminatory manner. In particular it shall not disclose any commercially sensitive information to the remaining parts of the undertaking, unless this is necessary for carrying out a business transaction. In order to ensure the full respect of the rules on information unbundling, Member States shall ensure that the transmission system owner and the remain\u00ad ing part of the undertaking do not use joint services, such as joint legal services, apart from purely administrative or IT functions.

Those procedures shall be subject to the approval of national regulatory authorities. 2. The transmission system operator shall not be entitled to refuse the connection of a new power plant on the grounds of possible future limitations to available network capacities, such as congestion in distant parts of the transmission system. The trans\u00ad mission system operator shall supply necessary information. 3. The transmission system operator shall not be entitled to refuse a new connection point, on the ground that it will lead to additional costs linked with necessary capacity increase of system elements in the close-up range to the connection point. CHAPTER VI DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM OPERATION Article 24 Designation of distribution system operators Member States shall designate or shall require undertakings that own or are responsible for distribution systems to designate, for a period of time to be determined by Member States having regard to considerations of efficiency and economic balance, one or more distribution system operators. Member States shall ensure that distribution system operators act in accordance with Articles 25, 26 and 27. Article 25 Tasks of distribution system operators 1. The distribution system operator shall be responsible for ensuring the long-term ability of the system to meet reasonable demands for the distribution of electricity, for operating, main\u00ad taining and developing under economic conditions a secure, reli\u00ad able and efficient electricity distribution system in its area with due regard for the environment and energy efficiency. 2. In any event, it must not discriminate between system users or classes of system users, particularly in favour of its related undertakings. 3. The distribution system operator shall provide system users with the information they need for efficient access to, including use of, the system. 4. A Member State may require the distribution system opera\u00ad tor, when dispatching generating installations, to give priority to generating installations using renewable energy sources or waste or producing combined heat and power.

        "Official Journal of the European Union 14.8.2009 5. Each distribution system operator shall procure the energy it uses to cover energy losses and reserve capacity in its system according to transparent, non-discriminatory and market based procedures, whenever it has such a function. That requirement shall be without prejudice to using electricity acquired under con\u00ad tracts concluded before 1 January 2002. 6. Where a distribution system operator is responsible for bal\u00ad ancing the distribution system, rules adopted by it for that pur\u00ad pose shall be objective, transparent and non-discriminatory, including rules for the charging of system users of their networks for energy imbalance. Terms and conditions, including rules and tariffs, for the provision of such services by distribution system operators shall be established in accordance with Article 37(6) in a non-discriminatory and cost-reflective way and shall be published. 7. When planning the development of the distribution net\u00ad work, energy efficiency/demand-side management measures or distributed generation that might supplant the need to upgrade or replace electricity capacity shall be considered by the distribution system operator. Article 26 Unbundling of distribution system operators 1. Where the distribution system operator is part of a vertically integrated undertaking, it shall be independent at least in terms of its legal form, organisation and decision making from other activi\u00ad ties not relating to distribution. Those rules shall not create an obligation to separate the ownership of assets of the distribution system operator from the vertically integrated undertaking. 2. In addition to the requirements under paragraph 1, where the distribution system operator is part of a vertically integrated undertaking, it shall be independent in terms of its organisation and decision-making from the other activities not related to dis\u00ad tribution. In order to achieve this, the following minimum crite\u00ad ria shall apply: (a) those persons responsible for the management of the distri\u00ad bution system operator must not participate in company structures of the integrated electricity undertaking respon\u00ad sible, directly or indirectly, for the day-to-day operation of the generation, transmission or supply of electricity; (b) appropriate measures must be taken to ensure that the pro\u00ad fessional interests of the persons responsible for the manage\u00ad ment of the distribution system operator are taken into account in a manner that ensures that they are capable of act\u00ad ing independently; (c) the distribution system operator must have effective decision- making rights, independent from the integrated electricity undertaking, with respect to assets necessary to operate, maintain or develop the network. In order to fulfil those tasks, the distribution system operator shall have at its dis\u00ad posal the necessary resources including human, technical, physical and financial resources. This should not prevent the existence of appropriate coordination mechanisms to ensure that the economic and management supervision rights of the parent company in respect of return on assets, regulated indi\u00ad rectly in accordance with Article 37(6), in a subsidiary are protected. In particular, this shall enable the parent company to approve the annual financial plan, or any equivalent instrument, of the distribution system operator and to set global limits on the levels of indebtedness of its subsidiary. It shall not permit the parent company to give instructions regarding day-to-day operations, nor with respect to indi\u00ad vidual decisions concerning the construction or upgrading of distribution lines, that do not exceed the terms of the approved financial plan, or any equivalent instrument; and (d) the distribution system operator must establish a compliance programme, which sets out measures taken to ensure that discriminatory conduct is excluded, and ensure that obser\u00ad vance of it is adequately monitored. The compliance pro\u00ad gramme shall set out the specific obligations of employees to meet that objective. An annual report, setting out the mea\u00ad sures taken, shall be submitted by the person or body respon\u00ad sible for monitoring the compliance programme, the compliance officer of the distribution system operator, to the regulatory authority referred to in Article 35(1) and shall be published. The compliance officer of the distribution system operator shall be fully independent and shall have access to all the necessary information of the distribution system operator and any affiliated undertaking to fulfil his task. 3. Where the distribution system operator is part of a vertically integrated undertaking, the Member States shall ensure that the activities of the distribution system operator are monitored by regulatory authorities or other competent bodies so that it can\u00ad not take advantage of its vertical integration to distort competi\u00ad tion. In particular, vertically integrated distribution system operators shall not, in their communication and branding, create confusion in respect of the separate identity of the supply branch of the vertically integrated undertaking. 4. Member States may decide not to apply paragraphs 1, 2 and 3 to integrated electricity undertakings serving less than 100 000 connected customers, or serving small isolated systems. Article 27 Confidentiality obligation of distribution system operators Without prejudice to Article 30 or any other legal duty to disclose information, the distribution system operator must preserve the confidentiality of commercially sensitive information obtained in the course of carrying out its business, and shall prevent informa\u00ad tion about its own activities which may be commercially advan\u00ad tageous being disclosed in a discriminatory manner.

Member States may provide for national regulatory authori\u00ad ties or other competent authorities to classify a system which dis\u00ad tributes electricity within a geographically confined industrial, commercial or shared services site and does not, without preju\u00ad dice to paragraph 4, supply household customers, as a closed dis\u00ad tribution system if: (a) for specific technical or safety reasons, the operations or the production process of the users of that system are integrated; or (b) that system distributes electricity primarily to the owner or operator of the system or their related undertakings. 2. Member States may provide for national regulatory authori\u00ad ties to exempt the operator of a closed distribution system from: (a) the requirement under Article 25(5) to procure the energy it uses to cover energy losses and reserve capacity in its system according to transparent, non-discriminatory and market based procedures; (b) the requirement under Article 32(1) that tariffs, or the meth\u00ad odologies underlying their calculation, are approved prior to their entry into force in accordance with Article 37. 3. Where an exemption is granted under paragraph 2, the applicable tariffs, or the methodologies underlying their calcula\u00ad tion, shall be reviewed and approved in accordance with Article 37 upon request by a user of the closed distribution system. 4. Incidental use by a small number of households with employment or similar associations with the owner of the distri\u00ad bution system and located within the area served by a closed dis\u00ad tribution system shall not preclude an exemption under paragraph 2 being granted. Article 29 Combined operator Article 26(1) shall not prevent the operation of a combined trans\u00ad mission and distribution system operator provided that operator complies with Articles 9(1), or 13 and 14, or Chapter V or falls under Article 44(2).

Member States shall ensure the implementation of a system of third party access to the transmission and distribution systems based on published tariffs, applicable to all eligible customers and applied objectively and without discrimination between system users. Member States shall ensure that those tariffs, or the meth\u00ad odologies underlying their calculation, are approved prior to their entry into force in accordance with Article 37 and that those tar\u00ad iffs, and the methodologies \u2014 where only methodologies are approved \u2014 are published prior to their entry into force. 2. The transmission or distribution system operator may refuse access where it lacks the necessary capacity. Duly substantiated reasons must be given for such refusal, in particular having regard to Article 3, and based on objective and technically and economi\u00ad cally justified criteria. The regulatory authorities where Member States have so provided or Member States shall ensure that those criteria are consistently applied and that the system user who has been refused access can make use of a dispute settlement proce\u00ad dure. The regulatory authorities shall also ensure, where appro\u00ad priate and when refusal of access takes place, that the transmission or distribution system operator provides relevant information on measures that would be necessary to reinforce the network.

( Having regard to the opinion of the Committee of the Regions ( 2 ) OJ C 172, 5.7.2008, p. 55. ( Acting in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 251 of the Treaty ( 3 ) Opinion of the European Parliament of 9 July 2008 (not yet published in the Official Journal), Council Common Position of 9 January 2009 (OJ C 70 E, 24.3.2009, p. 37) and Position of the European Parliament of 22 April 2009 (not yet published in the Official Journal). Council Decision of 25 June 2009. ( Whereas: (1) The internal market in natural gas, which has been pro\u00ad gressively implemented throughout the Community since 1999, aims to deliver real choice for all consumers of the European Union, be they citizens or businesses, new busi\u00ad ness opportunities and more cross-border trade, so as to achieve efficiency gains, competitive prices, and higher standards of service, and to contribute to security of sup\u00ad ply and sustainability. (2) Directive 2003/55/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 26 June 2003 concerning common rules for the internal market in natural gas ( 4 ) OJ L 176, 15.7.2003, p. 57. ( a contribution towards the creation of such an internal mar\u00ad ket in natural gas. (3) The freedoms which the Treaty guarantees the citizens of the Union \u2014 inter alia , the free movement of goods, the freedom of establishment and the freedom to provide ser\u00ad vices \u2014 are achievable only in a fully open market, which enables all consumers freely to choose their suppliers and all suppliers freely to deliver to their customers. (4) However, at present, there are obstacles to the sale of gas on equal terms and without discrimination or disadvan\u00ad tages in the Community. In particular, non-discriminatory network access and an equally effective level of regulatory supervision in each Member State do not yet exist. (5) The Communication of the Commission of 10 January 2007 entitled \u2018An Energy Policy for Europe\u2019 highlighted the importance of completing the internal market in natural gas and of creating a level playing field for all natural gas undertakings established in the Community. The Commu\u00ad nications of the Commission of 10 January 2007 entitled \u2018Prospects for the internal gas and electricity market\u2019 and \u2018Inquiry pursuant to Article 17 of Regulation (EC) No 1/2003 into the European gas and electricity sectors (Final Report)\u2019 showed that the present rules and measures do not provide the necessary framework for achieving the objective of a well-functioning internal market. (6) Without effective separation of networks from activities of production and supply (effective unbundling), there is a risk of discrimination not only in the operation of the net\u00ad work but also in the incentives for vertically integrated undertakings to invest adequately in their networks. (7) The rules on legal and functional unbundling as provided for in Directive 2003/55/EC have not, however, led to effective unbundling of the transmission system operators. At its meeting on 8 and 9 March 2007, the European Council therefore invited the Commission to develop leg\u00ad islative proposals for the \u2018effective separation of supply and production activities from network operations\u2019. (8) Only the removal of the incentive for vertically integrated undertakings to discriminate against competitors as regards network access and investment can ensure effec\u00ad tive unbundling. Ownership unbundling, which implies the appointment of the network owner as the system operator and its independence from any supply and pro\u00ad duction interests, is clearly an effective and stable way to solve the inherent conflict of interests and to ensure secu\u00ad rity of supply. For that reason, the European Parliament, in its resolution of 10 July 2007 on prospects for the internal gas and electricity market ( 5 ) OJ C 175 E, 10.7.2008, p. 206. ( dling at transmission level as the most effective tool by which to promote investments in infrastructure in a non- discriminatory way, fair access to the network for new entrants and transparency in the market. Under ownership unbundling, Member States should therefore be required to ensure that the same person or persons are not entitled to exercise control over a production or supply undertaking 9 0 0 2 . 8 . 4 1 n o i n U n a e p o r u E e h t f o l a n r u o J l a i c i f f O N E 4 9 / 1 1 2 L - n u b n u p i h s r e n w o o t d e r r e f e r ) 5 t n a c i f i n g i s a e d a m s h ) 4 , ) 3 , ) 2 , ) 1 ",
        "and, at the same time, exercise control or any right over a transmission system operator or transmission system. Conversely, control over a transmission system or trans\u00ad mission system operator should preclude the possibility of exercising control or any right over a production or sup\u00ad ply undertaking. Within those limits, a production or sup\u00ad ply undertaking should be able to have a minority shareholding in a transmission system operator or trans\u00ad mission system. (9) Any system for unbundling should be effective in remov\u00ad ing any conflict of interests between producers, suppliers and transmission system operators, in order to create incentives for the necessary investments and guarantee the access of new market entrants under a transparent and effi\u00ad cient regulatory regime and should not create an overly onerous regulatory regime for national regulatory authorities. (10) The definition of the term \u2018control\u2019 is taken from Council Regulation (EC) No 139/2004 of 20 January 2004 on the control of concentrations between undertakings (the EC Merger Regulation) ( 1 ) OJ L 24, 29.1.2004, p. 1. ( (11) Since ownership unbundling requires, in some instances, the restructuring of undertakings, Member States that decide to implement ownership unbundling should be granted additional time to apply the relevant provisions. In view of the vertical links between the electricity and gas sectors, the unbundling provisions should apply across the two sectors. (12) Under ownership unbundling, to ensure full independence of network operation from supply and production inter\u00ad ests and to prevent exchanges of any confidential informa\u00ad tion, the same person should not be a member of the managing boards of both a transmission system operator or a transmission system and an undertaking performing any of the functions of production or supply. For the same reason, the same person should not be entitled to appoint members of the managing boards of a transmission system operator or a transmission system and to exercise control or any right over a production or supply undertaking. (13) The setting up of a system operator or a transmission operator that is independent from supply and production interests should enable a vertically integrated undertaking to maintain its ownership of network assets whilst ensur\u00ad ing an effective separation of interests, provided that such independent system operator or such independent transmission operator performs all the functions of a sys\u00ad tem operator and detailed regulation and extensive regula\u00ad tory control mechanisms are put in place. (14) Where, on 3 September 2009, an undertaking owning a transmission system is part of a vertically integrated under\u00ad taking, Member States should therefore be given a choice between ownership unbundling and setting up a system operator or transmission operator which is independent from supply and production interests. (15) To preserve fully the interests of the shareholders of verti\u00ad cally integrated undertakings, Member States should have the choice of implementing ownership unbundling either by direct divestiture or by splitting the shares of the inte\u00ad grated undertaking into shares of the network undertaking and shares of the remaining supply and production under\u00ad taking, provided that the requirements resulting from own\u00ad ership unbundling are complied with. (16) The full effectiveness of the independent system operator or independent transmission operator solutions should be ensured by way of specific additional rules. The rules on the independent transmission operator provide an appro\u00ad priate regulatory framework to guarantee fair competition, sufficient investment, access for new market entrants and the integration of gas markets. Effective unbundling through the independent transmission operator provisions should be based on a pillar of organisational measures and measures relating to the governance of transmission sys\u00ad tem operators and on a pillar of measures relating to investment, connecting new production capacities to the network and market integration through regional coopera\u00ad tion. The independence of the transmission operator should also, inter alia , be ensured through certain \u2018cooling- off\u2019 periods during which no management or other rel\u00ad evant activity giving access to the same information as could have been obtained in a managerial position is exer\u00ad cised in the vertically integrated undertaking. The indepen\u00ad dent transmission operator model of effective unbundling is in line with the requirements laid down by the European Council at its meeting on 8 and 9 March 2007. (17) In order to develop competition in the internal market in gas, large non-household customers should be able to choose their suppliers and enter into contracts with sev\u00ad eral suppliers to secure their gas requirements. Such cus\u00ad tomers should be protected against exclusivity clauses, the effect of which is to exclude competing or complementary offers. 5 9 / 1 1 2 L n o i n U n a e p o r u E e h t f o l a n r u o J l a i c i f f O N E 9 0 0 2 . 8 . 4 1 . ) 1 ",
        "Official Journal of the European Union 14.8.2009 (18) A Member State has the right to opt for full ownership unbundling in its territory. Where a Member State has exercised that right, an undertaking does not have the right to set up an independent system operator or an indepen\u00ad dent transmission operator. Furthermore, an undertaking performing any of the functions of production or supply cannot directly or indirectly exercise control or any right over a transmission system operator from a Member State that has opted for full ownership unbundling. (19) Under this Directive different types of market organisation will exist in the internal market in natural gas. The mea\u00ad sures that Member States could take in order to ensure a level playing field should be based on overriding require\u00ad ments of general interest. The Commission should be con\u00ad sulted on the compatibility of the measures with the Treaty and Community law. (20) The implementation of effective unbundling should respect the principle of non-discrimination between the public and private sectors. To that end, the same person should not be able to exercise control or any right, in violation of the rules of ownership unbundling or the independent system operator option, solely or jointly, over the composition, voting or decision of the bodies of both the transmission system operators or the transmission systems and the pro\u00ad duction or supply undertakings. With regard to ownership unbundling and the independent system operator solution, provided that the Member State in question is able to dem\u00ad onstrate that the requirement is complied with, two sepa\u00ad rate public bodies should be able to control production and supply activities on the one hand and transmission activities on the other. (21) Fully effective separation of network activities from sup\u00ad ply and production activities should apply throughout the Community to both Community and non-Community undertakings. To ensure that network activities and supply and production activities throughout the Community remain independent from each other, regulatory authori\u00ad ties should be empowered to refuse certification to trans\u00ad mission system operators that do not comply with the unbundling rules. To ensure the consistent application of those rules across the Community, the regulatory authori\u00ad ties should take utmost account of the Commission\u2019s opin\u00ad ion when the former take decisions on certification. To ensure, in addition, respect for the international obliga\u00ad tions of the Community and solidarity and energy security within the Community, the Commission should have the right to give an opinion on certification in relation to a transmission system owner or a transmission system operator which is controlled by a person or persons from a third country or third countries. (22) The security of energy supply is an essential element of public security and is therefore inherently connected to the efficient functioning of the internal market in gas and the integration of the isolated gas markets of Member States. Gas can reach the citizens of the Union only through the network. Functioning open gas markets and, in particular, the networks and other assets associated with gas supply are essential for public security, for the competitiveness of the economy and for the well-being of the citizens of the Union. Persons from third countries should therefore only be allowed to control a transmission system or a transmis\u00ad sion system operator if they comply with the requirements of effective separation that apply inside the Community. Without prejudice to the international obligations of the Community, the Community considers that the gas trans\u00ad mission system sector is of high importance to the Com\u00ad munity and therefore additional safeguards are necessary regarding the preservation of the security of supply of energy to the Community to avoid any threats to public order and public security in the Community and the wel\u00ad fare of the citizens of the Union. The security of supply of energy to the Community requires, in particular, an assess\u00ad ment of the independence of network operation, the level of the Community\u2019s and individual Member States\u2019 depen\u00ad dence on energy supply from third countries, and the treat\u00ad ment of both domestic and foreign trade and investment in energy in a particular third country. Security of supply should therefore be assessed in the light of the factual cir\u00ad cumstances of each case as well as the rights and obliga\u00ad tions arising under international law, in particular the international agreements between the Community and the third country concerned. Where appropriate the Commis\u00ad sion is encouraged to submit recommendations to negoti\u00ad ate relevant agreements with third countries addressing the security of supply of energy to the Community or to include the necessary issues in other negotiations with those third countries. (23) Further measures should be taken in order to ensure trans\u00ad parent and non-discriminatory tariffs for access to trans\u00ad port. Those tariffs should be applicable to all users on a non-discriminatory basis. Where a storage facility, linepack or ancillary service operates in a sufficiently competitive market, access could be allowed on the basis of transpar\u00ad ent and non-discriminatory market-based mechanisms. (24) It is necessary to ensure the independence of storage sys\u00ad tem operators in order to improve third-party access to storage facilities that are technically and/or economically necessary for providing efficient access to the system for the supply of customers. It is therefore appropriate that storage facilities are operated through legally separate enti\u00ad ties that have effective decision-making rights with respect to assets necessary to maintain, operate and develop stor\u00ad age facilities. It is also necessary to increase transparency in respect of the storage capacity that is offered to third par\u00ad ties, by obliging Member States to define and publish a N E 6 9 / 1 1 2 L ",
        "Official Journal of the European Union L 211/97 non-discriminatory, clear framework that determines the appropriate regulatory regime applicable to storage facili\u00ad ties. That obligation should not require a new decision on access regimes but should improve the transparency regarding the access regime to storage. Confidentiality requirements for commercially sensitive information are particularly important where data of a strategic nature are concerned or where there is only a single user of a storage facility. (25) Non-discriminatory access to the distribution network determines downstream access to customers at retail level. The scope for discrimination as regards third party access and investment, however, is less significant at distribution level than at transmission level where congestion and the influence of production interests are generally greater than at distribution level. Moreover, legal and functional unbun\u00ad dling of distribution system operators was required, pur\u00ad suant to Directive 2003/55/EC, only from 1 July 2007 and its effects on the internal market in natural gas still need to be evaluated. The rules on legal and functional unbundling currently in place can lead to effective unbundling pro\u00ad vided they are more clearly defined, properly implemented and closely monitored. To create a level playing field at retail level, the activities of distribution system operators should therefore be monitored so that they are prevented from taking advantage of their vertical integration as regards their competitive position on the market, in par\u00ad ticular in relation to household and small non-household customers. (26) Member States should take concrete measures to assist the wider use of biogas and gas from biomass, the producers of which should be granted non-discriminatory access to the gas system, provided that such access is compatible with the relevant technical rules and safety standards on an ongoing basis. (27) To avoid imposing a disproportionate financial and admin\u00ad istrative burden on small distribution system operators, Member States should be able, where necessary, to exempt the undertakings concerned from the legal distribution unbundling requirements. (28) Where a closed distribution system is used to ensure the optimal efficiency of an integrated energy supply requir\u00ad ing specific operational standards, or a closed distribution system is maintained primarily for the use of the owner of the system, it should be possible to exempt the distribu\u00ad tion system operator from obligations which would con\u00ad stitute an unnecessary administrative burden because of the particular nature of the relationship between the dis\u00ad tribution system operator and the users of the system. Industrial, commercial or shared services sites such as train station buildings, airports, hospitals, large camping sites with integrated facilities or chemical industry sites can include closed distribution systems because of the specia\u00ad lised nature of their operations. (29) Directive 2003/55/EC introduced a requirement for Mem\u00ad ber States to establish regulators with specific compe\u00ad tences. However, experience shows that the effectiveness of regulation is frequently hampered through a lack of inde\u00ad pendence of regulators from government, and insufficient powers and discretion. For that reason, at its meeting on 8 and 9 March 2007, the European Council invited the Com\u00ad mission to develop legislative proposals providing for fur\u00ad ther harmonisation of the powers and strengthening of the independence of national energy regulators. It should be possible for those national regulatory authorities to cover both the electricity and the gas sectors. (30) Energy regulators need to be able to take decisions in rela\u00ad tion to all relevant regulatory issues if the internal market in natural gas is to function properly, and to be fully inde\u00ad pendent from any other public or private interests. This precludes neither judicial review nor parliamentary super\u00ad vision in accordance with the constitutional law of the Member States. In addition, approval of the budget of the regulator by the national legislator does not constitute an obstacle to budgetary autonomy. The provisions relating to autonomy in the implementation of the allocated bud\u00ad get of the regulatory authority should be implemented within the framework defined by national budgetary law and rules. While contributing to the independence of the national regulatory authority from any political or eco\u00ad nomic interest through an appropriate rotation scheme, it should be possible for Member States to take due account of the availability of human resources and of the size of the board. (31) In order to ensure effective market access for all market players, including new entrants, non-discriminatory and cost-reflective balancing mechanisms are necessary. This should be achieved through the setting up of transparent market-based mechanisms for the supply and purchase of gas, needed in the framework of balancing requirements. National regulatory authorities should play an active role to ensure that balancing tariffs are non-discriminatory and cost-reflective. At the same time, appropriate incentives should be provided to balance the in-put and off-take of gas and not to endanger the system. N E 9 0 0 2 . 8 . 4 1 ",
        "(32) National regulatory authorities should be able to fix or approve tariffs, or the methodologies underlying the cal\u00ad culation of the tariffs, on the basis of a proposal by the transmission system operator or distribution system opera\u00ad tor(s) or liquefied natural gas (LNG) system operator, or on the basis of a proposal agreed between those operator(s) and the users of the network. In carrying out those tasks, national regulatory authorities should ensure that trans\u00ad mission and distribution tariffs are non-discriminatory and cost-reflective, and should take account of the long-term, marginal, avoided network costs from demand-side man\u00ad agement measures. (33) Energy regulators should have the power to issue binding decisions in relation to natural gas undertakings and to impose effective, proportionate and dissuasive penalties on natural gas undertakings which fail to comply with their obligations or to propose that a competent court impose such penalties on them. Energy regulators should also be granted the power to decide, irrespective of the application of competition rules, on appropriate measures ensuring customer benefits through the promotion of effective com\u00ad petition necessary for the proper functioning of the inter\u00ad nal market in natural gas. The establishment of gas-release programmes is one of the possible measures that can be used to promote effective competition and ensure the proper functioning of the market. Energy regulators should also be granted the powers to contribute to ensuring high standards of public service in compliance with market opening, to the protection of vulnerable customers, and to the full effectiveness of consumer protection measures. Those provisions should be without prejudice to both the Commission\u2019s powers concerning the application of com\u00ad petition rules including the examination of mergers with a Community dimension, and the rules on the internal mar\u00ad ket such as the free movement of capital. The independent body to which a party affected by the decision of a national regulator has a right to appeal could be a court or other tri\u00ad bunal empowered to conduct a judicial review. (34) Any harmonisation of the powers of national regulatory authorities should include the powers to provide incentives to natural gas undertakings and to impose effective, pro\u00ad portionate and dissuasive penalties on natural gas under\u00ad takings or to propose that a competent court impose such penalties. Moreover, regulatory authorities should have the power to request relevant information from natural gas undertakings, make appropriate and sufficient investiga\u00ad tions and settle disputes. (35) Investments in major new infrastructure should be strongly promoted while ensuring the proper functioning of the internal market in natural gas. In order to enhance the positive effect of exempted infrastructure projects on com\u00ad petition and security of supply, market interest during the project planning phase should be tested and congestion management rules should be implemented. Where an infrastructure is located in the territory of more than one Member State, the Agency for the Cooperation of Energy Regulators established by Regulation (EC) No 713/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 13 July 2009 establishing an Agency for the Cooperation of Energy Regulators ( 1 ) See page 1 of this Official Journal. ( \u2018Agency\u2019) should handle as a last resort the exemption request in order to take better account of its cross-border implications and to facilitate its admin\u00ad istrative handling. Moreover, given the exceptional risk profile of constructing those exempt major infrastructure projects, it should be possible temporarily to grant partial derogations to undertakings with supply and production interests in respect of the unbundling rules for the projects concerned. The possibility of temporary derogations should apply, for security of supply reasons, in particular, to new pipelines within the Community transporting gas from third countries into the Community. Exemptions granted under Directive 2003/55/EC continue to apply until the scheduled expiry date as decided in the granted exemption decision. (36) The internal market in natural gas suffers from a lack of liquidity and transparency hindering the efficient allocation of resources, risk hedging and new entry. Trust in the mar\u00ad ket, its liquidity and the number of market participants needs to increase, and, therefore, regulatory oversight of undertakings active in the supply of gas needs to be increased. Such requirements should be without prejudice to, and compatible with, existing Community law in rela\u00ad tion to the financial markets. Energy regulators and finan\u00ad cial market regulators need to cooperate in order to enable each other to have an overview of the markets concerned. (37) Natural gas is mainly, and increasingly, imported into the Community from third countries. Community law should take account of the characteristics of natural gas, such as certain structural rigidities arising from the concentration of suppliers, the long-term contracts or the lack of down\u00ad stream liquidity. Therefore, more transparency is needed, including in regard to the formation of prices. (38) Prior to the adoption by the Commission of Guidelines defining further the record-keeping requirements, the Agency and the Committee of European Securities Regu\u00ad lators (the \u2018CESR\u2019), established by Commission Decision 9 0 0 2 . 8 . 4 1 n o i n U n a e p o r u E e h t f o l a n r u o J l a i c i f f O N E 8 9 / 1 1 2 L e h t ( ) 1 ",

The Agency and the CESR should also cooperate to investigate further and advise on whether transactions in gas supply contracts and gas derivatives should be subject to pre- and/or post-trade transparency requirements and, if so, what the content of those requirements should be. (39) Member States or, where a Member State has so provided, the regulatory authority, should encourage the develop\u00ad ment of interruptible supply contracts. (40) In the interests of security of supply, the balance between supply and demand in individual Member States should be monitored, and such monitoring should be followed by a report on the situation at Community level, taking account of interconnection capacity between areas. Such monitor\u00ad ing should be carried out sufficiently early to enable appro\u00ad priate measures to be taken if security of supply is compromised. The construction and maintenance of the necessary network infrastructure, including interconnec\u00ad tion capacity, should contribute to ensuring a stable gas supply. (41) Member States should ensure that, taking into account the necessary quality requirements, biogas and gas from bio\u00ad mass or other types of gas are granted non-discriminatory access to the gas system, provided such access is perma\u00ad nently compatible with the relevant technical rules and safety standards. Those rules and standards should ensure that those gases can technically and safely be injected into, and transported through the natural gas system and should also address their chemical characteristics. (42) Long-term contracts will continue to be an important part of the gas supply of Member States and should be main\u00ad tained as an option for gas supply undertakings in so far as they do not undermine the objective of this Directive and are compatible with the Treaty, including the compe\u00ad tition rules. It is therefore necessary to take into account long-term contracts in the planning of supply and trans\u00ad port capacity of natural gas undertakings. (43) In order to ensure the maintenance of high standards of public service in the Community, all measures taken by Member States to achieve the objectives of this Directive should be regularly notified to the Commission. The Com\u00ad mission should regularly publish a report analysing mea\u00ad sures taken at national level to achieve public service objectives and comparing their effectiveness, with a view to making recommendations as regards measures to be taken at national level to achieve high public service stan\u00ad dards. Member States should ensure that when they are connected to the gas system customers are informed about their rights to be supplied with natural gas of a specified quality at reasonable prices. Measures taken by Member States to protect final customers may differ according to whether they are aimed at household customers or small and medium-sized enterprises. (44) Respect for the public service requirements is a fundamen\u00ad tal requirement of this Directive, and it is important that common minimum standards, respected by all Member States, are specified in this Directive, which take into account the objectives of common protection, security of supply, environmental protection and equivalent levels of competition in all Member States. It is important that the public service requirements can be interpreted on a national basis, taking into account national circumstances and subject to the respect of Community law. (45) It should be possible for measures implemented by Mem\u00ad ber States to achieve the objectives of social and economic cohesion to include, in particular, the provision of adequate economic incentives, using, where appropriate, all existing national and Community tools. It should be possible for such tools to include liability mechanisms to guarantee the necessary investment. (46) To the extent to which measures taken by Member States to fulfil public service obligations constitute State aid under Article 87(1) of the Treaty, there is an obligation under Article 88(3) of the Treaty to notify them to the Commission. (47) The public service requirements and the common mini\u00ad mum standards that follow from them need to be further strengthened to make sure that all consumers, especially vulnerable ones, can benefit from competition and fair prices. The public service requirements should be defined at national level, taking into account national circum\u00ad stances; Community law should, however, be respected by the Member States. The citizens of the Union and, where Member States deem it to be appropriate, small enterprises, should be able to enjoy public service obligations, in par\u00ad ticular with regard to security of supply and reasonable tar\u00ad iffs. A key aspect in supplying customers is access to objective and transparent consumption data. Thus, con\u00ad sumers should have access to their consumption data and associated prices and services costs so that they can invite competitors to make an offer based on those data. Con\u00ad sumers should also have the right to be properly informed about their energy consumption. Prepayments should reflect the likely consumption of natural gas and different payment systems should be non-discriminatory. Informa\u00ad tion on energy costs provided to consumers frequently enough will create incentives for energy savings because it will give customers direct feedback on the effects of invest\u00ad ment in energy efficiency and change of behaviour. 9 9 / 1 1 2 L n o i n U n a e p o r u E e h t f o l a n r u o J l a i c i f f O N E 9 0 0 2 . 8 . 4 1 n o i s s i m m o C e h t e s i v d a d n a r e f n o c d l u o h s , ) 1 ",
        "Official Journal of the European Union 14.8.2009 (48) Consumer interests should be at the heart of this Directive and quality of service should be a central responsibility of natural gas undertakings. Existing rights of consumers need to be strengthened and guaranteed, and should include greater transparency. Consumer protection should ensure that all consumers in the wider remit of the Com\u00ad munity benefit from a competitive market. Consumer rights should be enforced by Member States or, where a Member State has so provided, the regulatory authorities. (49) Clear and comprehensible information should be made available to consumers concerning their rights in relation to the energy sector. The Commission should establish, after consulting relevant stakeholders including Member States, national regulatory authorities, consumer organisa\u00ad tions and natural gas undertakings, an accessible, user- friendly energy consumer checklist providing consumers with practical information about their rights. That energy consumer checklist should be provided to all consumers and should be made publicly available. (50) Energy poverty is a growing problem in the Community. Member States which are affected and which have not yet done so should, therefore, develop national action plans or other appropriate frameworks to tackle energy poverty, aiming at decreasing the number of people suffering such situation. In any event, Member States should ensure the necessary energy supply for vulnerable customers. In doing so, an integrated approach, such as in the framework of social policy, could be used and measures could include social policies or energy efficiency improvements for hous\u00ad ing. At the very least, this Directive should allow national policies in favour of vulnerable customers. (51) Greater consumer protection is guaranteed by the availabil\u00ad ity of effective means of dispute settlement for all consum\u00ad ers. Member States should introduce speedy and effective complaint handling procedures. (52) It should be possible to base the introduction of intelligent metering systems on an economic assessment. Should that assessment conclude that the introduction of such meter\u00ad ing systems is economically reasonable and cost-effective only for consumers with a certain amount of gas consump\u00ad tion, Member States should be able to take this into account when implementing intelligent metering systems. (53) Market prices should give the right incentives for the devel\u00ad opment of the network. (54) Promoting fair competition and easy access for different suppliers should be of the utmost importance for Member States in order to allow consumers to take full advantage of the opportunities of a liberalised internal market in natural gas. (55) In order to contribute to security of supply whilst main\u00ad taining a spirit of solidarity between Member States, nota\u00ad bly in the event of an energy supply crisis, it is important to provide a framework for regional cooperation in a spirit of solidarity. Such cooperation may rely, if Member States so decide, first and foremost on market-based mechanisms. Cooperation for the promotion of regional and bilateral solidarity should not impose a disproportionate burden on or discriminate between market participants. (56) With a view to creating an internal market in natural gas, Member States should foster the integration of their national markets and the cooperation of system operators at Community and regional level, also incorporating the isolated systems forming gas islands that persist in the Community. (57) The development of a true internal market in natural gas, through a network connected across the Community, should be one of the main goals of this Directive and regu\u00ad latory issues on cross border interconnections and regional markets should, therefore, be one of the main tasks of the regulatory authorities, in close cooperation with the Agency where relevant. (58) Securing common rules for a true internal market and a broad supply of gas should also be one of the main goals of this Directive. To that end, undistorted market prices would provide an incentive for cross-border interconnec\u00ad tions while leading, in the long term, to price convergence. (59) The regulatory authorities should also provide information on the market to permit the Commission to exercise its role of observing and monitoring the internal market in natural gas and its short, medium and long-term evolution, including aspects such as supply and demand, transmis\u00ad sion and distribution infrastructure, quality of service, cross-border trade, congestion management, investments, wholesale and consumer prices, market liquidity and envi\u00ad ronmental and efficiency improvements. National regula\u00ad tory authorities should report to the competition authorities and the Commission those Member States in which prices impair competition and proper functioning of the market.

In accor\u00ad dance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in that Article, this Directive does not go beyond what is nec\u00ad essary in order to achieve that objective.

In order to ensure the independence of the transmission sys\u00ad tem owner and storage system operator referred to in para\u00ad graph 1, the following minimum criteria shall apply: (a) persons responsible for the management of the transmission system owner and storage system operator shall not partici\u00ad pate in company structures of the integrated natural gas undertaking responsible, directly or indirectly, for the day-to- day operation of the production and supply of natural gas; (b) appropriate measures shall be taken to ensure that the pro\u00ad fessional interests of persons responsible for the management of the transmission system owner and storage system opera\u00ad tor are taken into account in a manner that ensures that they are capable of acting independently; (c) the storage system operator shall have effective decision- making rights, independent from the integrated natural gas undertaking, with respect to assets necessary to operate, maintain or develop the storage facilities. This shall not pre\u00ad clude the existence of appropriate coordination mechanisms to ensure that the economic and management supervision rights of the parent company in respect of return on assets regulated indirectly in accordance with Article 41(6) in a sub\u00ad sidiary are protected. In particular, this shall enable the parent company to approve the annual financial plan, or any equivalent instrument, of the storage system operator and to set global limits on the levels of indebtedness of its subsid\u00ad iary. It shall not permit the parent company to give instruc\u00ad tions regarding day-to-day operations, nor with respect to individual decisions concerning the construction or upgrad\u00ad ing of storage facilities, that do not exceed the terms of the approved financial plan, or any equivalent instrument; and (d) the transmission system owner and the storage system opera\u00ad tor shall establish a compliance programme, which sets out measures taken to ensure that discriminatory conduct is excluded, and ensure that observance of it is adequately monitored. The compliance programme shall set out the spe\u00ad cific obligations of employees to meet those objectives. An annual report, setting out the measures taken, shall be sub\u00ad mitted by the person or body responsible for monitoring the compliance programme to the regulatory authority and shall be published. 3. The Commission may adopt Guidelines to ensure full and effective compliance of the transmission system owner and of the storage system operator with paragraph 2 of this Article. Those measures, designed to amend non-essential elements of this Direc\u00ad tive by supplementing it, shall be adopted in accordance with the regulatory procedure with scrutiny referred to in Article 51(3). Article 16 Confidentiality for transmission system operators and transmission system owners 1. Without prejudice to Article 30 or any other legal duty to disclose information, each transmission, storage and/or LNG sys\u00ad tem operator, and each transmission system owner, shall preserve the confidentiality of commercially sensitive information obtained in the course of carrying out its activities, and shall pre\u00ad vent information about its own activities which may be commer\u00ad cially advantageous from being disclosed in a discriminatory manner. In particular, it shall not disclose any commercially sen\u00ad sitive information to the remaining parts of the undertaking, unless this is necessary for carrying out a business transaction. In order to ensure the full respect of the rules on information unbun\u00ad dling, Member States shall ensure that the transmission system owner including, in the case of a combined operator, the distri\u00ad bution system operator, and the remaining part of the undertak\u00ad ing do not use joint services, such as joint legal services, apart from purely administrative or IT functions. 2.

Where a distribution system operator is responsible for bal\u00ad ancing the distribution system, rules adopted by it for that pur\u00ad pose shall be objective, transparent and non-discriminatory, including rules for the charging of system users for energy imbal\u00ad ance. Terms and conditions, including rules and tariffs, for the provision of such services by distribution system operators shall be established pursuant to a methodology compatible with Article 41(6) in a non-discriminatory and cost-reflective way and shall be published. Article 26 Unbundling of distribution system operators 1. Where the distribution system operator is part of a vertically integrated undertaking, it shall be independent at least in terms of its legal form, organisation and decision making from other activi\u00ad ties not relating to distribution. Those rules shall not create an obligation to separate the ownership of assets of the distribution system from the vertically integrated undertaking. 2. In addition to the requirements under paragraph 1, where the distribution system operator is part of a vertically integrated undertaking, it shall be independent in terms of its organisation and decision-making from the other activities not related to dis\u00ad tribution. In order to achieve this, the following minimum crite\u00ad ria shall apply: (a) those persons responsible for the management of the distri\u00ad bution system operator must not participate in company structures of the integrated natural gas undertaking respon\u00ad sible, directly or indirectly, for the day-to-day operation of the production, transmission and supply of natural gas; (b) appropriate measures must be taken to ensure that the pro\u00ad fessional interests of persons responsible for the management of the distribution system operator are taken into account in a manner that ensures that they are capable of acting independently; (c) the distribution system operator must have effective decision- making rights, independent from the integrated natural gas undertaking, with respect to assets necessary to operate, maintain or develop the network. In order to fulfil those tasks, the distribution system operator shall have at its dis\u00ad posal the necessary resources including human, technical, financial and physical resources. This should not prevent the existence of appropriate coordination mechanisms to ensure that the economic and management supervision rights of the parent company in respect of return on assets, regulated indi\u00ad rectly in accordance with Article 41(6) in a subsidiary are protected. In particular, this shall enable the parent company to approve the annual financial plan, or any equivalent instrument, of the distribution system operator and to set global limits on the levels of indebtedness of its subsidiary. It shall not permit the parent company to give instructions regarding day-to-day operations, nor with respect to indi\u00ad vidual decisions concerning the construction or upgrading of distribution lines, that do not exceed the terms of the approved financial plan, or any equivalent instrument; and (d) the distribution system operator must establish a compliance programme, which sets out measures taken to ensure that discriminatory conduct is excluded, and ensure that obser\u00ad vance of it is adequately monitored. The compliance pro\u00ad gramme shall set out the specific obligations of employees to meet that objective. An annual report, setting out the mea\u00ad sures taken, shall be submitted by the person or body respon\u00ad sible for monitoring the compliance programme, the compliance officer of the distribution system operator, to the regulatory authority referred to in Article 39(1) and shall be published. The compliance officer of the distribution system operator shall be fully independent and shall have access to all the necessary information of the distribution system operator and any affiliated undertaking to fulfil his task. 3. Where the distribution system operator is part of a vertically integrated undertaking, the Member States shall ensure that the activities of the distribution system operator are monitored by regulatory authorities or other competent bodies so that it can\u00ad not take advantage of its vertical integration to distort competi\u00ad tion. In particular, vertically integrated distribution system operators shall not, in their communication and branding, create confusion in respect of the separate identity of the supply branch of the vertically integrated undertaking. 4. Member States may decide not to apply paragraphs 1, 2 and 3 to integrated natural gas undertakings serving less than 100 000 connected customers. Article 27 Confidentiality obligations of distribution system operators 1. Without prejudice to Article 30 or any other legal duty to disclose information, each distribution system operator shall pre\u00ad serve the confidentiality of commercially sensitive information obtained in the course of carrying out its business, and shall pre\u00ad vent information about its own activities which may be commer\u00ad cially advantageous from being disclosed in a discriminatory manner. 2.

Member States may provide for national regulatory authori\u00ad ties to exempt the operator of a closed distribution system from the requirement under Article 32(1) that tariffs, or the method\u00ad ologies underlying their calculation, are approved prior to their entry into force in accordance with Article 41. 3. Where an exemption is granted under paragraph 2, the applicable tariffs, or the methodologies underlying their calcula\u00ad tion, shall be reviewed and approved in accordance with Article 41 upon request by a user of the closed distribution system. 4. Incidental use by a small number of households with employment or similar associations with the owner of the distri\u00ad bution system and located within the area served by a closed dis\u00ad tribution system shall not preclude an exemption under paragraph 2 being granted. Article 29 Combined operator Article 26(1) shall not prevent the operation of a combined trans\u00ad mission, LNG, storage and distribution system operator provided that operator complies with Articles 9(1), or 14 and 15, or Chap\u00ad ter IV or falls under Article 49(6).

Member States or any competent authority they designate, including the regulatory authorities referred to in Article 39(1) and the dispute settlement authorities referred to in Article 34(3), shall, insofar as necessary to carry out their functions, have right of access to the accounts of natural gas undertakings as set out in Article 31. 2. Member States and any designated competent authority, including the regulatory authorities referred to in Article 39(1) and the dispute settlement authorities, shall preserve the confiden\u00ad tiality of commercially sensitive information. Member States may provide for the disclosure of such information where this is nec\u00ad essary in order for the competent authorities to carry out their functions. Article 31 Unbundling of accounts 1. Member States shall take the necessary steps to ensure that the accounts of natural gas undertakings are kept in accordance with paragraphs 2 to 5 of this Article. Where natural gas under\u00ad takings benefit from a derogation from this provision on the basis of Article 49(2) and (4), they shall at least keep their internal accounts in accordance with this Article. 2. Natural gas undertakings, whatever their system of owner\u00ad ship or legal form, shall draw up, submit to audit and publish their annual accounts in accordance with the rules of national law concerning the annual accounts of limited liability companies adopted pursuant to the Fourth Council Directive 78/660/EEC of 25 July 1978 based on Article 44(2)(g) ( * ) The title of Directive 78/660/EEC has been adjusted to take account of the renumbering of the Articles of the Treaty establishing the Euro\u00ad pean Community in accordance with Article 12 of the Treaty of Amsterdam; the original reference was to Article 54(3)(g).

Natural gas undertakings shall, in their internal accounting, keep separate accounts for each of their transmission, distribu\u00ad tion, LNG and storage activities as they would be required to do if the activities in question were carried out by separate undertak\u00ad ings, with a view to avoiding discrimination, cross-subsidisation and distortion of competition. They shall also keep accounts, which may be consolidated, for other gas activities not relating to transmission, distribution, LNG and storage. Until 1 July 2007, they shall keep separate accounts for supply activities for eligible customers and supply activities for non-eligible customers. Rev\u00ad enue from ownership of the transmission or distribution network shall be specified in the accounts. Where appropriate, they shall keep consolidated accounts for other, non-gas activities.

Undertakings shall specify in their internal accounting the rules for the allocation of assets and liabilities, expenditure and income as well as for depreciation, without prejudice to nation\u00ad ally applicable accounting rules, which they follow in drawing up the separate accounts referred to in paragraph 3. Those internal rules may be amended only in exceptional cases. Such amend\u00ad ments shall be mentioned and duly substantiated. 6. The annual accounts shall indicate in notes any transaction of a certain size conducted with related undertakings. CHAPTER VII ORGANISATION OF ACCESS TO THE SYSTEM Article 32 Third-party access 1. Member States shall ensure the implementation of a system of third party access to the transmission and distribution system, and LNG facilities based on published tariffs, applicable to all eli\u00ad gible customers, including supply undertakings, and applied objectively and without discrimination between system users. Member States shall ensure that those tariffs, or the methodolo\u00ad gies underlying their calculation are approved prior to their entry into force in accordance with Article 41 by a regulatory authority referred to in Article 39(1) and that those tariffs \u2014 and the meth\u00ad odologies, where only methodologies are approved \u2014 are pub\u00ad lished prior to their entry into force. 2. Transmission system operators shall, if necessary for the purpose of carrying out their functions including in relation to cross-border transmission, have access to the network of other transmission system operators. 3. The provisions of this Directive shall not prevent the con\u00ad clusion of long-term contracts in so far as they comply with Com\u00ad munity competition rules Article 33 Access to storage 1. For the organisation of access to storage facilities and linepack when technically and/or economically necessary for pro\u00ad viding efficient access to the system for the supply of customers, as well as for the organisation of access to ancillary services, Mem\u00ad ber States may choose either or both of the procedures referred to in paragraphs 3 and 4. Those procedures shall operate in accor\u00ad dance with objective, transparent and non-discriminatory criteria. The regulatory authorities where Member States have so provided or Member States shall define and publish criteria according to which the access regime applicable to storage facilities and linepack may be determined. They shall make public, or oblige storage and transmission system operators to make public, which storage facilities, or which parts of those storage facilities, and which linepack is offered under the different procedures referred to in paragraphs 3 and 4. The obligation referred to in the second sentence of the second subparagraph shall be without prejudice to the right of choice granted to Member States in the first subparagraph. 2. The provisions of paragraph 1 shall not apply to ancillary services and temporary storage that are related to LNG facilities and are necessary for the re-gasification process and subsequent delivery to the transmission system. 3. In the case of negotiated access, Member States or, where Member States have so provided, the regulatory authorities shall take the necessary measures for natural gas undertakings and eli\u00ad gible customers either inside or outside the territory covered by the interconnected system to be able to negotiate access to stor\u00ad age facilities and linepack, when technically and/or economically necessary for providing efficient access to the system, as well as for the organisation of access to other ancillary services. The par\u00ad ties shall be obliged to negotiate access to storage, linepack and other ancillary services in good faith. Contracts for access to storage, linepack and other ancillary ser\u00ad vices shall be negotiated with the relevant storage system opera\u00ad tor or natural gas undertakings. The regulatory authorities where Member States have so provided or Member States shall require storage system operators and natural gas undertakings to publish their main commercial conditions for the use of storage, linepack and other ancillary services by 1 January 2005 and on an annual basis every year thereafter. When developing the conditions referred to in the second sub\u00ad paragraph, storage operators and natural gas undertakings shall consult system users. 4. In the case of regulated access, the regulatory authorities where Member States have so provided or Member States shall take the necessary measures to give natural gas undertakings and eligible customers either inside or outside the territory covered by the interconnected system a right to access to storage, linepack and other ancillary services, on the basis of published tariffs and/or other terms and obligations for use of that storage and linepack, when technically and/or economically necessary for providing efficient access to the system, as well as for the organi\u00ad sation of access to other ancillary services. The regulatory authori\u00ad ties where Member States have so provided or Member States shall consult system users when developing those tariffs or the methodologies for those tariffs. The right of access for eligible customers may be given by enabling them to enter into supply contracts with competing natural gas undertakings other than the owner and/or operator of the system or a related undertaking.

        "Official Journal of the European Union L 211/119 Article 34 Access to upstream pipeline networks 1. Member States shall take the necessary measures to ensure that natural gas undertakings and eligible customers, wherever they are located, are able to obtain access to upstream pipeline networks, including facilities supplying technical services inciden\u00ad tal to such access, in accordance with this Article, except for the parts of such networks and facilities which are used for local pro\u00ad duction operations at the site of a field where the gas is produced. The measures shall be notified to the Commission in accordance with the provisions of Article 54. 2. The access referred to in paragraph 1 shall be provided in a manner determined by the Member State in accordance with the relevant legal instruments. Member States shall apply the objec\u00ad tives of fair and open access, achieving a competitive market in natural gas and avoiding any abuse of a dominant position, tak\u00ad ing into account security and regularity of supplies, capacity which is or can reasonably be made available, and environmental protection. The following matters may be taken into account: (a) the need to refuse access where there is an incompatibility of technical specifications which cannot reasonably be overcome; (b) the need to avoid difficulties which cannot reasonably be overcome and could prejudice the efficient, current and planned future production of hydrocarbons, including that from fields of marginal economic viability; (c) the need to respect the duly substantiated reasonable needs of the owner or operator of the upstream pipeline network for the transport and processing of gas and the interests of all other users of the upstream pipeline network or relevant pro\u00ad cessing or handling facilities who may be affected; and (d) the need to apply their laws and administrative procedures, in conformity with Community law, for the grant of autho\u00ad risation for production or upstream development. 3. Member States shall ensure that they have in place dispute- settlement arrangements, including an authority independent of the parties with access to all relevant information, to enable dis\u00ad putes relating to access to upstream pipeline networks to be settled expeditiously, taking into account the criteria in para\u00ad graph 2 and the number of parties which may be involved in negotiating access to such networks. 4. In the event of cross-border disputes, the dispute-settlement arrangements for the Member State having jurisdiction over the upstream pipeline network which refuses access shall be applied. Where, in cross-border disputes, more than one Member State covers the network concerned, the Member States concerned shall consult each other with a view to ensuring that the provisions of this Directive are applied consistently. Article 35 Refusal of access 1. Natural gas undertakings may refuse access to the system on the basis of lack of capacity or where the access to the system would prevent them from carrying out the public service obliga\u00ad tions referred to in Article 3(2) which are assigned to them or on the basis of serious economic and financial difficulties with take- or-pay contracts having regard to the criteria and procedures set out in Article 48 and the alternative chosen by the Member State in accordance with paragraph 1 of that Article. Duly substanti\u00ad ated reasons shall be given for any such a refusal. 2. Member States may take the measures necessary to ensure that the natural gas undertaking refusing access to the system on the basis of lack of capacity or a lack of connection makes the necessary enhancements as far as it is economic to do so or when a potential customer is willing to pay for them. In circumstances where Member States apply Article 4(4), Member States shall take such measures. Article 36 New infrastructure 1. Major new gas infrastructure, i.e. interconnectors, LNG and storage facilities, may, upon request, be exempted, for a defined period of time, from the provisions of Articles 9, 32, 33 and 34 and Article 41(6), (8) and (10) under the following conditions: (a) the investment must enhance competition in gas supply and enhance security of supply; (b) the level of risk attached to the investment must be such that the investment would not take place unless an exemption was granted; (c) the infrastructure must be owned by a natural or legal per\u00ad son which is separate at least in terms of its legal form from the system operators in whose systems that infrastructure will be built; (d) charges must be levied on users of that infrastructure; and (e) the exemption must not be detrimental to competition or the effective functioning of the internal market in natural gas, or the efficient functioning of the regulated system to which the infrastructure is connected.

Paragraph 1 shall also apply to significant increases of capacity in existing infrastructure and to modifications of such infrastructure which enable the development of new sources of gas supply. 3. The regulatory authority referred to in Chapter VIII may, on a case-by-case basis, decide on the exemption referred to in para\u00ad graphs 1 and 2. 4. Where the infrastructure in question is located in the terri\u00ad tory of more than one Member State, the Agency may submit an advisory opinion to the regulatory authorities of the Member States concerned, which may be used as a basis for their decision, within two months from the date on which the request for exemption was received by the last of those regulatory authorities. Where all the regulatory authorities concerned agree on the request for exemption within six months of the date on which it was received by the last of the regulatory authorities, they shall inform the Agency of their decision. The Agency shall exercise the tasks conferred on the regulatory authorities of the Member States concerned by the present Article: (a) where all regulatory authorities concerned have not been able to reach an agreement within a period of six months from the date on which the request for exemption was received by the last of those regulatory authorities; or (b) upon a joint request from the regulatory authorities concerned. All regulatory authorities concerned may, jointly, request that the period referred to in point (a) of the third subparagraph is extended by up to three months. 5. Before taking a decision, the Agency shall consult the rel\u00ad evant regulatory authorities and the applicants. 6. An exemption may cover all or part of the capacity of the new infrastructure, or of the existing infrastructure with signifi\u00ad cantly increased capacity. In deciding to grant an exemption, consideration shall be given, on a case-by-case basis, to the need to impose conditions regard\u00ad ing the duration of the exemption and non-discriminatory access to the infrastructure. When deciding on those conditions, account shall, in particular, be taken of the additional capacity to be built or the modification of existing capacity, the time horizon of the project and national circumstances. Before granting an exemption, the regulatory authority shall decide upon the rules and mechanisms for management and allo\u00ad cation of capacity. The rules shall require that all potential users of the infrastructure are invited to indicate their interest in con\u00ad tracting capacity before capacity allocation in the new infrastruc\u00ad ture, including for own use, takes place. The regulatory authority shall require congestion management rules to include the obliga\u00ad tion to offer unused capacity on the market, and shall require users of the infrastructure to be entitled to trade their contracted capacities on the secondary market. In its assessment of the cri\u00ad teria referred to in points (a), (b) and (e) of paragraph 1, the regu\u00ad latory authority shall take into account the results of that capacity allocation procedure. The exemption decision, including any conditions referred to in the second subparagraph of this paragraph, shall be duly reasoned and published. 7. Notwithstanding paragraph 3, Member States may provide that their regulatory authority or the Agency, as the case may be, shall submit, for the purposes of the formal decision, to the rel\u00ad evant body in the Member State its opinion on the request for an exemption. That opinion shall be published together with the decision. 8. The regulatory authority shall transmit to the Commission, without delay, a copy of every request for exemption as of its receipt. The decision shall be notified, without delay, by the com\u00ad petent authority to the Commission, together with all the relevant information with respect to the decision. That information may be submitted to the Commission in aggregate form, enabling the Commission to reach a well-founded decision. In particular, the information shall contain: (a) the detailed reasons on the basis of which the regulatory authority, or Member State, granted or refused the exemp\u00ad tion together with a reference to paragraph 1 including the relevant point or points of that paragraph on which such decision is based, including the financial information justify\u00ad ing the need for the exemption; (b) the analysis undertaken of the effect on competition and the effective functioning of the internal market in natural gas resulting from the grant of the exemption; (c) the reasons for the time period and the share of the total capacity of the gas infrastructure in question for which the exemption is granted; (d) in case the exemption relates to an interconnector, the result of the consultation with the regulatory authorities concerned; and (e) the contribution of the infrastructure to the diversification of gas supply.

Within a period of two months from the day following the receipt of a notification, the Commission may take a decision requiring the regulatory authority to amend or withdraw the deci\u00ad sion to grant an exemption. That two-month period may be extended by an additional period of two months where further information is sought by the Commission. That additional period shall begin on the day following the receipt of the complete infor\u00ad mation. The initial two-month period may also be extended with the consent of both the Commission and the regulatory authority. Where the requested information is not provided within the period set out in the request, the notification shall be deemed to be withdrawn unless, before the expiry of that period, either the period has been extended with the consent of both the Commis\u00ad sion and the regulatory authority, or the regulatory authority, in a duly reasoned statement, has informed the Commission that it considers the notification to be complete. The regulatory authority shall comply with the Commission deci\u00ad sion to amend or withdraw the exemption decision within a period of one month and shall inform the Commission accordingly.

In fixing or approving the tariffs or methodologies and the balancing services, the regulatory authorities shall ensure that transmission and distribution system operators are granted appro\u00ad priate incentive, over both the short and long term, to increase efficiencies, foster market integration and security of supply and support the related research activities. 9. The regulatory authorities shall monitor congestion man\u00ad agement of national gas transmission networks including inter\u00ad connectors, and the implementation of congestion management rules. To that end, transmission system operators or market operators shall submit their congestion management rules, including capacity allocation, to the national regulatory authori\u00ad ties. National regulatory authorities may request amendments to those rules. 10. Regulatory authorities shall have the authority to require transmission, storage, LNG and distribution system operators, if necessary, to modify the terms and conditions, including tariffs and methodologies referred to in this Article, to ensure that they are proportionate and applied in a non-discriminatory manner. In the event that the access regime to storage is defined according to Article 33(3), that task shall exclude the modification of tariffs. In the event of delay in the fixing of transmission and distribution tariffs, regulatory authorities shall have the power to fix or approve provisional transmission and distribution tariffs or meth\u00ad odologies and to decide on the appropriate compensatory mea\u00ad sures if the final tariffs or methodologies deviate from those provisional tariffs or methodologies. 11. Any party having a complaint against a transmission, stor\u00ad age, LNG or distribution system operator in relation to that opera\u00ad tor\u2019s obligations under this Directive may refer the complaint to the regulatory authority which, acting as dispute settlement authority, shall issue a decision within a period of two months after receipt of the complaint. That period may be extended by two months where additional information is sought by the regu\u00ad latory authorities. That extended period may be further extended with the agreement of the complainant. The regulatory authori\u00ad ty\u2019s decision shall have binding effect unless and until overruled on appeal. 12. Any party who is affected and who has a right to complain concerning a decision on methodologies taken pursuant to this Article or, where the regulatory authority has a duty to consult, concerning the proposed tariffs or methodologies, may, at the lat\u00ad est within two months, or a shorter time period as provided by Member States, following publication of the decision or proposal for a decision, submit a complaint for review.

Article 48 Derogations in relation to take-or-pay commitments 1. If a natural gas undertaking encounters, or considers it would encounter, serious economic and financial difficulties because of its take-or-pay commitments accepted in one or more gas-purchase contracts, it may send an application for a tempo\u00ad rary derogation from Article 32 to the Member State concerned or the designated competent authority. Applications shall, in accordance with the choice of Member States, be presented on a case-by-case basis either before or after refusal of access to the sys\u00ad tem. Member States may also give the natural gas undertaking the choice of presenting an application either before or after refusal of access to the system. Where a natural gas undertaking has refused access, the application shall be presented without delay. The applications shall be accompanied by all relevant information on the nature and extent of the problem and on the efforts under\u00ad taken by the natural gas undertaking to solve the problem. If alternative solutions are not reasonably available, and taking into account paragraph 3, the Member State or the designated competent authority may decide to grant a derogation. 2. The Member State, or the designated competent authority, shall notify the Commission without delay of its decision to grant a derogation, together with all the relevant information with respect to the derogation. That information may be submitted to the Commission in an aggregated form, enabling the Commission to reach a well-founded decision. Within eight weeks of receipt of that notification, the Commission may request that the Member State or the designated competent authority concerned amend or withdraw the decision to grant a derogation. If the Member State or the designated competent authority con\u00ad cerned does not comply with that request within a period of four weeks, a final decision shall be taken expeditiously in accordance with the advisory procedure referred to in Article 51(2). The Commission shall preserve the confidentiality of commer\u00ad cially sensitive information. 3. When deciding on the derogations referred to in para\u00ad graph 1, the Member State, or the designated competent author\u00ad ity, and the Commission shall take into account, in particular, the following criteria: (a) the objective of achieving a competitive gas market; (b) the need to fulfil public-service obligations and to ensure security of supply; (c) the position of the natural gas undertaking in the gas market and the actual state of competition in that market; (d) the seriousness of the economic and financial difficulties encountered by natural gas undertakings and transmission undertakings or eligible customers; (e) the dates of signature and terms of the contract or contracts in question, including the extent to which they allow for mar\u00ad ket changes; (f) the efforts made to find a solution to the problem; (g) the extent to which, when accepting the take-or-pay commit\u00ad ments in question, the undertaking could reasonably have foreseen, having regard to the provisions of this Directive, that serious difficulties were likely to arise; (h) the level of connection of the system with other systems and the degree of interoperability of those systems; and (i) the effects the granting of a derogation would have on the correct application of this Directive as regards the smooth functioning of the internal market in natural gas.

Such derogation shall expire from the moment when Cyprus is not qualifying as an emergent market. 3. On the date at which the derogation referred to in the first subparagraph of paragraph 2 expires, the definition of eligible customers shall result in an opening of the market equal to at least 33 % of the total annual gas consumption of the national gas market. Two years thereafter, Article 37(1)(b) shall apply, and three years thereafter, Article 37(1)(c) shall apply. Until Article 37(1)(b) applies the Member State referred to in para\u00ad graph 2 of this Article may decide not to apply Article 32 as far as ancillary services and temporary storage for the re-gasification process and its subsequent delivery to the transmission system are concerned. 4. Where the implementation of this Directive would cause substantial problems in a geographically limited area of a Mem\u00ad ber State, in particular concerning the development of the trans\u00ad mission and major distribution infrastructure, and with a view to encouraging investments, the Member State may apply to the Commission for a temporary derogation from Articles 4 and 9, Article 13(1) and (3), Articles 14 and 24, Article 25(5), Articles 26, 31 and 32, Article 37(1) and/or Article 38 for developments within that area. 5. The Commission may grant the derogation referred to in paragraph 4, taking into account, in particular, the following criteria: \u2014 the need for infrastructure investments, which would not be economic to operate in a competitive market environment, \u2014 the level and pay-back prospects of investments required, \u2014 the size and maturity of the gas system in the area concerned, \u2014 the prospects for the gas market concerned, \u2014 the geographical size and characteristics of the area or region concerned, and socioeconomic and demographic factors, For gas infrastructure other than distribution infrastructure, a derogation may be granted only if no gas infrastructure has been established in the area or if gas infrastructure has been established for less than 10 years. The temporary derogation shall not exceed 10 years from the time gas is first supplied in the area.
