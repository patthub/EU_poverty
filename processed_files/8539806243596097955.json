        "L A I F - C I F O P E R A T I O N A L R E P O R T 2 0 1 5 3 The Latin America Investment Facility (LAIF) and the Caribbean Investment Facility (CIF) are two of the EU\u2019s regional blending facilities, innovative fi- nancial instruments that use EU development grants to leverage additional investment from European and Regional Development Finance Institutions to implement key infrastructure and private sector support projects in part- ner countries. This report, which covers the Facilities\u2019 operational activities in 2015, pro- vides a detailed overview of projects funded in a wide range of sectors, from transport and energy, to water, sanitation and the environment. The report also describes how LAIF and CIF support the EU\u2019s development pri- orities in their respective regions by engaging with the private sector to ensure that development assistance has the widest possible impact and contributes to poverty eradication and to economic growth and job cre- ation. The Facilities also support policy objectives related to climate goals, with projects that contribute to partner countries\u2019 capacity to adapt to and mitigate the impacts of climate change. LAIF, which is funded under the EU\u2019s Development Cooperation Instrument (DCI), and CIF, financed from the European Development Fund (EDF), provide various kinds of grant funding for development projects: \u2022 Investment grants, which can finance specific project components (with, for example, social or environmental added-value) or a per- centage of the total project cost (thereby reducing the amount of debt for the partner country). \u2022 Technical assistance, which involves the provision of tailored assistance to meet specific project needs, both during project prepa- ration and implementation. This assistance helps ensure the quality, efficiency and long-term sustainability of a project and may ad- dress aspects related to the project-enabling environment or other aspects that are key for a project\u2019s successful implementation. \u2022 Risk sharing instruments, such as risk capital and guarantees, which allow the available funds to be used as efficiently as possible by reducing risks and unlocking additional financing. By mobilising the required investment, LAIF and CIF speed up the imple- mentation of development projects and ensure that their impact is both effective and socially-inclusive. The two Facilities contribute to leveraging the funds needed to finance capital-intensive infrastructure projects in key sectors which might otherwise be too large to finance using market instruments alone, or by Development Finance Institutions or beneficiary governments on their own. This report covers the fifth year of LAIF opera- tions and the second full year of operations for the CIF, following its launch in March 2013. L A I F C I F I N T R O D U C T I O N ",

        "L A I F - C I F O P E R A T I O N A L R E P O R T 2 0 1 5 5 Latin America and the Caribbean have made significant progress over the past decade in pro- moting inclusive economic growth and implementing programmes aimed at reducing poverty and improving the quality of life for all levels of society. However, despite the undeniable successes that have been achieved, social inequality is still a major challenge, requiring a concerted effort on the part of all stakeholders to achieve a sustainable solution. For the European Union international cooperation and development strategy, this has resulted in a growing recognition of the importance of social dimension in programmes and projects, and of the fact that economic cooperation between Europe, Latin America and the Caribbean needs to be conducted within a framework that ensures the protection and participation of the most vulnerable in the society. Within this context, when supporting business development and growth in Latin America and the Caribbean, the European Union prioritises investments that contribute to the ongoing process of inclusive growth and fight against inequality. This has resulted in a particular focus on programmes in energy, water and sanitation, transport and the environment, the benefits of which are strongly felt by the most disadvantaged in society. Support for small and medium-sized enterprises is also a priority. The development of this sector will play a key role in poverty reduction and in ensuring wider societal participation in economic growth. Small and medium-sized enterprises will remain a target for support in future projects too. By underpinning the European Union\u2019s international cooperation and development strategy in these regions, the Latin America Investment Facility (LAIF) and the Caribbean Investment Facility (CIF) provide the institutional framework within which the European Union can better help its partner countries to achieve the objectives of sustainable and inclusive development. Cooperation provided under LAIF and CIF is used to leverage funding from the development finance institutions and from private financiers, thereby increasing the impact in supporting sustainable development and private sector growth. At the EU-CELAC Business Summit in Brussels in June, I had the opportunity to announce \u20ac118 million of new EU funding for concrete projects in Latin America and the Caribbean, of which almost \u20ac82 million financed LAIF and CIF projects. In that context we also signed the Caribbean Regional Indicative Programme for the period 2014-2020, foreseeing an allocation to the CIF of \u20ac135 million. LAIF and CIF projects are having a significant positive impact on the lives of people in Latin America and the Caribbean. I have witnessed this myself last October, when I visited an inter- esting project to expand and improve water supply, sewage, waste water treatment and re-use systems in Lima that we co-finance through LAIF. However, the challenges that lie ahead are immense. By supporting projects that prioritise sustainable and inclusive development and by engaging the private sector, LAIF and CIF will continue to act as drivers of responsible invest- ment, bringing us closer to our common goals of prosperity and economic development, while respecting the principles of environmental sustainability and social equality.

        "L A I F - C I F O P E R A T I O N A L R E P O R T 2 0 1 5 7 ELIGIBLE EUROPEAN FINANCE INSTITUTIONS REGIONAL FINANCE INSTITUTIONS Multilateral European Finance Institutions: European Investment Bank (EIB) and Nordic Investment Bank (NIB). Bilateral Development Finance Institutions from EU Member States: Agence Fran\u00e7aise de D\u00e9veloppement (AFD), Agencia Espa\u00f1ola de Cooperaci\u00f3n Internacional para el Desarrollo (AECID), KfW Entwicklungsbank (KfW), Oesterreichische Entwicklungsbank AG (OeEB), Societ\u00e0 Italiana per le Imprese all\u2019Estero (SIMEST) and Sociedade para o Financiamento do Desenvolvimento (SOFID). Regional Development Banks: Central American Bank for Economic Integration (CABEI), CAF - Development Bank of Latin America (CAF) and Inter-American Development Bank (IDB). The primary objective of LAIF is to finance key infrastruc- ture projects in priority areas for sustainable socio-eco- nomic development such as transport, energy, water and the environment (including climate change mitigation and adaptation) as well as to support social programmes and private sector development, focussing on small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). LAIF\u2019s main purpose is to mobilise additional financing to support investment in Latin America, encouraging beneficiary governments and public institutions to carry out essential investment that could not be otherwise financed either by the market or by Development Finance Institutions alone. As part of its efforts to achieve this objective, LAIF pur- sues three cross-cutting and mutually-reinforcing strategic objectives: \u2022 Improving interconnectivity between and within Latin American countries via better energy and transport infrastructure, including energy efficiency, renewable energy systems, and sustainable trans- port and communications networks. \u2022 Increasing environmental protection and supporting climate change adaptation and mitigation actions in partner countries. \u2022 Promoting equitable and sustainable socio-economic development through the improvement of social service infrastructure and support to SMEs. LAIF\u2019s total budget for the period 2010-2015 was circa \u20ac270 million, made available under the EU\u2019s Development Cooperation Instrument (DCI). The total budget includes \u20ac50 million earmarked for Nicaragua and \u20ac17.3 million earmarked for specific climate change projects. Since its launch, LAIF has contributed \u20ac232 million in grants to projects representing a combined investment of circa \u20ac6.9 billion. LAIF acts as a catalyst to aggregate resources from various sources and improve the coordination and coherence of donor actions, thus conforming to the principles of owner- ship, partnership and shared responsibilities set out in the Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness and the subsequent Accra Agenda for Action. LAIF projects are fully aligned with the economic, environmental and social objectives of the Sustainable Development Goals agreed in September 2015 and help underpin the EU\u2019s role as a driver of so- cially-inclusive and environmentally-aware development in Latin America. By delivering on concrete initiatives that have real im- pacts on people\u2019s lives, LAIF has strengthened the EU\u2019s profile as a leading cooperation and development part- ner in Latin America. LAIF has provoked a very positive response from partner countries, EU Member States and Finance Institutions. ",

The total EU budget allocated to LAIF is around \u20ac270 million. The first LAIF operation in Honduras was approved. The LAIF contribution to the eco.business Fund was announced at COP21 in Paris. Of the four contributions approved in 2015 All contributions can be reported as climate action according to the Rio Convention on Climate Change. Three contributions support projects with a regional scope. The project \u201cCities and Climate Change\u201d will accompany Latin American cities in the definition and implementation of sustainable urban strategies and the financing of climate-friendly investments. The contribution to the eco.business Fund represents LAIF\u2019s first risk capital operation. The contribution to the Geothermal Development Facility will support the mitigation of resource risk during exploratory drilling through \u201ccontingency grants\u201d.

        "L A I F - C I F O P E R A T I O N A L R E P O R T 2 0 1 5 1 1 H I G H L I G H T S 2 0 1 5 The EU is currently the most important de- velopment partner and foreign investor in Latin America and is one of its main trading partners. During the last two decades, Latin America has made remarkable achieve- ments in terms of consolidation of democra- cy, growth and employment creation as well as poverty reduction. The EU has contributed to this progress, and will continue to be a reliable partner for Latin America, support- ing the region as it tackles the challenges it faces, including poverty and inequality. EU development cooperation instruments, targeting inclusive growth, security and rule of law, energy, climate change and sustain- able development, have been a crucial build- ing block of the EU relationship with Latin America, alongside political engagement, trade and investment. Since its launch at the 6th EU-Latin American and Caribbean (EU-LAC) Summit in 2010, LAIF has played an essential role in boosting financial resources for development in Latin America. By adding grant elements to loan funding from leading European Development Finance Institutions and Latin American Regional Development Banks, LAIF has con- tributed to securing and mobilising funds for major infrastructure and private sector sup- port projects at national and regional level. LAIF contributes to achieving the objectives of the DCI and its Regional Strategy for Latin America, complementing other regional pro- grammes such as EUROCLIMA, EUROsociAL, RALCEA and AL-INVEST. Its key priorities are to improve interconnectivity between and within the Latin American countries, in particular by establishing better energy and transport infrastructure, increasing en- vironmental protection, combatting climate change and supporting the development of the private sector, especially SMEs. In 2015, four LAIF contributions for a total amount of \u20ac45.2 million were approved, supporting projects with a total investment cost of around \u20ac1.65 billion in energy and transport as well as urban and private sector development. These contributions were an- nounced at the EU-CELAC Business Summit in Brussels in June 2015. Combatting climate change, a major EU policy priority, was a significant cross-cutting theme in 2015. Three of the four LAIF contri- butions approved in 2015 were reported as Rio Marker 2, which means that their contri- bution to the climate change mitigation and/ or adaptation objectives of the Rio Convention on Climate Change represents their principal objective. The eco.business Fund, aiming to promote sustainable business practices that contribute to biodiversity conservation and the sustainable use of natural resources in Latin America, was launched at the 21st Session of the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP21) in Paris. The LAIF contribution to Sustainable Cities and Climate Change, a project to assist Latin American cities in defining and implement- ing low-carbon and climate-resilient urban strategies and financing climate-friendly investments, was signed at the \u201cCAF Day\u201d on the sidelines of the COP21. The Geothermal Development Facility was launched at the COP20 in Lima in 2014. L A I F Supporting EU policy initiatives in Latin America ",
        "Moreover, in 2015 the first LAIF op- eration in Honduras was approved. Though the rehabilitation and upgrading of road sections along the Western Corridor, the Honduras Sustainable Roads project will have positive social and economic impacts and will foster trade and regional integration. Since its launch, LAIF has made considerable progress in support- ing large-scale operations through a range of Finance Institutions, improving donor coordination, har- monising procedures and avoiding duplication of efforts. Its approach is in line with the EU\u2019s commitments to enhance aid delivery as set down in the Paris Declaration and the Accra Agenda for Action. A key factor in the success of LAIF has been the participation of the Latin American Regional Development Banks, which has boosted partnerships and cooperation between them and the European Development Finance Institutions.

OV E RV I E W Four LAIF contributions for a total amount of \u20ac45.2 million were approved in 2015, in support to projects with a total investment cost of around \u20ac1.65 billion. In terms of geographical distribution of the LAIF support in 2015, three projects, representing a total LAIF contri- bution of \u20ac35.2 million (almost 78% of the total 2015 LAIF contribution), have a regional focus. The Geothermal Development Facility, to which LAIF contributed with an investment grant in 2015 in addition to a technical assis- tance grant provided in 2014, focuses on Central America and the Andean region. The countries participating in the Facility are Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Mexico and Nicaragua in Central America, and Bolivia, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador and Peru in the Andean region. The eco.business Fund, which promotes business prac- tices contributing to biodiversity conservation and the sustainable use of natural resources in Latin America, will initially target highly biodiverse countries such as Peru, Colombia, Ecuador and Central America (Costa Rica, Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador), with the aim of being subsequently extended to all other Latin American countries, if possible. The Sustainable Cities and Climate Change project focuses on several Latin American cities, supporting them in defining and implementing low-carbon and climate-resilient urban strategies and to finance cli- mate-friendly urban investments. The fourth operation approved in 2015, Honduras Sustainable Roads, is a bilateral project with cross-border components at sub-regional level. This first LAIF operation in Honduras involves rehabilitation, upgrading and imple- mentation of road safety improvements on road sections along the country\u2019s Western Corridor. Among others, the Western Corridor connects Honduras\u2019 second biggest city, San Pedro Sula, with border crossings to Guatemala and El Salvador. The improvement in the transport linkages to those neighbouring countries as a consequence of the proj- ect will foster trade and regional integration. In terms of sectoral distribution, the four operations target four different sectors. The \u20ac16 million contribu- tion to the eco.business Fund (36% of the total 2015 LAIF contribution) supports private sector develop- ment, the \u20ac15 million investment grant provided to the Geothermal Development Facility (33% of the total 2015 LAIF contribution) targets the energy sector, the \u20ac10 million contribution to the Honduras Sustainable Roads project (22% of the total 2015 LAIF contribution) tar- gets transport and the \u20ac4.2 million grant to Sustainable Cities and Climate Change (9% of the total 2015 LAIF contribution) addresses urban development. * This is the number of approvals during the year, net of cancellations (three projects were cancelled). **These are projects for which an agreement was signed during the year, net of cancellations. In some cases more than one agreement was signed for the same project. ***These are projects where a disbursement took place during the year. ",
        "All the projects approved in 2015 can be reported as cli- mate action support according to the Rio Convention on Climate Change. The Geothermal Development Facility, the eco.business Fund and the Sustainable Cities and Climate Change project have climate change mitigation and/or adaptation as their principal objective, while for the Sustainable Roads project in Honduras climate change miti- gation and/or adaptation constitutes a significant objective. Concerning the type of support provided by LAIF in 2015, in- vestment grants accounted for \u20ac22 million (48.6%), \u20ac10.2 million took the form of technical assistance (22.6%) and \u20ac13 million of risk capital (28.8%). Two projects involve a combination of technical assistance with another form of support (an investment grant in the case of the Honduras Sustainable Roads project and a risk capital participation in the case of the eco.business Fund), while the other two operations approved in 2015 involve solely investment grant support (for the Geothermal Development Facility, to which LAIF had provided a grant in the form of techni- cal assistance in 2014) and technical assistance (for the Sustainable Cities and Climate Change project). Almost all the projects approved in 2015 involve both European Finance Institutions and Latin American Regional Development Banks. The eco.business Fund is in the cap- italisation phase and is open to various investors. The fi- nancial leverage of the LAIF contributions in 2015 is high, with \u20ac45.2 million leveraging around \u20ac1.65 billion, which implies that every euro provided by LAIF leveraged over \u20ac36 of investment. This figure reflects the large investment foreseen for the Geothermal Development Facility, which has a total budget of over \u20ac1 billion. 2 .

This demand has largely been met through an increased use of fossil fuels and, to a lesser extent, through hydro-pow- er which has become increasingly difficult to exploit for a variety of reasons, including climate uncertainty. In this situation, governments across the region are interested in developing geothermal energy. The Geothermal Development Facility aims to overcome barriers to the exploitation of Latin America\u2019s geother- mal energy potential, thereby improving energy security and lowering greenhouse gas emissions in the region. The Facility consists of three components. First, a tailored Geothermal Risk Mitigation Fund will be set up in order to facilitate project preparation through grants for surface and other relevant technical studies. The Geothermal Risk Mitigation Fund will also support the mitigation of resource risk during exploratory drilling in at least seven cases ",

Second, Geothermal Investment Financing Windows will provide anchor financing for subsequent investments during the production drilling and construction stages. Third, a Technical Assistance Forum will be set up to coordinate and potentially execute existing and planned technical assistance activities and programmes of the Facility mem- bers with the respective partner governments in order to ensure the implementation of appropriate regulatory and legal framework conditions. The Facility represents the first coordinated multi-donor scheme to support geothermal energy on a regional scale in Latin America. While already counting on the support of a large number of donors and Development Finance Institutions, the Facility is designed to be open to fur- ther participation of interested donors and financiers. It is expected to facilitate the development of a minimum of seven geothermal plants with a cumulative generation capacity of at least 350 MW and a total investment volume in excess of \u20ac1 billion. In addition to its energy security and emissions benefits, the Facility will also reduce the expo- sure of economies in the region to fossil fuel price fluctua- tions and increase the competitiveness of local industries, thereby providing a stronger basis for poverty reduction and social development in the region. The Facility benefitted from a technical assistance grant from LAIF in 2014, to cover part of the cost of structuring, setting up and managing the Geothermal Risk Mitigation Fund. The LAIF investment grant of \u20ac15 million will be used for the provision of \u201ccontingency grants\u201d. The countries participating in the project are Bolivia, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador and Peru in the Andean region, and Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Mexico and Nicaragua in Central America.

        "As a structured fund, the eco.business Fund aims to attract private and public investors with different risk appetites, offering an efficient structure to make investments that have a visible and direct impact. The first loss-capital from public investors together with the subordinated funds from Development Finance Institutions and International Finance Institutions protect the more senior capital tranches. Through this innovative structure, private capital is lever- aged to invest in this new green finance asset class. The Fund includes a technical assistance component (Development Facility) to provide support and guidance for local finance institutions and cooperatives when introducing new, or improving existing green financial products with a focus on biodiversity protection and re- source efficiency. Technical assistance will also provide support to local SMEs and support the realisation of impact studies and the development of common stan- dards in monitoring and evaluation. Due to the nature of its mission and the characteristics of the region, investment activities will concentrate on the areas of sustainable agriculture and processing, agroforestry, sustainable fisheries and aquaculture, as well as ecotourism. The Fund\u2019s main target group comprises local SMEs, such as farmers, producers, processing companies and ser- vice providers, with the potential to positively influence biodiversity and ecosystem protection. As most of the targeted SMEs are located in rural areas, employment opportunities will arise for rural populations. Overall, the eco.business Fund is expected to extend \u20ac1,400 million in loans to SMEs and larger companies as well as to create or improve one million jobs by 2035, thus contributing to poverty reduction in the areas involved. The \u20ac13 million LAIF participation in the first-loss capital is key to attracting third party funds, including private capital, thereby enabling the Fund to reach its target capitalisation. The LAIF grant includes \u20ac3 million to be utilised for tech- nical assistance and capacity building services to financial intermediaries and/or SMEs. The Broader Context Latin America is characterised by rich biodiversity and an abundance of natural resources. Six of the world\u2019s 17 megadiverse countries are located in the region. The region\u2019s natural richness is being threatened by the economic activity of key sectors such as agriculture, fishery, forestry and tourism. The main pressures on the conservation of biodiversity and natural resources come from land use change, land degradation exacerbated by climate change, pollution from nutrients, the unsustainable use of resources and invasive alien species. Interventions to revert these trends have been historically limited to public sector initiatives. However, these efforts will not be sufficient unless they are combined with the significant involvement of the private sector. In this regard, the adoption of sustainable consumption and production practices at a sig- nificant scale will be an essential requirement for rescuing biodiversity. Such a significant scale can be reached by setting the right incentives for private companies to adopt these principles based on commercial considerations. An important obstacle is the fact that the adoption of sustainable production practices is associated with significant costs and risks for the producer, while the pricing mark-up that can be obtained remains highly uncertain. These challenges are being addressed in a joint effort through this PPP. ",

The Western Corridor connects Honduras\u2019 second biggest city, San Pedro Sula, with international border crossings to Guatemala and El Salvador as well as with the Mayan ruins of Cop\u00e1n, which are listed as a World Heritage Site. Development of the entire Western Corridor in the coming years is a national priority for the Honduran government. The Honduras Sustainable Roads project comprises the rehabilitation and upgrading of sections of road along the Western Corridor, in addition to the implementation of road safety improvements. By improving the quality, safety and resilience to climate change of these road sections, the project will achieve three main objectives. First, the quality of life of local communities in one of the poorest and most deprived regions in Honduras will be significantly improved through enhanced, uninterrupted and safer links to the main population centres in the area. Furthermore, improved access to markets will also have a crucial impact on the agricultural development potential of the rural areas affected by the project. Second, Honduras\u2019 regional integration will be fostered, both internally and internationally. The improvement in transport links to neighbouring countries will provide an opportunity for increased trade. Third, socio-economic development based on tourism will be promoted as a result of improved access to one of the country\u2019s most important tourist sites. The resulting growth in tourism will bring new livelihood opportunities for people living in the rural areas along the road sections affected by the project and will contribute to increased social cohesion and poverty alleviation in these rural communities.

        "Since the Latin American Investment Facility was launched in 2010, 28 contributions have been approved for a total LAIF grant of \u20ac232 million in support of projects with a combined investment cost of almost \u20ac6.9 billion. In terms of allocation to individual projects, LAIF support has ranged in size from \u20ac1.5 million to \u20ac50 million. LAIF con- tributions took the form of technical assis- tance or investment grants and sometimes a combination of both, with one project receiving support in the form of risk capital. Geographic breakdown Twelve of the 28 contributions for a total grant of \u20ac85 million (36.7%) support re- gional projects, ten involving the whole region and two focused on Central America. The other 16 projects concern 10 individual countries. The country that has received the biggest allocation is Nicaragua with a total of \u20ac57 million (24.6%) for two projects, fol- lowed by Mexico with a total of \u20ac23 million (10%) for four projects. Other countries that have benefitted from important contribu- tions have been Chile (6.5%), El Salvador (4.3%), Honduras (4.3%), Paraguay (4.3%) and Colombia (4%). Sector distribution Two sectors - water and sanitation and energy - have received most LAIF support in the period 2010-2015. The six water and sanitation projects account for 37% of the total contribution with a total grant of \u20ac85.5 million, while the seven LAIF con- tributions to energy projects amount to \u20ac59.5 million, representing 25.6% of the total contribution. Five transport projects account for 12% of the total contribution (\u20ac28 million). Three projects providing sup- port to the private sector account for 9.8% of the total contribution (\u20ac22.8 million), four environment projects for 8.6% of the total contribution (\u20ac20 million) and one project supporting the social sector for 3% of the total contribution (\u20ac7 million). One multisector project and one project target- ing urban development represent respec- tively 2.2% (\u20ac5 million) and 1.8% (\u20ac4.2 million) of the total LAIF contribution. While addressing climate change mitigation and/ or adaptation has not been designated as a sector, it represents a principal or significant cross-cutting component in most of the projects approved in the period 2010-2015. Joint operations Almost all LAIF operations involve at least one European Finance Institution and at least one Latin American Regional Development Bank, demonstrating the capacity of LAIF to act as a catalyst for concrete EU-Latin America cooperation and its potential for creating constructive synergies. Financial and qualitative leverage The 28 LAIF contributions amounting to \u20ac232 million will leverage almost \u20ac6.9 billion of total investments from other donors or national and international finance institutions. This represents a multiplier effect of almost 30:1. In other words, the LAIF has mobilised, or leveraged, almost \u20ac30 for every euro of support that it has provided.

Investment grants can finance specific project components or a part of the total project cost and therefore ease the burden on other funders, raise credit ceilings, im- prove the concessionality of credits and encourage other investors to participate in the projects. Most LAIF support has been channelled to projects in the form of investment grants, representing 58% of the total LAIF contribution. Technical as- sistance accounts for 36% and risk capi- tal represents 6% of the total LAIF contri- bution.

The EDF earmarked a minimum of \u20ac40 million in direct funding for CIF for the period 2012-2015. An additional allocation of \u20ac30.2 million was made avail- able from the National Indicative Programme of Guyana in 2013. Since it was officially launched in March 2013, CIF has provided a total contribution of around \u20ac68.6 million to finance nine projects with a total investment cost of over \u20ac541 million. In addition to regional programmes, CIF aims to support in- vestments in the 15 Caribbean countries that have signed the ACP-EU Partnership Agreement: Antigua & Barbuda, Bahamas, Barbados, Belize, Dominica, Dominican Republic, Grenada, Guyana, Haiti, Jamaica, St Kitts & Nevis, St Lucia, Saint-Vincent and the Grenadines, Suriname and Trinidad & Tobago. In supporting projects in the region, CIF is guided by the principles of complementarity and additionality, with CIF projects supporting the priorities of regional and national programmes and avoiding replacing private financing and distorting markets in the region. Caribbean countries require considerable financial resourc- es to implement large-scale and capital-intensive infra- structure projects.

The EU support in the region is focussed on sectors such as inclusive growth, security and rule of law, energy, climate change and sustainable development. The countries in the region are classified as Small Island Developing States and confronted with an inherent vulnerability to exogenous shocks including natural disasters. EU assistance to the Caribbean countries is mainly channelled through the EDF. For the period 2008-2013, approximately \u20ac1 billion was provided for the implementation of nation- al and regional programmes in the Caribbean. Remarkable results have been achieved and, for the period 2014-2020, the overall alloca- tion from the EDF to the Caribbean remains stable at around \u20ac1 billion. The significant increase in the resources allocated to the EU regional programme for the Caribbean (\u20ac346 million) acknowledges the regional dimension of several of the challenges faced, namely, the inherent vul- nerability of the region to natural disasters and the deterioration of security. EU assis- tance will concentrate on regional economic cooperation and integration, climate change, environment, disaster management and sus- tainable energy as well as crime and security. Launched in 2013, CIF is one of the EU\u2019s re- gional blending facilities aiming to leverage funding for development projects by combin- ing grants from the EDF with loans from other sources, including European and Regional Development Banks. The objective of CIF is to support Caribbean countries in financing key infrastructure in the areas of transport, water and sanitation, energy, disaster prevention and information and communication technology. Operations financed with CIF support will also allow an increase in risk and credit ceilings to the benefit of the Caribbean countries, and promote categories of investments which cannot be funded by the market or by Finance Institutions on their own. In 2015 five CIF contributions for a total amount of almost \u20ac33.6 million were approved to support projects with a total investment cost of almost \u20ac440 million. These contributions were announced at the EU-CELAC Business Summit in Brussels in June 2015. Three of the five contributions were signed in the margins of the EU-CELAC Business Summit. The first two, signed with bene- ficiary governments, are contributions to projects to be implemented with the IDB, respectively to improve the sustainability of the electricity service in Suriname and to rehabilitate a crucial section of the George Price Highway in Belize. The third contribution was signed with CDB for a sustainable energy project in the Eastern Caribbean, to channel resources to the six independent countries of the Organization of the Eastern Caribbean States (OECS) for technical assistance and investment in energy efficiency and renewable energy. The other two projects approved in 2015 benefit the Dominican Republic, targeting the quality of service offered to consumers in the energy and water and sanitation sectors.

In terms of geographical distribution of the CIF sup- port in 2015, one of the five projects, the Sustainable Energy for the Eastern Caribbean (SEEC) Programme, has a regional focus. The Programme will channel resources for renewable energy and energy effi- ciency investments to the six independent coun- tries of the Organisation of the Eastern Caribbean States (OECS): Antigua and Barbuda, Grenada, St. Vincent and the Grenadines, the Commonwealth of Dominica, St. Kitts and Nevis, and St. Lucia.

Climate change represented an important cross-cutting issue for CIF in 2015, with four out of five projects to be reported as climate action support according to the Rio Convention on Climate Change. The SEEC Programme and the project supporting investment programmes in water and sanitation in the Dominican Republic have cli- mate change mitigation and/or adaptation as their prin- cipal objective, while for both the George Price Highway rehabilitation project and the project aiming to improve the sustainability of the electricity service in Suriname, climate change mitigation and/or adaptation constitutes a signifi- cant objective. Concerning the type of support provided by CIF, all the proj- ects approved in 2015 have an investment grant compo- nent. Investment grants account for \u20ac29.3 million (87.3%), while technical assistance support amounts to \u20ac4.3 million (12.7%). Two projects consist solely of investment grants, while three combine investment grants with technical assistance. The financial leverage of the CIF contributions in 2015 is higher than in the 2013-2015 period, with almost \u20ac33.6 million leveraging almost \u20ac440 million, which implies that every euro provided by CIF leveraged around \u20ac13 in invest- ment. This figure reflects the relatively large investments supported by CIF in Dominican Republic. 2 . P R OJ E C T S Increasing the uptake of renewable energy and energy efficiency with financially viable, climate-friendly invest- ments represents an opportunity for the six independent countries of the Organization of the Eastern Caribbean States (OECS) to reduce the burden of high electricity costs. For these countries, high fossil fuel import bills are a significant drain on foreign exchange reserves and contribute to higher than prudent levels of indebtedness. High electricity prices have also been identified as a sig- nificant contributor to the cost of doing business and are a burden for the majority of consumers. In addition to re- ducing greenhouse gas emissions, renewable energy and energy efficiency initiatives have the potential to reduce electricity costs and prices as well as the amount of for- eign exchange committed to fossil fuel imports. The SEEC Programme will channel resources to the six independent OECS countries to support investment in re- newable energy and energy efficiency programmes. The Programme consists of four components. Two compo- nents involve technical assistance aimed at institutional strengthening and capacity building of local and regional actors, as well as to support the development of renewable energy and energy efficiency projects. The other two com- ponents provide funding for investments in public sector renewable energy and energy efficiency projects and ded- icated financial instruments for financial intermediaries benefiting the private sector.

The objectives of the SEEC Programme are threefold. First, the Programme aims to increase the capacity of actors in the public and private sectors to support, plan and imple- ment investments in renewable energy and energy efficien- cy. Second, it will contribute to the development of an ad- equately-financed renewable energy and energy efficiency market with a sufficient supply of goods and services. Finally, the Programme will share lessons learned about optimal implementation of energy efficiency measures and renewable energy technologies and raise awareness about these issues. Suriname\u2019s government strategy towards 2020 aims to establish a sustainable energy sector that offers equita- ble access to electricity services, including in the sparse- ly inhabited interior (the hinterland). Renewable energy technologies stand to play a key role in this strategy, by offering the possibility of controlling costs and establish- ing a reliable service for end-users in more isolated and remote communities. The support programme to improve the sustainability of the electricity service in Suriname is part of the Sustainable Energy Framework in Suriname (SEFS), currently being implemented with support from IDB. The objective of this framework is to anticipate future growth in electrici- ty demand in the country and to shape the conditions to ensure that this demand is sustainably met, from an eco- nomic, financial and environmental viewpoint. The SEFS will support the government of Suriname and the national electricity company Energie Bedrijven Suriname (EBS) in implementing adequate regulatory and manage- ment practices to reduce generation costs, review the cur- rent tariff structure, and establish contract models for the purchase of electricity. The Framework will also allow EBS to assess options for power generation using low-carbon technologies and improve access to sustainable energy. The support programme will support EBS in improving its operational procedures and address sustainability issues associated with the electrification of rural areas in Suriname. These efforts will be supported by the CIF con- tribution, which will promote the use of renewable energy technologies for rural electrification in the hinterland. Specifically, the CIF contribution will finance the procure- ment and installation of a small hydro power plant and a solar photovoltaic system in two different locations - the Upper Suriname Resort and the Tapanahony Resort.

The aim of this programme is to limit commercial losses in electricity distribution, reduce the national power sector\u2019s dependence on financial support from the government and improve the availability of power supply to consumers. The first phase of the programme is nearing completion while the second phase, started in 2015, involves an investment cost of circa $360 million to be financed by IDB, WB, EIB and OFID. In the context of the programme, the CDEEE loss reduction project comprises the rehabilitation of a number of medi- um-low voltage electricity networks and metering systems in the country, to reduce their vulnerability to tampering, as well as the strengthening of commercial activities with regard to contracting and monitoring irregular users. Moreover, the project will actively engage with the public to introduce a culture of payment and to promote the safe and efficient use of electricity. The project is spread across the territory of the Dominican Republic, with circa 60% of the investments concentrat- ed in the outskirts of the capital Santo Domingo. The CIF grant will focus on areas with high poverty rates, and will improve electricity provision with an associated beneficial impact on the quality of life of 13,326 families of which 45% live below the poverty line.

High quality transport infrastructure is crucial for trade, agriculture and tourism, all key sectors for Belize\u2019s economic growth. The George Price Highway, which connects the country\u2019s commercial centre, Belize City, with the national capital Belmopan and other major urban centres, is characterised by infrastructure vulnerabilities and it is particularly ex- posed to the impacts of climate change. The highway is a crucial interconnector between the northern, southern and central regions of Belize, as well as being an important link to Central America and Mexico. The George Price Highway Rehabilitation project comprises the rehabilitation to national standards of the highway section between miles 47.9 in Belmopan and 67.3 in Santa Elena, including the replacement of the Roaring Creek Bridge. Rehabilitation will decrease travel time and costs, improve user safety and make the infra- structure more resilient to climate change, thus enabling this important evacuation route to remain open during ex- treme weather events. Complementary to the rehabilitation work, the project will include an institutional strengthening programme to en- hance transport planning capacity and road maintenance management in the country.

        "Since CIF was launched in 2013, nine con- tributions have been approved for a total CIF grant of around \u20ac68.6 million in support of projects with a total investment cost of around \u20ac541 million. In terms of allocation to individual projects, CIF contributions have ranged from \u20ac2 million to almost \u20ac19.5 million. CIF contributions have taken the form of technical assistance or invest- ment grants and sometimes a combination of both. Geographic breakdown Two of the nine contributions, for a total grant of over \u20ac7.2 million (over 10.5%), support regional projects while the other seven benefit five individual countries. The country that has received the biggest allocation is Guyana with two contribu- tions worth a total of almost \u20ac30.1 million (nearly 43.9%), followed by the Dominican Republic with a total CIF contribution of over \u20ac19.3 million (28.1%) for two projects. Both Suriname and Belize have benefitted from a CIF contribution of \u20ac5 million (7.3%), while Dominica received one contribution worth \u20ac2 million (2.9%). Sector distribution Energy is the sector that has received the most consistent CIF support in the period 2013-2015. The five contributions to energy projects approved since the launch of the Facility account for 58.2% of the total CIF contribution, with a combined grant of over \u20ac39.9 million. The two contributions to water and sanitation projects amount to almost \u20ac20.7 million, representing almost 30.1% of the total CIF contribution. One contribu- tion to a transport project represents 7.3% of the total contribution (\u20ac5 million) and one multisector project accounts for 4.4% of the total contribution (\u20ac3 million). While addressing climate change mitigation and/ or adaptation has not been designated as a sector, it represents a principal or signif- icant cross-cutting component in eight out of the nine projects approved in the period 2013-2015. Joint operations Nearly half of the CIF projects involve co- operation between the European Finance Institutions, Regional Development Banks and International Finance Institutions active in the region, as well as national govern- ments. This cooperation demonstrates the capacity of CIF to create constructive syn- ergies between the EU and the Caribbean, both on a bilateral and multilateral level. Financial and qualitative leverage The nine CIF contributions, totalling around \u20ac68.6 million, will leverage around \u20ac541 million in investments from other donors or Finance Institutions. This represents a mul- tiplier effect of almost 8:1, which means that the CIF has mobilised, or leveraged, almost \u20ac8 for every euro of support that it has provided.

Technical assistance provides for functions like management, expert advice, and market and operation- al studies. Investment grants can finance specific project components or a part of the total project cost and therefore ease the burden on other funders, raise credit ceil- ings, improve the concessionality of credits and encourage other investors to participate in the projects. Most CIF support has been channelled to projects in the form of invest- ment grants, representing almost 86.5% of the total CIF contribution, while technical assistance accounts for over 13.5% of the total contribution. Of the nine CIF projects, four have received support solely in the form of investment grants, two only in the form of technical assistance and three have been supported with a combination of both. Implementation By the end of 2015, contracts had been signed for all of the nine approved proj- ects. More than \u20ac17 million of CIF funding had been disbursed.

        "L A I F C I F Engaging with the private sector The expansion of the private sector rep- resents a major reserve for the generation of employment in the developing world and, as such, has the potential to be a powerful driver of sustainable economic develop- ment in many EU partner countries. The private sector has a crucial role to play in eradicating poverty and ensuring that that development is not only sustainable, but serves to benefit all, including the most dis- advantaged sections of society. In developing countries, private sector com- panies need to overcome higher obstacles than those faced by their counterparts in developed markets. Access to finance is a major issue, as is a non-conducive business environment, and also a lack of the quality assessment and conformity compliance infrastructure needed for producers in the least developed countries to integrate into global value chains. The EU provides substantial support across a wide range of activities aimed at creating an enabling environment for private sector en- gagement, including regulatory reforms and business development services, with a special focus on strengthening micro, small and me- dium-sized enterprises (MSMEs) which play a particularly vital role in job creation. In its \u201cAgenda for Change\u201d, adopted in 2011, the Commission highlighted the need to develop innovative ways of engaging with the private sector, and set out its vision for empowering the private sector as an engine of sustainable development in a Communication from May 2014 - \u2018A Stronger Role of the Private Sector in Achieving Inclusive and Sustainable Growth in Developing Countries.\u2019 The Commission will continue implement- ing a set of \u201ctraditional\u201d private sector development actions to support local gov- ernments and business intermediary or- ganisations in developing countries to allow the private sector harness the opportunities offered by globally integrated markets. In addition, it will look for \u201cnew ways of har- nessing the potential of the private sector as a financing partner, implementing agent, advisor or intermediary to achieve more effective and efficient delivery of EU sup- port, not only in the field of local private sector development, but also in other areas of EU development cooperation such as sustainable energy, sustainable agriculture and agribusiness, digital and physical infra- structure, and the green and social sectors,\u201d the Communication notes. Blending is one such \u2018new way\u2019 of har- nessing the potential of the private sector as a financing partner. Furthermore, the sustainability focus of LAIF and CIF mean that these are fully aligned with European Commission\u2019s objectives as outlined in the Communication. Both of these investment facilities aim at fostering investments which will have a positive impact on so- cio-economic development in their respec- tive regions, with a particular focus on infrastructure in transport, communication and energy interconnections and the pro- motion of renewable energies. They also address threats to the environment, with climate change adaptation and mitigation measures, and promote smart, sustainable and inclusive growth, through private sector engagement and support to SMEs. This focus on private sector engagement as a driver of sustainable development can be seen in LAIF and CIF projects approved in 2015. For example, the eco.business Fund is an investment fund promoting business practices that contribute to the sustainable use of natural resources in Latin America. Historically, interventions to revert the trend of biodiversity loss in this region have been limited to public sector initiatives. However, there is a realisation that national and in- ternational public investments alone will be insufficient to achieve these goals unless ",

Consequently, it is a stated aim of the programme to mobilise additional capital by involving the private sector with a fund that minimises risk for private capital. Likewise the SEEC Programme aims to increase the capabilities of private sector actors to support, plan, and implement in- vestments in renewable energy and energy efficiency projects. The Programme\u2019s im- plementers have recognised reluctance on the part of the banking sector in the region to finance renewable energy and energy efficiency, mainly due to limit- ed experience and familiarity with the assessment of such projects. The SEEC Programme aims to address these issues by reinforcing CDB initiatives to strength- en capacity in the private sector for re- newable energy and energy efficiency project development in the participating countries. The private sector beneficiaries of SEEC loans may also benefit indirectly from technical assistance for energy audits and technical implementation pro- vided to participating government-owned financial intermediaries. At the end of 2014, the European Council issued conclusions on \u201cA stronger role of the private sector in development cooper- ation: An action oriented perspective\u201d. In these conclusions, the Council stressed the need to deliver on concrete initiatives and leverage more private finance to implement capital-intensive infrastructure projects in energy, transport and agriculture. The Council noted in particular the importance of blending as a tool to boost economic growth, innovation and job creation. Given their credentials as flexible mechanisms to leverage funding to finance sustainable development, it is clear that LAIF and CIF will remain a key tool by which the EU will pursue its goal of engaging with the private sector to ensure that development assis- tance is not only effective, but also sustain- able and socially inclusive.

        "L A I F C I F LAIF and CIF on the frontline of the battle against climate change The impacts of climate change are pro- found, both in developed and developing countries. The world is facing serious challenges due to climate change, requir- ing timely and appropriate measures that demand significant resources. In December 2010, developed countries committed to the goal of jointly providing funds, increasing to US$100 billion per year by 2020, to address the needs of de- veloping countries for significant mitigation actions to be implemented in a transpar- ent way. In order for the EU to meets its commitments in terms of climate finance, specific Climate Change Windows (CCWs) were created in the EU regional blending facilities. The CCWs encompass both public and private investments in strategic areas such as transport, energy, environment, water, sanitation and forests. The main objectives behind the establishment of Climate Change Windows (CCWs) in the EU regional blending facilities are as follows: 1. Establish a tracking system for climate change related operations; 2. Ensure transparency of EU financ- ing of climate change projects, including by making a distinction between programmed funds within geographical instruments and new, additional resources; 3. Guarantee better tracking and EU visibility for all its climate actions; 4. Mainstream the fight against climate change in projects (co) financed by the EU; 5. Attract additional financing for climate change. ",
        "3 9 LAIF and CIF on the frontline of the battle against climate change The tracking system is based on the contribution of each project to the climate mitigation and/or adaptation objectives of the Rio Convention on Climate Change: \u2022 Rio Marker 1: projects where the con- tribution to mitigating and/or adapt- ing to climate change represents a significant objective (40% of the LAIF/ CIF contribution can be reported as climate action support); \u2022 Rio Marker 2: projects where the con- tribution to mitigating and/or adapt- ing to climate change represents the principal objective (100% of the LAIF/ CIF contribution can be reported as climate action support). Mitigation measures include: \u2022 Limiting the emission of greenhouse gases caused by human activity; \u2022 Improving energy efficiency and increasing energy saving; \u2022 Increasing the production and use of renewable energy; \u2022 Protecting and/or enhancing greenhouse gas sinks and reservoirs. Adaptation measures include: \u2022 Reducing human and environmental vulnerability to the impact of climate change; \u2022 Promoting climate change adaptation technologies, including the related infrastructures; \u2022 Measures for emergency prevention and preparedness to cope with natural disasters. At the 21 st Session of the Conference of Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP21) in Paris in December 2015, countries pledged to strengthen the global response to the threat of climate change, in the context of sustainable development and efforts to eradicate poverty, including by making finance flows consistent with a pathway towards low greenhouse gas emissions and climate-resilient development. Results L A I F Between 2010 and 2015, 26 of the 28 LAIF contributions target climate actions. Out of the \u20ac232 million approved, \u20ac180.6 mil- lion can be reported as climate action support according to the Rio Convention on Climate Change (Rio Marker 1: 40% of the LAIF grant, Rio Marker 2: 100% of the LAIF grant contribution). Since its launch, 14 LAIF contributions can be re- ported as Rio Marker 2, with LAIF contributions totalling \u20ac154.2 million to be reported as climate action support. Another 12 projects were reported as Rio Marker 1, with LAIF contributions totalling \u20ac26.4 million to be re- ported as climate action support. C I F Between 2013 and 2015, eight of the nine CIF contributions target climate actions. Out of the circa \u20ac68.6 million approved, almost \u20ac33.5 million can be reported as climate action support according to the Rio Convention on Climate Change (Rio Marker 1: 40% of the LAIF grant, Rio Marker 2: 100% of the LAIF grant contribution). Three CIF contributions can be reported as Rio Marker 2, with CIF con- tributions of almost \u20ac16.3 million to be reported as climate action support. Another five projects were reported as Rio Marker 1, with CIF contributions of circa \u20ac17.2 million to be reported as climate action support. The full list of LAIF and CIF contributions approved up to 2015 is available in the LAIF and CIF annexes at the end of this report.

        "The European Union has strong historic ties with Latin America and the Caribbean, and these ties are reflected in the position that this region occupies in the EU\u2019s development agenda. While EU development assistance continues to have a positive impact on the lives of people across the region, there has been a change in how this assistance is perceived. In the post-2015 era, develop- ment assistance is evolving from a bilateral paradigm involving public sector aid donors and aid recipients to a more multilateral process with space for dialogue, mutual enrichment and exchange of best practice, in which representatives from public sector or- ganisations, business and citizens are all engaged. Within this context, the Latin America Investment Facility (LAIF) and the Caribbean Investment Facility (CIF) are ideally positioned to deliver on the promise of sustainable and inclusive development. These instruments are complementary to other aid modalities for implementing EU-funded development programmes in the region to kick-start investment in capital-intensive projects and support policies that are crucial to the sustainable devel- opment of the countries in question. Since its launch in 2010, LAIF has contributed \u20ac232 million in grants to finance invest- ments worth almost \u20ac7 billion. The impact of CIF, established in 2012, has been equally significant. Grant contributions worth almost \u20ac70 million have leveraged investments of about \u20ac541 million. The LAIF and CIF projects approved in 2015 reflect the instruments\u2019 ongoing focus on en- vironmental sustainability and the engagement of the private sector as a driver of devel- opment, with projects aiming to improve access to electricity, water and transport, and to support the development potential of small and medium-sized enterprises. By supporting projects that will reduce poverty and promote environmental sustainability, LAIF and CIF are fully aligned with the economic, environmental and social ethos of the Sustainable Development Goals agreed in September 2015 and will help create strong foundation for sustainable and inclusive economic growth in Latin America and the Caribbean. The European Commission remains committed to deepening its partnership with Latin America and the Caribbean and to upholding the EU\u2019s role as a global driver of poverty eradication and environmentally-aware development. Through LAIF and CIF and other EU actions supporting development cooperation, the European Commission will continue to support efforts undertaken by Latin American and Caribbean counties to improve transport, energy, and water infrastructure, develop small and medium-sized business and reduce social inequalities in the region.

Within this new structure, the EU implements blending opera- tions under the DCI, EDF, ENI (European Neighbourhood Instrument) and IPA (Instrument for Pre-Accession Assistance) Blending Frameworks, corresponding to the financing instruments supporting the Union\u2019s external policies. The Blending Frameworks, through their cor- responding facilities, cover the countries and thematic operations concerned. LAIF is covered by the DCI Blending Framework. CIF, as of 2016, will be covered by the EDF Blending Framework. Project assessment and Board opinion A blending operation needs to be developed by a Finance Institution, as it involves the provision of a loan or other type of financing from one or more Finance Institutions. The Lead Finance Institution is in charge of submitting a project proposal using a project application form for discussion and assessment at a Technical Assessment Meeting. These meetings are chaired by the Commission with the participation of the European External Action Service (EEAS) and Finance Institutions. Based on the results of the discussions at the Technical Assessment Meeting, proposals may either be considered mature enough for submission to the Board, or may be returned for re-submission at a subsequent meeting or may be rejected. The Board is responsible for formulating opinions on individual blending operations. It is chaired by the Commission with the participation of the EEAS and the EU Member States, as voting members, and the Finance Institutions as observers. Based on Board decisions for the selected proposals, a complemen- tary decision is adopted by the Commission. Secretariat The Secretariat of the EU Blending Frameworks is run by the Commission. The Secretariat supports the management of the EU Blending Frameworks by pro- viding support, including in the assessment process and formulation of opinions by the Board, coordina- tion of consultations and organisation of technical assessment and Board meetings, reporting, dissem- ination of information, sharing of best practices and training. The Directorate-General for International Cooperation and Development (DG DEVCO) provides support to the DCI and EDF Blending Frameworks. L A I F C I F O R G A N I S AT I O N A L S T R U C T U R E ",

The purpose of CIF is to support Caribbean countries in financing key infrastructure projects in the areas of transport, water and sanitation, energy, disaster prevention and information and communication technology. CIF contributions can support investments in the 15 Caribbean countries: Antigua and Barbuda, Bahamas, Barbados, Belize, Dominica, Dominican Republic, Grenada, Guyana, Haiti, Jamaica, Saint Kitts and Nevis, Saint Lucia, Saint-Vincent and the Grenadines, Suriname, and Trinidad and Tobago. CIF also supports regional operations. Considering the challenges faced by Caribbean countries to finance and implement key strategic infrastructures that require considerable financial resources, CIF aims at creating partnerships, pooling grant resources from the EDF with funding from European and International Development Finance Institutions, the private sector and the beneficiary countries\u2019 own resources. Operations to support access to credit for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) are also possible through CIF. As of May 2015, 9 projects have been approved, representing a total investment cost of about EUR 535 million with a total CIF grant contribution of almost EUR 70 million, entailing a leverage of almost EUR 8 for every Euro of support provided. The projects approved so far allowed for a wide geographical coverage and have targeted energy (5 projects), water and sanitation (2 projects) and transport (1 project). Only one project was multi-sector. CARIBBEAN Investment Facility International Cooperation and Development The Latin America Investment Facility (LAIF) is one of the EU\u2019s regional blending facilities, aiming to mobilise funding for development projects by combining EU development grants with loans from other sources, including European and Regional Financial Institutions. The purpose of LAIF is to support Latin American countries in financing key infrastructure projects in selected sectors, such as transport, energy, environment and social sector, as well as private-sector growth especially via small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). LAIF pursues three interconnected and mutually- reinforcing strategic objectives: \u2022 Improving interconnectivity between and within Latin American countries via better energy and transport infrastructures, including energy efficiency, renewable energy systems, and sustainable transport and communication networks. \u2022 Increasing environment protection and supporting climate change adaptation and mitigation. \u2022 Promoting equitable and sustainable socio-economic development through the improvement of social service infrastructure and support to SMEs. Since its launch at the sixth European Union-Latin American and Caribbean (EU-LAC) Summit in 2010 until end 2014, 25 projects were approved, representing a total investment cost of about LATIN AMERICA Investment Facility LAIF and CIF factsheets The European Union has joined forces with EU Delegations and European, Multilateral and Regional Finance Institutions in their use of communication tools to ensure that our partner countries and their populations are fully aware of LAIF and CIF opportunities and their results. The EU uses the various means of communication at its disposal to publicise EU contributions when the projects and programmes are formally agreed. Launch of the eco.business Fund ",
