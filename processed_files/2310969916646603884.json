        "Climate Change and Migration PE 655.591 13 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY In 2011, the European Parliament\u2019s Policy Department on Citizens\u2019 Rights and Constitutional Affairs commissioned the International Centre for Migration Policy Development (ICMPD) to undertake a study on legal and policy responses to environmentally induced migration. While looking at both forced and voluntary cross-border movements, the study generally focused on protection needs and the possible role of asylum and other policies related to forced displacement. This current study, nearly a decade later, re-examines the issue in light of increased interest and momentum in responding to the migration-climate change nexus. Indeed, this study comes at a time when the issue of climate change has fully moved to the centre of political and societal debates . The evidence available today on the expressions of climate change, its human causes, the speed of changes and interlinkages between different aspects of climate change (e.g. global warming, sea level rise or extreme weather events) is increasingly sophisticated, enabling better, more nuanced and more specific assessments of current and future impacts. This includes discussions of equity and justice in the context of climate change that acknowledge that the impacts of this phenomenon are uneven, for instance disproportionately impacting poorer and more vulnerable populations and among these, in particular women. In addition, researchers have also examined how climate change is affecting enjoyment of basic human rights. At the policy level, the European Union\u2019s (EU\u2019s) global engagement \u2013 both in terms of climate policy and migration and displacement policy \u2013 has significantly expanded and is set to become yet more important in the context of ongoing geopolitical shifts. This study explores the intersection of these two prominent issue and policy areas . At the same time, the impasse on a way forward to reform asylum in Europe raises questions as to the EU\u2019s capability to accommodate migration and displacement challenges connected with environmental change. This study reviews academic evidence on the impact of climate change on migration and displacement. It also examines policy debates and concrete initiatives addressing the nexus of migration, displacement and climate change, focusing on the global and regional levels, to assess the fitness of the legal and policy frameworks in place. The report concludes with recommendations and the presentation of possible options for the European Parliament to further develop policy frameworks at the EU level. Its primary focus is needs arising in the context of adverse environmental changes, and thus environmental displacement \u2013 although migration as a strategy to cope with climate change is also explored. The study is based on desk research of academic literature and selected policy documents and jurisprudence as well as a survey of policymakers in select EU Member States (MSs). The impact of climate change on migration, mobility and displacement A review of the literature underscores that the impact of environmental change on migration is complex: Environmental change interacts with and is mediated by other drivers of migration. Forced displacement following sudden- or slow-onset environmental events, in contrast, offers a more tangible category for analysis, raising specific practical and legal concerns. However, it should be noted that environmental change cannot only spur mobility, it can also drive immobility. In addition, it may adversely affect immobilised populations, such as those facing protracted displacement situations as a result of conflict, persecution or violence. ",
        "IPOL | Policy Department for Citizens\u2019 Rights and Constitutional Affairs 14 PE 655.591 Climate change is likely to increase the likelihood and intensity of natural hazards, which in turn will impact drivers of migration. Slow-onset environmental change is mediated by a variety of social, economic and political factors and generally affects migration indirectly. While disasters often have a more direct effect, these, too, are socially mediated, disproportionately affecting vulnerable populations. Existing estimates of the numbers of \u2018environmental migrants and displaced persons\u2019 are problematic on several counts , including because of the difficulties in establishing causality, the often unclear nature of estimates (do they refer to stocks of migrants or flows? Do they refer to the present or a future point in time?), and the absence of a transparent methodology. However, for over a decade the Internal Displacement Monitoring Centre\u2019s (IDMC) tracking of disaster-related internal displacement provides a robust evidence base on displacement caused by disasters and classifies the data by type of natural hazard causing displacement, thus allowing to distinguish environmental from other causes. No such estimates are currently available for cross-border situations. The IDMC\u2019s data collection methodology, however, offers a good basis for potential further development of global estimates in this area. Rather than simply a reaction to climate change or disasters themselves, migration should also be understood as an adaption strategy , a way to cope with related impacts on lives and livelihoods. Migration thus needs to be part of the solution both in respect to internal and cross-border situations, for example through facilitating migration and making it an option for a larger group of people through planned relocation in internal situations or through considering environmental factors in the context of resettlement, amongst others. International policy initiatives addressing environmental migration and displacement With environmental migration and displacement being an increasingly visible topic in international policy discussions and initiatives, efforts to address the issue through global fora have gained momentum and can be seen in frameworks, guidance, capacity building and other actions . In the field of migration and displacement, many of these efforts focus on cross-border displacement. The state-led Nansen Initiative has been particularly active both globally and regionally in strengthening protection for environmentally displaced persons. Meanwhile, the Global Compact for Safe, Orderly and Regular Migration has raised the profile of environmental drivers of migration and ways to address them through international cooperation. Beyond this, preventing and responding to environmental displacement has been part of broader global discussions on climate change and disasters, while the issue is also on the agenda of humanitarian and development actors. In addition to such global initiatives, several regional initiatives , especially in Africa and Latin America, as well as national-level efforts, particularly in the Pacific islands, represent important steps in strengthening frameworks for protection in the context of environmental migration and displacement . Notably, the African region has developed a few instruments that are legally binding, in contrast to the voluntary nature of most initiatives. A number of United Nations agencies, multilateral development banks and other actors have engaged in this work , reflecting the increased prominence of the topic and need to both strengthen protections for those displaced and to foster the resilience of those who could potentially be displaced in the context of climate change and disasters. As international and regional initiatives have gained ",
        "Climate Change and Migration PE 655.591 15 momentum, they have provided tools to better respond to environmental migration and displacement, filling in key gaps, and underscored the utility of international cooperation to do this. But despite this progress, the voluntary and fragmented nature of most of these efforts, the need to effectively implement them, and continued concerns regarding climate change all remain key challenges to effectively responding to environmental migration and displacement going forward. Addressing environmental displacement in Europe The EU and its MSs have taken an active role in promoting environmental protection in global fora; although the EU was late to the game, it has increasingly addressed the nexus of environmental change and migration over the past decade. Environmental change and migration is addressed in its civil protection, humanitarian aid and development policies . However, in the context of policies on international protection, no concrete initiatives to date have addressed the protection needs of people affected by environmental change , and specifically environmental \u2013 and other \u2013 disasters: According to the prevailing interpretation of the 1951 Refugee Convention , displacement based on environmental reasons alone does not meet the requirement for refugee protection. Within the EU, complementary forms of protection deriving from the Qualification Directive and the Temporary Protection Directive , as well as protection from non-refoulement in the Return Directive , could provide protection alternatives. However, all of those instruments reveal deficiencies for the protection of environmentally displaced persons . Looking at the national level, only Sweden and Finland provide for protection of persons affected by environmental change and natural disasters and unable to return under national legislation. However, Finland and Sweden both suspended their national provisions following the high numbers of migrant arrivals in 2015-16. Meanwhile, judgments by the European Court of Human Rights and the Court of Justice of the European Union on sick migrants can serve as examples of how these courts may assess applications from persons displaced or unable to return for environmental reasons . Socio- economic reasons in the broader context of Articles 2 and 3 of the European Convention on Human Rights could offer crucial bases for protection; however, the threshold is set very high. While national courts of EU MSs have not yet had to judge cases related to displacement and climate change, Australian and New Zealand courts have dealt with several cases . However, the only case where a court in New Zealand has granted residence to a person who claimed to be unable to return due to climate change was decided based on family ties in New Zealand and not on the situation in the applicant\u2019s country of origin (Tuvalu). Lastly, in a remarkable recent decision, the United Nations Human Rights Committee declared that inaction in the face of global warming can lead to violations of human rights and trigger non-refoulement obligations. Conclusions and recommendations Solutions for environmental migration and displacement must acknowledge the diversity of environmental drivers, including their scope, intensity and duration, as each may involve different needs and frameworks with which to respond. This calls for a multi-sectoral approach that addresses both root causes and consequences of the nexus between environmental change, on the one hand, and migration and displacement, on the other. While protection needs of those affected by slow or sudden- onset events arise independently of the question whether climate change can be established as a cause ",
        "IPOL | Policy Department for Citizens\u2019 Rights and Constitutional Affairs 16 PE 655.591 of such events, there is clear evidence of the increased risk of environmental hazards due to climate change. Addressing climate change through climate change, development, trade and other policies is thus a key element of prevention. The Study recommends that the European Parliament should : \u2022 Strengthen conceptual clarity, defining its position on climate change and environmental change more broadly and its impacts on migration and displacement . This includes more robust data collection and analysis to build the research base; an exploration of MS\u2019 readiness to address environmental factors in supra-national and national policies on migration and asylum; and the adoption of a common EU position on the climate change-migration nexus. \u2022 Develop a coherent policy to address migration in the context of climate change and natural disasters and mobility in the external dimension . This entails mainstreaming environmental and mobility considerations across policies, strategies and programs; taking concrete solidarity actions under the Global Compacts; encouraging European regional and national actors to engage in addressing the issue; and leveraging participation in international initiatives to foster the further development of tools and policies in areas of the world most affected by these environmental events, including through technical and financial assistance. These efforts should encompass the development and expansion of measures in reaction to crises as well as forward-looking approaches that address future risks, including adaptation strategies such as migration. \u2022 Push for forward-looking EU asylum and migration policies at internal level, which take into account climate change and natural disasters alongside other emerging challenges . Such an effort should recognise that there are different avenues through which the European Parliament can seek to address the needs of those affected by climate change and natural disasters within the EU. One such pathway is devising a strategy for providing solutions for protection claims submitted in Europe that are connected with climate change and natural disasters. \u2022 Strengthen various forms of assistance to countries particularly affected by environmental disasters as well as environmental and climate change more broadly as well as step up the EU\u2019s climate change policies more broadly .

INTRODUCTION In 2011, the European Parliament\u2019s Policy Department on Citizens\u2019 Rights and Constitutional Affairs commissioned the International Centre for Migration Policy Development (ICMPD) to undertake a study on legal and policy responses to environmental migration. Although addressing both forced and voluntary cross-border movements, the study generally focused on protection needs and the possible role of asylum policies on forced displacement more widely. 8 The study came at a time of increased policy and research interest in the relationship between migration, climate change and issues of environmental change more generally, reflected amongst others in an enormous growth of the relevant research literature (see Figure 1, below) and, at the policy level, the launch of a state-led policy initiative \u2013 the Nansen Initiative 9 \u2013 dedicated to addressing the nexus between environmental change and migration. The growth of both research and policy interest at the time reflected the wider growth in attention to climate change and its various social, economic and political impacts.

See in more detail section 4.2.1.1 below. 10 The Climig database can be accessed at https://climig.com/. 11 A notable example is the influential Foresight report (Foresight, 2011) bringing together a wide range of expertise from a large number of scientists from different disciplines, involving some 80 background papers and involving several hundred scientists and other stakeholders. Another example is a slightly earlier project funded under the EU\u2019s FP6 research programme \u201cEnvironmental Change and Forced Migration Scenarios (EACH-For, 2007-2009). ",

Almost a decade after the publication of the 2011 European Parliament-commissioned study, the issue of climate change has fully moved to the centre of political debates , both at the Member State (MS) and European Union (EU) level, even if temporarily overshadowed by the Covid-19 crisis and response. What is perhaps equally, if not more important, it has moved to the centre of broader societal debates: EU citizens consider it as one of the top societal challenges Europe is facing . 14 The evidence available today on the expressions of climate change, its human causes, the speed of changes and interlinkages between different aspects of climate change such as global warming, sea-level rise or extreme weather events is increasingly sophisticated and powerful and enables better, more nuanced and specific assessments of climate change impacts now and in the future. In the meantime, debates on \u2018climate justice\u2019 15 have highlighted the centrality of issues of \u201cequity and justice aspects inherent to both the causes and the effects of climate change\u201d, 16 stressing amongst other points that climate change does not affect everybody equally and may hit vulnerable groups particularly hard. Indeed, as recent research has shown, it is the global poor that are disproportionally affected by climate change. 17 Additionally, climate change impacts are clearly gendered. 18 Apart from raising concerns around equity and justice, climate change has important human rights implications, with a number of basic rights being at stake, while responses to climate change in turn may raise new human rights issues. 19 At the policy level, the EU\u2019s global engagement \u2013 both in terms of climate policy and migration and displacement policy \u2013 has significantly expanded; this is set to continue in the context of ongoing geopolitical shifts that have made EU leadership in regard to these global challenges even more important . At the same time, the impasse around the reform of the Common European Asylum System (CEAS) and the different views on the future of asylum in Europe raises questions as to the EU\u2019s capability to accommodate human mobility due to environmental change . 20 It is against this background that the European Parliament commissioned the present study in February 2020. The study is tasked with reviewing the academic evidence on the impact of climate change on migration and displacement, in addition to policy debates and concrete initiatives addressing the nexus of migration, displacement and climate change both at the global and the EU level and assessing the fitness of the legal and policy framework in place. Lastly, the study was tasked with describing possible 12 The IDMC database can be accessed at https://www.internal-displacement.org/database/displacement-data. 13 IDMC & NRC (2011). 14 The increasing salience of climate change is captured by the Eurobarometer, see European Commission (2019) for results also in comparison to previous waves. 15 See for a comprehensive overview of different aspects of climate justice debates Jafry (2019). 16 Jafry et al.

(2016) for the full World Bank Study on which the summary is based. 18 See Perkins (2019). 19 See Duyck et a.l. (2018). Policies on planned relocation as opposed to temporary evacuations is one example of a policy issue raising human rights issues. 20 As we will argue in the below, the spectre of mass migration due to climate change is both wrong on factual grounds (see for a critique de Haas 2020) and unhelpful in thinking about protections for those affected by adverse environmental change.

The primary focus of the study concerns the needs arising in the context of adverse environmental changes and related mobility, and thus environmental displacement. The study will proceed as follows: In the next section (section 2), we will describe the terms, definitions and conceptual framework of the study. Section 3 reviews the evidence on the impact of climate change on migration, mobility and displacement. In so doing, the study will also examine migration as an adaptation strategy and the issue of trapped populations in whose case such options are often absent. Section 4 undertakes a broad review of instruments and initiatives on the international level that either explicitly address environmental migration and displacement or have been mobilised to this end. Apart from global initiatives, the section also examines a number of regional and national initiatives. Section 5 focuses on European policy debates, examining both the global (external) and internal dimension of EU policies, that is the EU\u2019s legal framework on international protection, legislation at the MS level and relevant case law. The final section (section 6) will provide conclusions and make a number of recommendations. Note on methodology This study is based on desk research of academic literature and select policy documents and legal cases.

        "IPOL | Policy Department for Citizens\u2019 Rights and Constitutional Affairs 20 PE 655.591 2. BACKGROUND 2.1. Conceptual framework The debate on environmental change and migration can be traced back to the 1970s, when the term \u201cenvironmental refugees\u201d made its first appearance, 21 entering common usage in the 1980s. 22 The term \u201c environmental refugee \u201d suggested two conclusions: first, that movement in response to environmental change was involuntary, and second, that the involuntary nature of movement gave rise to specific protection challenges. However, these assumptions were heavily criticised: The criticism concerned the analytical value of the concept for helping to understand the relationship between environmental change and migration, 23 the often loose use of these terms in relevant debates and their normative implications. Social scientists refuted the terms climate or environmental refugees as implying a simplistic and mono-causal understanding of the relationship between climate change, environmental events and displacement, also drawing on broader debates within refugee and migration studies questioning the sharp distinction between voluntary and forced migration and stressing individuals\u2019 agency. 24 The Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) rejected the use of the term \u2018refugee\u2019 in this context on grounds that the term \u2018refugee\u2019 was a legal term and should be reserved for refugees 21 According to Black (2001), the term can be traced back to Lester Brown of the World Watch Institute. 22 The popularisation of the term is commonly attributed to an influential study by a researcher from the United Nations Environmental Programme (UNEP), El-Hinnawi (1985) (see McLeman R. & Gemenne, F. 2018, p.10). 23 Notably in terms of the scope of phenomenon. 24 See for a prominent voice in the debate and at the same time representing a new consensus Foresight (2011), p. 34.

KEY FINDINGS Climate change is an important driver of environmental change, but not all environmental change can be attributed to climate change. The present report thus uses the more general term environmental change. The impact of environmental change on migration and displacement is complex. Environmental change interacts with and is mediated by other drivers of migration. The concepts \u2018environmental migration\u2019 and \u2018environmental migrant\u2019 are thus only a shortcut for expressing that environmental factors have played a crucial role. Displacement following environmental events such as a drought (a \u2018slow-onset event\u2019) or a flood (a \u2018sudden-onset event\u2019) presents a more tangible category, raising specific practical and legal questions in the context of migration and asylum policies. The present report uses the umbrella term \u2018environmental migration and displacement\u2019 to denote individuals affected in some way or another by the nexus of environmental change and migration.

Discussing related attempts to estimate the numbers of \u2018environmental migrants,\u2019 the report argued that these are \u201cmethodologically unsound, as migration is a multi-causal phenomenon and it is problematic to assign a proportion of the actual or predicted number of migrants as moving as a direct result of environmental change.\u201d 27 The Foresight study criticised what it called \u2018deterministic approaches\u2019 to infer the number of migrants from the number of populations likely to be affected by environmental change, arguing that such an approach neglects human agency in dealing with environmental change and constraining factors influencing migration outcomes. By contrast, the Foresight study advocated for an approach that focuses on the impact of environmental change on drivers of migration , and thus on changes to the volume of migration resulting from environmental change, as plotted in Figure 2, below.

The most important point here is that it may be moot to try to arrive at a conceptual definition that captures environmental factors as single causes of any migration (or forced displacement, for that matter). At the same time, there is a need to have terms to denote both processes of migration and displacement related to environmental changes and individuals involved in these processes, whatever the real weight of environmental factors \u2013 amongst other drivers \u2013 are. Following the usage in the Routledge Handbook of Environmental Displacement and Migration , we will generally speak of \u2018 environmental migration and displacement \u2019 when we refer to the overall nexus of environmental change and migration \u2013 \u2018migration\u2019 here understood as an overarching term referring to a change of residence between different locations for a certain period of time. Reflecting the terminological debates mentioned above, and maintaining a basic differentiation between voluntary and involuntary migration, we propose to distinguish between \u2018environmental migration\u2019 on the one hand and \u2018environmental displacement\u2019 on the other. We refer to environmental migration (labelled environmentally induced migration in table 1 below) when we refer to (more) voluntary migration where environmental factors somewhat play a role, and refer to environmental displacement (called environmentally induced displacement in table 1 below), where some form of coerced movement takes place, recognising, at the same time, that the distinction between \u2018forced\u2019 and \u2018voluntary\u2019 is extremely blurry, as is also discussed in more detail below in chapter 3. Following the Foresight Study, we distinguish between environmental changes attributable to climate change and non-climatic changes, such as land and coastal and marine ecosystem degradation attributable to human factors (see box 1). 28 We use the term environmental change (as opposed to the more specific term environmental degradation) for two main reasons: first, the term \u2018environmental change\u2019 is the most widely used term in debates on migration and environment, and secondly, it is a more neutral concept covering a wider range of situations. Box 1: Environmental change vs. climate change 28 Foresight (2011), p.39. The Foresight Study defines environmental changes as \u201c[c]hanges in the physical and biogeochemical (chemical, geological, and biological) environment, over a large scale, either caused naturally or influenced by human activities,\u201d thus including both changes attributable to climate change and changes that are not. In contrast, climate change is defined as \u201c[t]he change of climate which is attributed directly or indirectly to human activity that alters the composition of the global atmosphere and which is in addition to natural climate variability observed over comparable time periods.\u201d ",
        "Climate Change and Migration PE 655.591 23 Source: Foresight (2011), p.233. The key conclusion from the distinction between environmental changes attributable to climate change and those which are not is that we should speak of climate change-induced migration and displacement only if the underlying phenomena \u2013 such as a drought, a flood or a hurricane \u2013 can be attributed to climate change. A second set of key concepts are the concept of \u2018 slow-onset \u2019 and \u2018rapid\u2019 or \u2018sudden-onset events\u2019. 29 \u2018Slow-onset events\u2019 include gradual environmental changes such as drought, sea-level rise or soil erosion. \u2018Sudden-onset events\u2019 include extreme weather events such as flooding or storms. 30 Both sudden- and slow-onset events can imply forced displacement: While forced displacement related to environmental hazards is usually associated with disasters such as typhoons or flooding (and thus \u2018sudden-onset events\u2019), more gradual forms of adverse environmental change such as severe drought or sea-level rise can also induce displacement, with the case of inhabited islands whose existence is threatened by sea-level rise being the most extreme example. 31 In many cases, however, such gradual environmental change may only be one amongst several factors triggering movement. Environmental factors may thus play a role in migration decisions but do intersect with other motivations. While such \u2018voluntary migrants\u2019 32 may not require particular protection, policymakers still need to be aware of environmental drivers as they may affect the volume and nature of migration Table 1: Typology of environmental migration and displacement Category Cause of movement Nature of movement Protection Challenges Environmentally induced temporary displacement Sudden-onset events; Slow-onset events Temporary displacement within national borders; Temporary cross-border displacement Cross-border displacement: Temporary, humanitarian protection; Internal displacement within countries: Limited internal protection Environmentally induced long- term displacement Sudden-onset events (if recovery of the impacted area is slow and ineffective); Slow-onset events (no alternative livelihood possible) Long-term cross-border displacement; Long-term internal displacement Cross-border displacement: Access to protection, access to durable solutions (resettlement, local integration, voluntary return); Internal displacement: Limited internal protection; access to durable solutions (resettlement, local integration, voluntary return) 29 The relevant literature also often uses the term \u201chazard\u201d as a more general term. 30 Kraler et al.

In this context, it is revealing that both the academic literature and related policy discussions do not limit themselves to the field of environmental migration and displacement narrowly speaking when discussing protection gaps and challenges. Indeed, key examples of policy challenges that have been discussed in the literature \u2013 such as responses to the 2010 earthquake in Haiti \u2013 are not related to environmental changes, let alone climate change. 33 Others, like the Fukushima disaster in March 2011, escape an easy categorisation, being the result of a combination of a geophysical event (an earthquake provoking a Tsunami) and a nuclear accident leading to the long-term contamination of large areas. 34 Recognising that a specific causality might be less important for recognising protection challenges, important initiatives such as the Nansen Initiative have also gradually moved to address disaster-related cross-border displacement in general. 35 Oxford-based scholar Alexander Betts has suggested dropping references to causality altogether, as for him the specific cause is unimportant in assessing protection needs. Rather, he suggests using the broader category of what he terms \u2018survival migration\u2019, relating to \u201cpersons who are outside their country of origin because of an existential threat for which they have no access to a domestic remedy or resolution.\u201d 36 While the concept of \u2018survival migration\u2019 in a sense only shifts some of the difficult questions of scope and thresholds for protection, a key point indeed is that there are a number of high-impact situations , including but not limited to environmental change, that have the capacity to influence drivers of migration or indeed forcibly displace persons from their habitual places of residence or countries of origin , or, in a related way, hinder them from returning. The ongoing Covid- 19 crisis, which has prompted a number of countries to adopt regularisation measures and other measures to protect migrants stranded in countries under lockdown, is a case in point. 37 More practically, the IDMC has collected data on disaster-related internal displacement since 2011 (with reference years 2008-2010). Disaster-related displacement covers a wider range of causes than environmental displacement.

For example, the locust plague affecting several countries in East Africa ongoing at the time of writing can be linked to the impact of climate change, and specifically the increased frequency of extreme weather events \u2013 in this case unusually wet conditions over prolonged periods of time on the Arab peninsula. 38 Thus, while capturing a number of clear-cut cases of movement that can be attributed to high-impact environmental changes, some basic conceptual problems associated with the notions of environmental migration and displacement remain.

This report will use the umbrella term \u2018environmental migration and displacement\u2019 as an indicative context helping to denote individuals somehow affected by the nexus of environmental change and migration. We distinguish between environmental migration to refer to voluntary forms of migration where environmental factors somewhat play a role, on the one hand, and environmental displacement, where some form of coerced movement \u2013 following a severe environmental event \u2013 has taken place, on the other.

THE IMPACT OF CLIMATE CHANGE ON MIGRATION, MOBILITY AND DISPLACEMENT In this chapter, we review recent evidence regarding overall trends in climate change and its impact on migration, mobility and displacement. We start with a brief description of overall trends in climate change and its effects on a number of areas. In section 3.2, we discuss the impact of climate change on migration and mobility, discussing environmental change and environmental shocks as drivers of migration, including its scale, environmental change and mobility and migration as adaptation. Section 3.3 provides a conclusion for the chapter. 3.1. Trends in climate change The most recent statement by the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) on the State of the Global Climate suggests an accelerated pace of climate change , noting that 2019 was the warmest year on record and each decade since 1980 has been warmer than the decade before. Greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere reached record levels in 2018, a trend that continued in 2019. While the oceans absorb an important share of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) emissions, CO 2 absorption KEY FINDINGS Climate change is likely to increase the likelihood of a number of natural hazards, which in turn will have significant effects on migration drivers and migration outcomes. Slow-onset environmental change affects migration outcomes largely indirectly \u2013 through its impact on social, economic and political factors. While disasters frequently involve direct threats to the life and safety of those affected and thus have a more direct effect, disasters too have substantial indirect effects spurring movement. They also affect more vulnerable populations disproportionally. Existing estimates of environmental migration and displacement are problematic on several counts. They tend to assume a straightforward attribution of causality, are often unclear as to their temporal reference and rarely are based on a transparent methodology. By contrast, in our view, the Internal Displacement Monitoring Centre\u2019s tracking of disaster-related internal displacement provides a robust evidence base for any further development of global estimates on disaster-related displacement that would include both internal and cross-border displacement.\" Environmental change not only may act as a driver of mobility, but also of immobility. In addition, it may adversely affect immobilised populations, such as persons in protracted displacement situations as a result of conflict, persecution or violence. Migration should also be recognised as an adaption strategy. While the frame of \u2018migration as adaptation\u2019 is not without risk, migration needs to be part of the solution both in respect to internal and cross-border situations. ",

In addition, ocean heat levels (\u2018ocean heat content\u2019) reached record levels in 2019, which in turn contributed to the melting of sea ice and sea- level rise, exacerbated by the melting of ice on land. The global mean sea level in 2019 was the highest since high precision measurements began in 1993. 39 While climate change is a global problem, the impacts of climate change are unevenly distributed and are most heavily felt in poorer countries . This bigger impact is partly because of greater exposure to climate-related hazards (such as flooding or droughts), but to a large extent also because of greater vulnerability (e.g. importance of agriculture for livelihoods and economies) and more limited resilience (e.g. more limited state capacity and reliance on community adaption). 40 Climate change, i.e. the rise in global average temperatures as a result of greenhouse gas emissions, is a complex phenomenon involving a number of interrelated yet distinct changes. The contribution of climate change to these different environmental changes is increasingly well documented. New approaches and powerful models for assessing the contribution of climate change to diverse environmental changes and for individual environmental events (\u201cattribution studies\u201d) demonstrate the important role of climate change in ongoing changes while also allowing scientists to better predict future outcomes. 41 The Foresight study on distinguishes six types of climate-related environmental changes, including: \u2022 Sea-level rise leading to higher risks of coastal flooding, erosion and salinisation of low-lying agricultural land; \u2022 a rise in tropical cyclone and storm intensity; \u2022 changes in rainfall regimes, impacting agricultural productivity; \u2022 an increase in temperatures and related higher frequency of extreme temperatures, involving risks to health as well as more frequent and intense wildfires, etc.; \u2022 a change of atmospheric chemistry affecting crop productivity as well as productivity of marine and coastal ecosystems; and \u2022 the melting of mountain glaciers affecting the exposure of mountain regions to hazards. In addition, however, the Foresight study also highlights non-climate related changes, notably land degradation and coastal and marine ecosystem degradation caused by human factors. 42 All these environmental changes are likely to influence \u2018migration drivers\u2019, that is the \u201c[c]omplex set of interlinking factors that influence an individual, family or population group\u2019s decisions relating to migration, including displacement.\u201d 43 These drivers then will shape migration outcomes. 39 World Meteorological Organization (2020), p. 5. 40 See Hallegate & Rozemberg (2017), p.255 and Jaffry, Mikulewicz & Helwig (2019), p.2. 41 See Scott for a short discussion of different approaches used in attribution studies (2016). 42 Foresight (2011), p.51f. 43 This is the definition in IOM\u2019s 2019 edition of the Glossary on Migration (IOM, 2019, p.58).

        "Climate Change and Migration PE 655.591 29 3.2. Key impacts 3.2.1. Environmental change as a driver of migration Since the beginning of academic and policy debates on climate and broader processes of environmental change and migration, the main focus has been the impact of environmental change on increased levels of migration, including displacement. The expectation that environmental change impacts migration dynamics is, generally, supported by available evidence . 44 But this evidence is more nuanced than some of the \u2018alarmist\u2019 voices in the debate on environmental change and migration, who warn that dozens, if not hundreds of millions, of people will be uprooted by climate change in the years and decades to come, would indicate. 45 Scholars have criticised the underlying \u2018environmental determinism\u2019 informing such views, the framing of migration as an involuntary uprooting of now stable populations and the related neglect of existing migration dynamics and patterns. 46 A notable recent example for this alarmist viewpoint is a study associating climate change, drought, internal migration and the outbreak of the conflict in Syria by a group of climate scientists in 2015 that was widely picked up by the media and policymakers and which, in the midst of the unfolding \u2018migration and refugee crisis\u2019 in Europe, suggested that mass migration due to climate change was already happening. Critical reviews of the study later highlighted that the study quickly jumped to conclusions where evidence was lacking. 47 Nevertheless, there are clear links between environmental change and migration . Thus, a recent review of the academic literature on drivers of migration finds that environmental drivers indeed seem to impact migration dynamics, although studies have largely focused on developing countries in the Global South. Thus, slow-onset changes in temperatures and precipitation are associated with out- migration from affected areas. However, studies generally find that environmental factors mostly affect migration decisions indirectly, e.g. through the impact on income and wages. 48 Another review of recent literature comes to a similar conclusion, finding that existing studies show a significant impact of climate change on both international and internal migration, noting that \u201crising temperatures, in agriculture-dependent countries in particular, tend to induce out-migration,\u201d often mediated through wages and agricultural productivity. 49 The study observes mixed results for natural disasters, with almost no effects on international migration but significant effects on long-term internal migration in the case of especially severe disasters (such as Hurricane Katrina), overall suggesting that the impact of disasters seems to be short term, with no significant international spill-over, a finding also 44 See for example Flavell et al. 2019, Foresight (2011), Ionesco et al.

However, the impact on other factors \u201csuch as incomes, livelihood opportunities, and food security\u201d can be significant. If these indirect effects are factored into the analysis, the impact of environmental changes is often larger. 51 Thus, while individuals may still see their migration decisions primarily as economically motivated, deteriorating environmental conditions can be linked to migration dynamics by analysing the impact of environmental change on the economy . Disasters such as floods, storms or droughts involve direct threats to life and security for those affected by them. While the impact of disasters may appear to be more immediate, their impact is similarly mediated by socio-economic factors shaping individuals\u2019 and communities\u2019 vulnerability to be adversely affected by environmental shocks, as well as their resilience in the face of these. 52 For example, a flood may pose a direct threat to life when dwellings are flooded and become uninhabitable. The flooding of fields or factories, in contrast, poses a threat to the livelihoods of populations in affected areas. A decision to move elsewhere in order to maintain a family income may appear to be a voluntary decision but is clearly dictated by the circumstances. 53 Put in more general terms, disasters may also affect other drivers of migration , such as employment prospects or market accessibility, 54 and therefore the ability to stay in an area . However, also in the context of classic situations of forced displacement due to violence, conflict and persecution, environmental factors may play a role. The interaction between conflict or persecution and environmental factors as drivers of displacement has so far been rarely studied, with the exception of indirect links between environmental change and conflict-related displacement, as in the case of Syria discussed above. 55 However, a recent study commissioned by UNHCR, although primarily concerned with how countries of first asylum used refugee law frameworks to respond to disasters, demonstrates how the 2010-11 drought and ensuing famine in Somalia led to renewed outflows from the country and intersected with ongoing insecurity. 56 3.2.2. Environmental change and immobility Importantly, environmental change may also cause significant levels of immobility . Indeed, one of the central messages of the 2011 Foresight report was that people might become trapped in areas of high vulnerability to environmental hazards, noting that \u201ca significant group of people living in environmentally prone locations in the future face a double jeopardy: they will be unable to move away 50 See Berlemann & Steinhardt (2017), p.378 51 Czaika & Reinprecht (2020), p.15. 52 See for a discussion of natural hazards, crises and vulnerability and resilience Hendow et al.

Immobility is related both to abilities (such as financial means, social capital \u2013 that is networks in other places or the lack thereof, as well as physical abilities and perceived employability) as well as migration aspirations. Aspirations, in turn, may be shaped by (perceived) abilities but also positive and negative place attachment. 58 A recent survey-based study examining migrant-sending areas in highland Peru affected by climate-related changes highlights that place attachment, rather than resource constraints, explain immobility in that specific context, questioning the underestimation of individuals\u2019 agency in the notion of \u2018trapped populations\u2019 put forward by the Foresight study and emphasising that immobility, too, needs to be understood along a continuum. 59 In some contexts, the decisions to stay put may also be a response to specific opportunities arising out of situations of environmental change for specific categories of people. 60 A major concern in debates on \u2018trapped populations\u2019 has been that populations are willing to move and feel the need to move, but are unable to do so. 61 The Foresight study thus highlighted, among others, the case of Somali pastoralists who were unable to relocate elsewhere in response to drought because of ongoing conflict and insecurity, thus preventing pastoralists from utilising traditional adaptation strategies in times of drought. 62 The case of Somalia also highlights the intersection of classical issues of international protection and protection issues brought about by environmental change. In summary, existing evidence shows that environmental change impacts migration drivers. In general terms, four migration outcomes can be distinguished: migration, displacement, being trapped and voluntary immobility (see figure 3, below). 57 Foresight (2011), p.29. 58 See Zickgraf (2018). 59 See Adams (2017).

Empirical dimensions of environmental migration and displacement Since the mid-1980s, a series of estimates have been put forward on the volume of migration likely to be engendered by adverse environmental changes, generally focused on migration resulting from slow- onset events. 63 A review of estimates conducted in the framework of the 2011 Foresight study found existing estimates lacking on several counts . First, conceptually they were often based on vague definitions of environmental migration and/or displacement; most lacked a clear methodology how estimates were reached, while some were simply updated extrapolations of problematic base estimates suggested by earlier contributions to the debate. Finally, their temporal reference and the nature of the figure (whether they should be understood as flows or stocks) often remained unclear. 64 Recent critiques of such estimates also note that their purpose seems primarily targeted at drawing attention and presenting potential migration engendered by environmental change in general and climate change in particular as a security risk. 65 More importantly, efforts to estimate the scale of environmental migration and displacement in general often rest on a simplistic equation of populations affected by environmental change (\u201cexposure\u201d) and populations at risk of migrating . A recent study examining the correlation between extreme weather events and asylum applications in the EU arguing that asylum applications will increase in the future due to global warming can be criticised on similar grounds, namely by a simplistic interpretation of correlations found between extreme weather events and migration flows. 66 As result of the impossibility of singling out environmental drivers as a factor in migration movements, the Foresight study and similar stocktaking exercises have thus limited themselves to providing estimates 63 Flavell (2019), p.39. 64 Gemenne (2011). 65 See Boas et al.

Some of the basic conceptual and methodological issues remain, but they are often not so different from those related to internal displacement due to violence and conflict, notably as regards the question of where to draw the line between voluntary migration and displacement (see the discussion in section 3.2.1, above). IDMC collects data on both current displacement and displacement risk, defined as probable annual disaster displacement with a ten-year perspective. The IDMC estimates of current displacement cover new disaster-related displacement in a given calendar year. In addition, the data are classified by broad hazard category (weather related vs. geophysical events), which is further broken down into specific hazard types (such as floods, storms, wildfires, etc.). IDMC\u2019s \u201cweather related\u201d category corresponds to the notion of \u201cenvironmental change\u201d in general and \u201cenvironmental events\u201d in particular used for the present report. Importantly, the number of displaced persons due to weather-related disasters cannot be taken as numbers of displaced persons due to climate change. For this to happen, individual weather-related disasters would have to be assessed as to whether they would have happened in the absence of climate change \u2013 a question that so called \u2018attribution studies\u2019 seek to answer (see above). At the same time, there is robust evidence on the increasing frequency and severity of extreme weather events and displacement caused by weather related disasters; 68 it is thus a relevant statistical indicator. As figure 4 (below) indicates, the scale of new displacement caused by disasters outstrips by far new displacement caused by conflict and violence. At the same time, the figures also show the volatility of disaster-related displacement, which is due to a number of factors, most importantly the type, severity and the geography of the event, i.e. whether it strikes in a densely populated area or not. 67 See Flavell et al. (2019), p.12 for a brief discussion. 68 See Flavell et al (2019), p.39. ",

Migration as adaptation The 2011 Foresight report and several academic papers building on it 74 were particularly influential in promoting a perspective that considered migration in the context of environmental change not as a problem whose root causes must be fought but as an adaptation strategy to adverse environmental changes and part of the solution . 75 While the role of migration in adapting to environmental change had already been made apparent by a number of earlier studies, 76 the Foresight report was particularly influential in promoting the perspective amongst policymakers, including the European Commission, whose 2013 Staff Working Paper on \u2018Climate change, environmental degradation, and migration\u2019 drew heavily on the report. 77 The focus on \u2018migration as adaptation\u2019 has 73 IDMC (2019b). 74 See in particular Black et al.

In more general terms, the \u201cmigration as adaption\u201d perspective shows that migration can be used as a means to an end, in the same way as migration has been shown to have positive effects on human development. 81 Based on ample evidence that migration presented a standard coping strategy vis-\u00e0-vis environmental changes, 82 the Foresight report recommended the creation of policies enabling affected populations to embrace migration as a coping strategy, while \u2013 as a last resort \u2013 also developing policies regarding planned relocation 83 in contexts where areas become inhabitable in a longer term, whether as a result of slow- or sudden-onset events. Directed mainly at internal situations, the conclusions of the Foresight study nevertheless have broader ramifications and also raise the question of broader mobility options across international borders, whether in a regional or a more global context. The study itself recommended enhancing livelihoods, including by migration, facilitating temporary and circular labour migration and remittances and utilising migration as an insurance strategy against risks associated with environmental change. 84 3.3. Conclusions This chapter has provided a review of the existing evidence on migration, mobility and displacement. It has shown that climate change is likely to increase the likelihood of a number of natural hazards, which in turn will have significant effects on migration drivers . In most situations, environmental events do not per se trigger migration. Even in the case of disasters, movement is often a response to consequences of the disaster rather than a response to a life-threatening situation as such, and thus is mediated by a variety of social, economic and political factors . Importantly, the impact of environmental changes is highly differentiated and generally affects vulnerable populations disproportionately . 78 See the landing page of IOM\u2019s Migration, Environment and Climate Change division at https://www.iom.int/migration-and-climate- change, which mentions the promotion of migration as climate change as one three focus areas in that area \u2013 alongside prevention of forced migration in the context of environmental change and assistance to forcibly displaced due to environmental factors.

        "Climate Change and Migration PE 655.591 39 This chapter has highlighted the focus of much of the debate on environmental migration and displacement on the role of environmental change in general and climate change in particular on triggering migration. Existing estimates put forward, largely by climate scientists, have been shown to be problematic and resting on a simplistic and deterministic understanding of the relationship between environmental change and migration , typically lacking basic quality criteria such as precision of the concept to be measured and transparent methodology. However, for over a decade, IDMC has been collecting data on current disaster-related displacement. Since 2020, data on total stocks of disaster-related internal displacement are also available. This data collection provides a robust and continuously improved evidence base that should be the basis for any further development of data on global disaster-related displacement. Apart from the expansion of existing data collection to cover more types of displacement \u2013 such as has happened with the recent addition of drought-related displacement \u2013 data collection could be extended to cover cross-border displacement. IDMC\u2019s disaster displacement risk modelling offers a promising avenue for assessing future risks of disaster-related displacement, including assessing the likely impact of climate change on weather-related disaster displacement. As this chapter has shown, environmental change cannot only act as a driver of mobility, it may also trigger significant immobility. In addition, it may adversely affect immobilised populations, such as persons in protracted displacement situations as a result of conflict, persecution or violence. Finally, migration also needs to be seen as part of the solution and not just as an effect of environmental change . The notion of \u2018migration as adaptation\u2019 highlights the need to embrace the idea that mobility, including cross-border mobility, can and indeed needs to be part of responses to adverse environmental changes and provides another rationale \u2013 apart from economic or development-related reasons \u2013 to promote migration.

FILLING A GAP: INTERNATIONAL POLICY INITIATIVES ADDRESSING PROTECTION IN THE CONTEXT OF ENVIRONMENTAL MIGRATION AND DISPLACEMENT Since the publication of the 2011 European Parliament study, the link between migration, mobility and climate change has moved from the margins of policy debates at the international level to a more prominent place both in the context of specific debates on climate change and those related to migration and forced displacement, as well as broader conversations about humanitarian and development assistance. These issues have been touched upon in a series of initiatives, including new formats for exchanging practices and supporting policy development and the creation of (mostly) soft law instruments considering environmental displacement. This chapter KEY FINDINGS Environmental migration and displacement has become an increasingly visible topic in international policy discussions and initiatives. Efforts to address the issue can be seen in frameworks, guidance and other action in the fields of migration and displacement, climate change and disaster and humanitarian and development assistance. In the field of migration and displacement, much of these efforts focus on cross-border displacement. The state-led Nansen Initiative has been particularly active both globally and regionally in strengthening protection for environmentally displaced persons, although it does not focus on slow- onset disasters. Meanwhile, the Global Compact for Safe, Orderly and Regular Migration has raised the profile of environmental drivers of migration and ways to address them through international cooperation. Preventing and responding to environmentally induced displacement has been part of broader global discussions on climate change and disasters, notably through the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and its Paris Climate Conference as well as the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015-2030. The issue is also on the agenda of humanitarian and development actors, as reflected in the 2030 Sustainable Development Agenda and 2016 World Humanitarian Summit and Platform on Disaster Displacement. In addition to such global initiatives, several regional initiatives, especially in Africa and Latin America, as well as national-level efforts, particularly in the Pacific, represent important steps in strengthening frameworks for protection in the context of environmental migration and displacement. While this momentum has led to progress in filling protection gaps, the largely voluntary nature of these initiatives and the need to effectively implement them all remain key challenges to an effective response \u2013 amid expectations that climate change will continue.

        "Climate Change and Migration PE 655.591 41 summarises the progress of debates and actions at the international level and reviews major milestones in different arenas in which environmental migration and displacement has been addressed. Figure 8: Milestones in the global governance of environmental migration and displacement, 2011 \u2013 2020 Source: authors\u2019 compilation and Camilla Fogli, ICMPD With climate change expected to become an increasingly important issue, a range of multilateral initiatives have endeavoured to strengthen protections for those displaced for environmental reasons and to foster the resilience of those who could potentially be displaced. The Nansen Initiative was the first global initiative addressing cross-border movements in this context, spurring and inspiring many of the efforts that followed. In addition, both IOM and UNHCR have taken up the topic and both helped to support state-led initiatives and addressed it in their ongoing work. IOM has worked on environmental migration in its operations, research, policy and advocacy activities. These efforts centre around its three overarching objectives on this topic: minimising involuntary and unmanaged migration; supporting and protecting forced migrants; and promoting migration as a climate change adaptation strategy. 85 While it has worked on the migration-environment-climate change nexus since the 1990s, MSs first requested that IOM report on its work in this area in 2007. In 2015, the agency created the Migration, Environment and Climate Change Division to spearhead work on the subject. 86 Its work includes: 87 \u2022 participating in global processes, including the Global Compact for Safe, Orderly and Regular Migration (GCM), United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification, Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction, 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and Global Forum on Migration and Development, as well as regional dialogues; 85 See https://environmentalmigration.iom.int/iom-and-migration-environment-and-climate-change-mecc. 86 IOM (2019c), p. 2. 87 IOM (2019c).

Recognising that environmental and climate change will become increasingly important to migration governance, IOM has incorporated the issue into its 2019-2023 Strategic Vision. 88 As with IOM, UNHCR has long paid attention to environmental change and displacement, often with a specific focus on the nexus of forced displacement under its mandate and environmental change. Recognising that forcibly displaced persons depend on the environment for food, warmth and shelter, and that the scarcity of natural resources can spark competition or worse, the agency has undertaken efforts to strengthen sustainable management of the environment, decrease environmental degradation and improve the availability of resources for displaced persons and host communities. Meanwhile, given the scale of displacement in disaster contexts, climate change and disasters have become an increasing concern for UNHCR, and the agency has worked to respond to relevant protection challenges. 89 UNHCR has been working on displacement in the context of climate change since the mid-2000s, and its efforts in this area have included: \u2022 supporting states in devising legal and policy approaches to extend protections to those displaced by climate change, including through state-led initiatives such as the Nansen Initiative and Platform on Disaster Displacement (PDD); \u2022 drafting guidelines for temporary protections; \u2022 promoting policy coherence regarding protection across frameworks such as the Global Compacts, Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction; \u2022 providing technical assistance to the UNFCCC and other support in international fora; 90 \u2022 participating in responses to natural disasters, including in interagency responses to disaster- induced internal displacement; 91 \u2022 developing, with partners, guidance regarding planned relocation; and \u2022 conducting research aimed at filling gaps and informing policy and operations. 92 88 IOM (2019b). 89 See https://www.unhcr.org/en-us/environment-disasters-and-climate-change.html. 90 UNHCR (2017c). 91 UNHCR (2019) l. 92 See https://www.unhcr.org/en-us/climate-change-and- disasters.html#:~:text=UNHCR%20recognizes%20that%20the%20consequences,and%20other%20people%20of%20concern.&text=It% 20recognizes%20that%20'climate%2C%20environmental,of%20climate%20change%20are%20numerous.

Multilateral development banks have also been active in this space to varying degrees, illustrating that a range of international organisations are incorporating environmental displacement into their strategy development and programming. As international and regional initiatives have gained momentum, they have enhanced ways in which policymakers and other stakeholders think about and respond to the issue of environmental displacement, including through information sharing, the development of practical recommendations and capacity-building efforts . They have also underscored the utility of international cooperation to address the issue of environmental migration and displacement and have helped to fill in key gaps , particularly related to concrete guidance and strategies for policymakers. However, the voluntary and fragmented nature of most of these efforts and the need to effectively implement them remain key challenges to responding to environmental migration and displacement. Meanwhile, all signs point to continued implications for displacement and other forms of migration in the context of climate change, necessitating an effective protection response. 4.1. Background: International protection instruments in the context of environmental displacement The international refugee regime, enshrined in the 1951 Refugee Convention , defines a refugee as a person who, owing to a well-founded fear of being persecuted for reasons of race, religion, nationality, political opinion or membership of a particular social group, is outside his or her country of nationality (or habitual residence for stateless persons) and is unable or, owing to such fear, unwilling to avail himself or herself of the protection of that country. 96 To enjoy the protection given by the Convention, a person must fulfil all elements of the refugee definition. According to most commentators of international refugee law, there are a number of difficulties in applying the 1951 Refugee Convention in the context of natural disasters. 97 Two main arguments (among others) that have 93 Platform on Disaster Displacement (2018a), p.10; UNHCR (2017b), p.18.. 94 See https://www.un.org/internal-displacement-panel/content/high-level-panel. 95 See https://www.undp.org/content/undp/en/home/2030-agenda-for-sustainable-development/prosperity/recovery-solutions-and- human-mobility/migration-and-displacement.html. 96 Art 1A 1951 Convention Relating to Status of Refugees. 97 Scott referring to various court decisions and the understanding articulated by Dr Jacob Robinson, Israeli Ambassador Plenipotentiary to the Refugee Convention at the Twenty-Second Meeting of the Conference of Plenipotentiaries remarking that the refugee definition \u2018obviously did not refer to refugees from natural disasters (Scott (2020) chapter 1.2.); see also UNHCR at ",
        "IPOL | Policy Department for Citizens\u2019 Rights and Constitutional Affairs 44 PE 655.591 been raised in this discussion are: 1) that natural disasters do not discriminate, while this is an integral feature of the refugee definition 98 and 2) it is difficult to identify a persecutor in environmentally induced cases. 99 The inoperability of the refugee definition for environmental claims has been also acknowledged by the former High Commissioner for Refugees, Antonio Guterres, who stated that \u2018adopting the terminology of \"climate refugees\" \u201cor \"environmental refugees\" would only complicate and confuse UNHCR's efforts to protect victims of persecution and armed conflict.\u2019 100 Among other reasons, he referred to the lack of a \u201cpersecutor\u201d and the \u201cindiscriminate nature\u201d of its impact. 101 Still, some people affected by climate change have based their claims on the Refugee Convention (see below section 5.3.5). In contrast, regional refugee protection instruments in Africa and Latin America employ a wider refugee definition. The 1969 Organization of African Unity (OAU) Refugee Convention also extends protection to \u201cevery person who, owing to external aggression, occupation, foreign domination or events seriously disturbing public order in either part or the whole of his country of origin or nationality, is compelled to leave his place of habitual residence in order to seek refuge in another place outside his country of origin or nationality.\u201d While the transposition of the OAU convention in national law by signatory states is far from complete, some African countries applied the OAU Convention\u2019s expanded definition on a prima facie basis to Somalis who were victims of famine threats and unable to receive assistance from domestic authorities. 102 Additionally, Ethiopia endorsed the Protection Agenda 103 to open its borders to persons compelled to leave their place of habitual residence due to natural disasters, while Kenya welcomed some 200,000 Somalis fleeing such calamities without invoking the OAU Convention. 104 In a similar vein, the 1984 Cartagena Declaration on Refugees uses a definition of refugees that is broader than the 1951 Refugee Convention and as the OAU convention includes a reference to persons fleeing \u2018other circumstances which have seriously disturbed public order.\u2019 105 While this provides flexibility for states, who may wish to apply the definition to those displaced due to natural or environmental disasters, such an application is not necessarily required . 106 While the aforementioned instruments outline protections for cross-border movements, it was not until 1998 that international standards were reached for IDPs.

        "Climate Change and Migration PE 655.591 45 the non-binding Guiding Principles on Internal Displacement were ultimately created under the auspices of Representative of the UN Secretary General on IDPs Francis Deng after a multi-year process. 107 The Guiding Principles lay out 30 standards for protection, taking and adjusting principles from human rights and humanitarian law and applying them to IDPs; while non-binding, they are based on and consistent with binding laws and have gained significant traction among the international community as a useful tool for addressing internal displacement. 108 For instance, among others, the Guiding Principles form the basis for the Inter-Agency Standing Committee (IASC) Framework on Durable Solutions for Internally Displaced Persons. 109 The Guiding Principles define IDPs as persons who were compelled to leave their homes or habitual residences, \u2018in particular as a result of or in order to avoid the effects of armed conflict, situations of generalised violence, violations of human rights or natural or human-made disasters, and who have not crossed an internationally recognised State border.\u2019 110 The Guiding Principles thus also apply to internal displacement caused by environmental events . 111 They do not foresee a specific status for IDPs, as these people are expected to be able to enjoy the same rights as other citizens and legal residents in a country. But they do spell out a number of specific protections that are particularly relevant in the context of internal displacement, such as the prohibition from arbitrary displacement, including arbitrary evacuation in the case of disasters or the obligation of authorities to prioritise all feasible alternatives to displacement (principle 7). 112 The Guiding Principles do not explicitly consider indirect causes for migration, for example the economic consequences of disasters. As a result, it is not always clear who exactly falls under them. 113 This question is not just an academic question, but may become relevant, for example, when state authorities decide who should be eligible for IDP assistance programmes. The voluntary nature of these guidelines means that they are only binding if states incorporate them into their domestic laws. By June 2020, the Global Database on IDP Laws and Policies 114 recorded 26 IDP laws (i.e. binding regulations) in 14 countries and 60 policies (i.e. guidelines outlining the main goals of the government) in 36 countries. An analysis of IDP laws and policies revealed that a minority, about one-third, addressed disaster-related displacement. 115 More broadly, although the Guiding Principles have been seen as an important tool that could be leveraged to strengthen protections for this population from, during and following displacement, for several reasons, efforts largely continue to focus on addressing protection in the context of cross-border rather than internal displacement, as illustrated by the initiatives explored in this section. 116 While the Guiding Principles provide recommendations on responding to internal environmental displacement, to date there is no established global instrument that would address cross-border 107 See for the guiding principlesOCHA (1998). ; For an early commentary by one of the experts involved in the drafting see Cohen (2001) 108 Cohen (2001) 109 Bradley et al.

The international legal landscape therefore leaves a protection gap regarding people who are forced to flee their country of origin (or habitual residence) due to environmental reasons and who are not protected by regional instruments. Thus, it is because of the lack of a dedicated legal instrument that would allow people affected by climate change to cross an external border in order to seek refuge that people have sought to use existing international protection frameworks to seek refuge in other countries. 117 4.2.

        "IPOL | Policy Department for Citizens\u2019 Rights and Constitutional Affairs 48 PE 655.591 4.2.1. Global initiatives Since the 2011 report, several state-led, global initiatives have addressed the issue of environmental migration and displacement. The Nansen Initiative in particular has played a key role in this regard. 4.2.1.1. The Nansen Initiative and related efforts The Nansen Initiative was established to help address the protection gap for persons displaced across borders as a result of disasters and climate change. Its work builds on the 2010 UNFCCC Cancun Agreements, which call for ways to strengthen knowledge and collaboration regarding climate change and displacement, as well as conclusions of the 2011 Nansen Conference on Climate Change and Displacement. 118 Following the 2011 Nansen Conference, Norway and Switzerland committed to working towards a more coordinated approach to addressing the protection needs of those displaced across borders due to disasters and climate change at the 2011 UNHCR Ministerial Conference. 119 The Nansen Initiative was then launched as a state-led project with the support of additional countries and stakeholders in 2012. 120 The Initiative has undertaken a range of state-led consultations with government and civil society stakeholders in five regions of the globe. These were then brought together for a global discussion in 2015. Rather than creating new legal obligations or standards, the Nansen Initiative has worked to foster a global consensus on components of a protection agenda for those displaced across borders by natural disasters and climate change, which could then be used to craft various laws and agreements at different levels. 121 The work of the Nansen Initiative culminated in the Agenda for the Protection of Cross-Border Displaced Persons in the Context of Disasters and Climate Change (\u2018Protection Agenda\u2019), which was endorsed by 109 government delegations in 2015. 122 This document consolidates findings from the regional consultations and meetings and was developed as a toolbox for states and other stakeholders responding to cross-border displacement. It aims to support these actors by offering a framework for a comprehensive response before, during and after displacement, and includes examples of good practices for temporary and long-term solutions while also exploring gaps and challenges. The Agenda focuses on cross-border displacement, looking at the admission and stay of persons moving across borders as well as not returning those already present in a foreign country. However, it also addresses IDPs and ways in which countries of origin can manage risks of displacement through reducing vulnerability and fostering resilience, including migration as a strategy to cope with impacts of climate change and natural disasters. The Protection Agenda calls for inter-sectoral coordination in policy and practice, encompassing migration management, humanitarian aid, development, human rights and 118 The Nansen Initiative 2015a, p. 15; United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) 2011 https://unfccc.int/resource/docs/2010/cop16/eng/07a01.pdf 119 The Nansen Initiative, https://www.nanseninitiative.org/secretariat/ 120 A Steering Group, Consultative Committee, Envoy and Secretariat oversaw the work of the Initiative.

Launched at the 2016 World Humanitarian Summit (WHS), the Platform is led by France and Fiji 124 and forges partnerships for multi-sectoral dialogues, information sharing and policy development. 125 Its activities are aimed at supporting interested countries and stakeholders in strengthening protection for environmentally displaced persons, including information sharing, promoting data collection and harmonisation, building partnerships with a range of stakeholders and offering input to policy processes, including the GCM. 126 Professor Walter K\u00e4lin, envoy of the Nansen Initiative, remarked that its consultations underscored the importance of regional and sub-regional organisations as actors supporting national governments in finding protection solutions. 127 Indeed, the Nansen Initiative has informed global and regional processes, and in doing so, has helped to further the development of policies and tools addressing environmental displacement. For instance, it has influenced policy processes in Latin America, notably the Cartagena +30 and Regional Conference on Migration 128 , as well as the Strategy for Climate and Disaster Resilient Development in the Pacific. 129 At the international level, the Initiative\u2019s outcomes supported the incorporation of internal and cross-border disaster-related displacement into the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015-2030. It has also informed negotiations regarding the 2015 Paris Climate Change Agreement and consultations undertaken as part of the 2016 WHS (these are discussed later in this section). 130 4.2.1.2. Migrants in Countries in Crisis The breakout of conflict in Libya in 2011, a destination and transit country for a significant number of migrants, led the international community to launch the Migrants in Countries in Crisis (MICIC) Initiative. This Initiative sought to fill gaps in emergency preparedness and response, efforts which have often overlooked the needs of migrants. 131 MICIC was a state-led effort, co-chaired by the Philippines and the United States, that worked to strengthen protection for migrants affected by a natural disasters or conflict. MICIC was launched in 2014 at the Global Forum on Migration and Development. Following research and consultations, it released non-binding Guidelines to Protect Migrants in Countries Experiencing Conflict or Natural Disaster in 2016 to offer practical guidance for actors providing protections while preparing for and responding to crises. 132 These Guidelines provide 123 The Nansen Initiative (2015a), p.19, 7. 124 Other members of the Steering Group are Australia, Bangladesh, Brazil, Canada, Costa Rica, European Union, Germany, Kenya, Madagascar, Maldives, Mexico, Morocco, Norway, Philippines, Senegal, and Switzerland.

While migrants have been impacted by conflicts and natural disasters in destination or transit countries, such as hurricanes in the United States or conflict in Yemen, their specific needs are often not incorporated into responses. MICIC's work targeting this specific, overlooked context can be seen as part of broader efforts to close protection gaps faced by at-risk migrants. 135 4.2.2. Addressing cross-border movement in two regional contexts With most cross-border displacement occurring within world regions, sub-regional and regional organisations stand to play important roles in strengthening protection responses . 136 While consistent data collection remains a challenge, the information available illustrates that Africa and Central and South America have the most occurrences of disaster-related displacement across international borders. 137 With environmental displacement a particularly pressing issue in these areas of the world, this section highlights efforts to strengthen protection for affected populations in Africa and the Americas. 4.2.2.1. The Americas: Guidance for disaster-related displacement protection Tropical storms and hurricanes have affected millions in the Americas, with storms increasing in strength because of climate change. Meanwhile, earthquakes, floods, landslides, volcanoes and other disasters have also had significant consequences, while droughts present a challenge of a more extended nature. 138 In fact, the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs named Latin America and the Caribbean as the second most \u2018disaster-prone\u2019 world region. 139 Such disasters can spark migration movements and have led regional governments to seek ways to deal with their cross-border displacement impacts. As noted above, the Cartagena Declaration on Refugees embraces a broad definition of refugees, applicable to persons displaced by disasters. To mark the 30th anniversary of the Cartagena Declaration ( Cartagena +30 ), 28 Latin American and Caribbean governments met in Brasilia in 2014 and adopted the Brazil Declaration and Plan of Action (BPA) . This document, developed following a year-long consultative process, was aimed at responding to new protection challenges and solutions for the next decade. It builds off of regional structures, the 1994 San Jos\u00e9 Declaration on Refugees and Displaced Persons and 2004 Mexico Declaration and Plan of Action to Strengthen the International Protection of 133 MCIC (2016). 134 The MICIC repository of practices can be viewed at https://micicinitiative.iom.int/repository-practices. 135 Foreword to the Guidelines by the Special Representative of the United Nations Secretary-General for International Migration, Peter Sutherland: MCIC (2016), p.5. 136 The Nansen Initiative (2015a), p.10. 137 The Nansen Initiative (2015a), p.6. 138 UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (2020), p.5. 139 UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (2020), p.2.

The BPA contains a list of programs related to the areas of asylum, solutions, solidarity, statelessness and regional cooperation, that are to be carried out by governments (as willing) by 2024. In addition to its importance in the regional context, the BPA influenced the consultations surrounding the Global Compact on Refugees (GCR) and Comprehensive Refugee Response Framework. 142 In its first triennial progress report, covering 2015-17, UNHCR finds improvements in several aspects, including the areas of asylum, alternative legal pathways, local integration, and elimination of statelessness. 143 It concludes that, looking at the current situation and good practices thus far, establishing protection measures for persons affected by climate change and natural disasters is among the priorities for strengthening the quality of asylum and ensuring full BPA implementation. 144 Meanwhile, improving responses to natural disaster-related displacement is among the priorities named for enhancing regional and international cooperation. 145 Meanwhile, the Nansen Initiative has worked with Central American countries, holding consultations followed by a 2015 workshop that included a study of laws, policies and practices in the region that have been used to respond to the needs of those displaced by disasters. 146 At this workshop, the Nansen Initiative received feedback that countries wanted more concrete guidance on how immigration law can better support displaced persons and worked to develop such a tool. 147 The Regional Conference on Migration (RCM), a multilateral body consisting mostly of Central and North American countries, 148 endorsed the resulting Guide to Effective Practices for RCM Member Countries: protection for persons moving across borders in the context of disasters (\u2018Effective Practices Guide\u2019), drafted by the Nansen Initiative, in 2016. It offers guidance to RCM Member Countries on how they can respond to the temporary humanitarian protection needs of persons affected by sudden-onset disasters using examples from current laws, policies and practices, with a focus on the use of immigration law. 149 The Effective Practices Guide focuses on three groups of people: 1. those who wish to enter a foreign country, seeking temporary protection and support before (in anticipation of), during, or after a disaster has taken place in their country of origin; 140 See https://www.unhcr.org/en-us/brazil-declaration.html. 141 Cartagena +30 (2014) f; UNHCR (2014). 142 UNHCR (2018), p.11. 143 UNHCR (2018), p.11. 144 UNHCR (2018), p.99. 145 UNHCR (2018), p.101-02. 146 Cantor (2015) https://www.fmreview.org/climatechange-disasters/cantor; Nansen Initiative (2016) https://disasterdisplacement.org/wp- content/uploads/2016/11/PROTECTION-FOR-PERSONS-MOVING-IN-THE-CONTEXT-OF-DISASTERS.pdf; Nansen Initiative (2015b) https://disasterdisplacement.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/150715_FINAL_BACKGROUND_PAPER_LATIN_AMERICA_screen.pdf. 147 Cantor (2015). 148 Current Member Countries are Belize, Canada, Costa Rica, the Dominican Republic, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Mexico, Nicaragua, Panama, and the United States.

In addition to reviewing applicable laws, the guide explores regional practices, including those concerning the identification of affected persons and the use of processes related to the admission and stay of different categories of migrants. 150 The guide takes the approach of looking at existing tools rather than developing new requirements. Since its adoption, Costa Rica and Panama have used the Effective Practices Guide as a resource to inform the development of Standard Operating Procedures for joint responses to environmental displacement across their shared border, thereby helping to spur further measures to address the needs of those displaced. 151 It has also been used as a resource to inform the response of authorities to natural disasters, such as Costa Rican officials in the aftermath of Hurricane Otto in 2016. 152 Pointing to the utility of such a resource, the South American Conference of Migration (CSM) 153 signalled its desire to develop similar guidance in 2017. 154 The CSM adopted its own guidelines the following year, Regional guidelines regarding protection and assistance for persons displaced across borders and migrants in countries affected by natural disasters . 155 These focus on cross- border displacement due to natural disasters and migrants already in countries experiencing natural disasters. This document, like its RCM counterpart, explores policies and practices that have been used to respond to displacement in these contexts. 156 Although the RCM and CSM guidelines are non-binding and do not establish governmental obligations, they are viewed as important steps in enhancing protection for people displaced across borders by natural disasters and as a tool for further policy development in this area. 157 4.2.2.2. East Africa: The Protocol on Free Movement of Persons in the IGAD Region The Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD) , an intergovernmental body in the East Africa region, was created to address issues of drought and desertification. 158 In a region where rainfall is inconsistent, land and environmental degradation can exacerbate challenges of food insecurity, 150 Nansen Initiative (2016). 151 K\u00e4lin & Cantor (2017) https://www.fmreview.org/latinamerica-caribbean/kaelin-cantor. 152 K\u00e4lin & Cantor (2017). 153 Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, Guyana, Paraguay, Peru, Suriname, Uruguay, and Venezuela are Member States; Mexico is an observer state. 154 K\u00e4lin & Cantor (2017). 155 It focusses on cross-border displacement due to natural disasters and migrants already in countries experiencing natural disasters.

Following several years of discussions, in February 2020, all IGAD representatives at the ministerial meeting in Khartoum adopted the Protocol on Free Movement of Persons in the IGAD Region . 160 It is expected to be signed at the next IGAD Heads of State summit; the next steps will be to conduct national-level consultations, followed by regional discussions regarding a blueprint for implementation. 161 Under this new Protocol, persons fleeing disasters will be allowed to seek refuge in a neighbouring country; they will not need to return until doing so is safe. 162 This includes those who cross a border in expectation of, during or following a disaster. This work is part of efforts supported by the European Union Trust Fund. 163 The Protocol expands upon existing bilateral arrangements between MSs, such as visa waivers between certain countries. 164 In addressing entry and stay, it helps fill a gap for protecting those displaced by natural disasters \u2013 and is particularly noteworthy because the IGAD region is home to some of the countries most affected by drought, flooding and other environmental challenges. 165 The IOM called this endorsement \u201ca significant milestone towards catalysing socio-economic development\u201d that can foster regional integration and development through the free movement of people. 166 Indeed, it could serve as a model for other sub-regional organisations in Africa and elsewhere . 167 4.2.3. Addressing environmental displacement in the context of IDP protection In addition to the above initiatives, some of which touch upon protection-related issues for IDPs, there are a few that focus specifically on internal displacement and in this way address issues related to climate change and natural disasters. This section explores developments in the latter arena since 2011, which make use of the 1998 Guiding Principles to strengthen protections for this population. 4.2.3.1. A regional approach: The Kampala Convention The African Union (AU) Convention for the Protection and Assistance of Internally Displaced Persons in Africa (also known as the Kampala Convention ) builds off the Guiding Principles of Internal Displacement in many ways while also strengthening the incorporation of natural disasters and climate change, including by referring specifically to persons displaced by climate change. 168 The Kampala Convention, adopted in 2009 and entering into force in 2012, includes in its definition of IDPs those who 159 IGAD https://igad.int/about-us/the-igad-region. 160 IGAD (2020) https://igad.int/divisions/health-and-social-development/2016-05-24-03-16-37/2373-protocol-on-free-movement-of- persons-endorse-at-ministerial-meeting. 161 International Organization for Migration Special Liaison Office in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia (2020) https://ethiopia.iom.int/iom-welcomes- historic-endorsement-free-movement-protocol-igad-region; IGAD 2020. 162 Wood (2020). 163 See https://eutf.akvoapp.org/en/project/5977/#summary. 164 IOM Special Liaison Office in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia (2020). 165 Wood (2020). 166 IOM Special Liaison Office in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia (2020). 167 Wood (2020). 168 Adeola (2018) .

These are: 170 \u2022 advancing national and regional efforts to prevent and address root causes of displacement and promote the development of durable solutions; \u2022 developing a legal framework for preventing displacement and supporting IDPs in the region, including a framework for cooperation in these efforts; and \u2022 identifying the responsibilities and obligations of both states and non-state actors related to preventing and responding to internal displacement. Under Article V, parties to the convention pledge to work to aid and protect persons who have been displaced internally as a result of \u201cnatural or human made disasters, including climate change\u201d. 171 Other obligations include putting into place strategies for disaster risk reduction and measures to prepare for and manage disaster situations. 172 Moreover, signatories agree that everyone has a right to be protected from arbitrary displacement, including forced evacuations related to natural disasters (if not necessary for their safety and health), and that states will be liable for providing reparations if they shirk from protecting and aiding IDPs affected by natural disasters. 173 The Kampala Convention thus explicitly addresses protections for persons internally displaced due to both natural disasters and climate change. But what is perhaps most important for protection efforts is the fact that the Kampala Convention is the first legally binding instrument related to IDPs that encompasses the African continent widely . 174 It thus marks a milestone in the development of international law on internal displacement . 175 However, countries that have ratified the Convention must incorporate its provisions into their national laws; to date, of the AU\u2019s 55 MSs, 40 countries have signed the Convention and 29 have ratified it. 176 Besides the partial signature to and ratification of the treaty, implementation of the Convention\u2019s components remains a challenge. 177 To assist with implementation, at the first Conference of State Parties in 2017, MSs agreed on an action plan for implementing the Convention. 178 Additionally, to promote the incorporation of the Kampala Convention\u2019s provisions into national legislation and speed up its implementation, the AU adopted 169 African Union (AU) (2009), p.3 170 AU (2009), p.4. 171 AU (2009), p.13. 172 AU (2009), p.12. 173 AU (2009), p.12, 21. 174 The Protocol on the Protection and Assistance of Internally Displaced Persons to the Pact on Security, Stability and Development in the Great Lakes Region, adopted in 2008, was the first legally binding instrument related to IDPs in Africa, albeit with a more limited geographical reach.

These mentions include: \u2022 Acknowledging that the climate, natural disasters and environmental degradation can interact with drivers of the displacement of refugees and are increasingly doing so. 187 \u2022 Calling on the international community to reduce the risk of disasters 188 and promoting the inclusion of disaster risk reduction in national preparedness planning. 189 \u2022 Encouraging stakeholders to respond to the protection needs of those forcibly displaced using applicable national or regional instruments, temporary protection, humanitarian stay or other forms of protection. 190 \u2022 Calling on the international community to help countries to include refugees in their efforts to reduce disaster risks. 191 Notably, by recognising that environmental factors contribute to driving displacement, the GCR enables countries impacted by natural disasters and environmental degradation to utilises its responsibility- sharing and other approaches. 192 Despite this, the more nuanced and detailed references to climate and migration featured in the GCM but not the GCR is yet more proof that it is considered less an issue of international protection but one that requires responses within the broader field of international migration. 193 These two intergovernmental Compacts are important milestones in the governance of international migration, and the GCM in particular raises the visibility of environmental migration and displacement as an issue to be better addressed through international cooperation. If the relevant provisions are implemented effectively, they can also serve to advance responses to environmental displacement before and if it occurs. 185 UN News (2019). 186 Beeler (2018). 187 UN (2018b), p.2-3 f. 188 UN (2018b), p.3. 189 UN (2018b), p.10. 190 UN (2018b), p.12. 191 UN (2018b), 15. 192 See UNHCR (2017a). 193 UNHCR (2017a).

Addressing environmental migration and displacement in the broader context of climate change and disaster policies Multilateral efforts to respond to climate change and disasters, led by the UN, have continued with gusto since 2011, building off previous work under the IASC, 1994 UNFCCC and Hyogo Framework for Action 2005-2015. Although focusing broadly on climate change and disasters, these instruments have acknowledged the importance of addressing environmental displacement. In addition to these global efforts, national-level initiatives, particularly in Pacific Island Countries for whom climate change and disasters represent a particularly existential threat, have been launched to promote adaptation and other solutions. 4.3.1. IASC Operational Guidelines on the Protection of Persons in Situations of Natural Disasters In 2011, the IASC revised its 2006 Operational Guidelines on Human Rights and Natural Disasters . These Guidelines, which address human rights concerns in the context of natural disasters, look at a range of human rights issues, including access to different services and freedom of movement. Noting that human rights concerns are frequently a result of insufficient planning and response rather than intentional policies, the Guidelines promote the incorporation of human rights considerations into all phases of disaster response. 194 In this document, the IASC recognises that IDPs are a particularly vulnerable group, and the Guidelines state that they should be treated in line with the Guiding Principles on Internal Displacement. 195 While the Guidelines touch upon internal displacement, they do not focus on cross-border displacement. 4.3.2. The UN Framework on Climate Change and 2015 Paris Climate Conference The 21st session of the Conference of the Parties (COP) to the UNFCCC , also known as COP 21 or the Paris Climate Conference , took place at the end of 2015. The resulting Paris Agreement , which came into effect in 2016, builds off the UNFCCC and boosts government investment and action to tackle climate change. 196 It is particularly remarkable in that it is the first legally binding agreement on climate change; 197 the Agreement has been ratified by 189 delegations (of 197). 198 Under the Paris Agreement, countries pledged to address the climate change threat by working to mitigate temperature increases and building the capacity of states to respond to its impacts. 199 Most relevant to this report, the Agreement recognises that responses to climate change should respect the rights of migrants alongside other particular populations. 200 COP 21 also called for the creation of the Task Force on Displacement (TFD), giving the Warsaw International Mechanism for Loss and Damage the responsibility of executing this task force and 194 IASC (2011), p.2. 195 IASC (2011), p.2. 196 See https://unfccc.int/process-and-meetings/the-paris-agreement/what-is-the-paris-agreement. 197 See https://ec.europa.eu/clima/policies/international/negotiations/paris_en. 198 See https://unfccc.int/process/the-paris-agreement/status-of-ratification. 199 UNFCCC (n.d., c). 200 UNFCCC (n.d., c=p.2.

The TFD was established to devise recommendations on coordinated strategies for responding to climate change-related displacement. In the first phase of its work (2017-2019), the TFD examined four thematic areas related to displacement: national and subnational policy and practice; international and regional policy; data and evaluation; and framing and connections. 201 Based on this effort, COP 24 (2018) adopted several recommendations and extended the work of the TFD. 202 Now in its second phase, the TFD is working toward the goals of its 2019 \u2013 2021 Plan of Action, which include a range of activities related to information dissemination and capacity building to strengthen awareness of and responses to environmental migration and displacement. 203 There is supposed to be a global check-in every five years, but due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the 2020 meeting (COP26) was postponed. 4.3.3. The Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015\u20132030 Upon the UN General Assembly\u2019s request, the UN Office for Disaster Risk Reduction undertook an effort to develop an instrument to succeed the Hyogo Framework for Action 2005-2015: Building the Resilience of Nations and Communities to Disasters. Following stakeholder consultations and international negotiations, the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015-2030 was adopted at the Third UN World Conference on Disaster Risk Reduction in 2015. 204 This new instrument works to further the efforts of its predecessor while also increasing the focus on managing risks of disasters (rather than consequences of disasters), including the reduction of current risks and prevention of new ones. 205 It mentions, among other things, that international cooperation is important to reducing the risk of displacement; 206 that those displaced should have access to shelter, food and other basic supports; 207 and that migrants can and do contribute to resilience-enhancing and risk- reduction efforts. 208 The Global Platform for Disaster Risk Reduction (\u2018Global Platform\u2019), which meets biennially, serves as an instrument to support the implementation and monitoring of the Sendai Framework; with outcomes also informing the 2030 Sustainable Development Agenda (discussed in the next section). 209 The Global Platform was created by the UN General Assembly to serve as the primary multilateral forum for discussion and action on disaster-related risk reduction. 210 The 2017 Global Platform in Cancun was the first to take place after the adoption of the Sendai Framework; the 2019 meeting was held in Geneva, focusing on the theme of resilience. 211 201 UNFCCC (n.d., b).. 202 UNFCCC (2019) ; UNFCCC(n.d., b).. 203 UNFCCC (2019b). 204 UN (2015b), p.5 . 205 UN (2015b), p.5. 206 UN (2015b), p.18. 207 UN (2015b), p.21. 208 UN (2015b), p.23. 209 Global Platform for Disaster Risk Reduction (2019). 210 Global Platform for Disaster Risk Reduction (2017). 211 Global Platform for Disaster Risk Reduction (2019).

National-level initiatives in the Pacific Pacific island countries have been particularly active on the issue of environmental migration and displacement at the national level, reflecting the fact that climate change and disasters present a particularly extreme threat for many countries in this region \u2013 notably, including challenges related to sea-level rise, a slow-onset disaster. 4.3.4.1. Kiribati\u2019s purchase of land abroad and Migration with Dignity Policy In response to climate change-related economic and food security challenges, Kiribati purchased 5,460 acres of land for nearly $9 million USD from the Church of England in 2014. 212 This land is on Vanua Levu, Fiji\u2019s second largest island, which offers land that is higher above sea level and that provides natural resources like fresh water, wood and stone. This government investment was intended to support potential agricultural, fishing, and other activities to support economic development. 213 While Kiribati\u2019s government acknowledged that it would not be ideal to relocate all of its residents to this land, it would theoretically be possible if necessary. 214 As of 2017, the government was still in its planning stage and had not yet determined how the land would be utilised, although the president announced that land cultivation would begin. 215 The Maldives had previously considered buying land in another country, but Kiribati was the first to actually take this approach. 216 In addition to this purchase of land, Kiribati has launched its Migration with Dignity Policy with the idea that climate change will necessitate the permanent relocation of some and that labour migration creates an important pathway for this. 217 The policy is aimed at supporting voluntary, temporary and permanent labour migration as an adaptation strategy; it also works to foster the growth of the country\u2019s diaspora, with the objective of enabling them to support other migrants in the future. 218 Additionally, the government is supporting efforts to upskill the population by enhancing their educational and vocational attainment to make it easier for people to find opportunities for labour migration. 219 These efforts support pathways for those who are willing and able to migrate. 4.3.4.2. Vanuatu\u2019s National Policy on Climate Change and Disaster-Induced Displacement Vanuatu, a country particularly vulnerable to both sudden- and slow-onset disasters, launched its National Policy on Climate Change and Disaster-Induced Displacement in 2018. 220 In a context of worsening natural hazards and community requests for help in the face of eviction and conflicts over land, the government identified a policy gap regarding mitigating drivers of displacement, protecting those who are displaced and responding to long-term needs related to development and recovery.

This policy offers national standards regarding displacement and provides a roadmap for responding to displacement resulting from climate change and natural disasters, focusing on internal displacement and planned relocation (also called resettlement). The document delineates the responsibilities of different government agencies and aims to facilitate cooperation among stakeholders. The Ministry of Climate Change Adaptation urges government and non-government stakeholders to use this document to mainstream migration and displacement into their policy and planning to facilitate durable solutions for displaced populations. 222 This roadmap takes a systems-level, multi-sectoral approach to facilitate a whole-of-government strategy for mitigating displacement-related challenges. 223 The policy document covers 12 strategic areas, encompassing a range of issues including governance, research, safeguards, capacity building, land, housing, health, education, infrastructure, food security, culture and justice to take a comprehensive approach. As part of this effort, IOM is providing technical assistance to support policy implementation, while the Vanuatu National Disaster Management Office is managing the creation of standard operating procedures to promote the protection of and supports for IDPs. 4.3.4.3. Fiji\u2019s Planned Relocation Guidelines and trust fund Fiji launched its Planned Relocation Guidelines at COP24 in 2018 to delineate clear and holistic procedures surrounding this method of climate change response. 224 These Guidelines offer a roadmap for involving communities in the relocation process, facilitating inter-sectoral cooperation and incorporating considerations of gender, age and disability. 225 They are meant to be a living document to be used to foster climate resilience by supporting governments, communities and other stakeholders in local-level relocation efforts before, during and after relocation. The Guidelines aim to ensure that relocation is sustainable and supportive of relocated persons to safeguard their wellbeing and rights. They were developed with the support of the German Agency for International Cooperation (GIZ) and in alignment with other national frameworks including the country\u2019s 5-year and 20-year National Development Plans, National Adaptation Plan and National Climate Change Policy. 226 While relocation is considered a last resort, it is one that will likely become more frequently used: a few Fijian villages have already been relocated, and it is expected that at least 45 additional villages will need to relocate in the near future. 227 In 2019, Fiji\u2019s prime minister launched the Climate Relocation and Displaced Peoples Trust Fund for Communities and Infrastructure on the sidelines of the 74th UN General Assembly meeting.

Linking environmental migration and displacement to broader humanitarian and development aid agendas With a range of international actors increasingly recognising the challenges related to natural disasters and climate change, discussions and planning in humanitarian and development spaces have also touched upon environmental migration and displacement issues. Risks associated with climate change and disaster are of concern for development stakeholders in particular because developing countries are impacted disproportionately : They are more likely to face these events and may find it more difficult to effectively respond due to challenges including less capacity and resources, weak governance and population growth. 232 Forced displacement has long been central to the topic of humanitarian aid response; meanwhile, development assistance has been increasingly viewed as an avenue for providing sustainable solutions for displaced persons. 4.4.1. The 2030 Sustainable Development Agenda UN Member States adopted 17 SDGs in 2015 under the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development , with the aim of achieving these goals by 2030. The SDGs succeed the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), which had a target date of 2015. One of the findings at the conclusion of the MDGs was that, despite successes, progress was uneven and many people remained left behind, including in the context of climate change, gender inequality and conflict. 233 Unlike the MDGs, the SDGs aim at addressing root causes of poverty and apply to every country. Moreover, addressing climate change is incorporated as a key element of sustainable development, with SDG 13 focusing on fostering resilience and adaptation in the face of climate change . 234 The 2019 SDG report even names climate change as \u2018the defining issue of our time and the greatest challenge to sustainable development.\u2019 235 However, progress on these ambitious goals is uneven, and responding to climate-related challenges remains a key area for improvement in the 2020-2030 \u2018decade of action\u2019 to ensure the SDGs are met. 228 Government of Fiji (2019). 229 Permanent Mission of Fiji to the United Nations (2019). 230 Goering (2020); Permanent Mission of Fiji to the United Nations (2019). 231 Goering (2020). 232 Martin et al.

An important element of the Summit\u2019s work was strengthening connections between the humanitarian and development fields to reflect and respond to the frequently protracted nature of displacement. 236 In his reports in preparation of and following the WHS, the UN Secretary General recognised climate change and natural disasters as two of the factors contributing to the worsening global humanitarian situation. 237 As mentioned previously, the PDD was launched at the WHS to support the implementation of the Protection Agenda. Participants at the Summit also underscored the need to increase proactive efforts to reduce the risk of disasters and assist communities in coping with climate change. 238 4.4.3. Efforts by multilateral development banks Multilateral development banks have increased their climate-related financing; the most recent data, for 2018, shows a record high of $43.1 billion, of which 30% was allocated to adaptation efforts. 239 As part of its goals of ending extreme poverty and fostering shared prosperity, the World Bank has explored the intersection of environmental change and mobility. Its Knowledge Partnership on Migration and Development (KNOMAD) created a working group to explore connections between environmental change and migration, displacement and relocation. The aim of KNOMAD is to strengthen evidence-based policy and practice; to help achieve this goal, it is focusing on longitudinal and quantitative data, especially regarding South-South flows. KNOMAD is also investigating the impact of mobility on vulnerability and resilience, with the aim of protecting the most vulnerable. 240 Additionally, in its 2016 Climate Change Action Plan, the World Bank pledges to expand and integrate efforts to address climate change across its work. Meanwhile, it has leant millions in funds for migration- related projects in the past 15 years; it also created a sub-window of support for refugees in its fund for the poorest countries in 2016 and that same year launched an effort to increase the quantity and quality of jobs, with a focus on high-risk situations including migration. 241 Looking at regional development banks, the Asian Development Bank has included migration in several areas of its work to address climate change, including research and technical assistance; it has published multiple reports on the climate change-development-migration nexus and has indicated its desire to support country-led adaptation efforts regarding climate change. 242 Arguing that policy debates should go beyond humanitarian assistance and legal protection to also look at migration more broadly as well as the role of development, with a focus on fostering resilience and making migration a voluntary choice, the Bank undertook a project focused on devising financial and policy responses to 236 Grandi (n.d.). 237 UN General Assembly (2016b), p.2. 238 UN General Assembly (2016b), p.11, 13. 239 World Bank (2019). 240 Martin et al.

Conclusions International governance of environmental migration and displacement is a complex topic and one that is characterised by a high degree of fragmentation 255 \u2013 providing both opportunities for flexibility and challenges to a comprehensive response. There have been a number of initiatives since 2011 that aim to establish approaches, spur action for cooperation and provide practical recommendations on responding to environmental migration and displacement. This reflects a recognition of the increasing importance of the issue and of the need for coordinated efforts to address it. Overall, this work builds off previous efforts, which have enabled ensuing discussions and actions to gain momentum. The efforts explored in this report have emphasised practical guidance, information sharing, cooperation and capacity building as important tools for translating ideas into action. Meanwhile, increasingly forward-looking approaches have emphasised the need to identify, mitigate and prevent future risks, including through fostering resilience to climate change and disasters, in which migration can play a role. Notably, the efforts mentioned in this section are largely state-led, voluntary initiatives. At the global level, there seems to be an understanding that there is little appetite for a binding legislative framework for addressing environmental migration or displacement, with the notable exception of the Kampala Convention. Initiatives have thus largely taken the form of guidelines and toolboxes, which aim to collect and share good practices and thus make these ideas and approaches more accessible to stakeholders. Despite progress in tackling the issue \u2013 both its root causes and consequences \u2013 several formidable challenges remain. With few legally binding instruments, most rely on the interest of states (or other actors) in participating and complying, and these often address pieces of the puzzle rather than constituting a holistic response to internal and cross-border migration and displacement in the context of climate change and slow- and sudden-onset disasters. Meanwhile, there are comparatively fewer international initiatives for addressing internal displacement, with most focusing on cross-border movements. Perhaps most importantly, the effective implementation of the above and future efforts is central to ensuring they will successfully and systematically strengthen protections for environmentally displaced persons. Moreover, climate change \u2013 and its impacts on natural disasters and on displacement (and other forms of movement) \u2013 continues, and addressing this is key to addressing environmental migration and displacement that can result. 254 Pacific Community (2016), p.15. 255 Lieberman (2019).

The European Union At the international level, the EU has positioned itself as an active promoter in the fight against climate change in international fora, above all the annual UNFCCC COP meetings. The EU, and its MSs KEY FINDINGS The EU and its MSs take an active role in promoting environmental protection in global fora. The EU started late but has increasingly been addressing the nexus of environmental change and migration over the last decade. According to the prevailing view, displacement based on climate alone does not meet the requirements for refugee protection. Within the EU, complementary forms of protection deriving from the Qualification Directive and Temporary Protection Directive, as well as protection from non-refoulement in the Return Directive, could provide protection alternatives. However, all of these instruments show deficiencies for the protection of people displaced due to climate-related reasons. To date, most European countries have made no efforts to extend national protection statuses to those displaced due to environmental factors. Exceptions are Italy, Sweden and Finland, which developed national protection grounds for victims of climate change and natural disasters. However, Finland and Sweden suspended their respective national provisions as a consequence of high numbers of arrivals in 2015/2016. Judgments by the European Court of Human Rights and the Court of Justice of the EU on sick migrants can serve as examples of how these courts would assess applications from persons displaced for climate-related reasons. Socio-economic reasons under Articles 2 and 3 of the European Convention on Human Rights could offer crucial protection bases; however, the threshold is set very high. While national European courts have not yet had to judge cases of climate change, Australian and New Zealand courts have dealt with several cases. However, the only case where a court in New Zealand has granted residence to a person who claimed not to be able to return due to climate change was decided based on family ties in New Zealand and not on the situation in the applicant\u2019s country of origin, Tuvalu. In a remarkable recent decision, the UN Human Rights Committee declared that inaction in the face of global warming can lead to violations of human rights and trigger non-refoulement obligations. ",

In response, the European Commission came up with a comprehensive analysis in its 2013 Commission Staff Working Document on Climate change, environmental degradation, and migration . 263 It provided a thorough overview of research and data on the interlinkages between migration, environmental degradation and climate change. The document concludes that further emphasis should be put on knowledge to better understand the phenomenon in all its dimensions and increase the focus on environmental migration in dialogues and cooperation frameworks such as the Global Approach to Migration and Mobility (GAMM). As outlined in the paper, most displacement due to environmental reasons remains within countries of origin 264 or the closer region; the paper therefore envisions EU development and humanitarian aid policies as the focus of EU action on this matter. 265 In the following European Agenda on Migration from 2015 , the European Commission mentioned climate change as one of the root causes of irregular migration and forced displacement , alongside civil war, persecution and poverty, demanding an active and engaged EU external policy. 266 However, in the communications that followed, the European Commission fully focused on events related to the so-called \u2018refugee crisis\u2019 and the responses taken. Climate was only mentioned as one of the drivers for the \u2018record numbers of migrants and refugees arriving in the EU in 2015\u2019. 267 256 Astuccia, E.

        "Climate Change and Migration PE 655.591 67 As early as 1999 , 268 the European Parliament addressed the links between environmental degradation and security concerns in international relations in its report. Specifically, the resolution remarked that \u2018climate refugees\u2019 already outnumber \u2018conflict refugees\u2019. 269 It therefore called for an official recognition for \u2018environmental refugees\u2019 . 270 Later, in 2011 , the Parliament commissioned the above-mentioned study on \u2018Climate Refugees\u2019 , 271 which aimed at taking stock of the discussion and the typology of environmental migration, identify the protection gaps and develop appropriate recommendations. In its 2016 report, the European Parliament specifically addressed environmental degradation as one of the triggers of population movements . 272 It reaffirmed that the Union must address the root causes of \u2018push factors\u2019, naming climate change and natural disasters as examples alongside conflict, persecution and others. 273 In 2017, the European Parliament requested that the EU take a leading role in recognising the impact of climate change on mass displacement , \u2018as the scale and frequency of displacements are likely to increase\u2019. 274 Members of the European Parliament (MEPs) were already actively proposing a community status of ecological refugees in 2001 275 and issued a position paper on Climate Change, Refugees and Migration in 2013 276 highlighting \u2013 among others \u2013 possibilities to include climate change either in the recast Qualification Directive 277 (QD), Temporary Protection Directive 278 (TPD) or the Return Directive (RD). Since these early initiatives, the concerns on the impact of climate and natural disasters on migration cuts across the groups in the European Parliament. 5.1.2. The Council of Europe The Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe (PACE) issued a report in 2008 entitled \u201cEnvironmentally induced migration and displacement: a 21st century challenge,\u201d 279 which emphasised the lack of consensus within the international community regarding international legal terminology concerning human mobility associated with environmental disasters and degradation, hindering progress on the recognition and legal protection of environmental migrants. The report further calls for an investigation of \u201cexisting gaps in law and protection mechanisms with a view to an eventual elaboration of a specific framework for the protection of environmental migrants, either in a separate international convention or as part of relevant multilateral treaties.\u201d 280 Recommendation 1862 (2009) to the Committee of Ministers 281 adopted at the same time goes so far as to advocate for 268 European Parliament (1999). 269 European Parliament (1999), Art K. 270 European Parliament (1999), explanatory note. 271 Kraler, Cernei, Noack (2011), see above under chapter 2. 272 European Parliament (2016), para G. 273 European Parliament (2016), para 100. 274 European Parliament (2017), para31. 275 See in more detail Srgo, A.

The Assembly considered this topic again in 2016 , with a report by Philippe Bies 282 asking MSs to give greater priority to (among others) devising protection policies and norms for victims of natural disasters and for victims of the consequences of climate change . The Assembly\u2019s preferred option at that time was to \u201crevise the 1951 Geneva Convention relating to the Status of Refugees, by means, for example, of an additional protocol.\u201d 283 A report from PACE in August 2019 was comparably more cautious, stepping back from proposing any additional protocol but emphasising the potential of learning lessons from the IDP protection framework . It further highlights the complementarity between prevention, emergency assistance and the search for sustainable solutions, accelerating societies\u2019 adaptation to climate change. 284 PACE, however, concluded, that the absence of a legally binding definition of \u201cclimate refugees\u201d does not preclude the possibility of developing specific policies to protect people who are forced to move as a consequence of climate change. 285 In the respective resolution from October 2019 , PACE called for protection measures to be developed in the asylum systems of Council MSs to \u2018provide appropriate asylum\u2019 for people who are forced to move as a consequence of climate change . 286 The resolution called on MSs to recognise human migration as a tool for increasing \u201clivelihood resilience\u201d and a legitimate form of adaptation to climate change. 287 5.2. Addressing environmental migration and displacement in the EU external dimension 5.2.1. Tools in the context of migration and forced displacement EU law, policies and programmes explicitly related to forced displacement have been developed from the perspective of development and humanitarian aid within the so-called \u2018external dimension\u2019 of the EU\u2019s migration and asylum policy. Although the developed frameworks hardly focus on environmental displacement, they are regularly mentioned as drivers or one of the root causes of displacement. Since 2005, the (revised) GAMM is the overarching framework of the EU external migration and asylum policy. The framework defines how the EU conducts its policy dialogues and cooperation with non-EU countries, based on clearly defined priorities and embedded in the EU\u2019s overall external action, including development cooperation. It aims to better organise legal migration, preventing and combatting irregular migration, eradicating trafficking in human beings, maximising the development impact of migration and mobility and promoting international protection and enhancing the external dimension of asylum. 288 Among others, the GAMM also addresses environmental migration by means 282 Council of Europe (2016). 283 Council of Europe (2016). 284 Council of Europe (2019a). 285 Council of Europe (2019a). 286 Council of Europe (2019b), para 5.4. 287 Council of Europe (2019b), para 4. 288 European Commission (2011), p.7.

While at present none of these partnership frameworks explicitly address the nexus between climate change and migration, they aim at better managing migration flows in partnership with the EU in exchange for enhanced legal mobility pathways. Specifically, the Mobility Partnerships provide a flexible tool with the potential to bring environmental migration and displacement into the partnership agenda . In 2015, the EU\u2013Africa Summit on Migration was held in Valletta, Malta, which resulted in the Valletta Summit Action Plan . 290 The political declaration which accompanied the Summit acknowledged that migration within and between the continents is a multifaceted phenomenon. The parties agreed \u2013 among other pledges \u2013 to commit to address the root causes of irregular migration and forced displacement, mentioning environmental trends as one of them . 291 The Valletta Summit also launched the EU Emergency Trust Fund for Africa. The 2019 Report on the EU Trust Fund mentions environmental challenges in various parts of Africa . 292 Extreme temperatures as well as droughts and fluctuating rainfall in the Sahel zone, combined with fast-growing populations, will \u2013 according to the report \u2013 aggravate the existing pressure and will increasingly impact migration and conflict. 293 Since 2016, the EU has a dedicated policy framework on forced displacement in place, which aims to \u201cprevent forced displacement from becoming protracted and to gradually end dependence on humanitarian assistance in existing displacement situations by fostering self-reliance and enabling the displaced to live in dignity as contributors to their host societies, until voluntary return or resettlement.\u201d 294 It is based on the Communication of the European Commission \u201cLives in Dignity: from Aid-dependence to Self-reliance\u201d 295 and the Council Conclusions on forced displacement. 296 Both address climate change as an aggravating factor forcing even more people to flee. The accompanying Staff Working Document, however, identifies violence as a key factor forcing people to flee, while characterising disasters and climate phenomena as threat multipliers for instability, conflict and state fragility. 297 5.2.2. Tools in the context of humanitarian aid and disaster relief EU humanitarian aid is an expression of international solidarity as laid out in the Lisbon Treaty Art 196 and 214.

When it comes to civil protection, the EU assumes a supporting role, coordinating voluntary contributions of in-kind assistance from countries participating in the EU Civil Protection Mechanism. 300 The EU Civil Protection and Humanitarian Aid Operations Department has been providing assistance to people in need since 1992; its annual humanitarian budget is just over \u20ac1 billion. 301 The Humanitarian Aid Regulation from 1996 302 sets the rules for the provision of humanitarian aid, including its financing instruments. It stipulates that humanitarian aid shall be comprised of assistance, relief and protection operations on a non-discriminatory basis to help people in third countries, particularly the most vulnerable among them, and as a priority those in developing countries and victims of natural disasters and human-made crises, such as wars and outbreaks of fighting . 303 The overall policy framework for humanitarian assistance is outlined in the \u2018European Consensus on Humanitarian Aid\u2018 (2007), 304 signed by the three main EU institutions (the Commission, the Council and Parliament). The Hyogo Framework and its successor, the 2015 Sendai Framework, significantly influenced EU discourses and policy making in the field of humanitarian aid and civil protection. In particular, they informed the \u2018European Consensus on Humanitarian Aid - Action Plan\u2019 in 2008 305 and the \u2018Implementation Plan of the European Consensus on Humanitarian Aid 2015\u2019. 306 The Consensus defines the EU\u2019s common vision, policy objectives and principles on a number of topics, including international humanitarian cooperation, good donorship, risk reduction and preparedness, civil protection and civil-military relations. The 2019 Decision on a Union Civil Protection Mechanism 307 governs EU actions in the area of civil protection. It modified the respective 2013 decision that dealt with prevention, preparedness, response and financial provisions. The 2016 regulation on the provision of emergency support within the Union establishes the circumstances under which MSs may apply for EU support. It sets out the eligible actions and types of financial intervention. The European Commission uses a dedicated Emergency Toolbox to respond rapidly to new emergencies. It contains four instruments: the Acute Large Emergency Response Tool (ALERT), the 298 Beside DG ECHO there are also a number of further DGs involved such as DG CLIMA or DG HOME for e.g. security aspects. Within the European Parliament, humanitarian aid falls within the remit of the Committee on Development (DEVE), and civil protection within that of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety (ENVI).

ALERT, for example, provides rapid first-line funding for immediate response to sudden-onset large-scale natural disasters where more than 100 000 people are affected. In 2018, EUR 8.65 million was provided to respond to severe floods in Kenya, Ethiopia and Nigeria, earthquakes and a tsunami in Indonesia and the effects of a tropical cyclone in the Philippines. 309 The Small-scale Tool was used to respond to seven disasters of a total of EUR 2.225 million, among them also some related to natural disasters, namely those in Tonga (tropical storm), Guatemala (volcano eruption), Venezuela (floods) and Haiti (earthquake). 310 5.3. Addressing environmental displacement in the EU internal dimension Since international refugee law can only be applied to a very limited extent (see above at chapter 4.1.), international human rights law remains a possible \u2018complementary\u2019 basis for protection claims from environmentally displaced persons . These complementary forms of protection mainly derive from the International Covenant for Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) and the Convention against Torture (CAT) as well as the ECHR and the EU\u2019s Charter of Fundamental Rights (CFR) as well as the Qualification Directive (QD, Directive 2011/95/EU) in the EU context. In particular, the right to life (Art 6 ICCPR, Art 2 ECHR, Art 2 CFR) and the prohibition of torture and inhuman and degrading treatment (Art 7 ICCPR, Art 3 CAT, Art 3 ECHR, Art 4 CFR; Art 15 QD) are of relevance in the context of the protection of environmentally displaced persons. 311 5.3.1. European legislation International protection within the EU is regulated by a set of EU Regulations and Directives jointly referred to as the Common European Asylum System (CEAS). Despite a brief reference to climate change and migration in the Stockholm Programme, also the second generation of CEAS instruments does not directly address protection in the context of climate change or natural disasters. Still, the QD and other instruments and initiatives within the EU may create entry points for such cases, 312 which are outlined below. 5.3.1.1. The Qualification Directive The purpose of the QD is to harmonise and set common standards across EU MSs on how to designate a person as being in need of international protection. This Directive defines international protection as being for refugees in the sense of the 1951 Refugee Convention; in cases where a person does not qualify for refugee status, he or she can be granted subsidiary protection status. The latter is based on 308 European Commission (2020): COM (2020) 6 final. 309 European Commission (2020): COM (2020) 6 final. 310 European Commission (2020): COM (2020) 6 final. 311 Climate change of course may also impact other human rights, such as the right to adequate food (Art 11 ICESCR; Art 14 CEDAW; Art 5 CERD), the right to water (Arts 11 and 12 ICESCR42; Art 14 CEDAW; Art 28 CRPD; Art 24 CRC), the right to health (Art 12 ICESCR), or the right to adequate housing (Art 11 ICESCR). 312 Kraler, Cernei & Noack (2011).

        "IPOL | Policy Department for Citizens\u2019 Rights and Constitutional Affairs 72 PE 655.591 \u201ccriteria drawn from international obligations under human rights instruments and practices in MSs\u201d (recital 34 QD). Refugee Protection With slight modifications, the QD follows the definition of the 1951 Refugee Convention. To qualify as a refugee, a person thus must fulfil the definition as described in Art 1A 1951 Refugee Convention as adapted in Art 2(d) QD. Victims of natural disaster therefore need to equally fulfil the definition to be recognised as a refugee under the QD . 313 Environmental reasons per se are not among the elements relevant for qualifying as a refugee . As described above under chapter 4.1, the absence of a persecutor in environmental disasters and its non-discriminatory nature stands against qualifying victims of such disasters as refugees. However, environmental disasters can still indirectly also be a reason for the application of the refugee status, for example if a state arbitrarily restricts access to socio economic rights in the course of a natural disaster and thereby discriminates against a certain group of people and thus the condition of persecutor is met. 314 Subsidiary Protection The complementary human rights-related protection grounds are provided under subsidiary protection in the QD. Subsidiary protection is defined as the \u201cprotection of a third-country national or a stateless person who does not qualify as a refugee but in respect of whom substantial grounds have been shown for believing that the person concerned, if returned to his or her country of origin [\u2026] would face a real risk of suffering serious harm\u201d (Art 2f QD). Subsidiary protection thus requires the element of \u2018serious harm\u2019, which circumscribes the different criteria drawn from international obligations such as the right to life (Art 2 ECHR) or the prohibition of torture (Art 3 ECHR). It consists, according to Art 15 QD of: 1. the death penalty or execution, 2. torture or inhuman and degrading treatment or punishment of an applicant in the country of origin, or 3. serious and individual threat to a civilian\u2019s life or person by reason of indiscriminate violence in situations of international or internal armed conflicts. The recast of the QD did not change the scope of subsidiary protection. For some, this constituted a missed opportunity to further enlarge the scope of subsidiary protection, for example to people leaving their country due to environmental reasons . 315 Thus, the recast QD remains with the three criteria mentioned above that must be satisfied in order for someone to be granted subsidiary protection. While Art 15 a and c offer little scope for environmental protection, the prohibition of inhuman and degrading treatment upon return as stated in Art 15 b has provided leeway for 313 EASO (2016), p46 additionally noting that their claim is unlikely to arise from a threat of persecution. 314 Ragheboom (2017), p.326. Ragheboom distinguishes between different scenarios, such as when the degradation of the environment is deliberately caused by a state or non-state actor to harm a specific group, such as an ethnic, political, religious, national or social group (see Ragheboom (2017), p.328f). Another possible scenario would be if the \u2018Degradation of the Environment is Caused by Technological Accident or Natural Hazard\u2019. In such cases, Ragheboom indicates that \u2018it must be shown that the threats to life or limb or threats of serious impairment of their economic, social and cultural rights affect the applicants specifically, as members of a group identifiable by the race, religion, nationality, political opinion or distinct social characteristic of its members.\u2019 (p.331). 315 See Borges (2019).

        "Climate Change and Migration PE 655.591 73 interpretation in literature , and jurisprudence (see below). Art 15 b also provides some room for MS policies to address environmental reasons that prevent a person from returning. Some MSs indeed have included in their legislation refugee-type protection provisions concerning those who may be unable to return home owing to a natural disaster. 316 The negotiation for a qualification regulation 317 offers yet another opportunity to broaden the scope of subsidiary protection . The European Parliament proposed to include \u2013 among others \u2013 internal conflicts, severe violations of human rights or events seriously disturbing public order in the country of origin, or in a part thereof as factors to be taken into account when determining whether indiscriminate violence exists. 318 This proposal, however, did not meet the Council's mandate for negotiations with the Parliament, 319 while further negotiations have been pending since. 5.3.1.2. The Temporary Protection Directive Also within the CEAS, the TPD 2001/55/EC is often cited as a potential instrument to extend to environmental migration. The application of this instrument, however, has a number of shortcomings. The term \u2018mass influx\u2019 is not defined, which may together with a lack of political will be but two of the reasons why the rather complex mechanisms to apply the directive have never been triggered. 320 Moreover, the temporary nature of the status may provide a solution for rapid onset disasters but hardly for slow-onset disasters like sea-level rise. An entry point in this respect is Art 2(d), which refers to the \u2018Arrival in the Community,\u2019 whether spontaneous or aided, e.g. via evacuation programmes. The reference to evacuation programmes has been identified as a strength of the Directive, insofar as it could facilitate the legal and safe arrival of displaced persons, 321 potentially also for victims of natural disasters. The directive has, however, never been triggered, even during the 2015-16 so-called \u2018migration crisis\u2019. 5.3.1.3. The Return Directive Another EU secondary legal act of importance in the present context is the EU RD 2008/115/EC . The principle of non-refoulement is well enshrined in this directive, which states that the implementation of return must respect the principle of non-refoulement (Art 5) and that removal shall be postponed if it would violate this principle (Art 9). The RD basically distinguishes between legal (non-refoulement or suspensory effects of appeals against return decisions) and practical obstacles that may postpone removal (Art 9). Issues related to non- refoulement may well extend to cases of return to a country hit be environmental and/or natural disasters . However, there is no EU harmonised status for non-refoulement cases (beyond those covered by the QD). MSs can, in principle, invoke Art 9(2) to postpone the removal of victims of environmental disasters; they may also devise more favourable provisions. 316 European Commission (2013). 317 European Commission. 318 European Parliament (2017b), recital 34. 319 Statewatch (2018) https://www.statewatch.org/news/2018/jan/eu-qualification-reg-trilogue-doc-10-1-17.pdf. 320 Beirens et al.

Non-harmonised protection status The EU asylum and protection framework leaves a certain gap with respect to cases that are at the interface between subsidiary protection and non-refoulement as derived from Art 3 ECHR . In this intersection, MSs may develop national protection statuses provided they do not undermine the minimum standards deriving from the CEAS. The European Migration Network (EMN) reports 322 that 20 countries covered by a recent report have at least one national protection status. Most of them offer more general humanitarian statuses, two of them specifically addressing environmental change and natural disasters (see below under chapter 5.3.2). 5.3.1.5. Resettlement and humanitarian admission programmes Resettlement is considered by UNHCR as one of the durable solutions for refugees and a life-saving tool to ensure the protection of those refugees most at risk. 323 However, UNHCR estimated that 1.4 million refugees were in need of resettlement, while only 81,300 places for new submissions were provided by 29 resettlement states in 2018. 324 Complementary to the global resettlement framework, a specific EU framework is negotiated. 325 Under the proposal for a Regulation for an EU Resettlement Framework , 'resettlement' is defined as the admission of third-country nationals and stateless persons in need of international protection from a third country to which or within which they have been displaced to the territory of a MS with a view to granting them international protection (Art 2). The proposal contains no reference to environment- or disaster-induced migration. While it will hardly evolve as a protection tool for climate-induced migrants per se, it may still offer a solution for refugees who need to be resettled due to adverse environmental change in their country of asylum . 5.3.1.6. Other options Besides the abovementioned protection tools, there are additional ones that come up when discussing alternative measures to fill protection gaps for people who need to leave their countries and regions of origin due to disaster and environmental change. Humanitarian grounds are but one possibility for MSs to issue a visa with limited territorial validity. 326 While such a humanitarian visa could bridge the lack of access to the EU for people in need of humanitarian protection including in the course of a natural disaster, the lack of existing protection or residence status would come up once the residence status needs to be determined in the country of destination. 327 In its resolution from 11 December 2018, the European Parliament requested that the European Commission submit a proposal establishing a European Humanitarian Visa which would allow persons seeking international protection to enter an EU MSs for the sole reason of submitting an application for international protection. 328 322 EMN (2020) p.11. 323 UNHCR (2019), p.30. 324 UNHCR (2019), p.30. 325 European Commission (2016) COM (2016) 468 final. 326 Art 25 Visa Code; REGULATION (EC) No 810/2009. 327 For more see Jensen (2014). 328 European Parliament (2018).

In addition, at times a system of circular migration or, indeed, seasonal work is proposed as a coping strategy for people affected by climate or environmental disasters . 331 Within the EU, the Seasonal Workers Directive 332 offers MSs an opportunity to grant third-country nationals seasonal work permits for not less than 5 months and not more than 9 months within a 12-month period (Art 14). Such programmes would allow persons whose livelihood is threatened or even wiped out by climate change to seek work on a seasonal basis in the EU during those periods. This seasonal system could reduce stress on temporary and permanent residence systems by encouraging migrants to seek protection only for the minimum amount of time needed. Seasonal work permits have already been tested as an adaptation strategy to climate change in the context of floods in Colombia in 2008 under a Spain-Colombia agreement . 333 Based on the bilateral agreement on circular migration, the project \u201cTemporary and Circular Labour Migration Project\u201d developed and facilitated temporary migration to Spain for Colombians affected by the floods in order to work in the agricultural sector for a limited time. 334 329 Miller et al.

National legislation and practice An EMN ad hoc query on climate change and migration in 2018 335 revealed that, in most countries, the link between climate change and migration is not much discussed . Debates are driven largely by academic researchers or the media rather than policymakers. Sporadic debates evolved, however, in the context of larger initiatives such as the French discussions in the context of the 2015 COP 21, the German chairmanship of the PDD or the discussions in the context of the development of the Austrian migration strategy. 336 However, none of the countries reported any planned changes in their respective legislations as a result of these discussions. 337 International Protection (EU harmonised protection status) In accordance with the prevailing opinion that climate change and natural disasters do not offer any protection grounds for refugee status according to the 1951 Refugee Convention, European countries also reject such an interpretation. 338 To qualify as refugee, the claimant would therefore need to provide a link to one of the five protection grounds under the 1951 Refugee Convention or rather, in the case of EU MSs, under the 2011 QD. Similar to refugee status, the brief survey of selected countries for this study did not reveal that any of the EU MSs plan to make use of subsidiary protection for reasons of environmental or natural disasters. 335 EMN (2018b). 336 EMN (2018b). 337 EMN (2018b). 338 Explicitly stated by AT, CZR, DE to a questionnaire on environmentally induced migration distributed by ICMPD to selected EU+ countries in March 2020.

The SWP replaced the Pacific Seasonal Worker Pilot Scheme in 2012, scaling up efforts to facilitate the recruitment of workers for the agriculture and accommodation industries while helping further the development of regional workers and their origin communities. Meanwhile, the Pacific Labour Mobility Scheme was established in 2018 following a pilot programme and aims to meet Australian low- and semi-skill labour needs and offer opportunities to those living in the Pacific region. It is one of the initiatives under Australia\u2019s \u2018Step-up\u2019 foreign policy to increase its engagement in the Pacific and respond to challenges the region is facing, including climate change and disasters.

In such cases it cannot be excluded that the person could be granted subsidiary protection in Austria according to Art 8 Asylum Act 2005. 339 Non-harmonised EU protection status Besides the harmonised international protection statuses, EU MSs make use of providing more favourable standards to protection than defined in the respective EU law by extending protection to people who do not fall under international protection. A recent EMN report provides an overview of such national protection statuses in 25 EU MSs plus Norway that participated in the survey. The EMN found national protection statuses covering humanitarian or compassionate grounds, which encompass more generic legislative definitions to more specific ones such as medical cases, national statuses based on the principle of non-refoulement as well as statuses linked to environmental change and natural disasters . 340 The EMN classifies these statuses at the interface between subsidiary protection and Art 3 ECHR. 341 Table 5: Overview of non-harmonised protection statuses in MS+ Type of National Protection Status Countries apply the status # of countries Overarching humanitarian grounds BE, CY, CZ, EL, ES, FI, IE, IT, LT, MT, NL, PL, SE, SK, NO 15 Exceptional circumstances AT, EL, FI, IT, LU, SE 6 Non-refoulement CZ, ES, FI, HU, IT, PL, UK, NO 9 Climate change and natural disaster IT, SE 2 Source: adapted from EMN (2020), only national protection statuses were listed that from their scope potentially could encompass protection due to environmental change and natural disasters. As illustrated in the table above, an explicit mention and a dedicated national protection status for environmental reasons only exists in Italy and Sweden , while Finland encompasses such grounds under a more general status for humanitarian and compassionate reasons. The Swedish Aliens Act (2005:716), Chapter 4 section 2a together with Chapter 5 section 1, provides protection for a person who cannot return to his or her country of origin because of an environmental disaster. The residence permit could last for up to 3 years; however it is currently suspended as a consequence of the high number of arrivals in 2015-16. In Italy , national protection can be granted to migrants \u2013 who first do not qualify for international protection \u2013 if there are \"serious reasons\" of a 339 Response from the Austrian Ministry of Interior to a questionnaire on environmentally induced migration distributed by ICMPD in March 2020. 340 EMN (2020), p.5. 341 EMN (2020), p.5.

As in the case of Sweden, Finland suspended the respected provisions as a consequence of the high number of arrivals in 2015-16. Another example of providing a national status can be found in Switzerland in Art 83 of the Swiss Foreign Nationals and Integration Act. This article provides temporary admission if the enforcement of a removal order (from a humanitarian point of view) is not reasonable because the person concerned is \u2018in concrete danger in situations such as war, civil war, general violence and medical emergency in his or her home country or country of origin\u2019. The Federal Council already affirmed in 2008 that this regulation is applicable to \"disaster displaced persons\". In addition, there is a provision in both the Swiss Asylum Act and the Aliens and Integration Act on the basis of which the enforcement of the return to a region affected by a natural disaster can be temporarily suspended (Article 44 para. 2 Asylum Act and Article 83 para. 4 Aliens and Integration Act). 344 Beyond a specific status, in Cyprus , Art 29(4) of the Refugee Law of 2000 345 includes environmental destruction as an additional reason for non-refoulement of refugees and beneficiaries of subsidiary protection. Environmental destruction does by itself not provide a protection ground but extends the non-refoulement obligation enshrined in international refugee law. 346 Germany has been working to establish mechanisms to provide adequate protection to people affected by disaster-induced displacement in disaster-prone countries as part of its humanitarian assistance and development cooperation. 347 While those discussions did not extend to a specific legal pathway or status, the German Advisory Council on Global Change proposed in August 2018 to develop a \u201cclimate passport\u201d that \u201cshould offer those who are at risk of global warming the option to gain access to civil rights in safe countries.\u201d The climate passport should, in its first phase, open early, voluntary and humane migration routes to the populations of small island states whose territory will likely become uninhabitable due to climate change. The \"climate passport\" should therefore apply to those people who would become stateless if their home were uninhabitable. 348 Besides these examples, the research revealed neither further direct reference to protection for environmental migrants in other countries nor any current plans on the part of national policymakers to introduce such provisions in the near future.

This was also concluded in the EMN study. 351 Still, the examples of Finland and Sweden have inspired others as to how these examples could be integrated into the EU protection framework. Hush, for example, proposes either using the Swedish example to extend serious harm under Art 15 by inserting a new paragraph (d) extending to environmental catastrophes or, deriving from the Finnish example, adding a new harmonised protection ground \u2018humanitarian protection\u2019 as a new Art 15a which shall refer to an impediment to return as a result of an environmental catastrophe. 352 5.3.3. European jurisprudence 5.3.3.1. Introduction M Scott\u2019s 353 review of judicial decisions globally found that disaster and climate change are peripheral to the majority of claims that were identified and reviewed. In the vast majority of the filtered cases, the claimant did not articulate concerns about being exposed to disaster-related harm if returned. References to disaster rather appear as general information from country of origin reports. 354 Still, there are also a number of cases where the applicant claimed refugee status or a complementary status based on human rights violations. As mentioned above and according to most commentators, 355 the international refugee regime does not provide for a protection status for climate-induced migrants. In the European context, the jurisprudence of the European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR) and the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) are of utmost importance in understanding whether the body of human rights law, anchored within the ECHR or the EU CFR, imposes an obligation to grant some form of protection to people fleeing because of environmental changes in their home country. The present section concentrates on claims related to the right to life and the prohibition of torture and inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment. States are confronted with these questions when they must decide whether environmental migrants and displaced people can be sent back to their country of origin. Thus, while public discussions often centre around the question of whether a person who left 349 It was the aim of the QD to harmonise the wide spread state practice on protection for people failing to fulfil the strict criteria for refugee status.

However, a number of judgements contain some references to environmental change and the respective jurisprudence on health-related impediments to return, illustrating some similarities that may thus provide some insights. The ECHR, in particular Art 2 (right to life) and Art 3 (prohibition of torture and inhuman and degrading treatment), extended the scope of protection obligations for Council of Europe states to not return a person if their life or physical integrity are arbitrarily endangered there. The jurisprudence of the ECtHR was essential to developing further the non-refoulement principle. Since the landmark decision Soering vs. UK , 357 the court has developed a rich jurisprudence on Art 3, 358 extending its scope from pure domestic to foreign issues. A state is thus not only obliged not to torture, but the state is also prohibited from returning a foreigner to his or her country of origin if torture or inhuman or degrading treatment awaits him or her there, constituting an extraterritorial effect of Art 3 ECHR. 359 Compared to the cases that determined the obligation under Art 3 to not return a person to a country where torture or inhuman and degrading treatment awaits them, the situation of environmental migrants is different. The expected harm does not originate from physical violence but rather from socio-economic vulnerabilities, which are at first sight not protected by Art 3 ECHR. 360 The ECtHR has not yet had the opportunity to develop jurisprudence around environmental change in the context of return. However, its case law based on Article 3 ECHR prohibiting the removal of sick persons to a country where they would face inhuman or degrading treatment may provide an entry point . 361 5.3.3.2. Return of sick people Since the landmark ruling of D vs. UK in 1997, it became a well-established standard in migration processes to determine whether health-related reasons would impede the return of an irregular migrant, denied asylum seeker or a foreigner whose legal stay is coming to an end. The ECtHR set a very high threshold that must be met in order to invoke the protection of Art 3 ECHR from being returned to the country of origin or return in such cases. The high threshold as first determined in the D vs. UK ruling and further concretised in N vs. UK referred to exceptional circumstances consisting of (but not limited to) a final stage of a disease with a real risk 356 McAdam (2020). 357 Soering vs. UK, Application no. 14038/88. 358 See further Cruz Varas v.

This high threshold dominated the case law until the 2016 Paposhvili vs. Belgium ruling. In the latter, the Grand Chamber refined its interpretation of \u201cother very exceptional cases\u201d as mentioned in N vs. UK . The Court concluded that \u201cother very exceptional cases\u201d would also include persons who are not at imminent risk of dying but who would face a real risk of \u201cbeing exposed to a serious, rapid and irreversible decline in his or her state of health resulting in intense suffering or to a significant reduction in life expectancy\u201d (para. 183). Also, in M.S.S. vs. Belgium and Greece 362 (a non-medical Art 3 case), the court had to decide on a claim from an Afghan applicant whom Belgian authorities intended to return to Greece according to the Dublin Regulation. The Court referred to the inaction of the Greek authorities, \u201cfor the situation in which the applicant has found himself for several months, living on the street, with no resources or access to sanitary facilities, and without any means of providing for his essential needs\u201d (para 263). The court followed that this situation amounted to a violation of Art 3 (para 264). In arguing in how far states\u2019 conduct is of relevance, the ECHR in Sufi and Elmi v UK 363 emphasised that states shall not be liable for lacking the resources to mitigate an applicant\u2019s circumstances when those result from external factors rather than its own act or omission. As an example, the court referred to natural phenomena such as drought (paras 281, 282). In the quoted case law, the ECtHR repeated that a certain level of severity had to be met but also took a sincere view of living conditions and other accompanying elements. When determining the real risk of an Art 3 infringement, the court thus regularly also takes socio-economic harm into account , which can amount to inhuman or degrading treatment, especially if several risks accumulate. However, as McAdam stated, \u201c[Courts] have carefully circumscribed the meaning of \u2018inhuman or degrading treatment\u2019 so that it cannot be used as a remedy for general poverty, unemployment, or a lack of resources or medical care except in exceptional circumstances. They have been especially reluctant to find that a person needs international protection unless a State deliberately withholds resources or actively occasions harm. It is therefore unlikely that a lack of basic services alone would substantiate a complementary protection claim unless this were to render survival on return impossible.\u201d 364 The question thus remains whether subsidiary protection according to Art 15b QD could develop an alternative ground for environmental claims in the EU protection framework. While by its wording Art 15b QD is very similar to Art 3 ECHR, 365 the CJEU determined in M\u2019Bodj vs. Etat belge 366 that, to qualify for subsidiary protection, serious harm as outlined in Art 15 QD must be linked with one of the actors of persecution according to Art 6 QD. In this respect, the Court clarifies that Art 6 362 MSS vs Belgium and Greece 2011-I Eur. Ct.

On the contrary, the CJEU might exclude environmentally displaced from subsidiary protection . 369 Concluding that the CJEU may exclude subsidiary protection and thus the application of the QD, the question still remains whether, ultimately, a person can be returned to a country or region which became unsafe due to climate change or natural disaster. Again, the CJEU's case law on returning sick people may provide insight into how the court would rule in such cases. 5.3.4. National jurisprudence The research regarding national jurisprudence on migration claims in environmental contexts revealed little. Some MSs reported that there have been sporadic claims related to environmental issues. 370 However, these claims are usually interlinked with other claims in relation to the grounds laid down in the Geneva Convention. Statistics in this regard are non-existent. Still, national European courts sometimes mentioned natural disasters, but rather with the aim of substantiating and delimiting the requirements for refugee status. For example, the Polish Regional Administrative Court ruled that the Convention relating to the Status of Refugees contains a finite list of grounds on which refugee status may be recognised and does not include victims of war, natural disasters, or famine, family situation, unemployment, lack of educational opportunities or poverty. 371 In a case from the Administrative Court in Luxembourg , the judge looked in his reasoning at the possibility to grant subsidiary protection for reasons beyond the usual considerations (internal armed conflict, ability to get protection from the authorities, etc.) and examined the environmental conditions that can render a return difficult, if not impossible, for Iraqi applicants. 372 The case was not linked to climate change or \u2018environmental protection\u2019 but showed that environmental reasons can and are taken up by courts when deciding whether a person can be returned or not. 367 M\u2019Bodj v Etat belge, para 35. 368 M\u2019Bodj v Etat belge para 44. 369 Delval (2020). 370 Survey on environmentally induced migration distributed by ICMPD in March 2020 to selected European countries. 371 Regional Administrative Court in Warsaw, 1 October 2012, V SA/Wa 873/12; quoted at https://www.asylumlawdatabase.eu/en/case- law/poland-regional-administrative-court-warsaw-1-october-2012-v-sawa-87312. 372 \u2018les conditions climatiques difficilement supportables pour des personnes habitu\u00e9es \u00e0 des temp\u00e9ratures climatiques \u00e9lev\u00e9es\u2019; see: Luxembourg - Administrative Tribunal, 3rd Chamber, 38651, 11 July 2017 at https://www.asylumlawdatabase.eu/en/case- law/luxembourg-administrative-tribunal-3rd-chamber-38651-11-july-2017.

Within the framework of Section 60 (5) of the Residence Act in conjunction with Art 3 of the ECHR, non-governmental dangers due to precarious living conditions can also be taken into account, although this is only considered in very exceptional individual cases.\u201d 373 The Court further took up discriminatory practice as a requirement for subsidiary protection and stated that \u201c[e]ven if the person concerned is in an essentially comparable situation with other people, an exception to Art 3 ECHR can exceptionally be affirmed if the deportation would lead to a serious, rapid and irreversible deterioration in his health.\u201d To answer the question of whether there is a risk of a violation of Art 3 ECHR, the Court took many factors (such as access to work, water, food, health care and the chance to find adequate accommodation, access to sanitary facilities and last but not least the financial means to satisfy elementary needs, also taking into account return assistance etc.) into account. The Court determined that \u201can exceptional case in the aforementioned sense only exists in the case of a very high level of damage, in which the humanitarian reasons are \"mandatory\" in accordance with the requirements of Art 3 ECHR.\u201d 374 5.3.5.

It is a remote and low-lying nation (mean elevation of 2 meters) in the Pacific Ocean with a population of about 112,000. 375 Tuvalu is a country in Polynesia, located in the Pacific Ocean, about midway between Hawaii and Australia. The country has a mean elevation of two meters above the Pacific and a population of about 11,000. 376 A rise in temperatures of 2 degrees more would \u2013 according to some calculations \u2013 make island states like Tuvalu disappear. 377 5.3.5.1. The Tuvalu case law Already in 1996, 378 a 35-year-old woman from Tuvalu requested protection status in Australia. The Australian Tribunal dismissed the claim but recognised the potential for socio-economic harm to engage host state protection obligations under the Refugee Convention, provided that the causal nexus could be established between the harm feared and one of the five Convention grounds. 379 For the claim in question, however, the Tribunal denied refugee status as the socio-economic impacts were not a result of persecution. 373 VGH Mannheim from 29.10.2019, A 11 S 1203/19, http://lrbw.juris.de/cgi- bin/laender_rechtsprechung/document.py?Gericht=bw&nr=29831, para: 96-100. 374 Ibid. 375 Central Intelligence Agency World Factbook, at: https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/tv.html. 376 Central Intelligence Agency World Factbook, at: https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/tv.html. 377 UN News (2019): Stop Tuvalu and \u2018the world from sinking\u2019 UN chief tells island nation facing existential threat from rising seas; at: https://news.un.org/en/story/2019/05/1038661. 378 RRT Case No96/10806 (1996). 379 Scott (2020), p.50.

This case concerned a Tuvaluan family of four (a couple and two children) who applied in New Zealand for refugee status or , in eventu, that they could not return because of the danger of arbitrary deprivation of their lives and because of the danger of being subjected to cruel treatment in case of return to Tuvalu. The court rejected the refugee and human rights claim 380 because it did not fulfil the refugee definition in the absence of a persecutor and one of the five grounds of persecution. However, the Tribunal granted resident visas on the humanitarian claim because of their strong family ties in New Zealand. 381 Still, the case drew much media attention \u2013 wrongly \u2013 celebrating it as the first environmental protection case. 382 5.3.5.2.

This also applied to Mr Teitiota, from Kiribati, who wished to extend his visa in New Zealand after he overstayed. As no other way to legalise his status was available, his case reached broad public attention or, as it was put, he became \u201can international celebrity, a stand-in for the thousands of people in Kiribati \u2014 as well as millions more worldwide \u2014 expected to be forced from their homes due to rising seas and other disruptions on a warming planet.\u201d 383 Mr Teitiota\u2019s residence permit ended in 2010. After overstaying, he applied for refugee status in 2012, which was denied in first and further national instances in New Zealand. In 2015, he was returned to Kiribati, from where he filed a complaint to the Human Rights Committee claiming a violation of his right to life according to Art 6 ICCPR by removing him to Kiribati and not the right not to be subjected to inhuman or degrading treatment under Art 7 ICCPR. 384 In his claim, Mr Teitiota argued that the effects of climate change and sea level rise led to saltwater contamination and scarce fresh water. Additionally, land erosion led to overcrowding on Tarawa and a housing crisis and related disputes, which exacerbated an untenable and violent environment for him and his family (para 2.1.). The Committee, as the New Zealand national courts had done before, found the claim \u201centirely credible, and accepted the evidence\u201d 385 which was presented.

Conclusions: protection in the context of environmental displacement The EU \u2013 with some exceptions \u2013 has remained quite silent on the issue of environmental migration and displacement. In the external dimension , the EU mentions climate change and disasters as potential root causes for migration, but hardly offers any concrete actions. In the internal dimension , the European Commission did not further build on its 2014 staff working paper. The European Parliament emphasised at times the links between climate change and disasters and migration and the need for addressing the identified legal gaps at EU level. At the MS level , with the exception of a few countries, environmental reasons are not addressed in laws related to international protection or legal migration. With hardly any cases based on environmental change and disaster related reasons for fleeing the home country, EU MSs currently see little need to address these phenomena in national laws. Additionally, European and national courts have not yet had to decide upon a claim by a victim of climate change or natural disaster. In this context, it does not come as a surprise that neither the current nor latest proposals for the next generation of the CEAS include any references to the nexus between environmental change or natural disasters and international protection. In the absence of a specialised legal framework or dedicated provisions, the current EU legal framework \u2013 as described in this section \u2013 offers a piecemeal of possible entry points to the EU for people leaving their country of origin in the context of climate change and natural disasters: Refugee protection according to the QD requires a well-founded fear of persecution because of race, religion, nationality, political opinion or membership to a particular social group as well as a lack of protection provided by the country of origin. People forced to flee due to climate change and natural disasters thus only may cater for refugee protection if they fulfil the definition of a refugee. This may apply, for example, if a state arbitrarily denies access to basic socio-economic rights of a particular group (e.g. a minority) in the country. Only in such cases may the person be granted refugee status, which 387 Behlert (2020). 388 McAdam (2020), p.38. 389 Among many other articles, see The Guardian(2020) https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jan/20/climate-refugees-cant-be- returned-home-says-landmark-un-human-rights-ruling; Newsweek (2020) https://www.newsweek.com/climate-refugees-cannot- turned-away-united-nations-committee-rules-1483076. 390 See McAdam (2020), p.38.

        "IPOL | Policy Department for Citizens\u2019 Rights and Constitutional Affairs 86 PE 655.591 would provide international protection and a long-time residence permit with and comprehensive access to rights. Should refugee status not apply, the QD offers subsidiary protection if a person shows substantial grounds for facing a real risk of suffering serious harm if returned to his or her country of origin. Serious harm is closely connected to the right to life and the prohibition of torture or inhuman and degrading treatment as protected by Art 2 and 3 ECHR. When deciding on the return of sick migrants, the ECtHR ruled that Art 3 ECHR could be violated in case of exceptional circumstances also in the absence of an actor of persecution or serious harm. However, in the context of the QD, the CJEU ruled differently and denied the benefits of subsidiary protection to sick people arguing that extending the protection to such cases would contradict the rationale of the directive. Consequently, even if courts would see a violation of Art 2 or Art 3 ECHR in cases of returning third country nationals to a place destroyed by climate change or natural disaster, it is likely that also in such cases the benefits of subsidiary protection according to the QD would be denied. Another solution therefore would require an amendment of the QD, e.g. by explicitly including climate change as one of the elements for serious harm in Art 15 QD. Subsidiary protection would provide for a temporary residence permit, limited access to rights, however, with the option for a long-term solution, should climate change or natural disaster prove to prevent the return over a longer period of time. In the absence of international protection (i.e. refugee or subsidiary protection status), the applicability of Art 2 or 3 ECHR may still trigger the non-refoulement provision under the RD. Thus, the non- refoulement provision of the RD may still prohibit the return, however without any EU harmonised status. In fact, various MSs fill the existing gap between international protection and non-refoulement according to Art 3 ECHR by applying non-harmonised protection statuses . Those non-harmonised protection statuses, however, usually offer more limited rights and protection than international protection does. Still, the few examples of EU MS legislation referring to environmental reasons and natural disasters, such as Italy, Sweden, Finland, are based on non-harmonised, thus national, statuses. While many other countries not explicitly mention environmental change or natural disasters in national protection status, they still may interpret such cases under broader notions of \u2018humanitarian protection\u2019 or \u2018protection based on exceptional circumstances\u2019. The absence of any protection solutions, however, would leave affected persons in a situation of limbo. Temporary protection in case of mass influx would be a valid tool for the mobility of larger number of people in the course of disasters, whether caused by environmental or other factors, but has so far proved toothless, and there is little to expect from this instrument. The EU further has a number of tools that could be used as pathways to protection, either in the form of evacuation programmes or resettlement, but again they would also require adaptation to cater to victims of environmental change and natural disasters.

        "Climate Change and Migration PE 655.591 87 6. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 6.1. Conclusions The present study has focused on the nexus between environmental change, migration, displacement and protection. The report shows that environmental change affects migration in very different ways. Addressing protection concerns is a key, but not the only response. As a corollary, a focus on causation and related concepts such as \u2018environmental migrant\u2019 or \u2018environmentally displaced person\u2019 does not necessarily help to address protection challenges arising in the context of environmental change and migration. While the concept of \u2018environmental migration and displacement\u2019 remains contested, there are clear links between environmental change , including climate change and various types of migration . Thus, available evidence suggests that climate change is likely to increase the likelihood of a number of natural hazards which in turn will have significant effects on migration drivers and thus will have an impact on migration flows. Nevertheless, drivers of migration are complex, and environmental change will always be mediated by a variety of other social, economic and political factors. As the report shows, debates focus very much on the environmental change as a cause of migration . Related estimates evoke images of a migration threat but, at the same time, largely do not stand up to scrutiny. By contrast, IDMC data collection on disaster-related internal displacement provides a robust and continuously improved evidence base that should be the basis for any further development of data on global disaster related displacement. As the report has shown, environmental change not only may act as a driver of mobility, but also goes along with significant immobility . In addition, it may adversely affect immobilised populations, such as persons displaced in protracted displacement situations as a result of conflict, persecution or violence. Finally, migration also needs to be seen as part of the solution , and not just as an effect of environmental change, highlighting the need to embrace that mobility:(cross-border) mobility can and indeed needs to be part of responses to adverse environmental changes. There have been a number of initiatives since 2011 that aim to establish approaches, spur action for cooperation and provide practical recommendations on responding to environmental displacement. These initiatives signal a recognition of the increasing importance of the issue and of the need for coordinated efforts to address it . The efforts explored in this report have emphasised practical guidance, information sharing and capacity building as important tools for translating ideas into action. Meanwhile, increasingly forward- looking approaches have emphasised the need to identify, mitigate and prevent future risks, including through fostering resilience to climate change and disasters, in which migration can play a role. At the global level, there seems to be an understanding that there is little appetite for a binding legislative framework for addressing environmental displacement. Initiatives have thus largely taken the form of guidelines and toolboxes, which aim to collect and share good practices and thus make these ideas and approaches more accessible to stakeholders. At the European level , the nexus of environmental change and migration has increasingly been addressed in the last decade and in several contexts \u2013 civil protection, humanitarian aid and ",
        "IPOL | Policy Department for Citizens\u2019 Rights and Constitutional Affairs 88 PE 655.591 development policy, although no concrete initiatives addressing protection needs have materialised yet. While the overall nexus of environmental change, migration and displacement thus has received increasing attention, there has been only a very limited debate on appropriate tools to address the admission or residence of persons moving for reasons connected to climate change or natural disasters. To some extent, this can be attributed to the lack of data that would shed light on the significance and scope of cross-border displacement , or the scale of persons unable to return. While existing evidence shows that people affected by \u2018environmental change\u2019 predominantly remain in their country or the closer region, environmental considerations are likely to become more important \u2013 whether directly or indirectly \u2013 in future migration and asylum claims in the EU. In the absence of a dedicated legal instrument, people affected may need to lean upon existing protection tools, whether appropriate or not. Human rights safeguards may step in at times but they do not (yet) ensure full recognition of the problem and thus do not provide for an appropriate umbrella of protection . The study reviewed various EU legal instruments designed for the protection of people in need for international protection and related legal instruments as well as the respective case law of the CJEU and the ECtHR. From this, the study concludes that 1. environmental reasons are not among the grounds for international protection nor were they yet subject of claims in front of the CJEU or the ECtHR; 2. that the case law of the CJEU and ECtHR on the return of sick third country nationals offers parallels for potential cases of victims of climate change and/or natural disasters; 3. that, however, the CJEU interprets the scope of subsidiary protection in a restrictive manner, requesting protection from an actor of persecution or harm; 4. that in order to fill a gap of a dedicated EU international protection ground, a small number of three EU countries know non-harmonised national protection grounds for victims of natural disasters and broader environmental factors. Due to this small number of countries, the potential for a joint EU approach to this matter seems unlikely, particularly in view of the stalemate around the CEAS reform and the repercussions of the 2015-16 \u2018migration and refugee crisis\u2019. Given that migration and asylum claims in the EU may in the nearer future more frequently also address reasons of environmental degradation due to climate change and/or natural disasters, the EU and its MSs, however, are well advised to proactively address the existing gap of available solutions. The awaited Pact on Migration and Asylum may offer an opportunity to put migration in the context of climate change and natural disasters on the political agenda for the coming five years . Given the long list of priorities in the field of migration and asylum, it is however unlikely that a \u2018relatively new\u2019 topic without evidence on its significance and urgency will be given much attention. Thus, while climate change and migration are both \u2013 separately \u2013 important issues on the European agenda, the nexus of the two stands to be much further strengthened. ",
        "Climate Change and Migration PE 655.591 89 6.2. Policy Recommendations 6.2.1. Contribute to conceptual clarity Solutions for environmental migration and displacement must acknowledge the diversity of environmental drivers (including scope, intensity and duration), as different situations may involve different needs and frameworks with which to respond. Do environmental changes occur as slow or sudden-onset events? Do environmental events force people to leave or rather trigger voluntary migration? Do international protection tools provide adequate tools to address such movements, or should they be addressed through regular legal migration pathways? Does the strict dichotomy between forced and voluntary migration generally provide satisfactory answers for these challenges? More broadly, should responses address the consequences of climate change only or also encompass displacement due to geophysical events? The range of mobility needs and challenges associated with climate change and natural disasters calls for a multi-sectoral, two-pronged approach that both addresses root causes and consequences of the climate change-migration nexus. A debate on these questions and a resulting consolidation of terminology are necessary preconditions for any further steps in the EU\u2019s external and internal dimensions . The EU should thus clarify its position on concepts related to climate change and environmental degradation and its consequences. The European Parliament should therefore \u2022 further promote the gathering of evidence on the effects of climate change and environmental change more generally on migration and displacement . It should do this in cooperation with third countries and regions that are facing mobility issues in the context of climate change and environmental degradation. To improve the evidence base, data collection on disaster-related cross-border displacement based on the methodology of the IDMC data collection on internal displacement should be promoted. \u2022 provide a platform for information sharing on migration and displacement to the EU. This discussion should extend \u2013 but not be limited to \u2013 an assessment of migration and asylum claims within the EU that have already brought forward environmental elements. The European Parliament should further initiate an exchange with EU MSs to test the waters on MS\u2019 awareness and readiness to address such reasons in the framework of migration and asylum policies, at the EU or national level, and promote the exchange of information on claims made with reference to environmental factors, such as through the establishment of a case law database. \u2022 offer a platform for an EU-wide discussion to adopt an EU position on the nexus between climate change, environmental degradation and disasters on mobility to guide the EU\u2019s contribution to mitigate and prevent impacts of climate change and environmental degradation on mobility in the EU external dimension as well as its policy in the internal dimension. ",
        "IPOL | Policy Department for Citizens\u2019 Rights and Constitutional Affairs 90 PE 655.591 6.2.2. Develop a coherent policy on the nexus of climate change and natural disasters and mobility in the external dimension The European Parliament should \u2022 promote the mainstreaming of mobility considerations in the context of climate change and natural disasters across EU policies, strategies and programming in the external dimension to reflect the multifaceted nature of related challenges and the need for comprehensive approaches to strengthen protections, reduce risks and foster resilience. These considerations should be regularly incorporated into programmes as part of EU external relations generally as well as into mobility-focussed programmes including the EU\u2019s Mobility Partnerships, the various EU dialogues and programmes under the CAMM. \u2022 incorporate migration and displacement issues into the EU\u2019s international engagement on the issue of climate change . \u2022 insist to the European Commission that EU policies, strategies and programming should not stop at solely acknowledging climate change and natural disasters as potential triggers for migration but lead to concrete actions in related fields of the EU\u2019s external dimension. Relatedly, policies should not solely be aimed at keeping people from moving but also at creating ways in which people can migrate safely and legally as a way to cope with climate change-related challenges. \u2022 urge that the EU take concrete solidarity actions on addressing the effects of climate change and natural disasters on migration within the context of the GCM and the GCR. \u2022 encourage EU MSs and the Commission to ramp up actions to mitigate the consequences of climate change and natural disasters on mobility. Specifically, in the context of the implementation of the GCR, the European Parliament could request that the Commission address in its pledges the nexus between climate change and natural disasters and mobility by proposing concrete actions with third countries directly affected. Actions could include providing support for planned relocation or for contingency planning and emergency response structures. \u2022 request that the EU leverage its role in international fora, including participation in and financial support to international organisation- and state-led initiatives and multilateral development banks, to address the complexities of environmental displacement, ensuring the incorporation of the issue into discussions and initiatives in the fields of migration and displacement, climate change and disasters and humanitarian and development aid. This should also include offering financing to implement these and resulting efforts . Promoting international cooperation through the Global Compacts, Global Platform for Disaster Risk Reduction and other venues can be important vehicles for the EU and its partners to address environmental drivers of migration and displacement. \u2022 promote the creation of protection guidelines in different world regions like those created in the Americas, focusing on regions that are most impacted by climate change and disasters. It can also help strengthen guidance on thematic topics, as done by MICIC and the IASC Operational ",
        "Climate Change and Migration PE 655.591 91 Guidelines on Human Rights and Natural Disasters. To increase the efficacy of such support, the EU should also engage in capacity building activities around their implementation. \u2022 provide technical and financial assistance to support national-level initiatives , like those conducted in the Pacific, including in collaboration with UNHCR, development agencies or other relevant organisations. This could include supporting efforts to develop comprehensive policies to facilitate a whole-of-government approach that works with civil societies and communities, as in Vanuatu, as well as more targeted policy development, like Fiji\u2019s planned relocation guidelines. \u2022 support the development and implementation of free movement agreements like the Protocol on Free Movement of Persons in the IGAD region and promote them as tools to provide migration pathways or humanitarian corridors for those facing climate change and slow- and sudden-onset disasters . \u2022 in addition to reacting to crises, support the adoption of a forward-looking approach that works to understand and respond to future risks, decrease vulnerability and promote resilience in line with Goal 13 of the SDGs, including the use of migration as an adaptation strategy but one that is a voluntary choice. This can include supporting the creation of labour migration pathways in Europe and elsewhere, especially for the portion of impacted persons for whom permanent relocation is necessary (e.g. Kiribati\u2019s program). Temporary programs or permits as those provided for by the Seasonal Workers Directive can also be leveraged and expanded to harness the potential of migration as an adaptation strategy. 6.2.3. Develop a strategy for providing solutions for asylum and migration claims connected to environmental change Addressing environmental migration and displacement is not a priority of reforms within the EU in the area of migration and asylum. Both the 2015 \u2018migration and refugee crisis\u2019 and the migratory and protection implications of the current Covid-19 pandemic leave little space for the issue at the moment. At the same time, the exclusive attention on these crises would be a missed opportunity, not least given the prominence of climate change as a leading policy challenge for the current Commission. In the EU context, the European Parliament has been at the forefront of advocating to more effectively address environmental migration and displacement. Against this background, the European Parliament should \u2022 continue this important role and request a future-oriented EU asylum and migration policy which shall, finally, take more imperative actions on environmental migration and displacement alongside other emerging challenges. \u2022 continue to support knowledge generation on the nexus of environmental change and migration and the concrete impact of this phenomenon on migration and asylum claims within the EU . It is difficult to understand the scope of environmental migration and displacement to the EU without sufficient data and evidence; initiating more thorough research would build the evidence base and shed light on the scope of cases where third country nationals based migration and asylum claims on climate change and/or natural disasters in EU countries.

        "IPOL | Policy Department for Citizens\u2019 Rights and Constitutional Affairs 92 PE 655.591 \u2022 proactively test the waters among respective EU institutions, the European Commission, the Council, EU MSs and other stakeholders with respect to different policy options to address environmental migration and displacement . An important test will come up with the forthcoming Pact on Migration and Asylum . Although the Pact has yet not been issued as of the time of writing this report, there are indications that the Pact will address environmental migration and displacement. The European Parliament should therefore use this window of opportunity to take a clear position towards the European Commission on the importance to arrive at EU level at a common position on how to address future migration challenges in the context of climate change and natural disasters in its various facets . The Parliament could request the European Commission to initiate a consensus making process on potential ways of addressing different facets of the impact of environmental change and natural disasters on migration and asylum to the EU. This process could be facilitated through a green paper on the impact of environmental change and natural disasters on migration and asylum to the EU. The paper could address different possibilities to address the phenomenon on a legal level (see the following recommendation). \u2022 acknowledge that the impacts of environmental change on migration and displacements are multifaceted. Environmental change can lead to voluntary as well as to forced movements which may be long-term, mid-term or short-term. Therefore, there may be different avenues through which the European Parliament can seek to address the needs of those affected by these phenomena : o Alternative 1: \u2018A Brave New Instrument\u2019: The European Parliament could support to develop a new, comprehensive legal instrument that would address environmental migration. and displacement Amongst others, it could offer new types of entry and residence permits for the EU with a duration depending on whether the impact of environmental events is long, mid or short term. Such a new instrument, however, could also address only specific forms of movements due to environmental change or disaster related displacement as an overarching category. o Alternative 2: \u2018The Piecemeal Approach\u2019: T he European Parliament could take a piecemeal approach and promote adding or expanding solutions across different protection and migration instruments. For instance the QD could qualify the consequences of climate change and natural disasters on the lives of people affected as \u2018serious\u2019 harm by extending an additional point \u2018d\u2019 to Art 15 or introducing a new ground beyond \u2018serious harm\u2019 by indicating a new Article \u201815 a\u2019. The TPD could well be extended to situations of mass influx to an EU MS in case of serious and sudden on-set natural disasters in a third country. The RD may introduce safeguards to suspend return in case natural disasters impede the return of a person to her/his country of origin temporarily \u2013 e.g. by indicating a respective reference into Art 9. Respective changes could also be introduced into the Seasonal Workers Directive, the EU Resettlement Framework, etc. thus, existing migration and protection instruments could be adapted, keeping in mind that such migration may be temporary and linking conceptually to \u2018protection\u2019, \u2018work\u2019, \u2018education\u2019, \u2018vulnerability\u2019, etc. ",
        "Climate Change and Migration PE 655.591 93 o Alternative 3: \u2018The Status Quo, Wait & Observe\u2019: The European Parliament, however, also could opt to promote no specific action at this point and trust in its MSs to address these challenges once they become more pertinent through adapting national (non- harmonised) protection grounds to meet evolving needs. In this alternative, the European Parliament could closely observe the developments in EU MSs, identify good practices and could then take appropriate actions to promote the harmonisation of the various approaches developed by EU MSs. Depending on the evolving practices, this may lead to a new legal instrument or could be incorporated into the existing EU asylum and migration framework. ",
