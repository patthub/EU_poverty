        "1. The Committee of the Regions' views The Committee of the Regions 1.1 warmly welcomes the commitment to implement a new Social Agenda for 2005-2010, fully endorses its objectives and supports the strategies and the range of individual instru- ments set out to implement them, which are succinctly described in the slogan \u2018A social Europe in the global economy: jobs and opportunities for all\u2019; 1.2 particularly appreciates the fact that, despite Europe's slower rate of growth and the unsatisfactory results that the Lisbon Strategy has produced so far, the same Lisbon objectives promoting the social dimension of economic growth are again being put forward in the sphere of social policy and that the European social model, defined in the 2002 Barcelona Euro- pean Council as being based on \u2018good economic performance, a high level of social protection and education and social dialogue\u2019 is being relaunched; 1.3 endorses the principles upon which the Social Agenda is founded: the integrated approach, the promotion of quality jobs, the modernisation of social protection systems and, lastly, an approach based on the \u2018cost of the lack of social policy\u2019 principle; 1.4 points out , however, that the objectives set out are, at times, too general and that the wording with regard to the implementing instruments and deadlines needs to be more precise; 1.5 agrees that the \u2018cost of the lack of social policy\u2019 prin- ciple has to be taken into account as social policies can contri- bute towards the achievement of both social and economic objectives. They are not only a means of reducing social exclu- sion but can effectively help to achieve better economic results, for example, by increasing the economy's potential to adapt to changes on the global stage. In practice, non-existent or inade- quate social policies may thus have an adverse impact on potential economic growth; 1.6 notwithstanding the overall positive opinion expressed above, deplores the fact that the role and responsibilities of local and regional authorities are not explicitly mentioned in the Social Agenda, particularly since in most European coun- tries, the working definition and implementation of social poli- cies fall within their remit; 1.7 believes, therefore, that in line with the subsidiarity principle enshrined in the draft European Constitution and the recommendations set out in the 2001 White Paper on Euro- pean governance (Working paper on Ongoing and systematic policy dialogue with local-government associations ), the active invol- vement and subsequent action of local and regional authorities will be one of the preconditions for the successful implementa- tion of the Social Agenda's objectives; 1.8 hopes that through the involvement of grassroots authorities, current gaps and disparities between the different Member States will be reduced and that the best qualities of the European social model will be promoted. It is hoped however that, in the case of the latter, best practices are followed, rather than levelling down to the Member States lagging furthest behind in the area of social policies. The strategies, objectives, instruments and proposals of the Commission 2. Recommendations of the Committee of the Regions Increasing confidence The Committee of the Regions 2.1 is aware that these are times of great disquiet for the citizens of Europe (factors such as a slower rate of growth, reduction in purchasing power, an ageing population, the current perception that the European Union does not play a primary role on the global stage, difficulties affecting social protection systems, persistent poverty belts and economic and social exclusion, give rise to fear and defensive behaviour, and, furthermore, fuel long-standing and emerging forms of \u2018local egoism\u2019); thus agrees with the idea that boosting confidence must be a key element of European social strategy; 2.2 believes that firm action should be taken to disseminate accurate information so that the fears of both the older and more recent Member States are allayed; 2.3 stresses the need, however, for substantial objectives and the immediate delivery of perceptible improvements to living and working conditions to go hand in hand with the commitment towards better communication. These objectives should be adapted to the different circumstances and priorities of the various Member States, and local and regional authorities must be strongly involved in them. 3. The instruments The Committee of the Regions 3.1 believes that the range of instruments set out (legis- lation, social dialogue and financial instruments) should be vigorously deployed in order to counter the widespread loss of confidence; 3.2 notes the step forward taken by adding a general social clause (Article III-117) to the draft Constitutional Treaty, under which the social dimension will have to be taken into consid- eration in all Community policies; 3.3 welcomes the complementarity between the Social Agenda, the Lisbon strategy and the sustainable development strategy which must interact with all the Community policies. If the instrument for impact assessment developed by the Commission were to reflect the subsidiarity principle, in accordance with the draft Constitutional Treaty, this integrated approach could bring about practical progress with regard to social and employment policies; 7.2.2006 C 31/33 Official Journal of the European Union EN ",
        "3.4 calls on the Commission to implement the open method of coordination in conjunction with the current purely intergovernmental methodology: this should be done by invol- ving local and regional authorities, who will be the main actors involved in the management of the Agenda's financial instru- ments, especially concerning the \u2018Convergence\u2019 and \u2018Regional competitiveness and employment\u2019 objectives; 3.5 considers that it is imperative to make decisive progress towards the application throughout the Union of the Com- munity acquis , and emphasises that the legislation of the Member States must progressively incorporate European princi- ples and minimum standards in order to reduce the gaps and imbalances between them; 3.6 believes that, a year after the accession of new Member States, it would be appropriate for the Commission to review the restriction which limits the access of workers from the new Member States to the labour market in the former EU-15. In particular, it would be useful to assess the structural impact of this restriction on the status of labour relations; 3.7 believes that the restriction limiting the access of workers from new Member States to the labour market in the former EU-15 and the current debate on the Commission's proposal for a Directive on services in the internal market high- light the need to revise Directive 96/71 concerning the posting of workers in the framework of the provision of services. 4. Three conditions to succeed in increasing confidence The Committee of the Regions 4.1 recognises the importance of a new intergenerational approach which aims to provide greater and better prospects for young people. An increase in confidence and the relaunch of the Lisbon strategy objectives would necessarily depend on the central role of young people; in this context, it draws atten- tion to its opinion (EDUC 37, 2004) on the Proposal for a Decision of the European Parliament and of the Council creating the \u2018YOUTH IN ACTION\u2019 programme for the period 2007-2013; 4.2 calls for a detailed discussion, during 2005, of the Green Paper on the intergenerational dimension; 4.3 believes that the intense debate on the ageing popula- tion and the reform of pension schemes must be accompanied by an in-depth assessment and consideration of the currently deteriorating conditions facing young people with respect to income security and employment and professional prospects. Without neglecting the persistent problems of older citizens, due attention should be given, through an integrated approach, to groups at risk of social exclusion; 4.4 warmly welcomes the idea of an intergenerational part- nership that would build on the experience of older people and ensure that they remain within the economically active popula- tion, while ensuring that younger people have the opportunity to join them; therefore calls upon the Commission to introduce trials, dissemination of good practice and specific initiatives with a view to encouraging interaction between generations; 4.5 in line with the Commission Communication, attaches great importance to the idea of a partnership at all levels, viewing this as a crucial instrument for building the social capital that seems to have been diminished due to weak economic growth and compounded by the delay in imple- menting the Lisbon objectives, first among which is the provi- sion of decent working conditions for all European citizens; 4.6 emphasises the need for specific action to be taken in areas where, for historical or socioeconomic reasons, the prac- tice of partnership is less rooted in tradition or experience; 4.7 fully agrees on the importance of the EU's external dimension. Europe can and must take an active role on the international scene, particularly to press for decent working conditions for all and to ensure fair trade rules, as well as to protect and uphold the European social model in a globalised economy and its principles regarding human dignity, social justice and solidarity; 4.8 believes that there are at least two other preconditions for increasing citizen confidence: i) a citizenry with a high level of awareness of the European opportunities available to them; ii) a citizenry holding the necessary tools to take advantage of these opportunities, such as language skills; urges the European Commission to place emphasis on these conditions, as well as on the others. 5. The two priority areas: moving towards full employ- ment The Committee of the Regions 5.1 fully agrees with the strategy to maintain the objectives of employment and the quantity and quality of employment at the core of the Social Agenda. In accordance with the four priorities set out in the Kok Report, employment remains the key means to combat social exclusion and to foster sustained and ongoing economic growth; 5.2 supports the drafting of a Green Paper on the develop- ment of labour law. The widespread increase of new forms of work dictates that the legal instruments of labour law be updated; 5.3 believes that action in this area is necessary to ensure that the flexibility of employment, which is indispensable for modernising the labour market and for competitiveness, does not adversely affect workers' safety or result in an increased risk of social exclusion; 5.4 considers therefore that social dialogue remains a fundamental instrument and should be carried forward and reinforced in all ways in order to promote, facilitate and manage reforms while ensuring that they are socially just; 7.2.2006 C 31/34 Official Journal of the European Union EN ",
        "5.5 appreciates the Commission's intention to propose a new strategy on health and safety at work, which, through prevention initiatives, aims to ensure the health and safety of workers; 5.6 looks forward to the prospect of a European labour market; hopes , nevertheless, that it will not be restricted to pushing ahead with workers' mobility between the Member States but will rather serve to extend the rules and regulations governing the dynamics of the labour market, which success- fully combine maximum guarantees with maximum efficiency and productivity; 5.7 considers, in this context, that trans-national collective bargaining can be useful; 5.8 similarly, welcomes the promotion of corporate social responsibility; 5.9 similarly, welcomes the promotion of better and more effective coordination of social security schemes. 6. Towards a more cohesive society The Committee of the Regions 6.1 acknowledges that modernising social protection, including its financial sustainability, is a key component of the mid-term review of the Lisbon strategy; reiterates, however, that such \u2018modernisation\u2019 must ensure a more cohesive society and equal opportunities for all; 6.2 in the light of the above, believes that local and regional authorities should be called upon to play a central role in the modernisation process and that the Open Method of Coordination (OMC) should be extended to subnational regions and communes; 6.3 agrees with the proposals to rationalise the OMC through a single list of objectives that are common to the three areas of social inclusion, pensions and health; 6.4 fully welcomes the objective to combat poverty and promote social inclusion; 6.5 believes that a Community initiative to provide all citi- zens with minimum income schemes is highly important and calls on the Commission to develop specific actions in order to compare and contrast the various national and regional experi- ences and thus promote the dissemination of good practice and the comparative analysis of related regulations; 6.6 welcomes the idea of a European year of combating poverty and social exclusion (2010); nevertheless, expresses concern that similar initiatives (such as the other \u2018European year\u2019 events, outlined in the Commission Communication, to be held between now and 2010) may become merely celebra- tory, whereas they should, on the contrary, go hand in hand with a reinforcement of the specific actions to be promoted; 6.7 fully welcomes the objectives of combating discrimina- tion and promoting minority rights, not least by means of legis- lative initiatives; 6.8 supports the proposal for a European gender institute. Other existing instruments should, however, be improved in order to contribute more effectively to the evaluation of the experiences and the implementation of good practices devel- oped in the various Member States; 6.9 points to the need for the objective of combating discri- mination to be better articulated by setting out specific actions and measures to use for different situations: the objective of equal opportunities for men and women carries historical connotations and presents specific issues that cannot be reduced to the more general aspects of minority rights, which, moreover, affect the various Member States differently; 6.10 welcomes the commitment to drawn up a specific Communication on social services of general interest (SSIGs) and, above all, hopes that this initiative will help to overcome the legal uncertainties of the current framework. It recalls the prominent role played by local and regional authorities in the SSIG sector and the need to give them adequate support in order that they may continue to ensure universal access. To achieve the desired mobility of people within the EU, all Member States must make significant, coordinated progress in this sector. In this connection, it appreciates the Commission's intention to grant, under certain conditions, an exemption from notification regarding state aid for some social service areas such as hospitals and social housing. 7. Conclusions The Committee of the Regions urges the Commission to take adequate account of the effective role and responsibilities of local and regional authorities in the various areas covered by the Social Agenda, in accordance with the subsidiarity principle enshrined in the Constitutional Treaty, and reiterates that this is the best way to create a people's Europe that is also based on the principles of cohesion and solidarity, and is engaged in the process of making the EU the most competitive and dynamic knowledge-based economy in the world.
