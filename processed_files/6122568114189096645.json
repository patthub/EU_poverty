        "Transatlantic Economic Council (TEC) meeting and strengthening of the TEC 16. Is convinced that the TEC constitutes the most appropriate mechanism for managing the trans\u00ad atlantic economic relationship; urges the partners to use the full potential of the TEC in order to overcome the existing barriers to economic integration and to achieve a transatlantic market by 2015, based on the principle of a social market economy, which will be a positive response to the current economic and social crises; 17.

        "26. Believes that it is essential to ensure that key members of Congress and of the European Parliament are brought into the Legislators' Dialogue and the TEC process, in order to make sure that legislation has no unintended consequences for transatlantic trade and investment; hopes that the current TLD can gradually be upgraded to a transatlantic inter-parliamentary assembly, following recommendations made by Parliament in its above-mentioned resolution of 26 March 2009; Bilateral and international trade 27. Is resolved to continue calling on the US legislature \u2013 and urges the Commission to do likewise within the TEC \u2013 to reconsider the 100 % container scanning obligation, and to develop cooperation with the US based on risk management, including mutual recognition of the EU and US Trade Partnership Programmes, in accordance with the World Customs Organisation's SAFE Framework of Standards; 28.

Recalls that the international undertakings given regarding the MDGs, the achievement of many of which is lagging behind schedule, can only be honoured if the industrialised countries maintain their commitments and set aside 0,7 % of their GDP for overseas development aid by 2015; calls, therefore, on the EU and the US, and on other international donors, to honour their commitments and to take measures to speed up progress towards meeting the MDG targets by 2015; Economic and financial crises 31. Recalls that the Basel II Agreement, and its forthcoming revised version, is meant to be a global standard and urges the US speedily to implement Basel II; is therefore very much concerned that limitations laid down in various national laws adopted in response to the crisis (in particular in the US Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, limiting recognition of external ratings) would result in serious fragmentation in the application of this global standard; notes, further, that consistent global accounting rules are essential for a level playing field and calls on the US to adopt the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS); 32. Notes that the crisis was the worst global recession since the Great Depression, and that in response governments from around the world, especially in the EU and US, have cooperated in an unprecedented way to reform financial markets and institutions; urges the EU-US Financial Markets Regulatory Dialogue (FMRD), in its role of coordinating approaches between regulators, to identify gaps and work on improving convergence; 33. Considers that the economic and financial governance structures in place at the onset of the crisis, whether at global level, in the US or in the European Union, have not provided enough stability for the global financial system; believes that in the light of increasing economic and financial market inter\u00ad dependence cooperation on macroeconomic policies and surveillance of the major economies needs to be strengthened; acknowledges, further, that the EU must address the issue of its representation in the IMF; 34.

        "35. Notes that both the Frank-Dodd Bill and the programme of regulatory reform in the EU are consistent with the G20 initiatives, and considers it important for this cooperation to continue throughout the rulemaking process; notes that this is particularly evident in legislation on OTC derivatives markets; emphasises that many of the divergences are caused by differences in the nature of the legislatures and the roles of supervisors in rulemaking; Energy, environment, transport, industry, research and science 36. Welcomes the creation of the EU-US Energy Council to provide a new framework for deepening the transatlantic dialogue on strategic energy issues, such as security of supply or policies to move towards low- carbon energy sources, whilst strengthening ongoing scientific cooperation on energy technologies; welcomes the initialling of a new Energy Star EU-US Agreement on the coordination of energy-efficient labelling programmes for office equipment and cooperation on the development of energy technologies; 37. Encourages the TEC to develop cooperation towards a common external energy and raw materials strategy which supports diversification of sources, supply routes and infrastructure and promotes an energy- efficient economy, in order to increase security of energy supply and enhance energy independence; encourages the TEC, further, to help seek convergent sustainability criteria for the energy mix and to step up research and development, including in the area of biofuels; regards an appropriate raw materials and rare earths policy aiming to decrease dependency on such materials as essential; 38. Notes that climate change is a global challenge to which there is no single political and technological solution, but that the combination of existing opportunities and a dramatic increase in efficiency in all areas of the economy and society in developed and developing countries would contribute to resolving the problem of resources and distribution and pave the way for a third industrial revolution; 39. Urges the EU Presidency to look for an ambitious US commitment at the forthcoming Cancun summit and for US cooperation in promoting links between the EU ETS and regional or federal trading schemes in the US; notes, in this respect, the importance of ensuring common standards and benchmarks in all emerging ETS markets so as to avoid unnecessary regulatory hurdles in this emerging market; 40. Calls on the US to allow the full and effective implementation of the first-stage EU-US aviation agreement and of the EU-US aviation safety agreement; reminds both the Commission and the US auth\u00ad orities that failure to conclude a second-stage agreement could lead to the cancellation of the first-stage agreement by some Member States; 41. Urges the TEC to stimulate cooperation in the field of research with a view to exploiting more effectively the potential of the recently extended EU-US Science and Technology Agreement, notably by extending a coordinated approach in areas of mutual strategic interest and by stepping up cooperation in energy research; Intellectual property and consumer protection 42. Emphasises the importance of close transatlantic cooperation on the digital agenda, such as the digital market, internet freedom in the world, net neutrality, the right of privacy, common standards, transparency and the rule of law in relation to ACTA; 43. Considers it essential to develop a joint EU-US action strategy for the enforcement of intellectual property rights which aims to fight the soaring global trade in counterfeit and pirated goods; calls for the creation of a transatlantic task force to combat counterfeiting as a much-needed sign of political deter\u00ad mination to tackle illegal activities which erode the competitiveness of innovative and creative industries, whilst respecting civil liberties, freedom of expression, privacy and due process; EN C 74 E/6 Official Journal of the European Union 13.3.2012 Thursday 11 November 2010 ",
        "Judicial and police cooperation, visas 44. Insists that the EU must negotiate as a single entity on admission to the US visa waiver programme, to ensure that the four Member States \u2013 Bulgaria, Cyprus, Poland and Romania \u2013 outside the visa waiver programme do not conclude bilateral agreements with the US to gain visa waiver status; reiterates that the Commission must continue to raise with the US at political and technical level the issue of the importance attached by the EU to the admission of the four remaining EU Member States to the visa waiver programme as soon as possible; 45. Underlines the spirit of cooperation between the EU and US in the fight against global terrorism and urges the EU and US to continue to work cooperatively in order to further counter the renewed threat from terrorism; reiterates its determination in this field and its firm belief in the need to ensure that security measures do not undermine the protection of civil liberties and fundamental rights and the utmost respect for privacy and data protection; reaffirms that necessity and proportionality are key principles without which the fight against terrorism will never be effective; 46. Welcomes the fact that the EU-US agreement on banking data transfers reflects the willingness of the US to respond positively to the data protection demands made by the European Parliament in the SWIFT report; 47. Calls on the Council to agree swiftly on an ambitious negotiating mandate for a EU-US data protection agreement; urges the Union\u2019s negotiator to move the negotiations forward in order to ensure full protection of fundamental rights; supports the Commission's approach to have such a framework agreement apply to all future and all existing EU or Member State personal data transfer and processing agreements with the US, in the framework of judicial and police cooperation; 48. Calls on both the US and the EU to limit data collection and processing to the absolute minimum genuinely necessary to meet security objectives, so as to minimise threats to freedom and civil liberties, and urges that data transfer demands, as well as other justice and home affairs arrangements, should generally be dealt with in a multilateral US-EU framework, rather than being pursued bilaterally with an individual Member State; 49. Stresses its serious concerns about the so-called Travel Promotion Act, and its discriminatory impact in applying only to travellers under the US visa waiver programme, and about data protection concerns stemming from the fact that fees can only be paid using one of the four major credit cards, whose companies are all based inside the US; calls for the issue of the Electronic System for Travel Authorisation (ESTA) fee to be raised at the next EU-US JHA Ministerial Meeting in December; 50. In view of recent developments on both sides of the Atlantic which pose challenges to harmonious, diverse societies, calls for an open dialogue between our governments and societies on how we can all strive for greater tolerance and respect for diversity in our respective communities, within the context of universal respect for fundamental human rights; * * * 51. Instructs its President to forward this resolution to the Council, the Commission, the governments and parliaments of the Member States, the US Congress, the co-chairs of the Transatlantic Legislators' Dialogue and the co-chairs and secretariat of the Transatlantic Economic Council.
