        "3 2 Introduction The 1992 United Nations World Summit, which was held in Rio de Janeiro, laid the foundations for global policies on sustainable development and the environment. Twenty years later, the UN is organising a high-level conference on sustainable development which will take place in Rio on 20-22 June 2012, and focus on the green economy and the institutional framework for sustainable development. With a significant proportion of the world's population living in poverty, increasing environmental degradation and the over-consumption of natural resources, we are still far from living in a sustainable world. Equally, the current economic and financial crisis is making people realise that the existing economic models are not working properly anymore. We need to make Rio+20 a turning point for global sustainable development \u2013 a decisive step towards eliminating poverty and social injustice whilst preserving natural resources for our future generations. Engaging people for a sustainable Europe lies at the heart of my work programme as EESC President, which is why the preparations for the Rio+20 conference are high up on our political agenda. At European level, following the organisation of two major hearings, the EESC adopted an opinion in September 2011 which set out European civil society\u2019s contribution to the EU's position at Rio+20. At international level, meanwhile, we are discussing Rio-related topics with our counterparts in various parts of the world including Brazil, China, Russia, India, South Africa (BRICS) and the ACP region. In February, the EESC conference Go sustainable, be res- ponsible! European civil society on the road to Rio+20 , offered a unique opportunity to hear the voices of European civil society in the run-up to the UN summit. With nearly 300 participants, high-level speakers, lively debates and plenty of media interest, it fully reflected the importance of sustainable development on the EESC agenda. It also sent out a strong joint message from Europe's civil society organisations to EU and world leaders about the changes that Rio+20 needs to set in motion. We all agree that we want our governments to be more ambitious in terms of objectives, timing, funding, legal commitments and follow-up to ensure that the Rio+20 conference provides an outcome which helps address the global challenges we are facing. We believe that greening the global economy is the way forward for reconciling the needs of a growing world population with our planet's limited natural resources. It provides opportunities for new jobs and economic growth, which can help the global recovery. But going sustainable also means changing the way we behave in Europe, and developing a new respect for those finite resources. Whatever measures our leaders agree on, they must prioritise the social aspects of sustainable development: combating poverty and hunger, offering decent working conditions and promoting the interests of women, migrants and disadvantaged people. The conference message is printed in full in chapter two. Endorsed in an EESC opinion adopted on 22 February 2012, it represents European civil society's formal contribution to the EU's position in the Rio+20 negotiations. We will share and discuss all these ideas with our civil society counterparts in the BRICS countries prior to the conference in order to outline a joint message from global civil society to Rio+20. The lively debates at the plenary and during the workshop sessions produced further conclusions and recommendations, which are summarised in chapter three. At the end of this brochure you will find general information about the EESC and its Sustainable Development Observatory, as well as sources of further information. During both the run-up to Rio+20, and beyond, civil society the world over must continue to push for an outcome that can truly address the challenges that our planet is facing. Without this pressure, there is a real risk that world leaders will lack the courage to take the tough decisions needed for the future. If we all mobilise together, I am certain that we can make our planet Earth viable for future generations.

        "4 5 Conference message During the conference Go sustainable, be responsible! European civil society on the road to Rio+20 organised by the European Economic and Social Committee on 7\u20138 February 2012 in Brussels, we, representatives of European organised civil society, adopted the following message. We: In particular, we urge developed countries to effectively implement their commitment to allocate at least 0.7% of their gross national income to development aid. 4. urge European negotiators to place much greater emphasis on the social dimension of sustainable development than envisaged in the zero draft. Increasing social and wealth inequalities within and between countries requires urgent action, since they are hindering efforts to achieve sustainable development and distributional equity. Moreover, a just transition must guarantee decent work and high-quality jobs for the workforce. We call for the ratification and application of ILO Core Labour Standards and we fully support the ILO Social Protection Floor Initiative. 5. call on political leaders at Rio to commit to a green economy roadmap with clear goals and monitoring mechanisms, ensuring an economically efficient, socially just and environmentally sound transition to sustainable societies. We stress that the transition process must be based on continuous engagement with civil society, including social dialogue. 6. urge European countries and other developed countries to commit in Rio to substantially reducing their consumption of the earth's limited natural resources . We call on European leaders to implement agreed EU targets, and to prepare themselves for more ambitious action. We encourage emerging countries to use natural resources more efficiently. 7. call for effective measures to phase out unsustainable consumption and production patterns , using a broad range of policy instruments, including regulatory measures, fiscal policy tools, green and social public procurement, the phasing out of environmentally harmful subsidies, research on eco- innovation, the internalisation of environmental costs and other market-based incentives, while at the same time promoting sustainable lifestyles and the active involvement of consumers in the transition. We call for the adoption of a 10-year work programme on sustainable consumption and production in Rio. 1. demand that, at the Rio+20 UN Conference, world lea- ders commit to a concrete action plan leading to sustainable development and poverty eradication within the limitations of the planet. Promoting a green economy must be part of an overarching sustainable development strategy, striking a balance between social, ecological and economic aspects while achieving distributional and intergenerational equity. 2. stress that eradicating poverty and secure access to enough food, clean water and sustainable energy for all must be a top priority on the Rio+20 agenda. We point out that the promotion of environmentally sound local agriculture in developing countries plays a crucial role in fighting poverty and improving food security, and is a driving force for the development of economically prosperous rural areas. We stress the need to ensure equal political, economic and social rights for women. 3. call on political leaders to deliver on their commitment to meet the Millennium Development Goals and to adopt additional measures ensuring the necessary effective financing. \u201cIt\u2019s about how to provide for the next generation\u2019s ability to enjoy life in future.\u201d Andris Piebalgs European Development Commissioner \u201c We need to make Rio+20 a turning point. We should not lose momentum, but we should try to stay optimistic.\u201d Staffan Nilsson President of the EESC \u201c Whatever the outcome of Rio+20, it will have a huge impact on future generations. That is why the EU intends to take a leadership role.\u201d Janez Poto\u010dnik European Environment Commissioner ",

We call for an inclusive process starting in Rio linking MDGs with comprehensive SDGs and establishing a strategy and sustainable development indicators with clear mechanisms for accountability. 12. call for the creation of a new Council for Sustainable Development , replacing the Commission for Sustainable Development, and for the creation of a new UN agency for the environment based on UNEP. Both of these bodies should provide for effective involvement of civil society, as represented by the Major Groups. 13. welcome the proposal to establish an ombudsman for fu- ture generations . 14. urge political leaders to agree at the Rio+20 conference on additional measures to improve effective civil society involve- ment and achieve empowerment at global, national and local level in the transition to sustainable societies. We call for the establishment of legal and institutional frameworks ensuring public access to information, dialogue, democratic participation and scrutiny. We advocate promoting multi-stakeholder fora such as Economic and Social Committees and National Sustainability Councils as models to stimulate civil society debate. We call for more awareness-raising campaigns and education programmes on sustainable development. 15. encourage civil society all over the world to continue pushing for a conference outcome capable of meeting the challenges we are facing.

We call on EU negotiators to work for a more ambitious document as regards targets, timing, financing, legal commitment and follow-up, and stress the need to review and revitalise the overarching EU Sustainable Development Strategy following the Rio+20 conference. 10. advocate a new global deal in Rio to ensure the necessary investments in the greening of the economy . 11. acknowledge the key role and the responsibility of the pri- vate sector in achieving a transition to sustainable development and stress that greening the economy is an opportunity for business. We encourage business and industry to take that opportunity, and call on political leaders to draw up clear, stable and predictable green economy policy frameworks to give business the confidence, the regulatory framework and the incentives for the investments needed. \u201c The transition to a model of socially and environmentally sustainable development will enhance the dynamism of economies in areas such as health, education, sanitation and housing.

In my view, the report of the UN Secretary-General's High- level Panel on Global Sustainability, and in particular its 56 recommendations, is a highly valuable source of inspiration for policies on sustainable development and should be taken into account by the negotiating parties. It became very clear from the debates that the social dimension of sustainable development needs much more attention than envisaged in the zero draft. The UN (ILO) Social Protection Floor Initiative, establishing a set of social rights, services and facilities which everyone should enjoy, should be a basis for defining current economic policies and put their people and the planet at the centre of their policy-making. Moreover, the concept of sustainable development, as established by the UN summits in Rio in 1992 and in Johannesburg in 2002, represents more than just the green economy; and it is that concept that needs to be strengthened at Rio+20.

The general debates, and in particular the four workshops, provided the opportunity for a more in-depth discussion and led to more detailed policy recommendations which are outlined below. 1.

Increasing social and wealth inequalities within and between countries are hindering progress towards sustainable development and distributional equity. On the environmental side, current systems encourage over-consumption of natural resources, allow pollution of the environment, and fail to prevent climate change. Therefore, the conference sent out an urgent call to world leaders to reverse \u201c People are realising that existing models and patterns do not work as they should.

European civil society on the road to Rio+20 has been one of the Observatory\u2019s key activities, bringing together civil society organisations from around Europe to put forward their views on what they believe should come out of Rio+20. The SDO has also been active in formulating EESC policy, first of all through three opinions, adopted in September 2011, on civil society\u2019s contribution to Rio+20, resource efficient Europe, and the EU low-carbon economy roadmap 2050. The conference message itself was set out in an EESC opinion adopted on 22 February 2012, which contributed to preparing the EU position in the Rio+20 negotiations. Building on this, the EESC has been working on further Rio-related opinions, to be adopted prior to the UN conference, on the resource efficiency roadmap 2050, the promotion of sustainable consumption and production patterns in the EU, and the EU Sustainable Strategy Progress Report 2011. Lastly, the SDO contributes to dialogue with organised civil society in other parts of the world, in the run-up to and during Rio+20. In the European inter-institutional set-up, the EESC helps to strengthen the democratic legitimacy and effectiveness of the EU by enabling civil society organisations in the Member States to express their views at European level. The EESC is strongly committed to European integration, and fulfils three key missions: \u2022 helping the European Parliament, Council and Commission to ensure that European policies and legislation tie in better with economic, social and civic circumstances on the ground, by making use of EESC members' experience and representativeness, and through dialogue and efforts to secure a consensus in the general interest; \u2022 developing a more participatory EU which is more in touch with popular opinion, by acting as an institutional forum representing, informing, expressing the views of and securing dialogue with organised civil society; \u2022 promoting the values on which European integration is founded, and advancing \u2013 in Europe and across the world \u2013 the cause of democracy and participatory democracy, as well as the role of civil society organisations. Set up by the EESC in 2006 in response to the EU Sustainable Development Strategy, the Sustainable Development Observatory (SDO) works within the Committee to tackle and promote sustainable development policies across all sectors. It is composed of 33 members drawn from a wide range of interests and representing all Committee sections. The European Economic and Social Committee (EESC) is a European Union consultative body composed of 344 members from 27 Member States, representing a wide range of economic and social interest groups. The European Parliament, the Council of the EU and the European Commission hold mandatory consultations with the EESC on a large number of European policy areas. In other areas, these three institutions consult the EESC whenever they consider it useful. However, the Committee also issues opinions on its own initiative on topics of political, social and economic interest. ",
        "20 21 The European Economic and Social Committee and its Sustainable Development Observatory In its institutional capacity as mediator between civil society and the EU institutions, the SDO: \u2022 analyses sustainable development issues and prepares reports and opinions on EU draft legislation and action programmes; \u2022 stimulates debate on sustainable development; \u2022 shares best practice and fosters exchanges on sustainable development.
