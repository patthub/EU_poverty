A gradual recovery in the second half of 1999, driven by the acceleration of growth in the European Union, mitigated the negative effects of the Russian crisis and of the Kosovo conflict that affected many countries in the second half of 1998 and the first half of 1999. The economic developments in Turkey were overshadowed by the earthquake of August 1999. As a result of the continuation of the recovery, our outlook for 2000 and 2001 is optimistic. The influence of the improved ex ternal environment will be further strengthened by the positive effects of domestic adjust ment programmes. The Spring 2000 forecast has been finalised in mid-March 2000. As a result, first official estimates for the fourth quarter of 1999 were not available yet for all countries. In addi tion, for some countries, information on the first months of 2000 that came available after the conclusion of the forecast has altered expectations. While this overview text only takes into account the information that was available when we closed the forecast, the country notes that follow also discuss more recent developments and how these might change the outlook for 2000. For most countries, economic growth has not been revised significantly compared to the previous forecasting exercise. In 1999, only Estonia and, more drastically, Lithuania and Turkey have recorded lower than expected GDP growth. In Lithuania, the expansionary policies undertaken after the Russian crisis in 1998 have proved to be unsustainable, ne cessitating a sharp correction in 1999. In Turkey, the effects of the earthquake on the economy seem to have been worse than expected. Two other countries, Romania and the Czech Republic, also recorded negative growth, although the decline was smaller than in 1998. This prolonged recession is mainly due to the slow implementation of economic reforms, especially in Romania. Slovakia, which is going through a domestic adjustment ",

For the CECC-10, we expect a rapid recovery of investment growth and a pick up in pri\u00ad vate consumption growth in 2001, pushing up the domestic contribution to growth. The contribution of net exports should remain about the same, as a result of the synchron\u00ad ous acceleration of export and import growth. In Turkey, the growth acceleration is mainly explained by the recon\u00ad struction effort after the earthquake and the positive econ\u00ad omic effects of the current economic stabilisation pro\u00ad gramme. As a result, in 2001, GDP growth is expected to accelerate to around AVi% on average in the CECC-10 and to around 5% in Turkey. and structural reform programme, was able to maintain a positive growth rate thanks to a relatively strong export per\u00ad formance. In sharp contrast, Hungary, Poland and Slovenia remained relatively unscathed from the regional problems because of sustained domestic demand and the more ad\u00ad vanced state of economic reforms. On aggregate, economic growth in the ten central European candidate countries (CECC-10) in 1999 was only some\u00ad what lower {Vi percentage point) than in 1998. This is the combined outcome of the halving of the contribution to growth of domestic demand and the elimination of the negative contribution of net exports. The weakening of do\u00ad mestic demand is almost fully explained by the stagnation in investment, while private consumption growth remained stable. The sharp slowdown of investment growth seems to be initiated mainly by the weak external demand. On the ex\u00ad ternal side, both export and import growth were very low. However, because of the high import component of invest\u00ad ment, import growth declined more than export growth. The weak external demand, which was at the source of the poor economic performance in 1999, also reduced import growth, because of the high import content of most exports in the CECCs. The reduction of domestic demand, mainly of investment, also had a depressing effect on imports. As a result, the average trade balance deficit improved slightly. The current account deficit, on the other hand, deteriorated somewhat, mainly as a result of the sharp deterioration of the current account balance in Poland. Spectacular reduc\u00ad tions of external deficits were recorded in Estonia, Roma\u00ad nia and Slovakia as a result of domestic adjustment pro\u00ad grammes. In 2000 and 2001, the improving external environment should support exports strongly, while im- portgrowth will accelerate somewhat less, leading to some further improvement in external deficits. While the average inflation rate for the CECC-10 declined further to 10.7% in 1999, the end-of-year rate increased from 11.0% in 1998 to 13.4% in 1999. This is explained by the jump in energy prices in the second half of 1999. Al\u00ad though oil prices eased recently and end-of-year inflation is consequently expected to decline to 8.0%, average en\u00ad ergy prices in 2000 should still be significantly higher than TABLE 2: Current account balance (%of GDP) Bulgaria Czech Republic Estonia Hungary Latvia Lithuania Poland Romania Slovakia Slovenia CECC-10 Turkey Total Note: e = estimate; converted at market ' = forecast exchange 1998 -1.6 -1.9 -9.2 -AS -11.1 -12.7 -4.7 -7.2 -10.1 0.0 ^i.9 0.5 -3.0 aggregate rates. 1999 e -5.5 -1.5 -5.7 -AA -10.4 -12.1 -7.6 -3.2 -5.7 -2.9 -5.6 -0.3 -3.7 2()00 r ^t.l -1.7 -6.1 -1.5 -9.6 -10.9 -6.8 -4\u039b -4.9 -3.1 -5.3 -1.3 -3.9 across countries weighted using 2001 f -3;1 -1.0 -6.1 -AA -9.1 -9.0 -6.2 ^1.9 -3.8 -3.1 -4.9 -0.4 -3.3 GDP TABLE 3: Bulgaria Inflation (CPI-yearly average) Czech Republic Estonia Hungary Latvia Lithuania Poland Romania Slovakia Slovenia CECC-10 Turkey Total Note: e = estimate; converted at market 1997 1084.7 8.4 11.2 18.3 8.3 8.8 15.1 154.8 6.2 8.4 61.1 85.7 69.6 = forecast aggregate exchange rates. 1998 22.3 10.7 8.2 14.3 4.7 5.1 11.8 59.1 6.7 7.9 16.3 84.6 40.0 1999 e 0.4 2.1 3.3 10.1 2.4 .0.8 7.3 45.8 10.6 6.1 10.7 64.9 29.7 2000 f 7.9 3.0 3.5 8.0 3.5 1.8 9.2 39.0 13.2 5.0 10.4 50.0 24.7 across countries weighted using 2001 f 4.8 3.3 2.4 5.8 3.5 2.5 5.3 25.0 7.5 4.5 6.6 20.0 11.5 GDP ",

Without new unexpected developments in energy prices, inflation is expected to decline further in 2001. Des\u00ad pite the common influence of energy prices, inflation de\u00ad velopments in the different countries are far from homo\u00ad geneous. The strength of domestic demand, adjustments of administered prices and changes in indirect taxes explain most of the differences. In Turkey, we expect that the stabi\u00ad lisation programme will be able to change inflation ex\u00ad pectations and bring down inflation, although it might take somewhat more time than envisaged. Bulgaria Bulgaria's strong performance of the past two years is ex\u00ad pected to continue into 2000 and 2001 with forecasted real GDP growth of 4.5% and 4.9%. The Commission expects industrial production to pick up and to be driven by strong exports. In 2000 the current account deficit should be re\u00ad dressed in the direction of 4% of GDP, which would be a considerable reduction compared to 1999 when the nega\u00ad tive balance on the trade in goods was only partly offset by services. Foreign direct investment can be expected to rise as a result of privatisation but additional efforts are needed to attract a future stream of green\u00adfield investments. The government's budget is expected to show a higher deficit than in 1999 but remains sufficiently close to balance. Prices jumped up in January and inflation is forecasted to be around 8% for the years as a whole. Due to the restruc\u00ad turing of enterprises and public utilities, unemployment is increasing. In March 2000 the 'Bulgaria 200\u0393 programme was up\u00ad dated. The aim is to continue the reform but the update of the programme also announces measures to create 250.000 new jobs and a freeze of certain energy prices. Structural reform progresses within the framework and timetable set out by the medium term economic programme agreed with IMF. Negotiations related to the sale to foreign investors of a limited number of major state owned enterprises has prog\u00ad ressed slower than previously announced. An agreement with Romania on constructing a second bridge over the Da\u00ad nube river is an important sign of improved regional co\u00ad operation and will in the medium term contribute to more sustained growth in the region. The economic recovery in second half of 1999 was prompted by the end of the Kosovo conflict, and was main\u00ad ly driven by higher private consumption and vigorous in\u00ad vestment activity. GDP growth reached 2.5% in 1999. The strong increase in the level of activity is expected to con\u00ad tinue into 2000 and 2001, mainly in relation to the econ\u00ad omic upswing in the EU. In the Commission's forecast real GDP growth increases to 4.5% in 2000, and 4.9% in 2001. Industrial production fell by 5% in 1999 as a consequence of on\u00adgoing restructuring. Sectors such as vehicles and chemicals were particularly hard hit. The Commission forecasts that industrial production will pick up in 2000 and 2001, driven by an increase in domestic demand and a strong export performance. These developments will affect the current account, which according to preliminary figures, deteriorated to a deficit of 5.2% of GDP in 1999. While imports rose due to strong do\u00ad mestic demand for consumer goods and capital equipment, exports of goods fell significantly. The negative balance on goods (10% of GDP) was only partly offset by the strong performance on services, including a positive development in the tourism sector. For 2000 the Commission expects the deficit to end up slightly above 4% of GDP. Financial inflows in the form of capital transfers and direct investments were able to finance the current account deficit and the level of foreign debts has continued to decrease. Thanks to the stabilising effect of the currency board the un\u00ad derlying downward trend of inflation initiated in 1998 re\u00ad mained. However, increases in oil prices and tariff in\u00ad creases for utilities produced some upward pressure on the CPI in the early winter and increased the 1999 year\u00adend inflation figures to 6.5 %. A new increase of 3.1% com\u00ad pared to the month before took place in January 2000. The Commission forecasts 7.9% inflation in 2000, on average over the year. Whether this can be achieved will partly de\u00ad pend on the development of the dollar exchange rate and the oil price. Increasing the level of FDI is a priority for the Government in the light of the low levels that Bulgaria has managed to attract since the transition began. The current macroeco\u00ad nomic stability is a positive factor in attracting investors ",

Feb. Feb. (') Estimated Source: National sources, OECD external Debt Statistics, IMF Government Finance Statistics, EBRD, EU-Commission and the figures for 1999 show a very significant increase compared to 1998. However, since investment in equity is about 10% lower than in 1998, the rise in FDI is mainly due to an increase in the liabilities of Bulgarian companies to their foreign owners ('Other capital'). Privatisation pro ceeds are also slightly up. At the same time foreign in vestors in net terms repatriated profits worth $70 million. The reported numbers are heavily affected by one single transaction. For instance, the postponed sale of the telecom operator BTC reduced the 1999 outcome below earlier ex pectations. Additional efforts are needed to motivate in vestors to launch more green-field projects. Otherwise the level of FDI might contract once the best pieces of the Bul garian enterprises have been sold off. In March 2000 the Government had privatised 71 % of the fixed assets eligible for privatisation. In 2000, privatisation in the financial sector is expected to involve Bulbank and Biochim. The telecommunication company (BTC) and Bulgartabac Holding Group and 6 other major companies are up for cash privatisation. The voucher privatisation pro gramme is being continued and has been extended to in clude also minority stakes in privatised enterprises. A me dium term strategy for the privatisation of the State Savings Bank was approved by the SSB board, but privatisation plans are not yet finalised. Official unemployment increased throughout 1999 as a re sult of large-scale redundancies following the restructuring or liquidation of public sector enterprises. A substantial number of workers remains employed in industries and public utilities with low or negative profitability and hence an uncertain future. Unemployment rates have soared dur ing the winter months. In February 2000, 693 531 unem ployed were registered with the labour office, which corre sponds with 18.1% of the labour force. This is an increase of 37.3% compared with February 1999. Measures have been taken to strengthen financial discipline in the remaining state-owned enterprises. To obtain sub sidies during a transition period enterprises had to present financial recovery plans on how to eliminate losses and en able subsidy-free operation from 2002. In addition, a pro cedure for the monitoring of 154 state owned enterprises has been put in place. It aims at preventing the build-up of new arrears between enterprises, or on tax and social secur ity contributions, which could destabilise the financial and fiscal situation.

Czech Republic After a modest decline in 1999, economic dynamics are im proving at the beginning of this year. For the whole year of 2000, the Commission's forecast predicts an acceleration of GDP growth to about 1 3 A%. Economic growth is seen to remain clearly below potential, reflecting the low domestic demand and relatively high imports, connected to restruc turing. In 2001, stronger domestic demand, in particular higher investment, will support GDP growth of about 3%. The liberalisation of administrated prices will lead to a one-off rise in the consumer price level, while the cost push from the wage side will remain moderate. Restructuring ",
        "and relatively low growth will lead to an increase in unem ployment this year, while stronger economic dynamics next year should help to improve the situation in the labour market. The public sector deficit might rise to 3V2% of GDP this year, largely due to one-time expenditures related to the cleaning-up of the banking sector. The current account deficit will remain on a low level, benefiting from stronger growth in the EU. Overall the Czech economy contracted by 0.2% year-on- year in 1999, while the modest growth in the second and third quarter carried through in the fourth quarter. This re covery of the economy was mainly driven by external de mand, reflecting the revival of economic activity in the EU. The growth of imports was considerably below that of ex ports. The second biggest source of economic recovery was private consumption, although its growth in real terms was somewhat less than real wage growth. The shrinkage of fixed capital formation (-5.5% year-on-year in 1999) re- emphasised the urgency of structural reform and the need for a general improvement in the business climate of the Czech Republic. In the first quarter of 2000 economic growth accelerated to 4.8% year-on-year, mainly driven by manufacturing. Ex ports and imports registered strong year-on-year growth. According to preliminary data, the value of exports rose by 31% while imports grew by 29.5%. The high increase in machinery and transport equipment (about 47% year-on- year) contributed positively to exports, increasing the share of this category in total exports. On the import side, a large part of the increase was due to higher oil prices carrying through into the value of imported crude materials and chemicals. During 1999, the unemployment rate rose steadily, al though there has been a slowdown towards the end of the year. In the first quarter of 2000, unemployment stood at 9.5%, up 1.1% from the same period of last year. April reg istered an unexpected drop of 0.5% to 9.0%. This decline is not only due to seasonal effects but also to the impacts of foreign capital inflows resulting in job creation. Job centres in the Czech Republic registered a total of 471,200 job- seekers by the end of April 2000. Unemployment rates va ried largely from region to region. Prague's three districts suffered comparatively little from unemployment, with rates between 2.9% to 3.6%, whereas 17 districts outside Prague were affected by rates above 12%. The highest rates were found in the districts of Most (20.7%), Karvina (18.4%) and Chomutov (16.9%). On top of that, the rate of hidden unemployment is supposed to be high. Trade unions estimate that there are about 140,000 employees who are either not paid at all or not in time, implying an unemploy ment rate of about 12% overall. The current account deficit improved in 1999, declining to $1,058.2 million compared to $1,335.7 million in the previ ous year. This was mainly due to a 19.4% decline in the trade deficit. The trade balance has been affected positively by the real depreciation of the exchange rate, but also by a growing share of export products with higher value added. Foreign direct investment showed a dynamic performance. In 1999, FDI jumped to $4.9 billion, against $2.5 billion in 1998.

In 1999 inflation decelerated substantially. The inflation target of the Czech National Bank, which had been set at 4.5+/-0.5%, was undershot considerably. Average infla tion amounted to 2.1% compared to 10.7% in 1998. The sharp downfall of average inflation was due to tight monet ary policy and low overall economic activity in the first nine months of 1999. At the end of the year, rising import prices, especially for mineral fuels, and the slight recovery in economic activity induced an increase in the inflation rate to 2.5% year-on-year. This trend tailed up in the first three months of 2000, with inflation rates of 3.4% in Jan uary, 3.7% in February and 3.8% in March. Net inflation, excluding administrative price changes, stood at 1.6%, 1.9% and 2.1%, respectively. This shows that the rise of inflation is mostly the result of increases in government- controlled prices, such as electricity, gas, water supplies, transport and telecom services. Monetary policy eased during 1999. Last fall, the Czech National Bank cut its key interest rates down to their current levels: Lombard 7.5%, discount 5.0% and two-weeks repo rate 5.25%. However, these cuts did not lead to greater bank activity in terms of loans offered to enterprises and house holds. The Czech crown has been comparatively stable against the euro, mainly due to the favourable balance of payments. In March, the Czech National Bank intervened in the foreign exchange market in order to prevent the Czech crown from appreciating and to keep stimulating Czech exports. In 2000 capital inflows are estimated to amount to CZK 255 billion. About CZK 190 billion are to be obtained as a result of the privatisation of state assets. In order to stem the Czech currency's appreciation, the Gov ernment has decided to establish a special account to collect privatisation revenues from foreign investors by the Czech National Bank. The approved state budget for 2000 projects a deficit of CZK 35.2 billion or about 2% of projected GDP. According to an agreement between the minority government and the ",

It aims to present a balanced state budget in 2003. Since the beginning of the year, fiscal policy has remained tight. In the first quarter the state budget recorded a surplus of CZK 8.34 billion. Revenues came to 23% of the annual target whereas expenditures re ached only 20%. At the beginning of the year, the deficit of the general government budget was projected to be about CZK 67 billion or 3.5% of GDP. Recently, the government has revised its projection to 6.5% of projected GDP. The government has explained the higher deficit with the need to cover Konsolidacni Banka's losses of 1998 and 1999. The Czech government is committed to privatisation, and plans to sell its shares of strategic enterprises within the next two years. Completing bank privatisation is at the top of the list, followed by the sale of the telecommunication companies Cesky Telecom and Ceske Radiokomunikace. Three of the four major state banks have already been sold. Privatisation of the largest bank, Komercni Banka (KB), is scheduled to be completed by the end of 2000. State finan cial resources have to be committed both to guarantee bad debts and for re-capitalisation. The main problem is the high burden of classified credits, as a result of financing en terprise privatisation through debt during the first phase of transformation. In April 2000, the Parliament passed the amendment to the bankruptcy and composition law. The amended law will take effect from 1 May 2000 and aims to speed up bank ruptcy proceedings by making them more efficient. It is also expected to improve payment discipline in general. Al though the amended bankruptcy and composition law is a step in the right direction, the importance of adequately im plementing and executing the law must be emphasised. Estonia / 999 was a year of recession in Estonia. Real GDP declined by 1.1%, with much of the fall concentrated in the first half of the year. The two main reasons of this sharp slowdown were the impact of the Russian crisis and much tightened credit conditions and lower domestic confidence, which dampened internal demand. Indeed, investment and im ports fell sharply. However, the decline of exports was less pronounced; in particular, exports to the EU continued to grow at solid rates, while exports of services were buoyant. These two trends have been linked to the good economic situation in the EU, and in Estonia's Scandinavian neigh bours in particular, which has sustained exports growth and tourism receipts. As a result, the current account con tinued to fall from the high level reached in 1997. The econ omy is emerging stronger from the recession. Many ineffic ient companies have closed or have gone through restructuring. Trade relations with the EU and other devel oped markets have been reinforced. The outlook for 2000-2001 is a continuation of the current broad-based re covery, based on a simultaneous pick-up in domestic de mand and exports. As a result, there are good prospects for a further improvement in macroeconomic stability, which should provide a supportive environment for continuing the necessary structural reforms. In the final quarter of last year and the first months of 2000, many signs of a recovery appeared, including higher retail sales and exports. The Commission's Spring forecast envis ages that real GDP growth resumes in 2000, to reach 4% and that it will accelerate to 5.5% in the following year. After a 4.1% fall in 1999, domestic demand is expected to increase again, mainly as a result of higher private con sumption and investment. The fall in interest rates, which have reached historically low levels, a new-found willing ness of banks to extend consumption credits, and higher confidence in general are the main factors explaining the re vival of domestic demand. In addition, exports growth has increased, sustaining economic activity. The pick up in ac tivity in 2000-2001 is forecast to increase demand for im ports and the trade deficit. The full cycle of growth, recession and recovery has dem onstrated clearly the functioning of the adjustment mechan ism of the Currency Board Arrangement.

This translated into an increase in domestic interest rates. Combined with more difficult refinancing conditions for local banks on international markets, this led to a slow down of credit growth, which in August 1999 was at the same level as the year before. In turn, these factors affected the financial position of enterprises and domestic demand, in particular fixed investment and imports. The fall in im ports led to a dramatic improvement of the current account deficit, which even posted a surplus in the third quarter of 1999. In the context of a well functioning market economy, lower demand and higher interest rates led to more bank ruptcies and faster restructuring, including through mergers and acquisitions. In particular, the restructuring of the financial system advanced much. As a result, and despite a modest increase in banks' bad assets, international credibility was restored relatively rapidly. Higher confidence in the local financial system, and by implication, in the local economy, has translated into the positive evolution of a number of indicators, including much lower spreads on local currency deposits, longer maturities of banks' liabilities, and strongly positive open net foreign exchange position of domestic banks. In this context, net capital inflows and official foreign exchange reserves grew again, interest rates went down and credit growth resumed. The improvement in credit conditions has been reflected in historically low interest rates and an accel eration of credit growth. Despite the remarkable reduction in external imbalances and the improvement in the overall economic situation, there are a number of important challenges that must be ad dressed in the coming months. Firstly, the control of domestic demand should remain a key concern of the authorities' macroeconomic policy, es pecially as the currency board arrangement tends to be pro- cyclical. As shown by the fast increase of imports in the last months of 1999 and in early 2000, there is still a lot of pent up demand from consumers. In fact, domestic demand might be rebounding faster than expected, especially if in vestment growth picks up from its current level. Conserva tive fiscal policy will be important. In that respect, the auth orities are committed to reduce the deficit of the consolidated general government from 4.7% of GDP last year to little more than 1% in 2000. However, this is insuffi cient to guarantee macroeconomic and external stability. It will be important to ensure that real wage growth is not out of line with productivity developments and that credit ex pansion does not reach the very high level of 1996-1997. The risk is a rapid increase of the current account deficit, which would raise concerns about its sound financing. In- this context, the completion of the pension reform is an im portant element that will raise the national savings rate on a medium term basis.

        "Secondly, diversification and expansion of the export base, in terms of the geographic coverage and the traded commo dities, remains a key challenge to reduce the vulnerability of the economy to external shocks, while supporting growth and employment. External price competitiveness is currently not a serious concern. Indeed, the evolution of the real effective exchange rate has been favourable in recent months, thanks partly to the depreciation of the local currency against the US dollar and the modest level of infla tion. Exports to the EU have increased by almost 8% in 1999. However, the overall level of exports has gone down in 1999, largely because of the severe contraction of the Eastern markets. As demand from these markets recovers, it is important that industries and enterprises that were rely ing on them before the onset of the crisis do not become ov erly dependent on what are likely to remain volatile markets. Thirdly, tackling the unemployment problem and the lack of skilled labour must remain a key economic policy objec tive. The 1998-1999 economic slowdown had a significant impact on unemployment, which increased to 12% in the first quarter of 1999, before slightly falling back to 11.7% in the second quarter. The Estonian labour market has proved remarkably flexible during the recent slowdown, with nominal wages falling in some of the worst affected sectors. However, other features of the labour market are a falling activity rate, the concentration of unemployment in some regions (Northeast, Southeast Estonia and the Islands) and the high level of unemployment among young people and low skilled workers. It is also difficult to find enough well qualified staff in large cities. The under-mobilisation of human resources, in a situation in which the population is diminishing, and in which the authorities are keen to devel op skill-intensive and high value added activities, points to the need for continuing efforts and ambitious strategies in the field of education, training and skills development. Hungary Economic activity accelerated during the first quarter of 2000, with industrial activity over the first two months of the year surging by 21%. Following a decisive policy re sponse by the central bank, short-term capital inflows have subsided and pressure on the exchange rate has been re duced. Reflecting the rise in economic activity, fiscal per formance has been particularly strong during the first quarter of 2000, and the government should easily achieve their fiscal target. Annual real GDP growth in the next two years is expected to be at least 4.5% and probably higher. Inflation is likely to fall, but not as fast as indicated by the government's targets. The macroeconomic environment has improved markedly over the 12 months up to March 2000. Boosted by the strong recovery in EU markets, growth accelerated throughout the year, and it is now expected to be around 4.5% for the year as a whole. Export performance during the first quarter has been remarkable, with volumes increas ing by over 17%. Recovery was particularly strong in the manufacturing sector, which is also reflected in the strong industrial output data recorded in the first two months of the year. There are strong indications that the upturn in activity will be extended for the rest of the year. Housing permits, which are a leading indicator of housing investment, increased by 32% in the first months of the year. The government also announced an ambitious motorway construction pro gramme, which should lead to a strong increase in public investment next year. Moreover, household credit has picked up, although from a rather low level. The current account narrowed significantly over recent months. Preliminary data for 1999 suggest that the deficit will be just over $2 billion, or about 4.3% of GDP, more than 0.5% of GDP lower than in 1998. Data for the first quarter of 2000 confirmed the improving external position, with the deficit coming in at $0.4 billion compared to $0.5 billion for the same period last year. Initially, the better than expected trade performance was due to a marked recovery in exports as a result of the upturn in activity in the EU in the second half of the year and the pronounced deceleration in investment-related imports, particularly within the public sector. In addition, the current account also benefited from lower than expected profit repatriation by foreign investors in Hungary. However, during the first months, the current account consolidation has relied less upon the slowdown in investment expenditure, and more upon the rapid acceler ation in exports. Inflation declined marginally during the first four months of 2000. In April, year-on-year inflation was 9.2%. How ever, it is unlikely that the government will achieve its 6-7% inflation objective for 2000. Average inflation is more likely to be within the 7 to 9% range. However, pros pects for 2001 are somewhat better, particularly if the rise in wages and oil prices is moderate. Unemployment has continued to fall. Household survey data suggests that in March 2000 6.7% of the workforce were without work, compared to 7.4% during the same period last year. While there are significant regional dispa rities, many firms are now reporting significant skill short GRAPH 5: HUNGARY: Unemployment rate 01 04 07 10 01 04 07 10 01 04 07 10 01 04 07 10 01 04 07 10 01 04 07 10 0104 1994 I 1995 I 1996 I 1997 I 1998 I 1999 I 2000 Source: National Bank nf Hungary (monthly report).

However, prelimi nary signs for the first quarter of 2000 are positive. Gross average earnings point to a slight improvement in wage pressure, with growth during the first two months of this year coming in at 13.3% compared to 16.5% last year. Meanwhile, a strike in the state railway company was settled without significant concessions above the public sector wage guidelines. During the early months of the year, monetary policy has been complicated by the recent surge in capital inflows. The central bank responded by rapidly cutting interest rates, introducing a zero coupon short term bond to mop up liquidity, moral suasion upon the banks, and strong public announcements emphasising the bank's commitment to the current exchange rate regime. For the short term, the cen tral bank's efforts have borne fruit and upward pressure on the exchange rate from speculative inflows appears to have subsided. In line with the central bank's announced strategy to grad ually move towards a more fixed exchange rate, the month ly devaluation rate was further reduced to below 0.4% in April, while the inflation target implies that a further reduc tion in the rate of crawl can be expected later in the year. Moreover, on lanuary 1 st , the forint's crawling peg mech anism, moved from a weighted basket of the euro and the US dollar, to one comprising solely of the euro. The real exchange rate has appreciated slightly in recent months, but there are no signs that the appreciation has adversely af fected export competitiveness. The central bank have announced a change to the reserve requirements as part of their strategy to gradually reduce the level, and towards the principle of uniform treatment of liabilities. As of July 1, 2000 the reserve requirement will be lowered by 1% to 11%, while the base will be expanded to include foreign liabilities with a maturity of less than one year. The government should easily achieve their 3.5% fiscal target for this year. Moreover the strong economic growth, and higher than expected inflation may push the final defi cit figure significantly below this level. The central govern ment deficit for the first four months of 2000 was 115 bil lion forint, representing 29% of the annual budget target. This improvement is largely due to a better than expected performance on the revenue side, with the profits tax, VAT and personal income tax all up significantly compared to the first quarter last year. Latvia Latvia is slowly recovering from a period of almost zero growth. The positive results of the last two quarters of 1999 are expected to continue into this year, with real GDP growth increasing to 2.5% in 2000 and nearly 4% in 2001. Inflation also shows an upward tendency but is expected to remain in the range of 3 to 4% in the next two years. More worrying is the renewed widening of the trade deficit. As indicated in the Commission's forecast, exports need to grow considerably faster than imports to curb this develop ment. In 1999, GDP increased by 0.1% year-on-year. The first half of the year was still negatively affected by the Russian crisis, but the positive results of the last two quarters (0.2% and 2.8%, year-on-year) show that the Latvian economy is recovering. Overall, industrial production output fell by 8.8% year-on-year in 1999, but towards the end of the year production recovered to the levels of 1998. This positive trend could be maintained in the first quarter of 2000: in dustrial production output increased by 3.8% compared to the corresponding period of the previous year. The official unemployment rate stood at 9% at the end of April 2000. Unemployment shows large regional differ ences. The eastern parts of Latvia are still particularly af fected by the lack of labour demand, with unemployment ",

Riga registered the lowest unem ployment rate with 4.5%, followed by the Ogre region with 5.9% and Saldus with 6.8% (all end of April 2000). The new government has announced it intends to reduce unem ployment to 8% over the course of the year. Throughout 1999 inflation in Latvia was low at an average 2.4% compared to 1998, but from the beginning of 2000 inflation has been increasing again. In the first quarter it rose by 3.2% compared to the corresponding period of 1999. April 2000 even showed an increase of 3.7% year- on-year (2.7% for goods and 7.2% for services). The rise of inflation is basically due to higher energy and transport prices and an increase in state-controlled tariffs and regu lated prices. After producer prices dropped by 4% in 1999, they have shown a slight upward tendency growing by 0.6% year-on-year in the first quarter of 2000. In 1999 foreign trade at current prices decreased compared to 1998. Imports declined by 8.4%, faster than exports which decreased by 5% year-on-year. This resulted in a trade deficit of 715.6 million lats - 12.5% lower than in 1998. In the first two months of 2000, Latvia's foreign trade deficit at current prices began to increase again compared to the corresponding period of the previous year. Exports grew by 13.5%. Imports rose by 13.9% and exceeded ex ports by 47.2% in value. Latvia's current account recorded a deficit of 10.2% of GDP in 1999, compared to 10.6% in the previous year. As export growth is set to improve and imports are expected to grow more slowly, the current account deficit should de cline further in 2000. Recent monetary policy reflects the modest recovery of the economic situation in Latvia. In the course of the first quarter of 2000, broad money continued to grow. In March, loans granted to enterprises and private households in creased by 4.8%. Demand in government securities auc tions continued to be strong. The stock of outstanding gov ernment securities rose by 9.5% year-on-year. The IMF approved a 16-month stand-by arrangement for Latvia in December 1999. Against this background, the Latvian government had agreed on a reform agenda which includes some hard-hitting measures in the public sector. The programme focuses on reducing the consolidated budget deficit from 3.8 % of GDP in 1999 to about 2% in 2000. As the social insurance sector accounts for nearly one third of the consolidated general government budget, the new government has announced that it will also take measures to curb the deficits in the social insurance budget. Prime Minister Andris Skele resigned on 12 April 2000 after nine months in office. The mains reasons for his resig nation were personality and policy clashes within his coali tion cabinet, in particular on privatisation. On 5 May 2000, the Latvian parliament (Saeima) approved the new government headed by Prime Minister Andris Ber- zins. The government is a coalition of four parties (People's Party/National Party, Latvian Way, For Fatherland and Freedom/National Independence Movement, and the New TABLE 8: LATVIA - Main economic Real GDP growth rate Inflation rate annual average December-on-December Unemployment rate, end year ILO definition General government budget balance Current account balance Foreign debt debt/export ratio' \" gross foreign debt Foreign direct investment net inflow EBRD data balance of payments data trends % % % % % of GDP % of GDP million EURO % billion EURO % of GDP million EURO 1996 3.3 17.7 13.1 18.3 -1.7 -5.5 -0.3 28 0.6 7.4 299 1997 8.6 8.4 7 14.4 0.1 -6.1 -0.3 27 0.7 9.2 395 1998 3.6 4.7 2.8 13.8 -0.8 -11.7 -0.7 35 0.9 4.7 185 1999 0.1 2.4 3.2 13.9 -3.8 -10.2 3.8<D 2000 3.7 9.0 latest Apr-on-Apr Apr Source: National sources.

        "11- Party). The first three parties also formed the previous coalition government. The inauguration of the new government does not imply any major changes in the area of economic policies. Ac cording to the declaration, the most important objectives are: to continue fiscal consolidation; to complete the priva tisation of large-scale companies within the coming year; to reduce the unemployment rate to 8% in the course of the year; to abolish the possibility of early retirement and to continue gradually increasing the retirement age, at the same time abolishing all restrictions on working pensioners so that they may receive pensions in addition to their pay. Progress in privatising the few remaining large-scale state- owned companies continues to be slow. The Latvian Priva tisation Agency (LPA) sold another 26.85% of the gas util ity Latvijas Gaze in March. However, the privatisation of the power utility Latvenergo will be postponed again due to the lack of consensus over restructuring options. After last June's failure to find suitable bidders LPA called new bids for the privatisation of 44% of the Latvian shipping com pany Lasco. The state's 51% stake in the t\u00e9l\u00e9coms company Lattelekom should be sold by the end of 2000. Lithuania After a rather sharp contraction in 1999, economic pros pects are seen to improve during this and next year. Econ omic growth will largely be driven by private investment, connected with privatisation and the need to further re structure the Lithuanian economy. In addition, exports should benefit from stronger growth in the EU and the ex pected recovery in the CIS area. Wage moderation in order to maintain international price competitiveness will limit the growth of real disposable income, keeping the growth of private consumption on a rather low level as well. As a re sult, real GDP growth will probably remain moderate at about 2'A% this year. For next year, stronger growth of pri vate consumption and investment is expected to support a further stepping up of GDP growth to about 3'/2%. How ever, this is still well below the growth potential of the Li thuanian economy. On the back of weak domestic demand, consumer price inflation has been particularly low in 1999. Increased demand, imported inflation and the need to liber alise regulated prices will lead to a stronger rise in con sumer prices. Unemployment will remain relatively high this year but might begin to decline when the economy is growing faster next year. Based on the government's stricter fiscal discipline, public finances are expected to im prove during the forecasting period. The current account deficit needs to be reduced to be sustainable in the medium term. Lithuania still has not yet recovered completely from the negative external shocks, which hit the economy in the aftermath of the Russian crisis. Traditional export markets in the CIS countries faded away and the continued appreci ation of the litas vis-\u00e0-vis the euro impeded Lithuania's competitiveness on Western markets. In addition, moves connected to the privatisation of the region's only oil re finery led to a temporary shut-down of supplies with a marked impact on the output of the manufacturing sector. The refinery's share in GDP is about 10%. As a result, econ GRAPH 7: LITHUANIA: Unemployment rate 01 04 07 10 01 04 07 10 01 04 07 10 01 04 07 10 01 04 07 10 01 04 07 10 1994 | 1995 | 1996 | 1997 | 1998 | 1999 Source: IMF, International Financial Statistics (IFS). omic growth declined markedly from the second half of 1998 onwards. In the third quarter the negative contribution to overall growth came mainly from agriculture; from the fourth quarter onwards the decline also spread over to the sectors of trade, manufacturing and transport. In January 2000, however, industrial output was back at 5% above the level of the year before, largely due to the recovery of the oil sector. A modest upturn in other parts of manufacturing seems to be on its way. Declining investment and exports were the main factors be hind the output decline. At the same time, imports de creased at a significantly lower rate than exports, reflecting relatively solid private consumption. However, during the first three quarters of 1999 the decline in exports seemed to come to an end, while imports continued to slow down, re flecting declining domestic demand. Thus the contribution of net exports to economic growth has been improving. One important reason for this prolonged weakness in external demand is the rather sluggish recovery of important trade partners such as Germany and Russia. This was further ag gravated by the continuous real effective appreciation of the litas, due to its peg to the US dollar. As a result, the Min istry of Economy revised downward its estimate of econ omic growth, now pointing to a decline in output by more than 2% in 1999. Due to economic decline and restructuring, the registered unemployment rate rose to 10% at the end of 1999. On aver age, the unemployment rate rose from 6.4% in 1998 to 8.4% in 1999. During the first 3 months of this year, the unem ployment rate increased continuously, to 11.4% in March. Given the sluggish economic performance and the further need for economic restructuring, unemployment is ex pected to continue to rise. As a small open economy, the Lithuanian economy was hard hit by the sharp decline in export markets. In 1998, ex ports declined by nearly 4%, largely resulting from a 26% decline in exports to CIS. Exports to the EU rose by more than 12%. At the same time, imports remained relatively ",

In 1998, imports expanded by 2.6% due to strong growth in private consumption in the first three quarters. During 1999 this pattern changed, as imports were increas\u00ad ingly affected by shrinking domestic demand. In 1999, nominal exports declined by more than 19%, while imports decreased by about 17%. The situation on the balance of payments in 1999 was not much different from 1998. Both, the current account deficit and the trade account deficit remained largely on the same level as the year before. However, during the second half of 1999 the trade deficit started to improve as exports im\u00ad proved and imports decreased. Foreign direct investment flows have remained relatively unaffected by the Russian crisis. During the first three quarters of 1999, FDI inflows were in line with the trend during recent years, covering a large part of the country's rising external financing needs. Official reserves continue to cover nearly three months of imports of goods and services. Inflation has fallen drastically, reflecting weak domestic demand, the appreciation of the litas, the surplus supply of agricultural goods on the domestic market and global trends in commodity prices. During the first four months of the year, average 12-month inflation was 0.8%, compared to 1.6% and 6.7% in the first four months in 1999 and 1998, respectively. Annual average inflation in 1999 was only 0.8%, compared to 5.1% in 1998. Excise taxes and some of the regulated prices were raised, but falling food prices, which account for some 40% of the consumer price index, offset any inflationary pressure. The effective exchange rate appreciated markedly, not only due to the devaluation of the Russian rouble but also due to the peg of the litas to the US dollar, which appreciated sig\u00ad nificantly against the European currencies. The currency board arrangement survived the Russian crisis without much difficulty. In mid-October, the Bank of Lithuania an\u00ad nounced that it would shift the peg of the litas directly to the euro in the second half of 2001, maintaining parity. Previ\u00ad ously, a more gradual change involving a basket of cur\u00ad rencies had been envisaged. This decision had positive ef\u00ad fects on the financial markets. However, the Lithuanian interest level is significantly higher than in comparable countries, impeding economic restructuring. The high in\u00ad terest rate level reflects higher economic volatility and the considerable financing needs of the public sector in a nar\u00ad row and underdeveloped capital market. For a long time, the Lithuanian government not only al\u00ad lowed the automatic stabilisers to work fully, but also tried to cushion the negative external impact by supporting af\u00ad fected enterprises. In addition, the government continued to implement the savings restitution programme, transferring 60% of privatisation revenues to private households in order to compensate them for losses during the shift from the Russian rouble to the national currency. As a result of this rather loose fiscal stance, public sector finances de\u00ad teriorated markedly in 1998 and 1999. Current revenues fell short of their target as growth slowed while extra- budgetary expenditures were increased sharply, with one- off privatisation revenues being used as an immediate source of financing. Under the savings restitution scheme, the equivalent of about 2.5% of GDP has been transferred to households so far. As a result, the general government fi\u00ad nancial deficit rose from below 1% of GDP in 1997 to around 5% in 1998 and to around 7% of GDP in 1999 (ex\u00ad cluding municipalities). In mid-1999, revenues and ex\u00ad penditures missed their targets by more than 10%. The situ\u00ad ation of public finances got further strained by the financial implications of the sale of the Mazeikiu oil refinery com\u00ad plex, including commitments of the government to provide considerable funds for the capitalisation and modernisation of the enterprise. In early November 1999, the newly sworn-in government presented an \"anti-crisis\" pro\u00ad gramme, envisaging the postponement of the third and last tranche of the savings restitution, amounting to about 1.5% of GDP and various structural reforms in the social security sector. Most of the measures were incorporated into the year 2000 budget, which was approved end of December. In mid-February 2000, a precautionary stand-by agreement was signed with the IMF, covering 15 months and provid\u00ad ing US dollar 83 million on possible support. The agree\u00ad ment foresees a fiscal deficit of 2.8% of GDP in 2000. ",
        "13 The process of privatisation has continued to move for ward. On 3 April, Lithuania announced the launching the privatisation tender for Agriculture Bank (AG). On 3 May, the Government approved the time table for the sale of the remaining 35% stake of the Lithuanian Telekom. Expected revenues from the sale of the telecommunication company are about 1.2 billion litas, which is about 3% of GDP. With respect to he restructuring of infrastructure facilities, the government approved on 26 April a plan for the Lithuanian railways, creating 6 different entities. With respect to social security, the Lithuanian government took a key decision by approving a pension reform plan on 12 April, setting up a 3\u2014pillar pension system. An obliga tory build-up of insurance in pension funds would be intro duced gradually, i.e. a part of current social insurance con tributions paid to the Sodra budget would be redirected to individual accumulative accounts. The re-organisation of the pension system will be financed from the Privatisation Fund. Poland Poland's macroeconomic performance continues to be impressive. In the second half of 1999, domestic demand enabled GDP growth to accelerate. Although the recovery in exports has been lagging up to now, the contribution of external demand this year is expected in the Commission's forecast to bring back real GDP growth to 5.1% in 2000 and 5.5% in 2001. In 2000 the profile of inflation is ex pected to be the reverse of last year, when inflation picked up significantly in the second half bringing the annual aver age to 7.3%, with year-on-year consumer price inflation rates gradually easing from the double digit levels re-en tered in the first quarter of 2000. Year-end inflation should be around 6.8%, the upper-limit of the inflation objective for 2000, announced by the Monetary Policy Council. The resumption of export growth, including previously unre corded cross-border transactions, anda responsible fiscal stance should lead to a visible reduction of the current ac count deficit by the end of the year. Output growth in the first quarter has consolidated the growth of the last quarter of 1999 (6.2%, year-on-year). Estimates of real GDP growth in the first three months of this year range from 6.3% to 7%. On the other hand, the considerable tightening of monetary policy in the second half of last year could indicate a slowdown in the growth of domestic demand. While industrial production was up 16.4% in February, compared to the same period of the previous year, and 14.2% on average in the final quarter of last year, it was \"only\" 6.8% higher year-on-year in March. The decline in production growth was also apparent in sev eral components of industrial output, with manufacturing up 5.8% year-on-year (against 16.8% on average in the last quarter of 1999) and construction up 4.3% (against 7.6%). Another indicator of such a trend break is the 6.2% drop in new car sales reported for the first quarter of this year. Meanwhile, the unemployment rate has fallen for the first time since May 1999, to around 13.6%. The appropriateness of the macroeconomic policy mix in the face of a still worsening current account position con tinues to be the main worry of Polish policy-makers. Be tween 1995 and 1999, the current account balance slid from a 4.7% of GDP surplus to a 7.6% deficit ($11.7 billion). Since the second half of last year, the resumption of growth and domestic demand have been fuelling imports further, while the recovery in exports, expected from an improved external environment, is still waiting to materialise. The fi nancial markets' reaction to the poor March balance of pay ments data led to a sharp sell-off of the zloty. The trade defi cit in March was nearly $ 1.2 billion and the current account deficit was $1.4 billion, bringing the 12-month moving av erage to 8.3% of GDP. Even though there was some export recovery, import growth rose significantly faster (12%, year-on-year). In the recording of trade, however, the sharp swings in the cross rates between the US dollar and the euro blur the picture if an increasing share of exports is being denominated in euro. In addition, cross-border trade remains depressed, while the deficit on services continues to widen. The impact of the rapid depreciation of the zloty on trade in the coming months is uncertain. On the one hand, the currency sell-off that took place at the beginning of May is seen as a welcome correction of the previous overvaluation of the currency. The zloty went down from 6.69% above its (now notional) central parity on April 12 to 0.96% below the central parity level on May 8. On the other hand, most of the depreciation has taken place against the US dollar, and the current account problem of the Polish economy reflects much more an underlying imbalance between savings and investment than a nominal price and cost competitiveness deficiency. The savings-investment imbalance calls pri marily for a structural response, in particular from fiscal policy. The depreciation of the currency, however, is gener ating fresh uncertainties as to the conduct and the stance of monetary policy. On 8 May the Monetary Policy Council of the NBP held a special meeting in which it recognised that a significant further deterioration of the zloty could have inflationary implications. The MPC, whilst being aware GRAPH 8: POLAND: Unemployment rate 01 04 07 10 01 04 07 10 01 04 07 1001 04 07 1001 04 07 1001 04 07 1001 1994 I 1995 I 1996 I 1997 I 1998 I 1999 I 2000 Source: OECD (Transition Economies Indicators).

On April 11, the Polish government in co-ordination with the Monetary Policy Council (MPC) of the National Bank of Poland (NBP) announced the full floatation of the Polish currency, a long-awaited decision which the monetary authorities had asked for since May of last year. In itself, the floatation constitutes a rather limited exchange rate re gime change. It was defined in the NBP statement as the elimination of the trading bands (which had been progress ively widened to +/- 15%), and the abandonment of the central parity against a basket of 55% euro and 45% US dol lar and the crawl/devaluation of the parity by 0.3% per month against this basket. The previous exchange rated re gime of crawling bands was already close to a full float, after the widening of the bands and last year's elimination of the daily fixing by the NBR At the same time, the an nouncement of the float was not accompanied by a decision to fully liberalise short term capital inflows in line with the commitments to the OECD, which should have been im plemented at the end of last year. The move to a floating exchange rate is consistent with Poland's monetary policy framework of direct inflation targeting. It is clear that the exchange rate will remain, in any case, the most efficient transmission mechanism, and cannot be disregarded as an element of the policy mix. This does not imply, however, that the burden of adjustment on the external front should be carried by monetary policy. The credibility risk associated with missing the inflation target for a second year in a row and the fact that fiscal policy is likely to have a greater impact on the savings and invest ment decisions affecting the balance of payments than monetary policy determine the current account position suggests that the burden of adjustment is firmly on the fiscal side. In this respect, it should be noted that the change of regime is taking place at a time when domestic price developments are becoming more positive. 12-month inflation fell back to single-digit levels in April, at 9.8%. Food prices remain broadly flat, while the price of services is declining. This development suggests that the tightening of monetary policy is starting to have an effect on domestic demand, and it is in line with output indicators. It is also consistent with recent money supply data, which show a decline in year- on-year consumer credit growth. Irrespective of short term price developments, however, the growing external imbalances continue to require fiscal re straint. The prospects for fiscal consolidation this year are promising. By the end of April, the deficit of the state budget was reported to be 57% of the planned deficit of 15.4 billion zloties for 2000. Moreover, turning to the general government budget, the social security office ZUS has re ported an improvement in the rate of collection of contribu tions, in line with the assumptions in this year's budget. On the revenue side, however, the recent rejection by Parlia ment of the introduction of a 3% rate for VAT on agricul tural products will have a negative effect. Macroeconomic assumptions underlying the draft budget for 2001 are due to be released around the end of May. Romania 7999 was the third consecutive year of real GDP decline, which fell by 3.2% compared to 1998. This was a disap pointment to the authorities, which had expected a much lower decline. However, the spectacular reduction in the current account deficit, the successful repayment of all ex ternal obligations and the rebuilding of official reserves were important achievements. In fact, while Romania's macro-economic situation remains fragile, there have been signs of a gradual improvement in recent months. The re vival of exports in the first quarter of 2000 has been the most encouraging sign that efforts made in recent years might start to have an impact on the supply side of the economy. There is also increased confidence that the recent agree ment with the International Monetary Fund should lead to a resumption of official lending to Romania and strengthen the international credibility of the authorities. However, the gains achieved in macroeconomic stabilisation could still ",

In the first quarter of 2000, exports have increased faster than expected and have reached levels not seen since the beginning of the transition. Imports have also increased, albeit more modestly. In this context, it is possible that growth will resume this year. In fact, the gov ernment is confident that there is a sound basis for an ex port-led recovery in 2000 and expects real GDP growth to reach 1.3% in 2000. This remains uncertain given very weak internal demand (retail sales were down 23% in the first two months of the year), the high level of interest rates and the possible negative impact on exports of the nominal appreciation of the leu against the euro and its real appreci ation against the dollar. The government is committed to rigorous macroeconomic management, including tight fiscal and income policies. It has successfully extended the agreement with the IMF in May 2000. The basic tenets of the economic programme are a further contraction of domestic demand through strict fis cal, credit and income policy, which, together with restruc turing of the public industrial sector and tighter financial discipline, should result in a relatively stable current ac count deficit and increased external financing. The econ omic programme should also help to reduce the budget deficit and lead to lower inflation. Unemployment is likely to continue to increase as a result of restructuring. The most pressing challenge is to increase external capital inflows, in particular to improve the financing of the budget deficit and allow companies to invest in modern production technol ogy- One of the government's greatest challenges is to put public finances on a sustainable path. This will require stopping the timid and uncertain approach to structural reforms, which has been the root cause of economic problems since GRAPH 9: ROMANIA: Unemployment rate % 01 04 07 10 01 04 07 10 01 04 07 10 01 04 07 10 01 04 07 10 01 04 07 1001 1994 I 1995 I 1996 I 1997 I 1998 I 1999 I 2000 Source: National Commission for Statistics. 1990. In 1999 the government tightened fiscal policy. As a result, the consolidated fiscal deficit fell from 5.1% to 3.3% of GDP, and a primary surplus of 2.4% of GDP was re corded. Given the proximity of elections, it has proved more difficult to continue with strict fiscal policies in 2000: the 2000 budget, which was approved in early May, pro vides for a slight increase in the headline deficit and a de cline in the primary surplus. Monetary policy has been over-burdened as the central bank has tried to pursue many objectives at the same time: strengthening credibility of the currency; increasing the level of foreign exchange reserves; controlling liquidity and reducing inflation, while ensuring some real depreci ation to support exports. Strict monetary policy in recent months has allowed a slight reduction of inflation, which remained high at 48.9% on a year-on-year basis in April.

        "- 1 6- Unemployment has increased rapidly and reached 11.9% of the labour force at the end of March 2000. It could still con tinue to rise as enterprise restructuring accelerates. The so cial situation is also a serious cause of concern, with pov erty growing steadily and health conditions deteriorating. One of Romania's main economic problems since 1990 has been its relatively weak external position. In 1999, after three years of negative growth, there was a remarkable ad justment of the current account deficit, which fell by more than 55% and accounted for about 3.8% of GDP. The main factors were the fall in domestic demand, which reduced imports of goods by 13%, and a modest 1% increase of ex ports. In the first quarter of 2000, however, there has been a clear revival of exports, which have increased by more 26.5% compared to the same quarter of 1999 and have re ached levels not seen since the beginning of the transition. Imports have also increased, albeit more modestly. As a re sult, the trade deficit fell by more than 80%. The main fac tors behind the expansion of exports have been the acceler ation of growth in the EU and the large devaluation of the currency that took place in 1999. Given the weak balance of payments position, an increase in the export base is needed to sustain the long-term devel opment of the Romanian economy. Foreign direct invest ment, structural reforms and a more hospitable business environment will greatly contribute to that goal. Unfortu nately, progress in these areas has been slow and although there has been an improvement in recent months, this is not sufficient given the extent of Romania's problems. In fact, the evolution of the capital account has been worrying. FDI inflows fell by almost two thirds in 1999 while there was a large net outflow of portfolio investments, reflecting the very weak confidence of international investors. There has been no pick-up in FDI in 2000. The successive governments' ambitious plans to accelerate privatisation and the restructuring of large companies is proving very difficult to implement, as shown by the almost complete halt in the privatisation of large enterprises since the beginning of summer 1999. Many ambitious privatisa tion operations have been initiated by the government, but will not be finalised until the middle of 2000 or thereafter. Closure and restructuring of public loss-making com panies is also delayed. The lack of financial discipline con tinues to hinder macroeconomic stabilisation. In particular, the arrears connected with large utilities have continued to increase in real terms in the first months of 2000, putting strains on revenue collection. In the context of increasing poverty and growing social pressures, with general elections looming, a consistent im plementation of the announced economic policy pro gramme will be a challenge for the new Romanian govern ment. The improvement of the country's credibility among international private and public lenders, weakened by many years of unfulfilled promises and failed agreements, de pends on the government's capacity to take on that chal lenge. Slovakia The macroeconomic stabilisation policies of the govern ment have broadly generated the desired results in 1999.

The trade and current account deficits have been almost halved, while economic growth slowed down but remained relatively strong thanks to robust exports. We expect that GDP growth will recover slightly in 2000 and more noti ceably in 2001. Growth in 2000 is expected to remain mod erate because domestic demand will still be subdued, al though clearly less than in 1999. Although continued strong export growth is expected, the contribution from net exports to growth should decline because import growth will accel erate again as a result of the less negative developments in domestic demand. With an expected recovery in investment in 2001, domestic demand should start to have a positive contribution to growth again, leading to an acceleration of GDP growth to around 3'A%. Inflation will remain high in the first half of 2000 as a result of sharp increases in admi nistered prices in the second half of 1999 and the first half of 2000. Afterwards inflation could decline to 7'/2% in 2001. After the sharp improvement of external accounts in 1999, the further reduction of trade and current account deficits is expected to be slower because import growth will acceler ate again in line with the strengthening of domestic de mand. The decline in economic growth from 4.4% in 1998 to 1.9% in 1999 is relatively modest, given the size of the painful but necessary cuts in domestic demand. In preceding years, ex cessive domestic demand growth had pushed the trade and current account deficits to unsustainable levels, leading to exchange rate tensions in the second half of 1998 and early 1999. Price and tax increases, lower public investment, and the imposition of a harder budget constraint on the enter prise sector, generated a drop in domestic demand (exclud ing stocks) by 6.4% in 1999, compared to an increase by 6.1% in 1998. This was mainly the result of a dramatic de cline of gross fixed capital formation by more than 18%, re ducing the investment to GDP ratio from close to 41% in 1998 to 33% in 1999. Private consumption growth also de celerated sharply from 5.0% to 0.5%, while public con sumption growth was only 0.3%. It is expected that domes- ",
        "17 tic demand will stabilise in 2000 and grow by about 2Vi% again in 2001. The negative effects of the weak domestic developments on GDP growth were largely compensated by the contribution from net exports. Real exports grew by 7%, which is a good performance given the feeble economic growth during most of the year in Germany, the Czech Republic and Italy, Slovakia's main export markets. In addition, the sharp con traction of domestic demand resulted in a decline of real im ports by 2.5%, compared to an increase by close to 10% in 1998. As a result, both the trade and current account deficits were almost halved to below 6% of GDP. Figures for the first months of 2000 confirm this positive trend. In the first quarter, exports grew by one third, while imports increased \"only\" by almost a quarter. As a result, the trade balance de clined further to about 3%% of GDP in the first quarter, while the current account deficit for January was less than 1% of GDP. In the second half of 1999 and early 2000, the evolution of inflation has been largely determined by government deci sions. Various increases of administered prices (mainly in the energy sector), higher indirect taxes and the introduc tion of an import surcharge have pushed up the inflation rate from 7.1% in June 1999 to 16.6% in March 2000. In April, the month-on-month inflation rate was zero and the annual inflation rate slowed down to 15.9%. Due to the profile of price increases in the past, inflation will stay relatively high in the first half of 200\u00d5, but might decline rapidly to close to 10% towards the end of the year. With most of the backlog in administered price increases cleared by the end of 2000, inflation could fall further to around lVi% in 2001. Unemployment increased rapidly in 1999 and reached 17.1% in the fourth quarter (labour force survey data), an increase by 4.5 percentage points compared to the end of 1998. In January and February 2000, registered unemploy ment increased to as much as 19.5%, before a slight sea sonal decline to 19.3% in March. The main solution of the unemployment problem will have to come from a more dy namic private sector that starts generating jobs, especially in small and medium-size enterprises. This will take time and, consequently, a sharp reduction of unemployment should not be expected this or next year. The reduction of the general government deficit plays a central role in the government's macroeconomic stabilisa tion programme. Although present estimates indicate that the deficit target of 3% of GDP was not reached in 1999, the authorities have been able to reduce the primary deficit (ex cluding interest payments) by about 2% of GDP, which represents a significant fiscal tightening. The budget for 2000 again aims at a general government deficit of 3% of GDP. It is based on expected GDP growth of 2.5%, which is slightly higher than the Commission's forecast of around 2.2%. The plans include a number of tax reductions to pro mote entrepreneurial activity, while consumption taxes on driving, drinking and smoking will be increased. The gov ernment counts on significant revenues from privatisation, mainly from the sale of a majority share in Slovak Telecom. These will be used for settling outstanding debts (for example to the Slovak Railways), covering expected pay ments for existing state guarantees, and for a number of public investment projects. However, there seem to be a number of risks, mainly on the expenditure side, that could result in a higher than planned deficit. Because of the budgetary effects of the corporate income tax reduction and the costs of banking restructuring it will be particularly difficult to keep the government deficit in 2001 at the level reached in 2000. When the first positive effects of the macroeconomic stabi lisation programme on the external accounts became appar ent, and after the government made credible progress with structural reforms, the interest of international financial in vestors in Slovakia returned. Foreign investment in govern ment securities increased and drove down interest rates. As a result of the improved current account balance and the in creased foreign interest in koruna denominated securities, the exchange rate started to recover against the euro from the middle of 1999. The National Bank of Slovakia has re peatedly intervened to slow down the appreciation of the TABLE 12: SLOVAKIA- Main economic trends Real GDP growth rate Inflation rate annual average December-on-December Unemployment rate, end year ILO definition General government budget balancee 2 ) Current account balance Foreign debt debt/export ration) gross foreign debt Net foreign direct investment EBRD data( 4 ) balance of payments data % % % % % of GDP % of GDP million EURO % billion EURO % of GDP million EURO Source: National sources.

As a result, official international reserves have in creased from a low of \u20ac2.4 billion at the time of the currency crisis in May 1999 to \u20ac4.5 billion at the end of April 2000. In early May, the currency came under down ward pressure as a result of Slovak crown sales by foreigners and the central bank intervened to support the currency. The bank restructuring and privatisation process has made substantial progress in recent months. After a first carve- out of non-performing assets, the state-owned banks have been recapitalised to reach a capital adequacy ratio of 8%. In addition, legal and financial advisors for the privatisation of these banks have been selected. The government has an nounced that it intends to sell majority shares in all banks, including in the Slovak Savings Bank where it originally wanted to keep the majority in state hands. The government decided recently on a second carve-out of bad assets in order to increase the capital adequacy ratio (to 8% in ac cordance with international standards that are more strin gent than Slovak accounting standards) and to reduce the proportion of non-performing assets to a maximum of 20% in each bank. The government intends to finalise the bank privatisation process by the first quarter of 2001. In order to promote enterprise restructuring, a revised bank ruptcy law is currently being discussed by Parliament. By accelerating procedures, reinforcing the role of the credi tors, and by increasing the possibilities for restructuring of the enterprise without liquidation, the bankruptcy frame work should become an effective instrument for enterprise restructuring. A number of state-owned enterprises will be privatised or will look for a strategic partner. The privatisa tion of a majority share of Slovak Telecom and of the state's share in one of the GSM operators has already been in itiated. It has recently been announced that several major private Slovak enterprises (VSZ, Slovnaft) have been fully or partly sold to a foreign strategic investor. Slovenia Slovenia's economic performance in 1999 exceeded ex pectations which is remarkable in the light of the unfavour able external circumstances in the first half of the year. Economic growth reached 4.9% of GDP in 1999, after a weak start. Activity in the manufacturing and construction sector was substantially higher than expected. The Com mission 's forecast includes 4.1% real GDP growth for 2000 and 2001. Domestic and external imbalances have con tinued to widen in the first months of 2000 and, although they remain small in comparison to other candidate countries, this may become problematic since foreign direct investment inflows have been drying up. In 1999 prise in creases turned out relatively low despite the introduction of VAT on 1 July, but inflation has increased in the first quarter of 2000. The fiscal deficit in 1999 remained at a relatively modest 0.6% of GDP. There is only limited progress on the implementation of structural reform in Slovenia. The recent change in government could hold up further progress in the run up to the elections which are due later this year.

In the months preceding the intro duction of VAT (on 1 July 1999) growth was driven by a hike in imports as consumers anticipated the price increases induced by the new VAT system. This contributed to an ex ceptionally high, current account deficit of $581 million for 1999 - equivalent to 2.9 % of GDP. The widening cur rent account deficit was caused by a surge in imports of con sumer goods in the first half of 1999 and by increased im port of intermediaries in the last half. Preliminary data for January 2000 indicate that the deficit is not coming down although exports are increasing. The current account defi cit, will, to a large extent, be financed by debt creating in flows as foreign direct investments have dried up. The level of FDI in 1999 was a disappointing $83 million and the first months of 2000 brought almost no new FDI to Slovenia. Continued restrictions on short term capital movement have been partly responsible for this situation, but also the securities market remains very thin with no new emissions for several years and a very short range of titles. Acceleration of structural reform, the removal of adminis trative barriers in relation to establishing a business, and in- Creased flexibility of the labour market are increasingly ur gent to ensure long term competitiveness. In 1999 fiscal performance was sound, with a deficit of 0.6 % of GDP. The progress in reducing inflation achieved in 1998 was continued in 1999. Despite the introduction of VAT, the year-on-year inflation rate only increased from 6.5% in December 1998 to 8% in December 1999. The Commission forecast that inflation will remain at that level. Administrative prices, including fuel prices, constitute 14% of the CPI basket. Despite an agreement by social partners on a wage policy for the period 1999-2001, there nevertheless seem to be an underlying upward pressure on wages as groups not covered by the agreement manages to ",

It involves among other changes, an increase in the retirement age for women. It, in principle introduces a three pillars sys tem, but only the existing 'Pay as you go' pillar will be obli gatory. A second pillar based on a supplementary and funded pensions scheme is voluntary and subject to decen tralised agreement between social partners. For professions with very early retirement age (pilots, ballet dancers, etc) or dangerous occupations, this second pillar will be obliga tory. The reform will allow to reduce costs per retired per son, but the rapidly increasing number of pensioners will almost counterbalance this effect. A significant impact on the public budget is therefore not expected in the short to medium term. Economic growth, together with tighter rules for register ing as unemployed, has led to a decrease in registered un employment. While the unemployment rate based on the ILO definition stood at 7.8% by end 1998, it was 7.7% in third quarter of 1999 (or 13.0% according to the definition used in officially reported figures.). For 2000 the Commis sion forecast a further slight decrease in the unemployment rate. There are significant imbalances in the labour market where long-term unemployment in particular affects workers over 40 with low skills. On the other hand, demand for young and well-educated workers exceeds supply. A legislative initiative to improve labour market flexibility is currently blocked in Parliament awaiting consultation with social partners, and is unlikely to be adopted before elec tions. While there has been little practical progress on the priva tisation of state owned banks, two new laws on the insur ance sector initiate the long awaited ownership transform ation and open up the market for foreign competition. The Slovene Development Co-operation has been slow in divesting assets of rehabilitated enterprises, but a new man agement is expected to speed up the process. The emission of shares in the concerned companies would enhance the development of the capital market. For the time being the economy remains characterised by a hesitation to fully pri vatise major economic agents and the prospect of the gen eral election seems to add further to delay in the necessary reforms. Turkey As a result of the earthquake related destruction of last year and weak domestic demand the dynamics of the Turkish economy seem to be subdued. However, the start of the re construction activities, declining interest rates and stronger growth in the EU should lead to a marked increase in output during this year and next year. The main driving force will be investment, benefiting from reconstruction activities and the decline in the interest rate, and exports, driven by stronger growth in the EU and in particular in Germany. Private and pubic consumption will only mar ginally contribute to Turkey's recovery. Based on the imple mentation of the dis-inflationary programme, consumer price inflation is expected to decline markedly, while the public sector deficit is seen to improve. Despite the ex pected acceleration in growth, unemployment will remain largely unchanged. With respect to structural reforms, the Turkish government is proceeding with privatisation of state enterprise and, the cleaning-up of extra-budgetaiy funds. In the area of institutional reform it has proceeded with the revision of the central bank regulation. The Commission's Spring forecast expects for this year a relatively moderate acceleration of GDP growth at about 4 x /2 %, mainly driven by earthquake reconstruction acti vities and exports. Given the ambitious economic conso lidation programme, the growth in private and public con sumption is expected to remain rather limited, while imports will be much higher than usual in a situation of weak domestic demand, given the high import content of investment. Next year, economic growth is supposed to be more balanced, relying to a larger extent on domestic com ponents, while the reconstruction related import boom should fade out. Consumer price inflation is expected to de cline markedly, based on moderate wage agreements and ",

End of this year, 12-monthly consumer price inflation rates of about 30% seem to be within reach. This development should continue next year, leading to a further decline in 12-monthly inflation rates to about 10% end of the year. Unemployment is expected to remain on a relatively high level; job creation due to stronger growth will be largely compensated by job losses in state enterprises prepared for privatisation. Public sector finances are expected to improve markedly, mainly benefit ing from declining interest rates, lower expenditures for supporting the agricultural sector and state enterprises and improved tax collection. The current account probably will deteriorate this year, to a deficit somewhat above 1% of GDP. This is a relatively minor deterioration; higher tourist revenues most likely will partly compensate higher recon struction related imports. Next year, the situation in the cur rent account should improve, as import growth should re main on a rather low level, given subdued domestic demand. Some early indicators of industrial production and capacity utilisation show a moderate acceleration of economic activ ity after about a year of decline caused by the Russian crisis. The impact of the fall of Russian demand, which was most strongly felt up to mid-1999, was prolonged by the earth quake in August 1999. While in the first quarter of 1999, real GDP was 9.1% lower than the year before, the decline had been more moderate in the second quarter (-1.7% year-on-year). In the third quarter, GDP contracted by 6.0% compared with the same period in 1998, reflecting the negative impact of the earthquake on industrial production, construction and commerce. In the fourth quarter, the de cline was still 3.4% year-on-year, leading to decline for the whole year of 5.0%. During the last two years, foreign trade was strongly af fected by the deterioration in the external environment and the decline in domestic demand. However, during the last half year, commodity exports seem to have recovered. Pre liminary data for the whole of 1999 indicate a relatively moderate decline in nominal commodity exports (in US dollars) by 1.4% compared to 1998, while nominal com modity imports declined by 11.4%. The decrease in exports occurred mainly in trade with CIS countries, while exports to the EU increased by about 3%. The decline in imports was more evenly distributed among the trade partners. As a result of declining imports and high worker's remit tances, the current account improved and showed even a slight surplus in 1999. However, in view of the expected ac celeration in growth the current account is expected to turn into a deficit again in the near future, especially given the increased import demand related to the reconstruction acti vities after the earthquake. After the drain in foreign ex change reserves during the second half of 1998, reserves re covered in the first half of 1999 and are currently at a comfortable level. The most noteworthy development in 1999 was probably the substantial decline in inflation. Starting from a rate of increase of 101.6% 12-month consumer price inflation de clined since January 1998 and reached its lowest level of 63.8% this April. Besides diminishing demand and lower import prices it has been mainly the dis-inflationary stance of the government which led to this decline. Since last year, the government is no longer applying backward indexation to public sector wages and agricultural support prices, but uses inflation expectations as guideline for the wage and price setting. In addition, the Central Bank announced a de tailed programme of applying a crawling peg heading for an inflation target instead of simply accommodating inflation ary developments. According to the government pro gramme, CPI inflation is set to decline to 25% by the end of this year and to reach single digits by the end of 2001. In early December 1999, the Turkish government presented a comprehensive economic programme designed to reduce the chronically high level of inflation and real interest rates and to address structural imbalances in the economy in order to stabilise the volatile economic development. The main features of the programme are up-front fiscal adjust ment, structural reforms and firm exchange rate commit ment supporting the anti-inflationary stance. On 22 De cember 1999 the IMF announced the provision of a 3-year stand-by credit amounting to $4 billion in order to support this programme. General government finances largely remained in line with targets of the IMF-guided consolidation. This is a remark able success and a significant change compared to previous consolidation attempts. The fiscal consolidation took place despite a series of adverse influences: interest payments rose sharply in the wake of the Russian crisis; costs for agri cultural support were higher than expected as world market prices were below expectations; revenues were dampened by the first-round effect of the 1998 tax reform and the earthquake required additional expenditures and unex pected shortfalls of tax revenue. All this accounted for more than 1% of Gross National Product (GNP). The govern ment reacted by further reducing expenditures and inten sifying tax collection. At the end of November 1999, the ",

The key fiscal goal for 2000 is to raise the primary surplus of the public sector from 2.8% of GNP in 1999 to 3.7% of GNP in 2000. Earthquake related fiscal expenditures, ac counting to about \\Vi% of GNP are not included in this target. In addition to the earthquake package, which is ex pected to raise revenues by about 2% of GNP in 2000, vari ous other measures will be introduced generating nearly 3% of GNP in additional revenues. Reduced expenditures for public sector wages and current expenditures should im prove the deficit by 0.2% of GNP. In addition, structural measures approved in 1999, such as the decisions on pen sion reform, should reduce state transfers to the social se curity fund by 0.5% of GNP. However, many of the measures in 2000 are of a one-off nature, while further measures with a permanent nature are planned to be intro duced in 2001. In recent years, privatisation revenues played no significant role for public finances. In the present consolidation pro gramme privatisation revenues play an important part. In 2000, privatisation revenues are expected to amount to $7.6 billion or 2Vi% of GDP, resulting from $4.5-5.5 billion from privatisation in the telecommunication and energy sector. The rest is expected from sales by the Privatisation Agency. The generated cash receipts are put at $3.1 billion, which will be used to cover interest payments ($0.9 billion) and to finance investments and public institutions liabilities ($2.2 billioh). Any additional privatisation revenues will be used for debt reduction. In order to facilitate privatisation, the Turkish parliament has passed constitutional amend ments allowing for international arbitration. In so far, priva tisation revenues are above expectations, in particular thanks to unexpectedly high revenues for a GSM licence. Thus, by early May about 70% of the targeted privatisation revenues for the year 2000 are achieved. In line with the structural measures foreseen in the dis inflationary programme, the Turkish government is pro ceeding with closing down extra-budgetary funds. By early April, 7 extra-budgetary funds have been liquidated. How ever, another 25 funds are supposed to be closed by August, and all 61 extra-budgetary funds are to be closed down by June 2001. In order to improve the independence of the Turkish Cen tral Bank, a protocol has been signed between the Treasury and the Central Bank, reducing institutional links between those two institutions.
