O BJECTIVE OF THE C OMMISSION P ROPOSAL This proposal is part of the third legislative package for an internal EU gas and electricity market (\"Third Package\"), which includes two Directives and three Regulations. The main objective of the package is to put in place the regulatory framework needed to make market opening fully effective and create a single EU gas and electricity market in the interest of the citizens and of the industry of the European Union. This will help to keep prices as low as possible and increase standards of service and security of supply. This is done through the following main measures: \u2013 more effective regulatory oversight by independent national regulators; \u2013 establishment of an Agency to ensure effective cooperation between national regulators and take decisions on all relevant cross-border issues; \u2013 compulsory cooperation between network operators to harmonise all rules relating to the transport of energy across Europe and to coordinate investment planning; ",
        "EN 3 EN \u2013 effective unbundling of the generation and transmission of energy so as to eliminate any conflict of interests, promote network investment and prevent any discriminatory behaviour; \u2013 increased transparency and better functioning of the retail market; \u2013 increased solidarity and regional cooperation between Member States to ensure greater security of supply. 3. C OMMISSION COMMENTS 3.1 General At its Plenary Session of 22 April 2009, the European Parliament adopted a compromise package which had been agreed with the Council in view of reaching a second reading agreement. These amendments concern essentially: \u2013 the limited strengthening of some rules ensuring effective unbundling of transmission system operator, \u2013 reinforced independence and powers of national regulators, and \u2013 provisions creating stronger obligations for Member States as regards consumer protection, energy poverty and the implementation of smart metering. The Commission accepts the compromise package as it is in line with the overall purpose and the general characteristics of the proposal. 3.2 Amended Proposal Pursuant to Article 250(2) of the EC Treaty, the Commission amends its Proposal as set out above.
