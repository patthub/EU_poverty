        "Creation of function group AST/SC The establishment plans of all EU Institutions and bodies will be modified to take account of the creation in the Staff Regulations of the new AST/SC function group, as proposed in Amending Letter No 2/2014. Heading 6 Commitment appropriations are set at the level proposed by the Commission in the Draft Budget. 1.4. Special instruments Commitment appropriations for the Emergency Aid Reserve (EAR) and the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF) are set at the level proposed by the Commission in the Draft Budget. 1.5. Payment appropriations The overall level of payment appropriations in the 2014 budget is set at EUR 135 504 613 000. The Council position on the Draft Budget is used as a starting point to apply the following allocation of payment appropriations across budget lines in 2014: 1. First, account is taken of the agreed level of commitment appropriations for non-differentiated expenditure, for which the level of payment appropriations by definition is equal to the level of commitments; 2. By analogy, the same applies to decentralised agencies, for which the EU contribution in payment appropriations is set at the level proposed in section 1.2 above; 3. The payment appropriations for all new pilot projects and preparatory actions are set at 50 % of the corresponding commitment appropriations, or to the level proposed by Parliament if lower; in the case of extension of existing pilot projects and preparatory actions the level of payments is the one defined in the Draft Budget plus 50 % of the corresponding new commitments, or to the level proposed by Parliament if lower; 4. The following specific amounts in payment appropriations are agreed: a. The level of payment appropriations for the EU Solidarity Fund in 2014 is set at EUR 150 million; b. The level of payment appropriations for the Joint Technology Initiatives is set at the level proposed in Amending Letter No 1/2014, whereas the level of payment appropriations for the International Fisheries Agreements is set at the level proposed in Amending Letter No 2/2014; c. The level of payment appropriations for \u2018Support to peace process and financial assistance to Palestine and to the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (UNRWA)\u2019 is set at EUR 200 million; d. The level of payment appropriations for the Macro-regional strategies 2014-2020 is set at 50 % of the level of commitments defined under heading 1b in section 1.3 above; e. The level of payment appropriations for the Special Annual Events is set at the level of commitments defined under heading 1a in section 1.3 above. 5. The level of payment appropriations set in paragraphs 2 to 4 has a net impact of EUR 285 million compared with the Council position on the Draft Budget for the expenditure items concerned. Taking into account the difference between the overall level of payment appropriations of EUR 135 504 613 000 and the Council position on the Draft Budget, the remaining amount of EUR 215 million allows for an increase of payment appropriations across all budget lines with differentiated appropriations for which no specific rules have been defined in the paragraphs 2 to 4 above, in proportion with the difference between the Draft Budget proposed by the Commission and the Council position. 24.11.2016 EN Official Journal of the European Union C 436/149 Wednesday 20 November 2013 ",

Budgetary remarks All amendments introduced by the European Parliament or the Council to the text of budgetary remarks are agreed with changes as set out in Annex 1.

        "3. Statements 3.1. Joint statement on payment appropriations The European Parliament, the Council, and the Commission recall their shared responsibility, as laid down in Article 323 of the Treaty on the Functioning the European Union (TFEU), that \u2018the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission shall ensure that the financial means are made available to allow the Union to fulfil its legal obligation in respect of third parties\u2019. The European Parliament and the Council recall the need to ensure, in the light of implementation, an orderly progression of payments so as to avoid any abnormal shift of outstanding commitments (\u2018RAL\u2019) onto the 2015 budget. In this respect, they will have recourse, when appropriate, to the various flexibility mechanisms included in the MFF Regulation, among others in its Article 13. The European Parliament and the Council agree to set the level of payment appropriations for 2014 at EUR 135 504 613 000. They ask the Commission to initiate any necessary action, on the basis of the provisions of the draft MFF Regulation and the Financial Regulation, to cover the responsibility assigned by the Treaty and, in particular, after having examined the scope for reallocation of the relevant appropriations, with particular reference to any expected under- implementation of appropriations (Financial Regulation Article 41\u00a7 2) to request additional payment appropriations in an amending budget if the appropriations entered in the 2014 budget are insufficient to cover expenditure. The European Parliament and the Council will take position on any draft amending budget as quickly as possible in order to avoid any shortfall in payment appropriations. In addition, the European Parliament and the Council undertake to process swiftly any possible transfer of payment appropriations, including across financial framework headings, in order to make the best possible use of payment appropriations entered in the budget and align them to actual execution and needs. The European Parliament, the Council and the Commission will, throughout the year, actively monitor the state of implementation of the 2014 budget, in particular under sub-heading 1b (Economic, social and territorial cohesion) and rural development under heading 2 (Sustainable Growth: Natural Resources). This will take the form of dedicated inter- institutional meetings, in accordance with point 36 of the Annex of the Interinstitutional Agreement, to take stock of payment implementation and revised forecasts. 3.2. European Parliament and Commission statement on payment appropriations The European Parliament and the Commission recall the need for specific and maximum flexibility within the 2014-2020 MFF. Changes to the proposed legal bases agreed by the legislative authority will lead to further pressure on the payment ceilings under the 2014-2020 MFF. In the context of the finalisation of the legislative package for the Cohesion policy 2014-2020 and taking into account the possible impact of the SME initiative, the Commission issued a declaration on the impact of the agreement reached on the performance reserve and pre-financing levels, on payment needs. Whilst the overall impact of these changes on additional payment appropriations in the 2014-2020 MFF is considered to remain limited, the Commission stated that the annual fluctuations in the global level of payments would be managed through the use of the global margin for payments. If needed, the Commission may also have recourse to the Flexibility Instrument and the Contingency Margin agreed upon in the draft MFF Regulation. Therefore, the Commission intends to propose correcting measures in light of implementation, using, to the extent necessary, all the tools offered by the new MFF. Specifically, in the course of 2014 the Commission may have to propose to have recourse to the Contingency Margin, in accordance with Article 13 of the draft MFF Regulation. 3.3. Council statement on payment appropriations The Council recalls that the special instruments can only be activated to cater for genuinely unforeseen circumstances. 24.11.2016 EN Official Journal of the European Union C 436/153 Wednesday 20 November 2013 ",
        "It recalls that the Contingency Margin shall not result in exceeding the total ceilings of commitment and payment appropriations. As regards other special instruments, the Council recalls that Article 3(2) of the draft MFF Regulation states that commitment appropriations may be entered in the budget over and above the ceilings of the relevant headings. 3.4. Joint statement on decentralised agencies The European Parliament, the Council and the Commission recall the importance to progressively reduce the staffing levels of all EU institutions, bodies and agencies by 5 % over five years, as agreed in point 23 of the draft Interinstitutional Agreement on budgetary discipline, cooperation in budgetary matters and on sound financial management. The European Parliament and the Council commit to pursue progressively the above-mentioned 5 % staff reduction for the period 2013-2017 while insisting as well on the proper functioning of the agencies so that they can fulfil the tasks they have been assigned by the legislative authority. In this respect, they consider that further measures, including structural ones, may be required to achieve this reduction for decentralised agencies. In this context, the Commission will continue its assessment of the possibilities to merge and/or wind-up some of the existing agencies, and/or other ways to achieve synergies. Further to the work carried out by the Inter-Institutional Working Group, which resulted in the Common Approach on decentralised agencies agreed in July 2012, the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission agree on the need for a closer and more permanent scrutiny on the development of decentralised agencies to ensure a coherent approach. Without prejudice to their respective prerogatives, they agree to establish a specific inter-institutional working group with the aim of defining a clear development path for agencies, based on objective criteria. The Group should in particular discuss: \u2014 Evaluation of establishment plans on a case-by-case basis; \u2014 Ways to provide adequate appropriations and staff for additional tasks, assigned to individual agencies by the legislative authority; \u2014 Treatment of agencies which are fully or partially fee-financed; \u2014 Administrative structure of agencies, financing models, treatment of assigned revenues; \u2014 Reassessment of needs; potential mergers/closures; transfer of tasks to the Commission. The European Parliament and the Council will take into due account the results achieved by the Inter-Institutional Working Group in their deliberations as legislative and budgetary authority. 3.5. Joint statement on heading 5 and salary adjustments The European Parliament and the Council agree that pending the outcome of the cases before the European Court of Justice, the appropriations related to the proposed salary adjustments of 1,7 % for 2011 and 1,7 % for 2012 will not be included at this stage in the 2014 budget. Should the Court of Justice rule in favour of the Commission, the Commission will present a Draft Amending Budget in 2014 in order to cover the proposed salary adjustments, for all the Sections. Under such a scenario, the European Parliament and the Council undertake to act swiftly on the relevant Draft Amending Budget. 3.6. Joint statement on EU Special Representatives The Parliament and the Council agree to examine the transfer of appropriations for the European Union Special Representatives from the Commission's budget (Section III) to the budget of the European External Action Service (Section X) in the context of the 2015 budgetary procedure.
