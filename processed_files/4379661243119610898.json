        "5 Introduction Ethics of modern developments in agriculture technologies The European Group on Ethics (EGE) is an independent, pluralist and multidisciplinary body that advises the Eu- ropean Commission on the ethical aspects of science and new technologies in connection with the preparation and implementation of Community legislation or policies. The Group is composed of fifteen independent experts appointed by the Commission for their expertise and personal qualities. It was set up by the Commission in December 1997 to succeed the Group of Advisers on the Ethical Implica- tions of Biotechnologies (GAEIB 1991-1997). During its first term (1998-2000) the EGE provided Opinions on subjects as diverse as human tissue banking, human em- bryo research, personal health data in the information society, doping in sport and human stem cell research. In April 2001 the Commission appointed twelve mem- bers for the period 2001-2004. During its second term, the Group published Opinions on the ethical aspects of patenting inventions involving human stem cells (No 16\u2013 7 May 2002), clinical research in developing countries (No 17\u20134 F ebruary 2003), genetic testing in the work- place (No 18 \u2013 28 July 2003), and umbilical cord blood banking (No 19 \u2013 16 March 2004). On 11 May 2005, the Commission decided to renew the Group\u2019s mandate for a further four-year period. For this third term, the EGE was increased in size from 12 to 15 members. The same year, the Group published its Opi- nion on the ethical aspects of ICT implants in the human body (No 20\u201316 March 2005). So far in 2007 the EGE has issued Opinions on ethics and nanomedicine 1 (No 21\u2013 17 January 2007), on an Et hics review of FP7 human em- bryonic stem cells projects 2 (No 22\u201313 July 2007), and on the Ethical Aspects of Animal Cloning for Food Supply (No 23\u201316 January 2008). The Group is currently working on an Opinion on the Ethics of modern developments in agriculture tech- nologies , to be presented to the Commission by De- cember 2008. In preparing its opinions, the EGE engages in broad con- sultations, involving individual experts, representatives of European institutions and other international institu- tions as well as representatives of civil society. The pur- pose of the Round Table organised by the Group is to promote a transparent dialogue between parties repre- senting different interests.

        "7 Round-Table Report 1. Main goal of the Round-Table The European Group on Ethics in Science and New Tech- nologies (EGE) is preparing an Opinion on Ethics of mo- dern developments in agriculture technologies (Opi- nion 24). As part of its preparatory work the EGE held an open round-table debate on the issues related to animal cloning for food supply. The round table was organised by the Bureau of European Policy Advisers (BEPA). The main goal of this event was to allow stakeholders to provide the EGE with relevant data, considerations and viewpoints for the finalisation of Opinion 24, which is to be published at the end of 2008. To maximise the participation of experts, an open invita- tion was sent to relevant stakeholders (EU and beyond), members of the National Ethics Councils (EU-27 Member States), consumer organisations, farmers\u2019 organisations, environment protection organisations, academics, reli- gious groups, industries, NGOs, etc. An open invitation was published on the Internet to allow the full and free participation of all interested parties and a press an- nouncement was also published by the Commission ahead of the event. Participants were also asked to send contributions to the EGE, and the round table was broadcast on the Internet. 2. The Round-Table The round table was structured as a set of contributions from different speakers representing different interest groups and as a debate between the attendees, the speakers and the EGE members. Around 100 participants attended the round table, in- cluding representatives of European Institutions, inter- national organisations, religions, consumers, food and farm industries, animal protection and environment organisations, experts (biotechnology, ethics, science, law, theology, etc.), representatives of EU National Ethics Committees, etc. Invited speakers included scientific experts, ethicists, and representatives of consumer organisations, animal welfare bodies and industry. The speakers were: \u2022 Ms R. Raina (Centre for Policy Research, New Delhi, India) \u2022 Mr K.K. Jensen (University of Copenhagen, DK) \u2022 Mr G. Eberz (Bayer AG, DE) \u2022 Mr W. Gruissem (ETH Zurich and EPSO, CH) \u2022 Mr E. Dr\u00e9sin (FWW Europe) \u2022 Mr E. Millstone (University of Sussex, UK) \u2022 Mr C. Then (consultant for Greenpeace) \u2022 Ms N. Moll (EuropaBio) The round-table was chaired by Professor G\u00f6ran HER- MER\u00c9N , President of the European Group on Ethics in Science and New Technologies, and was opened by Maurizio SALVI , Member of the Bureau of European Policy Advisers (BEPA) and head of the EGE Secretariat, and Gra\u00e7a CARVALHO , Principal Adviser of the Society Group of the Bureau of European Policy Advisers (BEPA). Dr CARVALHO argued that inputs to help design a re- sponsible, ethically sound and sustainable policy for agriculture in the European Union (EU) were of primary importance for the EU\u2019s economic welfare, the role the EU plays in global trade and the social dimension of the EU. She also stated that equality, health, social cohe- sion, solidarity, intergenerational justice, environmen- tal protection, the right to food etc. were all relevant values that could not be ignored in modern agriculture, where innovation had to be balanced against sustain- ability, where globalisation and trade should be linked to ethics and human rights, including the right to food and the Millennium goals. Dr Carvalho also reported on recent initiatives by the Commission to reduce the prices of agricultural products in the EU, the \u2018health check\u2019 of the EU Common Agricultural Policy (CAP), the Commission Communications on food prices, energy, and oil prices, and stressed the fact that the EGE Opin- ion would help ensure a proper reflection on how to promote modern agriculture while respecting EU fun- damental values. Ethics of modern developments in agriculture technologies ",
        "8 Professor G\u00f6ran HERMER\u00c9N underlined the key role played by dialogue, tolerance and pluralism in assess- ing the ethical implications of new technologies in modern agriculture and argued that agriculture could contribute to more and safer food while retaining sus- tainability and food security as its main objectives. He explained that the EGE would address new technolo- gies and methods insofar as they are conducive to the above goals. He also stressed the need to address social implications and societal expectations in seeking real- istic options to propose to the relevant stakeholders in- volved in the revision of the EU\u2019s common agricultural policy (CAP) and the global discussion on trade and sustainability. Following the opening speeches, the invited partici- pants were then encouraged by the Chair to openly ex- press suggestions, concerns and ideas to the EGE. 3. The Round-Table: contributions by speakers Scientific aspects were addressed by Dr G\u00fcnther Eberz ( Innovative Agriculture Helps to Meet Basic Needs of Life ) and Professor Wilhelm Gruissem ( New Technologies and Agriculture for the Future ). Dr Eberz (Bayer AG, DE) reported on the industrial per- spective. He pointed out that there would be 9 billion people by 2020, with a 30% decrease in the land avail- able for food production, and stressed the relevance of sustainability in agro-food production. He underlined that the current increase in food product costs was related to increased fertiliser costs and oil prices, but then pointed to bi otechnology as a potential positive response in order to (1) safeguard and increase yields from a limited land area (crop protection, stress shield, plant breeding and plant biotechnology), (2) adapt resource management (targeted use of crop protec- tion, irrigation technology and fertilisers), (3) support agricultural production under adverse environmental conditions and climate variability (by developing new crop varieties with enhanced tolerance to drought and extreme temperatures, improved plant health and nu- trient uptake). Professor Wilhelm Gruissem reported on new tech- nologies in agriculture. He argued that increased food production was necessary for both developed and developing countries although food security options would need to be addressed mainly in the developing countries because of the lack of arable land for food pro- duction. He stated that while hunger did not particularly affect EU citizens, abstaining from promoting innovative agriculture in the EU would impact on the use of green biotechnology across the world and hence contribute to the current food crisis (800 million people suffering hun- ger in 2008, of which 170 million under 5 years of age). Professor Gruissem also advocated an ethics imperative under which the EU should promote new technologies in agriculture and seek improvements in productivity and quality of food products. He also underlined that the EU was neglecting research on green biotechnology and losing expertise in this sector. Sustainability aspects in developing countries were addressed by Dr Rajeswari Raina ( Modern agricultural technologies \u2014 Ethics, policy choices and the IAASTD find- ings, International Assessment of Agricultural Knowledge, Science and Technology for Development ). Dr Raina (Cen- tre for Policy Research, New Delhi, India) pointed to the unethical nature of hunger, poverty, malnutrition and degradation of the environment. She reported on the recent United Nations\u2019 International Assessment of Ag- ricultural Science and Technology for Development re- garding the impacts of agricultural knowledge, science and technology (AKST). According to this UN report, modern agriculture had mainly focused on technology and generally neglected traditional food systems or so- cio-cultural considerations, thus contributing to the glo- bal food divide. Dr Raina mentioned as an example the current scarcity of water resources and underlined that new technologies (bio-physics, SRI, molecular genetics, nanotechnology) could help alleviate this water crisis, while some uses of biotechnology could improve food security (targeted promotion of MAS and DNA diag- nostics). She also stated that technological media could not be seen apart from socio-cultural dimensions in the countries where they are applied. Dr Raina then called for urgent legal and political responses to the current food crisis. ",
        "9 Professor Karsten Klint Jensen ( Food production and sustainability ) addressed the notion of et hics and sus- tainability and its different uses in agriculture, forestry, fishery and environmental sciences. Professor Jensen (University of Copenhagen, DK) argued that the notion of sustainability had normative uses, but was associated with a degree of empirical uncertainty and could not be seen apart from social considerations (addressing farm- ers\u2019 needs). He underlined that while the notion of sus- tainability initially referred to economic considerations regarding the value of resources (stock-taking), it now incorporated the principle of intergenerational justice and took account of interrelated phenomena such as globalisation, climate change, the technical and socio- economic divide etc. He also argued that the notion of sustainability based on empirical considerations needed to anticipate the link between population variation and productivity \u2014 the availability of usable natural resourc- es. He then pointed to the need to link sustainability to societal expectations. 4. The morning debate Following the presentations and the opening speeches, an open debate was launched. The topics debated in- cluded the following: \u2022 The relevance of green biotechnology (GM crops in particular) for solving the food crisis in developing countries was highlighted by several experts. Some argued that the controversy surrounding the use of Genetically Modified (GM) crops in developing coun- tries did not concern the technology as such but its current technical limits. Others underlined that some GM products seeking better nutritional and produc- tive capacities had led to price rises and detrimental consequences in terms of economic accessibility in the developing countries where they were cultivated. \u2022 Some indicated that hunger had been portrayed as a technological problem requiring technologi- cal solutions while the real issue of food security was poverty and differing levels of access to food. They stated that new technological media in the agro-food sector might increase food availability without doing anything about the food divide, and then called for a proper assessment of socio-cultural features and needs in countries where new green technologies were used. They also underlined that local production systems for small or medium-sized farmers could play a key role in food security in de- veloping countries (in India 86% of Indian farms are minor producers, but account for 70% of the food consumed in the country). \u2022 The role of the EU in the global trade in agricultural products was stressed, as well as the need not to limit the discussion of sustainable agriculture to just the food crisis. \u2022 Several participants underlined that genetically modified plants engineered for developing coun- tries might benefit local food production but were not planted by the local population due to the risk on the global market. Similar considerations were advanced concerning the EU regulation on food products (labelling and traceability) and its conse- quent costs for food producers, as well as IPR issues. It was also mentioned that EU regulations on chemi- cals had led to a 25% reduction in cereal production in the UK. \u2022 The need to enhance the role of NGOs and the rep- resentatives of developing countries in the discus- sion of external activities under the EU\u2019s CAP was stressed. Also advocated was extending the impact assessment of the CAP to include its consequences for global trade. \u2022 Other aspects were also stressed, such as the con- siderable impact of modern agriculture in eroding natural resources (including water) and the ethics of importing food products such as cereals from coun- tries suffering from hunger and malnutrition in or- der to feed farm animals. ",
        "10 5. Contributions by the afternoon speakers Consumer aspects were addressed by Dr Eric Dr\u00e9sin ( Strengthening consumer health through sustainability ). Dr Dr\u00e9sin (FWW Europe) reported on the threats posed by the current agriculture system to public health and the environment. He pointed to the negative consequences of current methods in agro-food production for the health of citizens (antibiotic resistance and obesity) and the use of natural resources (87% of world water consumption being used for food production and nitrate pollution affecting several EU countries). He also reported on the risks of mo- nopoly in the food market, and noted that 40 supermarket companies currently controlled one third of global sales, 10 seed companies accounted for 70% of world sales, 2 ce- real production companies had 75% of the world market and 3 food retail companies handled 80% of the world\u2019s food transport. He called for the CAP to focus on food safety and consumer protection and promote the quality and healthiness of food products, noting the growing role organic food production was acquiring in the EU. Risk assessment and policy making were addressed by Professor Erik Millstone ( Agriculture and environmen- tal protection ). Professor Millstone (University of Sussex, UK) addressed the mechanisms for policy-making on the environment and agriculture, where science plays an important role in addressing the long-term consequences of proposed policy options. He underlined the impossibility of having predictive measures based on scientific assertions for en- vironmental or agricultural policies and called for socio- cultural considerations to play a role in assessing new technologies. Professor Millstone referred to the role played by risk assessment in the decision-making pro- cess and called for a democratic and ethically sound ap- proach to environmental and agricultural policy reform. The ethical implications of industrialised biotechnol- ogy were presented by Ch ristoph Then ( The industrial gene paradigm and its [ethical] implications ). According to Mr Then (consultant for Greenpeace), mod- ern genetics was introducing new genetic models that largely ignore the link between the complexity of living beings and the environment (genomics, proteomics). He argued that the use of biotechnology in the agro-food sector might have detrimental ethical implications, such as (1) disrespect for life, (2) exposure to new risks (some- times of an irreversible nature and which may be over- looked during the risk assessment procedure), (3) the risk of monopolies due to current patent systems. He stressed the need to abandon the gene paradigm based on mech- anistic views, and called for a holistic, more transparent and democratic process in designing policies in the agro- food sector. The industrial perspective was presented by Dr Na th- alie Moll ( Ecologically, environmentally and socially sus- tainable agriculture: the role of GMOs ). Dr Moll (EuropaBio) addressed the complex architecture of the EU\u2019s food and environmental policies. She under- lined the need to increase the productivity of arable land for food production and argued that a sustainable policy in the agro-food field should equally incorporate eco- nomical, social and ecological considerations. Dr Moll ex- plained that the use of agro-biotech crops in the EU had reduced spray pollution by 40% and herbicide-resistant crops had allowed active herbicide ingredients to be cut by 25-33% and CO 2 emissions to be reduced by 1.2 billion kg. She presented data on increased incomes for farmers using GM crops and increased production yields. 6. The general debate Following the afternoon presentation, a debate on sus- tainability and modern agriculture was launched. Issues addressed included the following: \u2022 The need for marketing affordable quality food with proper labelling was stressed by several partici- pants. Individual choice in the consumption of food products was claimed to be a key value that had to be respected. ",
        "11 The video of the round table (English) is available on the EGEWebsite (http://ec.europa.eu/european_group_ethics/index_en.htm). The presentations by the invited experts are enclosed in the conference proceedings. \u2022 Some pointed to the adverse effects of the ban of chemical products (DDT) on the production of food products. Some also said that at global level, the ban on DDT had increased malaria epidemics. \u2022 The need to include users and consumers in the decision-making process was stressed by several participants. The increase in food prices, particularly the costs of raw materials, affected the daily lives of consumers\u2019 and farmers alike and contributed to an increase in economic inequalities rather than facili- tating food security and fair distribution. The need to reduce food waste was also stressed. \u2022 Issues related to IPR (plan variety and GM crops) and the risks of monopolies, including the impact on inno- vation and growth of local economies in developing countries, were raised by several participants. Other participants argued that the moratorium on GM crops led to monopoly on the part of multinationals. \u2022 The role of the precautionary principle in industrial- ised agriculture for the EU\u2019s position on green bio- tech and food production was underlined. \u2022 Promising technologies mentioned during the round table included: mutation reading and mar- ket system breeds, hybrid seed production, ICT, en- zymes, robotics, and nanotechnology. \u2022 Food security policies were recognised as playing an important role in security and migration policies (migration to the EU to escape food crises in other regions of the world). \u2022 Itwasarguedthatsustainabilityinagricultureshould also include innovation and take into account other industrial sectors (e.g. chemicals industry). \u2022 The need to find a balance between the sustainable use of biomass for food production and the produc- tion of biofuels and bioethanol was stressed. Some stated that the second generation of biofuels could play a positive role in the EU\u2019s energy and environ- mental policies. Additional topics raised included: \u2022 The need to promote education and research in the agro-sciences. \u2022 The need to respect animal welfare considerations in animal breeding. \u2022 The need for changes in life style and dietary habits. Some argued that a decrease in meat consumption would have a positive impact on global hunger, en- vironmental protection and animal breeding. \u2022 Nanotechnology, cloning, patenting, contamination and coexistence as issues of major relevance for EU farmers and the revision of the CAP. Other issues of major significance in this revision included afford- ability, availability, and consumer choice (including providing cheap food for those demanding it). \u2022 Biodiversity, the impact of technology, and owner- ship of seeds as major issues that merit proper atten- tion and an ethical approach.

        "18 First of all, on behalf of the EGE I want to extend a warm welcome to all of you. The task of the EGE is to provide advice to the European Commission on ethical aspects of science and new technologies in connection with the preparation and implementation of Community legisla- tion or policies. As many of you know, the EGE is now preparing an opin- ion on ethical aspects of new (and some older) technolo- gies in agriculture which are relevant to \u2014 in the sense of promoting or hindering \u2014 food security and sustain- ability in particular. Ege working methods and the role of round tables We prepare our opinions by having internal working meetings, by inviting experts to hearings, sometimes by commissioning special studies on certain aspects of the background, by public consultations via the web and by round tables such as this one. Round tables are an important part of this process, as they allow NGOs and stakeholders to express their views, which will provide an important input to our work. The round tables also help to establish a dialogue between different stakeholders and to promote transparency. The focus of this round table is on dialogue. We are still in the process of preparing the Opinion, other- wise it would be pointless to have this round table. As you know, our opinions are divided into different parts, including background, concerns and recommendations. The background as to the background, it is essential for us to have correct information about the state of the art, including about what is produced on arable land, where and how, how what is produced is stored and distributed from where, to whom and how, as well as when and where what is distributed is sold (at what prices, with which subsidies, import and export taxes, etc.). In our reports, we also express a number of concerns and put forward suggestions as to how they should be dealt with. Of course, the concerns are relative to underlying values. If the EU, a Member State or an agency wants to avoid or achieve certain things, some current develop- ments may give rise to concerns. If, however, they want to achieve other things, the situation may well be differ- ent. That is why these underlying values and goals have to be made explicit. As you know, the topic is very timely, and the media have reported about international congresses on this theme. We welcome contributions on all aspects of this com- plex problem. But what we hope is that the discussions today will highlight at least the following dimensions of the problem: the goals, the means to achieve the goals, and the regulatory landscape. The goals which are the goals of agriculture? Whose goals are they? Here, we may distinguish between three types of goals. First, there are general overarching goals such as increas- ing life expectancy and the quality of life. Agriculture can contribute to these overarching goals by providing more food, better food, and safer food. These aims illustrate the more specific goals of agriculture. In addition, there are other particular goals, not only for agriculture, such as promoting sustainability and providing food security. These goals, and conflicts over them, are related to how arable land is used and to how what is produced on ara- ble land is stored and distributed. What kind of products is arable land used to produce? We discuss these goals in a European context and setting, but the global dimen- sion is ever-present. In this discussion we need to pay some attention to the relationshipsbetweenthesedifferentkindsofgoals.First of all, the goals have to be clarified. The key terms have to be defined. The choice of definitions, e.g. of \u2018sustain- ability\u2019, is not ethically neutral. Second, conflicts and ten- sions between the various goals have to be identified. Opening by Professor G\u00f6ran Hermer\u00e9n ",
        "19 Arable land is finite. Some of the conflicts have to do with competing uses of arable land. It is used for the production offood,feed,fuel,andfibre(suchascotton).Asyouallknow, competition and a number of other factors have caused ris- ing food prices and difficulties for developing countries. Sustainability and food security are also related to the methods used to achieve the various goals. The methods The next dimension has to do with the methods used to achieve the goals mentioned above. Which methods are used or could be used? Different classifications are possible, but the important point in the present context is whether the methods used help or make it difficult to achieve food security and sustainability \u2014 which, of course, will need to be defined and clarified. The methods used to achieve the goals may be of sev- eral kinds, for example, \u2022 mechanical (use of tractors) \u2022 chemical (use of fertilisers) \u2022 genetic (genetic modification of seeds) \u2022 or may involve the use of information technologies \u2022 others (for example irrigation) \u2022 as well as combinations of these. But we should not forget the importance of the storage and distribution aspects. These problems can be han- dled in different ways, which may have an impact on food security and sustainability. Thus, we do not want to focus exclusively on GM food. From an ethical point of view, it will also be important to raise the question of who has access to these meth- ods, and how their use will affect the structure of farm- ing in the developed and developing world. In other words, we should in our discussions consider not only their technical or biological consequences, but also their social and structural impact on farming in different parts of the world, given present trends and policies (taxes, subsidies, speculation, etc.). Whatever the methods, their uses \u2014 and the conse- quences of their uses \u2014 have thus to be evaluated with an eye in particular to the extent to which they will af- fect food security and sustainability. We may ask \u2014 and here we will listen carefully to your thoughts \u2014 whether adequate methods do or do not exist, whether the exist- ing methods are counter-productive, whether they are or are not enough, or whether there are important negative side-effects of certain methods for food security and sus- tainability, which need to be countered, and if so, how. Regulations A third dimension is the regulatory landscape. It is an im- portant part of the background, with implications also for our concerns and recommendations. Goal-setting and R&Dforagriculturetakeplaceinanenvironmentregulated by national laws, international treaties, trade agreements etc., ranging from EU Directives, GMO bans and patent conventions to Doha rounds and WTO agreements. The regulations impose restrictions on both the goals and the methods. So the regulations need to be identi- fied and discussed. What are they? Are there problems with conflicting regulations, unclear regulations, or part- ly overlapping regulations that have a negative impact on legal certainty, on the possibility to predict what will happen in future court cases? Finally Finally, identifications of actual or potential problems will be welcome, as well as suggestions as to what to do about them. Thank you again for coming and we look forward to listening to your presentations and to the dis- cussions today. ",

        "22 Distinguished Members of the European Group on the Ethics of Science and New Technologies, distinguished colleagues, ladies and gentlemen, thank you for attend- ing this round table organised by Bureau of European Policy Advisers. It is as always a pleasure to see that a dialogue platform bringing together so many relevant and different stake- holders can be established to discuss a so complex and heterogeneous issue as the ethics of modern develop- ments in agriculture technologies. As you all know, sustainable agriculture, food security and globalisation have become core issues in the current political debate in the European Union and beyond. We are experiencing an unprecedented rise in the prices of food and oil, also facilitated by financial speculation, climate change and world population growth, which has affected the global economy and provoked hunger, social instability and inflation in different regions of the world. A phenomenon which seems destined to grow. Today, modern agriculture feeds six billion people. Over the next 50 years, the amount of food will have to double in order to feed the world\u2019s population, which is expected to grow to nine billion. A growth that will put pressure on a range of resources, including land, water, oil, and food supply. Urgent measures to ensure food security and sus- tainability are therefore needed at EU and global level. A few weeks ago, on 5 June 2008, the delegates to the Rome Food Security Summit, 181 nations and more than 40 Heads of State and Government, announced their increased commitment to the fight against hunger and to agricultural development. The financing announced during the Summit included around US$8 billion. The EU is part of this effort. The EU Ministers of Agriculture have decided to double EU development aid by 2015, thus reaching a total amount of \u20ac120 billion of aid per year. But development aid, while being an expression of soli- darity, does not in itself solve the problem of how to ar- rive at a sustainable, ethically sound and innovative de- sign for modern agriculture at EU and global level. The question is then \u2018how to build a modern EU agricul- ture that respects European values while ensuring ef- fective and sustainable growth, within the EU and with third parties?\u2019 The EGE has been asked by President Bar- roso to contribute to a response to such a complex and heterogeneous issue. Ladies and gentlemen, the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) has been a key policy pillar of the European Union since its origins. It was originally conceived to expand production and provide secure food supplies to Euro- peans following the food crisis after the Second World War. Now, after more than 50 years, we have a \u2018new\u2019 food crisis at world level. Higher prices for food and oil have increased EU infla- tion, affecting the daily lives of EU consumers and EU trade. A solution cannot then be postponed. We should remember that agriculture alone occupies around 5% of the EU population and accounts for 20% of average EU household consumer expenditure and a large proportion of the internal trade and exports of the EU. It is therefore not only a key economic sector of the EU, but is also an economic sector with an extremely high social and political importance. Inputs to help design a responsible, ethically sound and sustainable policy for EU agriculture are therefore of pri- mary importance for the EU\u2019s economic welfare, the role the EU plays in global trade and the social dimension of the EU. Equality, health, social cohesion, solidarity, inter- generational justice, environmental protection, the right to food, etc. are all relevant values that cannot be ignored in modern agriculture in the EU, where innovation should be balanced against sustainability, where globalisation and trade should be linked to ethics and human rights, including the right to food and the Millennium goals. But the complexity of the issue discussed today points to an intrinsic difficulty in finding unequivocal and com- prehensive solutions for bringing about a sustainable, safe and equitable industrial agriculture. Dialogue and pluralism are therefore the key to identifying the best options to put forward on the EU policy agenda. Opening by Maria Da Gra\u00e7a Carvalho ",
        "23 Ladies and gentlemen, in 2007 the EU adopted specific short-term measures to reduce the prices of agricultural products in the EU, such as increasing the volume of ar- able land by abolishing mandatory set-aside, increasing milk production quotas for 2008, reducing buffer stocks and export refunds, and suspending import duties on almost all cereals. In the current \u2018health check\u2019 of the EU common agricul- tural policy, the options being considered include: abol- ishing the set-aside requirement, gradually abolishing milk quotas by 2015, adjusting market price aid in the cereal sector, and making the transition from support for energy plants to more effective solutions to bolster the bio-energy sector \u2014 without, however, adversely impacting on the production of foodstuffs and feeding- stuffs \u2014 including the production of second-generation biofuels. In addition, the Commission has recently adopted Com- munications on food prices, energy, and oil prices. It is therefore trying to pro-actively address the complexity of the issues discussed here. Now we need inputs on em- bedding ethics within modern agriculture technologies and arguments to consider for the forthcoming reform of the CAP. The EGE is not being asked to look at the political con- siderations behind the reform of the CAP, which is not its role or remit. But the Opinion and today\u2019s platform debate will certainly help ensure a proper reflection on how to promote modern agriculture while respecting fundamental EU values. Thank you for your patience. ",

Ethics of modern developments in agriculture technologies ",
        "26 Introducing the IAASTD A normative ethical position has driven the international assessment of agricultural science and technology for development (IAASTD). Hunger, poverty and environ- mental degradation are unethical \u2014 they ought to end. What the IAASTD gives in answer to this ethical posi- tion is a set of findings. Agricultural knowledge, sci- ence and technology (AKST) can reduce hunger and poverty, as well as help in the conservation of natural resources and wider environmental systems, if current systems of knowledge generation, access to and af- fordability of knowledge and technology, and utilisa- tion patterns change. The translation of a normative ethical position into a process of assessment makes the IAASTD a unique process. During 2003, eleven consultations were held under the aegis of an international multi-stakeholder steering committee, involving over 800 participants from all relevant stakeholder groups, e.g. govern- ments, the private sector and civil society. Based on these consultations, the steering committee recom- mended to an intergovernmental plenary meeting in Nairobi \u2014 September 2004 \u2014 that an international as- sessment of the role of AKST in reducing hunger and poverty, improving rural livelihoods and facilitating environmentally, socially and economically sustainable development was needed. The concept of an IAASTD was endorsed as a multi-thematic, multi-spatial, multi- temporal inter-governmental process with a multi- stakeholder bureau, and was co-sponsored by the FAO (UN), the GEF, UNEP, UNDP, UNESCO, the World Bank, the EU, and the WHO, as well as some developed coun- tries. Over 400 authors were selected \u2014 each one ap- proved by the Bureau \u2014 and worked over 2005-2008, giving their time to the assessment. I make this presentation to the European Group on Eth- ics as one among 400 authors who have willingly given their time and energy to this process, millions who have faith in science and human ingenuity, and billions of citi- zens whose governments endorsed, approved and ac- cepted the IAASTD reports. (IAASTDGlobalReport,fivesub-globalreportsandIAASTD Synthesis Report \u2014 please see www.agassessment.org for further details) Ethics and IAASTD findings The goals of the IAASTD were (see slide 2) different from those of other (domestic and international) assessments of agricultural S&T that we as decision-makers and aca- demics have been involved with. For instance, the as- sessment was not about the impact of natural resource management on groundwater or soil erosion, or of ge- netic engineering on pest incidence in corn or soya, nor about the impact of trade on agricultural GDP or farm in- comes. It had to consider empirical evidence relevant to its goals: inter-temporal, inter- and multi-sectoral, multi- spatial, and multi-cultural evidence. The IAASTD merely presents findings against goals guided by normative ethics. For us today, it is impor- tant to underscore the implications of these findings for policy making \u2014 for ethically informed choices in the practice of and policies for modern science and technologies in agriculture. We must note that it would have been an ethical choice many centuries ago for a Roman senator not to own slaves, several decades ago for an American cotton farm- er not to own black people as part of his farm (labour) inputs, and, till recently, for an Indian family farm not to use bonded labour or employ children in their farms. The might of the Roman empire across continents, the pro- ductivity of American cotton or the success of the green revolution were not sufficient justification to legitimise the suffering of slaves or children \u2014 those affected by the duties of the senators or farmers to their states and fami- lies. Civil wars, social movements and informed choices have led to appropriate institutions (laws, rules, norms, habits and behavioural changes) making these unethi- cal practices formally illegal. (Historically, the growth of knowledge \u2014 in both the natural and social sciences \u2014 has gained tremendously from these institutional changes and ethical choices.) Agriculture now awaits similar ethical choices that will lead to appropriate insti- Modern agricultural technologies \u2013 Ethics, policy choices and the IAASTD findings Rajeswari S. RAINA ",
        "27 tutions and knowledge systems. Currently, it is an ethical choice for millions of consumers, producers and policy- makers not to use modern science and technology that does not reduce hunger and poverty and adds to envi- ronmental degradation. The IAASTD findings are summarised in a brief presenta- tion made at the global press launch (also in www.agas- sessment.org) \u2014 given as ha ndouts today. The findings highlight that social and economic inequity as well as environmental quality is worsened by the in- appropriate and undemocratic choice of technology and institutional arrangements (like property rights, trade rules, banking practices, etc.) that maynotbeappropriate for local contexts and are likely to worsen (given the risks) the economic and (given the uncertainties) environmen- tal conditions of those affected by these technologies. Policy decisions and technology choices Let us take a look at two controversial modern S&T issues that the IAASTD confronted \u2014 water and biotechnology. Water \u2014 based on the empirical evidence of increasing water withdrawal (from surface and groundwater sourc- es) for irrigated agriculture, the continuing pollution (and eutrophication) of water sources and the demand for water to produce to feed increasing populations, the IAASTD presents a balanced assessment of the current water crisis in agriculture and multifunctional perspec- tives on water, agriculture, the environment, trade and overall economic activities. The reports, despite a wide difference in regional contexts, \u2022 Emphasise the need for new paradigms in AKST to understand and utilise natural resources (especially water) for socially and environmentally sustainable development. Holistic systems approaches, agro- ecological sciences, and capabilities within S&T for working across multiple scales and different social and physical systems are necessary, but are cur- rently inadequately supported. AKST investment in dryland agriculture and crop-livestock systems is highly inadequate and follows the limited green revolution paradigm. \u2022 Present empirical evidence, in all the five sub-global reports, pointing to unsustainable production tech- nologies and associated water use practices \u2014 a second green revolution especially in Africa will be unsustainable. What is needed is a real green revo- lution based on the holistic integration of natural resource management with other systems of pro- duction technologies, markets and local govern- ance. The ESAP, NAE and CWANA reports highlight the need for the appropriate pricing of water, and institutional support for the use of modern resource conservation technologies. \u2022 Present evidence of rural infrastructure and other complementary investments that enable access to and utilisation of water within localised ecosystems. There is a need for modern science (for instance, molecular biology and genetics) to understand stress and stress response, as well as indigenous and traditional conservation practices. \u2022 Highlighttheimpactofcurrentcrop-waterandcrop- livestock use patterns on increasingly economically unviable and unsustainable farming, local adaptive responses and management systems in small-scale farming, increasing inequality, and the responses necessary to help mitigate and adapt to water stress (floods and droughts, increasing temperature win- dows for crops, etc.) climate change. Biotechnology \u2014 drawing upon the definition in the Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety \u2014 involves a wide ran- ge of technologies. There are several discussions about conventional vs modern biotechnology. The IAASTD notes that modern biotechnologies used in containment (enzymes, DNA diagnostics, etc.) are wide- ly accepted. The application of modern biotechnology outside containment \u2014 for instance GM crops \u2014 is con- tentious. Evidence is often controversial, and selectively used \u2014 by industry, public sector R&D organisations, ",
        "28 and NGOs \u2014 each with their own stakes in mind. The IAASTD presents a balanced view given its goals. It \u2022 Emphasises the need for more and better targeted investment in biotechnology. For example, marker- aided selection (MAS) in plant breeding, platform technologies, DNA diagnostics or chips for the screening of planting material, nanotechnology for targeted input delivery or pathogen elimination, etc. etc. \u2022 Highlights the rapid pace of change in biotechnol- ogy \u2014 assessments lag behind development and application. There is a need for more transparent and non-anecdotal (whether from poor farmers, public sector scientists or industry) communication on the benefits and the costs, risks and uncertain- ties that cut across systems within agriculture and across different sectors (health, rural infrastructure, environment, etc.). Transgenics do not contribute to addressing the IAASTD goals. \u2022 Discusses the ways in which the institutions (IPRs, seed laws, trade restrictions or globalisation) that control living material and processes that trans- form living material into commercially appropriable products and processes lead to negative (and highly skewed) impacts on basic science, personnel or hu- man resources in agricultural science, the exchange ofandaccesstoseed/geneticmaterial,andthecapac- ities of people (especially small farms) to choose ap- propriate technologies, crops and cropping systems, and ultimately of governments to comprehend and intervene in the scientific, economic, environmental and social aspects of agricultural production. \u2022 Highlights how modern biotechnology can be ef- fectively integrated with and make contributions to participatory plant breeding, agro-ecology, re- source-poor drylands and coastal ecosystems, etc. Most importantly, the agricultural and allied-sector applications of modern biotechnology \u2014 in food processing, leather and other animal products- based industries, and other manufacturing activities is crucial for rural employment and incomes in many developing countries. Fundamental knowledge of biological components and systems where the tools/processes of biotechnology are useful will be- come increasingly important in order to understand climate change impacts and responses. Ethical positions For decision-makers, the IAASTD offers a set of norma- tive principles providing a basis for taking decisions on modern science and technology. The utilitarian approach (embodied in neo-classical economics and its evaluation methods) is not sufficient to make decisions about mod- ern S&T in agriculture, when there is empirical evidence that millions of rural poor and soil, water and forest sys- tems are adversely affected by certain modern technolo- gies. Power relationships are crucial. They have to be understood as ethical or moral issues in modern S&T \u2014 the ways in which the scientifically and technologically well-endowed exert power over the millions who have no power to choose, control, monitor or assess the tech- nologies and information systems that determine what they cultivate, eat, sell or exchange (on unequal playing fields). At the very least, it is imperative to ensure that modern technologies do not destroy (or have the poten- tial to destroy) other knowledge systems that modern S&T has not bothered to study or engage with. Finally, it is important that decision-makers see the IAASTD as a beginning. It builds on and adds value to a number of recent assessments and reports that have provided valuable information relevant to the agricul- tural sector, but have not specifically focused on the future role of AKST, the institutional dimensions and the multifunctionality of agriculture. These include: the FAO\u2019s State of Food Insecurity in the World (yearly); the InterAcademy Council Report: Realising the Promise and Potential of African Agriculture (2004); the UN Millen- nium Project Task Force on Hunger (2005); the Millen- nium Ecosystem Assessment (2005); the CGIAR Science Council Strategy and Priority Setting Exercise (2006); the Comprehensive Assessment of Water Management in Agriculture: Guiding Policy Investments in Water, Food, Livelihoods and Environment (2007); the Intergovern- ",
        "29 mental Panel on Climate Change Reports (2001 and 2007); the UNEP Fourth Global Environmental Outlook (2007); the World Bank\u2019s World Development Report: Agriculture for Development (2007); the IFPRI Global Hunger Indices (yearly); and the World Bank\u2019s Internal Report of Investments in SSA (2007). There are public sector research organisations, public sector and private sector industry, civil society, the si- lent poor and their (equally disenfranchised) ecosys- tems, each with their own stakes \u2014 all equally deeply entrenched and difficult to change. The IAASTD puts forward findings that demand changes in all these ac- tors \u2014 the silent ecosystems and the poor who (scien- tific evidence points out) will be the worst affected by current systems of agricultural production, trade and de- velopment. Modern science and technology forms part of other informed choices that decision-makers have to confront, IF HUNGER, POVERTY AND ENVIRONMENTAL DEGRADATION ARE UNETHICAL. ",

        "40 The widely used concept of su stainability is seldom pre- cisely defined, and its clarification involves making up one\u2019s mind about a range of difficult questions. One line of research ( bottom-up ) takes sustaining a system over time as its starting point and then infers prescriptions from this requirement. Another line ( top-down ) takes as its starting point an economic interpretation of the Brundtland Commission\u2019s suggestion that the present generation\u2019s need-satisfaction should not compromise the need-satisfaction of future generations. It then measures sustainability at the level of society and infers prescriptions from this requirement. These two approaches may conflict, and in this conflict the top-down approach has the upper hand, ethically speaking. However, the implicit goal in the top-down approach of justice between generations needs to be refined in several dimensions. But even given a clari- fied ethical goal, disagreements can arise. At present we do not know what substitutions will be possible in the future. This uncertainty clearly affects the prescrip- tions that follow from the measure of sustainability. Consequently, decisions about how to make future ag- riculture sustainable are decisions under uncertainty. There might be different judgments on likelihoods; but even given some set of probabilities, there might be disagreement on the right level of precaution in face of the uncertainty. Keywords: Empirical Uncertainty, Goals and Means, Value Judgments Introduction \u2018Sustainability\u2019 has become a notorious buzz-word, re- ferring to something undeniably good. No-one defends unsustainable development or unsustainable activities, just like no-one would call their position \u2018undemocrat- ic\u2019. However, the almost universal acceptance of the claim that development should be sustainable comes at a cost, namely that the concept has become almost empty. Different policy-makers appear to interpret the concept each in their own way, always keen to reaffirm the sustainability of their policy, regardless of its con- tent. But this means that it is very unclear what exactly the practical implications of sustainability are. Hence, there is a need to clarify the concept. However, any clarification will also make the concept more controversial. And of course, more than one clarification is possible. The differences between conflicting interpretations of \u2018sustain- ability\u2019 will uncover disagreements about value judgments as well as about empirical issues. This paper attempts to map the logic of some of the important disagreements. The concept of sustainability Thefirststepistorecognisethatsustainabilityisanorma- tive concept. Sustainability is a valuable state \u2014 a goal we should strive to realise. This means, firstly, that the only way to make the concept more precise is through reflection on what is valuable about sustainability and how this value relates to other important values. And secondly, analysis of the practical implications of sustain- ability presupposes that the concept has been clarified. It only makes sense to determine the necessary means to achieve a goal when the goal has been specified. Considerations as to the sustainability of activities date back to the late 19 th century, where the question rose within forestry how to determine the maximum cut that could be sustained in the long term; later, similar consid- erations were developed within fisheries, and eventually they spread to many other areas. The underlying princi- ple was the constraint that the resource stock in ques- tion should be kept constant over time, and the simple prescription was to keep the harvest rate per year within some area smaller than or equal to the natural regenera- tion rate per year for the resource within the area. This is all right as far as it goes, but unfortunately it does not go very far. One line of research views a farm as a sys- tem engaged in exchange with its surroundings. If the farm is to sustain its production over time, keeping the resource stock constant over time is not likely to be suf- ficient. Roughly, the farm also needs to be sustainable in a social sense.

This way of enhancing the concept of sustainability corresponds roughly to what Paul Thompson has dubbed \u2018sustainability as func- tional integrity\u2019 (Thompson, 1997). Another line of research originates in economics. From an economic point of view, the prescription to keep the resource stock constant over time leaves many questions unanswered. For one thing, many resources are non-re- newable. If they are to be used at all, it is by definition impossible to keep the stock constant over time. Econo- mists suggest answers along two lines (e.g. Solow, 1974; Hartwick, 1977). Firstly, a reduced stock of exhaustible re- sources can be compensated for by an increase in renew- able resources. This strategy assumes that substitution between different types of capital is possible. Secondly, through technological development it may become possible to achieve increasing efficiency in the use of re- sources and hence possible to sustain a constant level of welfare with a reduced stock of exhaustible resources. The economic analyses move from the simple prescrip- tion of keeping a single renewable natural resource stock constant to the more general prescription of keeping the welfare level at least non-decreasing. This is inspired by Brundtland(WorldCommission,1987),whodefinedasus- tainable development as a development that \u2018meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs\u2019. Economists prefer to analyse this in terms of welfare rather than need satisfaction. The important point is, however, that if we are going to take substitution and technological devel- opment into account in order to make more general pre- scriptions, it is necessary to look at the value of resources, i.e. their potential to generate welfare or satisfy needs, rather than simply the stock. It is implicit in this move that \u2018sustainability\u2019 no longer can be applied to a single activity in isolation, such as a single farm or even farming; rather, we have to judge whether society at large and its development is sustain- able. Hence, I find it reasonable to dub this approach a top-down approach , because it starts by determining sustainability at the level of society, and then infers pre- scriptions for a single activity, given some technologi- cal stage. On the other hand, the systems approach is a bottom-up approach , because it starts out by inferring prescriptions for a single activity, and then reaches pre- scriptions for society at large by putting together the prescriptions for all relevant activities. Discussion and conclusions If the bottom-up approach is based on the implicit premise, as it often is, that the system in question should be sustained perpetually, or at least as long as the time horizon reaches, it may be in conflict with the top-down approach. The latter has, among other things, the impli- cation that an activity that at some time can be part of a sustainable society does not necessarily need to be part of it at a later time; for instance, because technological development may have made it superfluous or just too costly to maintain. From an ethical point of view, it is clearly the top-down approach that has the upper hand: whereas the claim that the level of welfare should not de- crease over time has great ethical weight, the claim that some isolated system, e.g. a farming practice, should be sustained over time has no ethical weight (although the farmer\u2019s welfare of course should count). If we take a closer look at the ethical value implicit in the top-down approach, it seems clear that the objective is justice within and between generations. However, this objective needs refinement. One problem is whether the requirement of non-decreasing welfare over time repre- sents a too rigid form of equality between generations. Another, more important, problem concerns the issue of increasing population. The economic analyses referred to above assume a constant population over time. But if the population grows over time, as it is likely to do, and we understand sustainability as the requirement that the welfare level per capita should not decrease over time, this of course results in more stringent requirements for sustainability. As it happens, population ethics is riddled with problems, and no-one has so far been able to arrive at a reasonable concept of justice between generations with variable population sizes (Parfit, 1984). I shall have to leave this problem aside in the present context. ",
        "42 Given some clarified notion of justice, prescriptions for sustainability will depend on the rate of population growth, the rate of increased efficiency in the use of re- sources and the possible substitutions between types of resources. These are empirical questions, but at present we do not know for certain what the answers to them are. The economic discussion has uncovered disagree- ments about the likelihoods. We can roughly summarise this debate in the following table, where the strategies derived from the main rival assumptions about possible substitutions are listed as acts together with a rough de- scription of the consequences if each of these assump- tions are true: Table 1: Strategies in the face of uncertainty about substitution States Acts Unrestricted substitution Restricted substitution Natural resources cannot be substituted Keep total stock of resources constant Constant level of welfare Considerable reduction of welfare Ecological catastrophe Keep total constant & preserve critical resources Reduction of welfare Constant level of welfare Ecological catastrophe Keep stock of natural resources constant Extreme reduction of welfare Considerable reduction of welfare Constant level of welfare ",

Hence, there is an empirical disagreement about how to judge the likelihood of the different possibilities for substitution. But even given agreement about the like- lihoods, there might be disagreement about the right strategy in dealing with this kind of uncertainty about the future. A strongly precautionary approach would choose the act with the best worst outcome (i.e. the most stringent). A weaker type of precaution would consider the degree of likelihood and the seriousness consequences and then seek to balance the degree of precaution against its costs. Given the indeterminateness of the top-down approach and the uncertainty of its implications, we might want to turn to the bottom-up approach. It should not just be concerned with the expectation of present stakeholders, but should try to determine the implications of the gen- eral requirements of justice and sustainability. Hence, it too cannot avoid dealing with uncertainty, but still it might be easier to derive practical implications from it. ",

        "52 The continuous growth of the world\u2019s population and changing consumption patterns, particularly the in- creasing consumption of food and changes in dietary requirements with far greater demand for meat and higher-quality food, are leading to a growing need for agricultural productivity. At the same time, available farm land is limited and climate change is likely to affect crop production systems. Efforts to protect the climate and concerns about security of supply with fossil re- sources are also stimulating endeavours to exploit new energy sources such as biomass as a renewable resource for the generation of energy. There can be no doubt that the need to safeguard an ad- equate supply of food for a global population that contin- ues to grow strongly is one of the most important ethical questions of our time. We need only to look at population growth and the amount of agricultural land per capita to realise the extent of the problem. Forecasts published by the United Nations show that agricultural land is likely to remain at approximately 1.5 billion hectares worldwide, which means that the amount of land available per capita will diminish to just 0.16 hectares by 2050. In other words, the land available to feed one person in 1950 will have to serve more than three persons in 2050. Producing food or non-food crops for an ever-growing and more demanding world population is a lasting global challenge. Since plants are continuously exposed to \u2018bi- otic\u2019 and \u2018abiotic\u2019 factors that negatively influence growth and agricultural yields, it is of vital importance to protect plants from these environmental stress factors. Biotic fac- tors include attack by insects, fungi, weeds, bacteria or viruses, which can be controlled by crop protection prod- ucts. Without crop protection almost half of the current harvests would be lost. Yields could be further increased by more than 40% by preventing the actual losses of ag- ricultural productivity due to biotic factors. Abiotic stress includes factors such as drought, heat, cold and soil sa- linity, which in many parts of the earth cause dramatic yield losses. These abiotic stresses can reduce the optimal achievable yield of crop plants by up to 80%. The develop- ment of new crops with better resistance to the stresses caused by drought and extremes of temperature will play an enormously important role in this context. Media reporting in recent months about acute short- ages of agricultural raw materials, the growing demand for plant sources of energy, and rising commodity pric- es have clearly demonstrated the intensive attention now focusing on what is happening in agriculture. The reasons behind the recent increase in food prices are diverse: beside the long-term demand trends of a con- tinuously growing world population, growing wealth and changes in consumer habits, the constant increase in mineral oil prices has made farmers\u2019 production con- siderably more expensive. Oil prices have an impact, for example, on the operation of agricultural machinery, the transport of production materials and harvests, and air-conditioned storage facilities. In addition, the use of artificial fertilisers, the manufacture of which is energy- intensive, makes a significant contribution to the rising cost of production. Machinery and energy factors make up approximately 60% of the overall production costs of wheat growing in Europe. By way of comparison: only six percent is spent on seeds and eight percent on crop protection agents. Furthermore, in the past two years in particular other factors have also had an impact on pric- ing, including weather-related harvest losses, for exam- ple due to the worst drought for a century in Australia, as well as the additional demand for biofuels. Given the current trends in agricultural markets, we must also expect the level of food prices to remain compara- tively high over the coming years. This will have a partic- ular impact on emerging markets and developing coun- tries, and the international community must react. Export restrictions, on the other hand, are counter-productive, as they only further curb supply. Political approaches for the future should rather be aimed at strengthening sup- ply in a sustained fashion. We must therefore promote international trade by dispensing with unnecessary sub- sidies and export and market restrictions, and encourage the cultivation of crops in those countries that offer the most efficient production conditions for these crops. Against the background of globally limited resources for agricultural production, it is vital that we encourage the long-term supply of agricultural raw materials. For this, we need a new green revolution: we need to invest more heavily in research, technology and the agricultural infra- Innovative agriculture to meet basic needs of life G\u00fcnther EBERZ ",

        "62 The world is going through unprecedented changes. While life expectancy has vastly increased in Europe and the United States, many developing countries continue to experience large population growth with stagnating or even decreasing agricultural production. The benefits of the agricultural \u2018Green Revolution\u2019 that supported population growth have given way to crop shortages, rising costs for staple foods, and shifting economic in- terests in the utilisation of agricultural crops. The current debate on meeting the challenges of an impending hun- ger crisis is merely symptomatic of the need to develop and deploy innovative technologies for sustainable agri- culture and food production that can support a growing human population. Europe is at the centre of a controversy about the ac- ceptance of new agricultural technologies that have dramatic impacts on developing countries. The backlash in Europe against the introduction of genetically modi- fied crops is fuelled by heavily subsidised agricultural production, a tariff system that favours food exports but discourages imports, and a romanticised view of agricul- ture and food production that largely ignores global re- alities and problems. At the same time, organic farming is promoted as a form of sustainable agriculture despite the fact that this will inevitably have a greater impact on the environment while reducing feed and food produc- tion. Because of the raging controversy in Europe and the failure of the European Commission to deal deci- sively with the adoption of novel agricultural crop and production systems, many developing countries are forgoing the development and deployment of promis- ing new agricultural technologies. These countries, and especially African countries, are concerned that the Eu- ropean feed and food market may not be accessible to them if they produce novel and improved crops, includ- ing genetically modified crops, which are rejected by the European consumer. Can Europe afford to be a bystander as a global food crisis is unfolding? Is it ethical for Europeans to ignore scientific facts in favour of promoting agricultural pro- duction systems that cannot contribute to reducing glo- bal hunger? Is it ethical for Europe to heavily subsidise its own agricultural production systems with the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) while discouraging developing countries from adopting novel crops, including geneti- cally modified crops, that could significantly improve their own agricultural production? Instead of marginal- ising plant research and development, should Europe not be at the forefront of global crop improvement and agricultural innovation to meet future challenges in feed and food production? These questions and their ethical implications must be considered if Europe wants to lead the world in build- ing a knowledge-based bio-economy. Predictions show that conventional agriculture as we practice it today will be insufficient to meet tomorrow\u2019s demands for food and feed. At least a two-fold increase in agricultural yields will be needed in the coming decades, especially in developing countries, if we want to have a signifi- cant impact in reducing the number of people that go hungry every day. This increase in agricultural yields must be achieved in ecologically sustainable ways. As much as we need to embrace the general principles of sustainable agriculture that are the pillars of organic farming, we must also deploy agricultural biotechnol- ogy as an important pillar of Europe\u2019s economy. Only by merging organic farming principles with innovative crop biotechnology will Europe be able to develop the new agricultural production systems indispensable to sustainable economic growth, employment, energy supply and maintenance of the standard of living. Bio- technology is expected to help meet the most urgent global challenges and reduce the threat of future con- flicts resulting from limited arable land for food versus non-food crop production. It is an ethical imperative for European political leaders to inform the public in an open and transparent way, based on well-established scientific facts, of the oppor- tunities \u2014 and the risks \u2014 of using biotechnology in agricultural crop production. Political leaders, together with scientists, farmers, NGO experts and opinion lead- ers, are essential to building public trust. Only if Euro- peans embrace biotechnology and innovative and ge- netically modified crops in combination with organic farming principles to support their future agriculture will this send positive signals to developing countries.

Europe is being economically challenged, and the ethi- cal considerations associated with new technologies in agriculture today and for the future are clearly defined. Only by developing ethically responsible policies and by achieving public acceptance can Europe deploy new technologies to sustain agriculture for the future in or- der to avert an impending hunger crisis and contribute to European and global economic growth.

        "70 The rapid intensification and globalisation of our food production and distribution systems has had severe negative impacts on farmers, public health and the envi- ronment. These problems demand that sustainability be placed at the centre of future agriculture policy in the EU and worldwide. They also demand that traditional defi- nitions of \u2018food safety\u2019 and \u2018consumer protection\u2019 be ex- panded to include social, environmental, economic and planetary health. Food can no longer be called \u2018safe\u2019 and \u2018healthy\u2019 unless it is safe and healthy for all people \u2014 not just those who grow and eat it. It must be safe for the entire planet and people everywhere. Many questionable technologies pose threats to food safety and public health. Mass production of livestock has led to: Mad Cow Disease and other animal illnesses; massive recalls of unsafe meat \u2014 such as the record 143 million pound beef recall in California in February; hu- man health problems; water, air and soil pollution; and widespread mistreatment of farm animals. The overuse of pesticides, first brought to public attention by Rachel Carson\u2019s book Silent Spring in 1962, has had many nega- tive human and environmental effects. Artificial food additives have been linked to emotional problems in children, leading the EP\u2019s Environment Committee to vote last month to ban food sweeteners and colourings aimed at children. Genetically modified organisms pose health and environmental risks, as well as threats to food sovereignty, particularly in developing nations. Industrialised livestock production is a principal cause of growing antibiotic resistance in food-borne bacteria. Much of the rise in obesity and obesity-related illnesses throughout the world can be attributed to industrialised diets. Childhood disorders linked to industrialised food include obesity, high blood pressure, early signs of heart disease and attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder. The globalisation of the Western-style, fast-food diet has been especially harmful to indigenous populations, such as the Oodham Indians in the southwest US. Industrialised diets cause people to eat higher on the marketing chain, weakening consumer sovereignty and increasing the food industry\u2019s manipulation of tastes and desires. Diverse di- ets can buffer against the ill-effects of poor nutrition. Intensively produced and globalised food poses many threats to the environment. Farming, which depends heavily on fossil fuels for energy, fertiliser and other inputs, generates 9% of the EU\u2019s greenhouse gas emis- sions. National governments should tax rather than sub- sidise fossil fuel development, and a \u2018CO2\u2019 label should be developed to inform consumers of a food item\u2019s car- bon footprint. Runoff from intensive crop and livestock operations has created nitrate pollution problems in many EU Member States. Intensive food production also contributes to water scarcity. Irrigation accounts for 87% of global water consumption and 69% of global with- drawals. Poor farming practices have turned the steppes and plateaus of northwestern China into a dust bowl, sweeping dust all the way to North America. Intensive, globalised food is a threat to farmers and farming economies. Today, farming is the world\u2019s poor- est, hungriest occupation. The farmers\u2019 share of the con- sumer food dollar has shrunken dramatically. In the US, it fell from 40 to 7 cents from 1910 to 1997. Wheat farmers there get 6 cents per loaf of bread \u2014 the same as what the wrapper costs. The number of farms in the EU fell from 7 million to 6.2 million from 1997 to 2005 \u2014 with farms of less than 50 hectares accounting for all losses. The US now has more full-time prisoners than full-time farmers. The future does not look promising, as only 8% of EU farmers are under 35, while more than half are near retirement. Despite this problem, the CAP lacks a dedi- cated funding source for young and first-time farmers. The loss of farmers is transferring food quality control to distant corporations that extract maximum output at minimum cost. Intensification and globalisation have been fuelled by agri-food consolidation. The international food trade has quadrupled since 1961. The top 30 supermarket companies now control one-third of global sales; the top 10 seed companies control one-third of the global mar- ket; and two companies \u2014 Archer Daniels Midland and Cargill \u2014 control 75% of the world cereal market. Non-local food is a threat to sustainability. American eco- logical economist Herman Daly said: \u2018Americans import Danish sugar cookies and Danes import American sugar Strengthening consumer health through sustainability Eric Dr\u00e9sin ",
        "71 cookies. Exchanging recipes would surely be more effi- cient.\u2019 Imported ingredients for the traditional UK Sunday dinner release 650 times more carbon than local ingre- dients. Pigs raised by US-based multinational Smithfield Foods are nearly identical genetically and are raised un- der nearly identical conditions. Tropicana sources its ap- ple juice concentrate from at least 10 countries. As an alternative to intensive, globalised food produc- tion and distribution, sustainability and local production can serve as promoters and protectors of safe food, pub- lic health, farming communities, the environment, food sovereignty and animal welfare. Local food initiatives are forming throughout the world. In Hawaii, where cows are routinely shipped 3 500 kilo- metres to California and the packaged meat is shipped back, ranching families are uniting to raise their cattle on former pineapple plantations. Belo Horizonte, Brazil, be- came the world\u2019s first city to make food security a right, providing four meals a day to all students and providing local produce at low, fixed prices. The county of Devon in England informs farmers of new crops and process- ing techniques, sets up farmers\u2019 markets and provides grants to local food businesses. The Gothenburg Strategy states that the CAP should reward quality rather than quantity by encouraging or- ganic and other environmentally friendly farming meth- ods. The FAO states that organic agriculture can alleviate world hunger, support the environment, improve public health, ease global warming and strengthen local econ- omies. Organic farming also has a strategic role in devel- oping rural communities. Today, 6.1 million hectares, or 4.1%, of European farmland is under organic production \u2014 with Austria leading with 11%. The EU\u2019s organic food market is growing by 30% a year. Sustainable regional brands such as Label Rouge Poultry in France promote environmentally friendly production as well as local farming communities and geographic identity. Label Rouge establishes regional producer alliances that market branded products under a com- mon label. All chickens are free-range, slow-growing birds from rustic stock that are fed no animal products or growth stimulants. Label Rouge has captured 30% of the French market. Serving wholesome school meals is a rapidly emerging strategy to improve public health and support local pro- duction. Italy requires organic, local food to be served in public schools. In Ross School in New York, all meals are made from scratch with local, in-season ingredients. The meals contain less fat, sugar and salt, and more fibre and antioxidants. A Harvard University study has revealed fewer pesticides in the bodies of children compared to the general population. In Santa Monica, California, salad bars have lowered fat and cholesterol intake while improving pupil behaviour. To help the plight of farmers, the International Federa- tion of Agricultural Producers released \u2018The World Farm- ers\u2019 Charter\u2019 in 2006. Among the Charter\u2019s key planks: \u2022 Family farmers are the basic elements of sustainable agriculture, have a key role in strengthening demo- cratic processes, and are equally entitled to all legal rights and forms of social protection. \u2022 Governments have a key role in ensuring reasonable living standards for farmers. \u2022 Rural communities should be sustained for the ben- efit of all people, and \u2022 International trade rules should balance exporters with importers, and developed with developing countries. We need new definitions and new thinking in order to build a new future. The Gothenburg and Lisbon Strat- egies state that strong economic performance must go hand in hand with sustainability, and that the CAP should emphasise healthy products, environmentally sustainable production, renewable raw materials and biodiversity protection. Because technologies such as intensive livestock production and genetic engineer- ing threaten the health of the planet, they threaten the health of people everywhere. Accordingly, the definition of \u2018food safety\u2019 and \u2018consumer health\u2019 must be expanded ",
        "72 far beyond the context of the individual. Food must be safe for the entire planet and people everywhere \u2014 not just for those who grow and eat it. We must also change the definition of \u2018consumer.\u2019 A \u2018consumer\u2019 is said to be someone who makes food purchasing decisions based on taste, cost and convenience \u2014 which, not coinci- dentally, are the same factors that drive intensification and globalisation. But this is not how growing numbers of people make their decisions. People want to know if their food is good for the environment, farmers and animals. We need to turn consumers back into people who make their food decisions not as customers of agri- businesses, but as members of a global community. As the Gothenburg and Lisbon Strategies very rightly state, the time has come to place sustainability at the centre of our food production systems. Doing so will improve the health of people, the environment, farming communi- ties and animals everywhere. ",

        "82 A great deal of agriculture, in both industrialised and developing countries, is unsustainable in numerous dimensions: \u2022 soils \u2014 impoverished and/or lost \u2022 energy costs \u2014 high and rising \u2022 pesticides, fertiliser, pharmaceuticals \u2014 escalating treadmills \u2022 employment \u2014 innovation is labour-displacing not recruiting. As R\u00f6ling and Jiggins have argued: \u2018Agriculture\u2026is a ma- jor source of the gaseous emissions implicated in global warming, the largest user of potable fresh water, a lead- ing contributor to pollution, a source of actual and po- tential pandemics, and land clearance for agriculture is a major cause of loss of habitat and biodiversity.\u2019 1 Those challenges are aggravated by an agenda of market liber- alisation \u2014 without interventions to provide floors and ceilings to prices, agricultural markets are chronically volatile. Chronic hunger amongst the world\u2019s poor is the biggest single ethical issue confronting agricultural technology. Regulating agricultural technologies \u2014 how can it be understood? Theorthodoxyusedtobe,e.g.intheUKpriorto20March 1996, classically technocratic. Technocratic narratives portray regulatory policies as if they were based on, and only on, \u2018sound science\u2019. Policy-making institutions were structured in accordance with that model. Commission Directorates-General and government departments is- sued policy decisions, and represented them as based upon and legitimated by sound science as provided by expert committees. The technocratic model has, however, been torpedoed by the obvious fact that scientific evidence and under- standing is often incomplete, equivocal, uncertain and contested. From 1986 to February 1996, we did not know whether or not BSE could cause CJD. We still can- not forecast precisely how our climates will change as a consequence of agricultural or industrial activities. If we could reliably predict the environmental consequences of cultivating GM crops, the European Directive would not include a requirement for post-release monitoring. Once the uncertainties can no longer be concealed or denied, the technocratic narrative and model lose all their plausibility. Even if, per impossibile , all scientific uncertainties were eliminated, scientific considerations alone still could not decide environmental policy mat- ters. Policy judgments are concerned for example with the acceptability of possible risks (and uncertainties) in exchange for anticipated benefits; and those are socially variable value judgments \u2014 they are normative policy judgments, not scientific issues. During the late 1990s and the early years of this decade, many leading Euro- pean-wide institutions, and those in EU Member States too, abandoned technocratic narratives and institution- al structures. They have been replaced by a new orthodoxy, which maintains policy-making is a two-stage linear process in which science influences policy, but policy does not influence the science. That model is called the Red Book model after the 1983 US NRS report entitled Risk Assess- ment in the Federal Government: Managing the Process , which was bound in a red cover. In this model, it is as- sumed that the environmental impact of, for example, agricultural technologies and practices can and should be assessed scientifically in a value-free, policy-neutral space. That is often referred to as a \u2018scientific risk assess- ment\u2019. The conclusions of those assessments are then passed on to those responsible for policy decisions, who in this context are referred to as \u2018risk managers\u2019. At that second stage, and only then, other considerations of a normative, ethical, social and political character may le- gitimately be taken into account by policy-makers. For example, when deciding what practices and products Modern developments in agriculture technologies and environmental protection Erik Millstone ( 1 ) \u2018Making Trans-disciplinary Science Work for Resource-poor Farmers\u2019, Workshop Farmer First Revisited, Brighton, 12-14 December 2007, available at http://www.future-agricultures.org/farmerfirst/files/T2b_Roling.pdf. ",
        "83 to permit, restrict or forbid, risk management policy- makers may need to make normative judgments about trade-offs between risks and benefits, e.g. the \u2018adverse environmental impacts of pesticides\u2019 in exchange for \u2018crop protection\u2019. This model is fundamental to the institutional structur- al relationship between e.g. DG SANCO (as risk manag- er) and the EFSA as risk assessor. Similar arrangements have been introduced in e.g. Germany and France. As influential and popular the Red Book model may be, it has been rejected by almost all policy analysts, and formally repudiated by the European Commission and all EU Member States. Scholars and policy analysts have concluded that scientific assessments of e.g. the environmental effects of agricultural technologies and processes are not prepared in value-free, policy-neutral spaces; on the contrary, they are inevitably, and exqui- sitely, sensitive to their policy, economic, social and cul- tural contexts. As my colleagues and I found, in our study of policy dis- putes in relation to e.g. GM foods and crops, pesticides and food safety, expert risk assessment bodies disagree, notbecausetheyprovidingcompetinganswerstoshared questions, but because they are asking and answering different questions. 2 The choice of those questions is a normative policy-sensitive issue, not a neutral scientific issue. For example, in the 1990s US assessors deemed changes to flora and fauna from cultivating GM crops to be adverse effects only if they harmed the economic prospects of US farmers, otherwise they were deemed to be \u2018adaptations\u2019. In the EU, any changes to flora and fauna in either the agricultural or non-agricultural envi- ronments were deemed to be \u2018harm\u2019 and therefore as \u2018risks\u2019 that needed to be assessed, and if necessary man- aged. The US approach was not considered acceptable by any European Member State. Policy scholars since the 1980s have talked about the up- stream \u2018framing assumptions\u2019 that condition scientific deliberations about risks, and the representations and assessment of them. A major analytical and institutional innovation emerged in 2003 at the Codex Alimentarius Commission,whentheCodexMemberStatesintroduced a new concept \u2014 namely \u2018risk assessment policy\u2019, to re- fer to those up-stream framing assumptions. This risk as- sessment policy is portrayed in the following terms: \u2018Determination of risk assessment policy should be in- cluded as a s pecific component of risk management . Risk assessment policy shouldbe established byriskman- agers in advance of risk assessment, in consultation with risk assessors and all other interested parties \u2026\u2019 3 That implies that Codex acknowledged that risk assess- ments are framed by prior policy assumptions, which are risk management issues, and should be decided in ad- vance and up-stream by policy-makers in consultation not only with risk assessors but also with all other in- terested parties such as consumers, environmental in- terests and industrial interests. That acknowledgement represents a repudiation of both the technocratic and Red Book models. In July 2007, at the plenary session of Codex, all Codex Member States, which include all EU Member States and the European Commission, adopted an identical provi- sion to be applied domestically. The technocratic and Red Book models have therefore also been repudiated by the European Commission and all EU Member States. The new model implies that evaluative, normative and politically contestable issues arise not only down-stream but up-stream too. In a recently completed and published study of risk as- sessment policy for Codex in the UK, Germany, the USA, ( 2 ) Scienceintradedisputesrelatedtopotentialrisk:comparativecasestudies, (with P van Zwanenberg, C Marris, L Levidow and H Torgersen), Euro- pean Science and Technology Observatory Technical Report Series, 2004, available at http://esto.jrc.es/detailshort.cfm?ID_report=1203.

        "84 Japan and Argentina, my colleagues and I concluded that there are at least three main elements to risk assess- ment policies (RAP), namely: substantive procedural and interpretative \u2014 and they are interdependent. This is not an exhaustive list of ethical and policy ques- tions that arise when the environmental effects of agri- cultural technologies and processes are appraised 4 , but does comprise an important set of ethical and policy is- sues to which far too little attention has so far been paid. This set of issues is also one that policy-makers have, in general terms, undertaken to address, but which they have yet to address adequately. Since they should be addressed by the European Com- mission, and the governments of all EU Member States, they should also be on the agendas of national legisla- tures and the European Parliament if they are to meet their responsibilities for oversight of the executive in- stitutions. Those legislatures should ensure that policy- makers articulate at least those three key dimensions of risk assessment policy guidance for their risk assessors, and that the resulting policies are decided by transpar- ent and accountable processes. If these conditions are met, and if the co-evolutionary model is effectively operationalised and the risk assess- ment policy provisions properly implemented, then we may well have institutional structures and procedures through which policy-making could become both dem- ocratically and scientifically legitimate . ( 4 ) For example, a separate issue is: how could we test for the environmental impact of GM crops without taking precisely the risks that the testing is supposed to help us avoid? ",

        "94 \u2018The industrial gene is one that can be defined, owned, tracked, proven acceptably safe, proven to have uniform effect, sold and recalled.\u2019 This quote (by molecular biolo- gist Jack Heinemann) is taken from an article in the New York Times published in July 2007 1 and reflects the wide- ly accepted perception that as a result of international research projects such as the Human Genome Project (published in 2000/2001 2 ) and the ENCODE project (pub- lished in 2007 3 ), the 20th century concept of genes and their function is to a large extent no longer valid. Instead of viewing a gene as a deterministic building block ( In- dustrial Gene Paradigm ), gene functions and their regula- tions now have to be understood as a part of a systemic unit influenced by many factors. In fact, the full role of a gene can only be explained by looking at its context as a whole. The structure of DNA alone, which according to the 20th century concept determines the role of a gene, does not really define or restrict the function of the gene nor does it sufficiently explain the complex nature of life. As Craig Venter wrote as regards the Human Genome Project, which for the first time revealed the complete DNA structure of humans: \u2018(...) we must look elsewhere for the mechanisms that generate the complexities (...).\u2019 4 This new dimension in complexity calls into question the use of genetic engineering in plants, which is based on the general idea that a gene can be isolated, transferred to another organism (in many cases even from another spe- cies), inserted at random and, at the same time, be used to transfer a defined biological function. Because a DNA sequence alone does not define or restrict the function of a gene, predicting the effect of moving one gene to an- other organism is not at all as straightforward as has been assumed 5 . According to a study by the German Depart- ment of the Environment: 6 \u2018A genetically transferred gene sequence must be understood as genetic information whose context has been altered in an uncontrolled way\u2019. Many cases demonstrate that the application of the In- dustrial Gene Paradigm underestimates the issue of com- plexity at the level of gene regulation. For example, it has been shown that changing the function of a single gene can influence the functioning of several hundred other genes 7 . Side-effects associated with genetic engineering can even cause severe health problems. A slight modifica- tion in the expression of a new protein in peas as a result of genetic engineering led to an unforeseen potential hazard to human health 8 . Sometimes after unintended side-effects become evident, they are hailed as a success- ful result of genetic engineering, for example in the case of Golden Rice. Originally, Golden Rice kernels were sup- posed to produce a compound of a red, not yellow col- our. 9 Even if a certain function is transferred \u2018successfully\u2019, the function of a gene may be affected by the environ- ment (such as in conditions of drought, disease, or salin- ity) in ways too complex to be predicted based on our current knowledge. This has been shown in commercially traded genetically engineered plants such as cotton, soy and maize. For example the Bt content in MON810 maize seems to depend on environmental factors. 10 The industrial gene paradigm and its (Ethical) implications Christoph Then ( 1 ) Caruso,Denise.\u2018AChallengetoGeneTheory,aTougherLookatBiotech\u2019,NewYorkTimes,1July2007,www.nytimes.com.

        "95 In short, the concept of current genetic engineering in plants is flawed because it perceives an organism, its cells and gene functions (and its interaction with the en- vironment) as being determined by its single parts and not as being organised by emergence and non-linear processes. Therefore, the current concept of genetic en- gineering in plants tends to ignore the results of recent mainstream research leading the way to the post-ge- nomic era of the 21st century. The correct understand- ing of the mechanisms of life by industry is impeded by potential conflicts with commercial interests 11 . As Barry Commoner writes: \u2018The fact that one gene can give rise to multiple proteins also destroys the theoretical foun- dation of a multibillion-dollar industry, the genetic engi- neering of food crops.\u2019 12 This is relevant not only in the context of the manufac- ture of products, such as genetically engineered plants, but also to the patentability of plants, animals and re- lated genetic resources. Currently, patent offices in the US and Europe grant patents largely based on the In- dustrial Gene Paradigm ; genetic information is treated in the same way as chemical compounds are, which can be isolated and defined at the molecular level of DNA. As a logical result of this concept, very broad patents are granted for DNA sequences covering each and every biological function as soon as a commercial application is described. Even if a DNA sequence is only described in its natural context, it might become an invention where the breeding of plants and animals is concerned. This is the focus of the discussion at www.no-patents-on- seeds.org. The Industrial Gene concept has implications for civil society on several levels. Driven by economic expec- tations, it can have far-reaching ethical and socio-eco- nomic implications. These implications are addressed in the following four paragraphs: 1) (dis-)respect for life 2) exposure to risks 3) creating monopolies 4) opting for sustainable solutions 1) (Dis-)respect for life seems to be somewhat of an old fashioned concept when discussing the implications of modern biotechnology. But in the light of the underly- ing Industrial Gene Paradigm this very basic approach could acquire a new meaning. The construction and engineering (manipulation) of life forms under flawed technical preconditions could be perceived as not con- forming to the very basic concept of respect for living beings. One might interpret this as abuse of the tech- nical and economic power to turn life into a product, which suffers from a fundamental technical misconcep- tion. This issue has not yet taken centre stage in public debate \u2014 but it might well be on its way, sparked by the application of biotechnology to animals (including the advent of cloning). 2) The exposure to risks posed by genetically modified organisms is reflected in European legislation requir- ing a general risk assessment for genetically modified organisms before authorisation. But so far there is still no protocol for risk assessment which takes the general complexity of genes and their functions into account. 13 It is a matter of great concern that products originating from biotechnology are released into the environment and used in food production without a proper under- standing of genes and their functions. Thus consumers and the environment are systematically and permanent- ly exposed to a fairly unpredictable form of risk. Consid- er the risk of outcrossing: this risk might be prolonged ( 11 ) Seealso:Then,Christoph.2008.\u2018Dollyisttot\u2019,Rotpunktverlag,Schweiz.

        "96 and irreversible with implications for future generations. The risks emerging from the Industrial Gene Paradigm are exceptional in nature. As the New York Times points out: \u2018Innovation begets risk, almost by definition. When something is truly new, only so much can be predicted about how it will play out. Proponents of a discovery of- ten see and believe only in the benefits it will deliver. But when it comes to innovations in food and medicine, be- lief can be dangerous. Often, new information is discov- ered that invalidates the principles \u2014 thus the claims of benefit and, sometimes, safety \u2014 on which proponents have built their products.\u2019 14 3) Creating monopolies in seed and food production has been an integral part of modern biotechnology for approximately 20 years. Today, agrochemical com- panies such as Monsanto are the main global players in seed production. One central mechanism for the in- ternational takeover of the seeds market is patent law. Wherever DNA sequences of economic relevance can be identified, they and associated products can be claimed as intellectual property. This includes the entire chain of food production as well as all following generations derived from crossing and propagation. As mentioned above, this misappropriation of genetic resources is not restricted to genetically engineered plants. Especially in the light of the current food crisis, which is driven by the rising cost of everyday food products, this can have se- vere implications for civil society particularly in develop- ing countries. As the IAAST (International Assessment of Agricultural Science and Technology for Development) report in 2008 concludes: \u2018In developing countries espe- cially, instruments such as patents may drive up costs, restrict experimentation by the individual farmer or public researcher while also potentially undermining lo- cal practices that enhance food security and economic sustainability.\u2018 15 Broad monopolies in food and food production tech- nology can create additional bottlenecks in world food supply and therefore are in clear contradiction to the need for sustainable food security. For ethical reasons these monopolies should be ruled out by the interna- tional community. 4) Opting for sustainable solutions could also pose an ethical challenge if it could be shown that technologies are available that generate identical or better results as regards yield and sustainable food supply without pos- ing specific risks as is the case with genetic engineering. The latest outcome in what is known as marker-assisted breeding (MAB) has been positive, showing good results for pest and drought resistance as well as higher yields. 16 This technology does not introduce a completely new breeding technology, but simply supports conventional breeding with relatively low technical input, using some kindofgenediagnosis.Indeed,evenaccordingtoindustry, conventional breeding assisted by gene diagnosis seems to be more effective than GE technology. 17 Since costly procedures for authorisation, labelling and segregation are not necessary with MAB, this technology also means a lower economic burden for participants in the food and seed market. Seen from this perspective, we must weigh the pros and cons and take ethical aspects into account.

        "106 The EGE Round-Table comes at a time when sustainable agriculture, climate change and food security arehigh on the political agenda. In light of these discussions, more and more governments and authorities, including the Commission and the European Parliament, are recognis- ing a positive role for agricultural biotechnology in sus- tainable production. At the same time, the EU regulatory framework for GMOs, the most stringent in the world, is currently being discussed at several levels by European policy-makers. The WTO Panel ruling in 2006 that the EU was \u2018not compliant\u2019 in terms of implementing its legisla- tion on GMOs also gives an international dimension to this discussion. The inability at EU level to approve agricultural biotech products assessed as safe by the EU Food Safety Author- ity is denying European farmers access to innovative biotech crops that would allow them to compete with equal tools on the global market. In Europe, only one biotech product has been available for cultivation since 1998, while a number of cultivation approvals have been blocked in the approval system since then. This is seri- ously challenging the ethical concept of \u2018equal access\u2019 or \u2018justice within generations\u2019 for European farmers versus farmers in the rest of the world. Furthermore, given that the EU is often an important agricultural trading partner of developing countries, the EU\u2019s restrictive policy towards GMOs has a strong impact on developing countries that would like to adopt agri- cultural biotechnology but fear losing their trading part- ner as a result. An assessment, including the ethical im- plications, of policies and any new EU legislation in this sector should look beyond Europe\u2019s borders to examine the effects on other world regions as well. The lack of progress in approving new biotech products in the EU is also denying choice to the 42% of consumers who are not opposed to GMOs 1 . Indeed, the inconclusive voting patterns of Member States in the approval proc- ess show that even though a product is considered safe by the EU\u2019s own Food Safety Authority, Member States cannot arrive at a decision on whether or not to let that safe product onto the market, often on the basis that \u2018the public may not want it\u2019. In reality, consumer perceptions ofGMOs arechanging as shown by the trends in the latest Eurobarometer survey 1 , where the number of Europeans worried about biotech crops has declined to 20%, down from 24% in 2004. Similar studies recently conducted in the UK 2 and Sweden 3 have shown that fewer than 3% of respondents mention GM as a concern in relation to food. It seems ethically important to allow consumers to decide which safe products they will or will not purchase and not take that decision away from them. Currently, agriculture is facing a number of major global challenges. The rapid growth in world population (+13%), globalincome(+36%)andmeatconsumption(beef+14%, pork +11%, chicken +45%) in the last decade are major drivers of an increased demand for raw materials. There appear to be only two options to meet this challenge: 1) Increase the amount of cultivated area, thus further increasing the pressure on remaining land, includ- ing marginal grounds and forests 2) Increase the productivity of currently cultivated land, which is doubtless the more sustainable option. The challenges today are to enable all inhabited world re- gions to produce enough healthy food for their inhabit- ants while preserving precious resources such as soil and water and mitigating climate change.

Indeed, agricultural biotechnology has a role in ensuring the fol- lowing components of sustainability in agriculture: \u2022 Ecological sustainability : According to a recently published peer-reviewed study 4 which examined the technology over a ten-year period from 1996 to 2006, agricultural biotech has reduced greenhouse gas emissions from agriculture by 14.8 billion kg of CO 2 , which is equivalent to removing 6.6 million cars from the roads in 1 year (= 25% of the cars registered in the UK), and has reduced crop protection spray- ing by 286 million kg. \u2022 Economical sustainability : The global net eco- nomic benefits of 11 years of biotech crop cultiva- tion at farm level amounted to \u20ac4.5 billion in 2006 and \u20ac21.6 billion over the ten-year period 4 . Farmers get a direct benefit from growing biotech crops via higher yields and lower input and management costs, which translates into a benefit to consumers through lower prices. \u2022 Social sustainability : In 2006, 54% of the increase in farm income went to farmers in developing coun- tries. It is mainly the farmer who substantially gains from agricultural biotechnology. In Europe, as in the rest of the world, two thirds of the benefits of growing biotech crops are shared among European farmers and consumers, while one third goes to the developers and seed suppliers 5 . Given the challenges of food security and sustainable production, is it ethical for Europe to renounce agricul- tural biotech as part of the solution?
