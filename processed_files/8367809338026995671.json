        "The euro and US dollar: Partnership or boxing match? A major step with worldwide implications... A single European currency called the euro (\u20ac), involving 11 EU countries (') at the outset, will be created on 1 January 1999. The new currency zone will cover some 300 million Europeans and will account for 19.4 % of the worlds GDP, compared with 19.6 % for the United States. It will confirm the EU's impor\u00ad tance as a commercial power in the world with an 18.2 % share of world trade, equal to that of the United States. Exports from the euro currency zone are already 25 % higher than those of the US and twice those of Japan. The euro is expected to play a growing role in international trade in the future. IT) \u03c4\u03bf tri ... and with particular benefits for the United States The advent of the euro will have immedi\u00ad ate beneficial effects. Stability within the euro zone will be increased; the costs to businesses of currency exchange and risks associated with exchange rate fluctuations will be removed and economic growth will be promoted. And all of these will also ben\u00ad efit the United States. Global economic stability will be enhanced. US exporters to and investors in the EU will share in the cost savings. Growth in the European economy will provide new opportunities for US businesses. The US will therefore have a new opportunity to join in creating a powerful partnership with Europe on global economic and financial issues. The US dollar plays a dominant role in the world economy but Europe's new currency might soon change that. It is not expected to be a rival to the US dollar but will complement it, allowing for diversification and reducing the risk of countries being faced with currency fluctuations. Former European Commission President Jacques Delors once said, 'The construction of Europe is not a boxing match', a statement that can certainly be applied to Europe's approach to its single currency inter\u00ad nationally. The launch of the euro is therefore a historic event for the United States in particular, which has been used for so long to bear alone the burdens associated with the dominance of the 'greenback' in financial markets. (') I he 1 1 EU Member States participating in the euro area are Austria, Belgium, Finland, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Portugal and Spain. Denmark, Greece, Sweden and the United Kingdom arc not participating at the initial stage. ",
        "The euro will stimulate international trade In order to prepare for the euro, EU Member States have committed themselves to sound economic policies based on low inflation, healthy public finances and stable monetary conditions. The newly created indepen\u00ad dent European Central Bank's primary goal is price stability. These rules of sound economic management are generally a recipe for low interest rates, strong investment growth, and therefore high economic growth and job creation. Greater economic efficiency and stability in Europe is not only good for Europe. The global econ\u00ad omy will welcome a newly stabilising force and Europe's trading partners \u2014 amongst which the US is the most important \u00ad will gain from increased transparency, lower costs and greater predictability in the EU market. It is too early to assess the impact of the world's financial crisis and the apparent first signs of a global eco\u00ad nomic slowdown on the international use of currencies. Currently 85 % of stockmarket transactions and half the world's trade is settled in US dollars. Countries around the world are expected to turn increasing\u00ad ly to the euro as an alternative to the US dollar, both in trade invoicing and in financial markets. International financial markets in euro will develop and grow By virtue of the size and stability of the economies that have adopted the euro, it will become increasing\u00ad ly sought\u00adaftet as the currency in which investors choose to denominate their assets when investing in world stock markets. Fiscal policy will be stable too, based on the European Union's strong commitment to budgetary discipline. However, the expected shift of investments towards the euro must be set in per\u00ad spective: the diversification away from the US dollar has been going on for some time; and the additional impact of the euro will be gradual, as markets become convinced of its stability. These trends will not disrupt financial markets or bring unwelcome pressure on exchange rates. Indeed they are likely to lead to much greater international cooperation and a reduction in the volatility of markets. The establishment of the euro presents the US in particular with a new opportunity to build a partnership with Europe to encourage global growrh and maintain stability in the global economy. The benefits of economic and monetary union in Europe will therefore be felt not just in London and Frankfurt but in Wall Street as well. US companies should benefit worldwide from a more stable econom\u00ad ic environment than would be the case without the euro. An alternative to the US dollar for debt management At present, governments tend to issue their debt in US dollars. The advent of the euro presents non\u00adEU countries with the possibility of diversifying their debt structure and debt servicing, which would thus become less dependent on (and vulnerable to) major fluctuations in the US dollar's exchange rate. At pre\u00ad sent, a numbet of non\u00adEU countries (mainly developing countries) have only limited access to interna\u00ad tional capital markets, so that it is not always possible to diversify their liabilities. The introduction of the euro should open additional opporrunities for these countries to optimise the currency structure of their foreign debt by increasingly borrowing in euro. This ability to manage bettet debt and diversify risk should help countries avoid some of the difficulties which triggered the financial crisis in Asia. The euro will develop as a reserve currency Similarly, countries outside the euro area are likely to start using the euro as an official reserve currency. Trade flows with the euro area will grow. As these trade flows will increasingly be based in euro, this will become an incentive for central banks of countries outside the euro zone to increase the share of euro in their international cutrency reserves.

        "The European Union and the United States: allies with global responsibilities The world's two greatest powers The European Union and the United States are the two largest economies in the world. They account together for about half the entire world economy. The EU and the US also have the biggest bilateral trading and investment relationship. Transatlantic flows of trade and investment amount to around USD 1 billion a day, and jointly, our global trade accounts for almost 40% of world trade. By working together, the US and the EU can promote their common goals and interests in the world much more effec tively. Both the EU and the US share common interests in developing coherent strategies in order to favour harmonious economic development in the wider world and to promote, in particular, the stability of the international trade, financial and monetary system as well as the integration of countries in transition and developing countries. Awareness amongst Americans that the EU is its most important partner in this economic agenda is increasing. The creation of a single European market has boosted cross-border business, creating economies of scale, increasing Europe's competitiveness and leverage on world markets, and providing, new opportu nities for US exporters and investors. The single market has led to the creation of a single European currency, the euro, which was launched on 1 January 1999. This will reduce costs and increase efficiency not only for Europeans, but also for those US economic operators who are present in the world's biggest single market. The EU and the US are also linked by close security ties and a similat set of values, belief in democratic government, human rights and market economics. They share a common concern in handling effectively a wide variety of political and security issues across the globe. Both the EU and the US have to confront global challenges such as threats to security and stability, weapons proliferation, unemployment, environ mental degradation, drugs, crime and terrorism and many other important issues. \u00ab5 A long and enduring relationship The richness and diversity of American society owes much to successive waves of immigration from prac tically every European country during the course of the past five hundred years, and this accounts for the extent to which Europeans and Americans share common values and maintain close cultural, economic, social and political ties. Of course, this is reflected in close and warm relations between the US and indi vidual European nations. But the US has also traditionaliv been a stalwart supporter of integration between the nations of Europe, a process in which the creation of the European Union has played a central role. The US has therefore always paid the closest attention to Europe's efforts to shape its own destiny. The United States has maintained diplomatic relations with the European Union and its forerunners since 1953, when the first US observers to the European Defence Community and the European Coal and Steel Community were nominated. In 1961, the US mission to the European Communities \u2014 now the European Union \u2014 was established. The European Commission is represented in the United States by a delegation in Washington, which was established in 1954 largely thanks to the work of the then President of the ECSC, Jean Monnet. A New York office, accredited as observer to the United Nations, was estab lished in 1964. In 1971 the Washington office became a delegation with full diplomatic privileges and immunities. The delegation represents the European Commission in its dealings with the US government. It reports on US developments to headquarters in Brussels and acts as a liaison with other international institutions in Washington, DC. ",
        "The European Union and the United States: allies with global responsibilities The European Union and the United States hold twice-yearly presidential summits to assess and develop transatlantic cooperation. The EU-US summits bring together the President of the United States, the Head of State or Government of the EU Member State in the EU Presidency, and the President of the European Commission. The EU-US Presidential summits came into being as a result of the November 1990 Transatlantic Declaration which for the first time formalised the United States' contacts with what was then called the European Community. The Transatlantic Declaration recognised the EU's pivotal role in both the political stability and economic reconstruction of former communist countries of central and eastern Europe. Summit meetings between the EU and US executives are reinforced by regular dialogue between the legis latures. The importance of meetings between representatives of the US Congress and of the European Parliament has increased as the European Parliament has developed a much stronger role in decision making in the EU, from its beginnings as a largely consultative assembly to its current status as the directly-elected voice of the EU citizen. A new era for transatlantic relations It soon became clear that the regular consultation procedures foreseen by this declaration, even if positive, were not enough and that we needed to undertake decisive joint action in many areas. The internal strengthening of Europe under the 1992 Maastricht Treaty, which created the European Union, offered new possibilities for a closer and more equal partnership. The emergence of a European common foreign and security policy meant that the United States would have a more solid and coherent partner. Besides, it was also more evident that a joint response by the US and Europe to a growing number of external chal lenges was needed, for example, in relation to the threat of proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, the situation in the countries of the former East bloc, the war in Bosnia, the fragile peace process in the Middle East, and the need to secure economic growth and employment. To meet these and other challenges, a decisive step forward in the relations between the two partners was taken at the EU-US Summit in Madrid, in December 1995, when the European Union and the United States adopted the New Transatlantic Agenda. Both sides pledged to work together to promote peace, democracy and stability, foster economic growth and liberalisation world-wide, meet global challenges such as terrorism and environmental degradation, and to build stronger non-governmental links between the people of Europe and the United States. Thus, the New Transatlantic Agenda launched an era of unprecedented cooperation on a wide tange of political and economic issues. This led in 1998 to a further deepening of the framework for economic relations, when the London Summit of May 1998 launched the Transatlantic Economic Partnership. We have now begun formal bilateral negotiations on a number of issues, accompanied by a wide range of bilateral cooperative actions and a regular dialogue on multilateral trade policy issues. June 1999 ",
        "The New Transatlantic Agenda 'We decided to underpin our relations with a more practical action-oriented approach based on 'deeds not words' (...). In the years ahead we must deliver, on both sides of the Atlantic, the fruits of these actions. Our citizens and future generations will demand nothing less. And they are right to do so. ' European Commission President Jacques Santer, 30 November 1995 A new quality of partnership. On 3 December 1995 at the EU-US Summit in Madrid, European Commission President Santer, Spanish Prime Minister Gonzalez, as President of the European Council, and US President Clinton signed the New Transatlantic Agenda (NTA). This was a new framework for a partnership of global significance, designed to lend a new quality to the transatlantic relationship, moving it from one of consultation to one of joint action in four major fields: \u2022 Promoting peace and stability, democracy and development around the world; \u2022 Responding to global challenges; \u2022 Contributing to the expansion of world trade and closer economic relations; \u2022 Building bridges across the Atlantic. The NTA is accompanied by a Joint EU-US Action Plan setting out no less than 150 specific actions to which the EU and US have committed themselves. These range from promoting political and economic reform in Ukraine to combating AIDS; from reducing barriers to transatlantic trade and investment to pro moting links between colleges and universities. It is an agenda that is ambitious, outward looking and which affects all sectors of society from big business to the individual citizen. .with concrete benefits for the partners Since the NTA was adopted, the EU and US have made excellent progress in implementing the actions which were agreed. We have reduced barriers to trade, benefiting businesses and consumers on both sides of the Atlantic as part of the creation of a New Transatlantic Marketplace. Within this framework, a new initiative to reinforce the Transatlantic Economic Partnership was launched at the 18 May 1998 EU-US summit, in London. m We have concluded agreements to remove technical barriers to trade by mutual recognition of conformity assessment and to work together on customs procedures. We have joint projects in Ukraine to promote civil society and in the Caribbean to combat illicit drugs. We have decided to cooperate systematically in sci ence and technology and on higher education and vocational training. We have encouraged parliamentar ians, business-people, trade unionists, consumers and people from all walks of life to meet and to make their own input into out dialogue. Alongside all of this cooperation, the NTA also provides us with a framework within which we can address our differences more constructively. A partnership of equals does not exclude tough talking on difficult issues. But the strength of our relationship means that even thorny issues such as the US's extraterritorial legislation and different approaches to hormones in meat and genetically-modified food do not prevent progress in other areas. ",
        "The New Transatlantic Agenda .and a positive impact on the global community As powers of global significance, the EU and the US have a responsibility to cooperate to provide leader ship in the world. The NTA is quite deliberately an outward-looking agreement committing both partners to cooperate on issues of global importance. This applies as much to the field of foreign affairs and devel opment as to the more traditional area offrade. Together, the EU and the US are working to promote the Middle East peace process, to alleviate poverty in the developing world, to bring peace to the former Yugoslavia and to support a smooth transition to market-based democratic systems in the countries of central and eastern Europe. We have also cooperated to address the global issues which are of most concern to our citizens, agreeing measures to combat inter national organised crime and terrorism, to stem the trade in illegal drugs and to protect the global envi ronment. And we are working together in organisations such as the World Trade Organisation and the Otganisation for Economic Co-operation and Development to encourage our trading partners to join with us in our efforts to liberalise trade and investment on a multilateral basis so that businesses and consumers across the world can benefit from the economic gains that these bring. An intensive dialogue Such an ambitious agenda of cooperation between the EU and US in such a large number of areas requires intensive dialogue. Twice-yearly summits between the Presidents of the European Council and the European Commission and the President of the United States mean that work on the implementation of the NTA is monitored constantly at the highest level and priorities for each six-month tetm are identified. The summits are prepared by a group of senior level representatives (SLG), (composed of two senior offi cials each from the European Commission, the country holding the ELI presidency and the US State Department) which has been entrusted to oversee work on the NTA and particularly the priority action which the summit leaders have identified. They meet two to three times in every six-month term and pre pare a report to the summit leaders on achievements and new priorities. In addition, a number of spe cialised high-level groups oversee cooperation in particular areas such as economic assistance to other coun tries, the environment, biotechnology and the information society. The SLG is supported in its work by a NTA task force, which follows closely the day-to-day implementa tion of the NTA, prepares the SLG meetings, and recommends areas for SLG input. December 1998 ",
        "Promoting peace, stability, democracy and development Towards a partnership of true equals The EU and US have a strong and long-standing economic relationship, but it is only more recently that the EU as such has emerged as a potential partner in foreign policy for the US. Because of the EU's impor tance as an international donor and, in particular since the entry into force of the Maastricht Treaty on European Union, and its increasingly influential role in international diplomacy, the EU-US partnership now covers the full range of foreign policy issues. Even if transatlantic achievements in the area of foreign policy are less visible and numerous than in the trade policy field, it is becoming increasingly evident that, in politics as in economics, where they have common interests the EU and the US can achieve more by acting together than when they act separately. The EU can be particularly effective in providing leadership in areas where foreign and security policy objectives can be pursued not only through traditional foreign policy mechanisms but also through more well-established fields of EU action such as assistance and trade policy. Foreign policy issues have become an increasingly important part of the dialogue. They occupy a signifi cant part of the summit and ministerial agendas and are the subject of regular consultations between EU and US experts meeting twice a year. No fewer than 16 specific subject areas are covered, including both geographical and 'horizontal' issues such as non-proliferation and human rights. A partnership which can yield results. ism Amongst the important achievements of transatlantic cooperation we can point to joint efforts in Bosnia on civilian reconstruction and support for democracy; the transfer of war criminals ro the international tri bunal in The Hague; promoting respect for political and human rights in Kosovo; restoration of democra cy in Albania, and greatly intensified coordination on the Middle East peace process, notably through increased cooperation between the special envoys Dennis Ross and Miguel Moratinos. On Ukraine, we adopted a joint statement at the December 1997 Washington summit, which reinforced close EU-US coordination of assistance programmes (including on the Chernobyl nucleat plant closure), as well as cooperation on reform policies, market access barriers and accelerating Ukraine's accession to the World Trade Organisation. All of this contributes to an objective which is central to both EU and US pol icy in eastern Europe \u2014 the establishment of Ukraine as a key to that region's stability. We have also agreed on a common approach to the problem of nuclear waste management in north west Russia. The agreement between the EU and the Korean Peninsula Energy Development Organisation (KEDO), in which Korea, Japan and the US already participate, underlined a shared global commitment to strengthen non-proliferation efforts. As a part of this commitment, we have defined our common views on non-pro liferation and we have agreed to increase our cooperation to counter the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. Cooperation on China is now gaining ground and focuses on human rights issues, China's full integration into the international system and the political situation in Hong Kong. Annual high-level consultations on assistance address both global issues and specific areas of very concrete cooperation, ranging from training of local civil servants in Bolivia ro supporr for desrirure women in Bangladesh. ",
        "Promoting peace, stability, democracy and development ....and from which yet more can be expected There are other areas, however, where EU-US cooperation still has a good deal of scope for improvement. In some cases, cooperation has been held back by internal political factors: in the case of the EU this some times reflects the difficulty of achieving consensus between all 15 Member States. On the US side, lack of support in Congress for multilateral commitments (such as in the case of UN financing, the Anti- Landmines Convention and the ratification of the Chemical Weapons Convention) can sometimes be problematic. In other areas, while significant potential for cooperation exists, at least on specific issues, both partners still shy away from stepped-up efforts since the common interest in doing so is not clearly perceived by one or other of the partners. Thus, there remain a number of important regions and countries which transat lantic partners still approach separately. Partners \u2014 yet not with identical views A partnership of equals presupposes that each will respect the other's decisions not only when these are palatable, but also when there are honest differences of opinion between the partners. Divergent policy approaches exist towards certain 'countries of concern', and in particular Iran and Cuba. Whilst the EU fully shares the US's determination to ensure international security and full respect of human rights and democratic principles, and is working extremely hard to address these, the EU does not share the US's political strategy of isolating these countries. Unfortunately, the US's approach to these differences has, in some cases, had an extremely negative impact on our trade relations. The extra-territorial US legislation on the above countries has been firmly rejected by the EU. Nevertheless, the NTA provides a forum in which we can work together consrructively and effectively to overcome these difficulties. Thus, on 18 May 1998, the EU and the US succeeded in reach ing an understanding which may constitute the basis for the resolution of this problem. The key to the implementation of this deal lies with the adoption by the US Congress of the necessary changes to US leg islation. The basis for rhe understanding is the respect which each partner has for the other's positions and the recognition that, whatever the difficulties, we are stronger acting together than acting separately. December 1998 ",
        "Responding to global challenges The European Union and the United States share a serious concern about new global challenges which cut across national boundaries and which threaten the safety and quality of life of our citizens. These include international crime, terrorism and drug trafficking, degradation of the environment, and communicable diseases. The EU and the US have pledged themselves to address these challenges in an effective manner in the framework of the New Transatlantic Agenda. m Regular joint training of the region's coastguard personnel is an integral part oi the Caribbean anti drug strategy. Fight against drug trafficking, terrorism and organised crime As part of our joint efforts against illegal dtug trafficking, we concluded in 1 997 an agreement on the con trol of chemical precursors used in the manufacture of illicit drugs. We are working together against drug trafficking in the Caribbean, addressing law enforcement capabilities, institution-building, marine inter diction, training and information sharing. Additional collaborative approaches in other regions plagued by drug trafficking are being discussed. We have intensified and better structured our cooperation on counter-tetrorism. This has helped to pass the UN International Convention on the Suppression of Terrorist Bombing. At the 1998 EU-US London summit, we issued a joint statement where we defined our shared objectives and planned reinforced Cupertino on this critical matter. We have combined forces to combat trafficking in women by launching a joint information campaign in two key transit and source countries \u2014 Poland and Ukraine. In the framework of our cooperation against international crime we have exchanged information at con ferences, seminars and other expert-level meetings on money laundering, cybercrime, financing of terror ism, high-tech law enforcement technologies and other related subjects. First contacts between US law enforcement agencies and the nascent Europol have been established. ",
        "Responding to global challenges Preservation of the environment An EU-US high-level group on environmental issues now meets regularly to discuss how we can work together meet the challenge of the degradation of the global environment. Out discussions have led not only to better coordinated policies in international fora, but also concrete actions. For example, we have pledged funding and begun work to establish four regional environmental centres in Russia, Ukraine, Moldova and Georgia to be opened in 1998. We cooperated together to reach in 1996 an OECD agree ment to reduce lead use in petrol, chemicals and other products. Although much attention was given to the significant differences between EU and US posirions at the December 1997 Kyoto Conference on Climate Change, we nevertheless managed to bridge those difficul ties sufficiently to be able to agree to a protocol binding both the EU and US to reductions in their pro duction of 'greenhouse gases', even if the targets eventually were not as ambitious as the EU would have liked. We are continuing to work hard on effective follow-up to this agreement, as was evidenced by our close cooperation at the Buenos Aires conference in November 1998. Health The spread of new communicable diseases and the emergence of stronger resistant strains of scourges such as malaria are a threat both to our own citizens and to those in developing countries ro which we have a shared commitment. We have therefore established an EU-US Task Force on Communicable Diseases to build a global early warning and response network for such diseases in cooperation with the WHO and other multilateral organisations. It has started with a surveillance network covering salmonella and E. Coli and will subsequently extend to other pathogens. We are also seeking ways to cooperate in research into these diseases and in finding ways to help developing countries develop their own capacity to tackle them. December 1998 ",
        "Economic and trade relations Towards the expansion of world trade and closer economic relations A partnership of economic superpowers The two transatlantic economies enjoy a high degree of economic integration. The European Union and the United States ate the leading participants in international trade, accounting between them for 37 % of world merchandise trade, and 45 % of world trade in services. They are also each other's single largest trad\u00ad ing partner \u2014 taking goods and services together \u2014 and each other's most important source and destina\u00ad tion for foreign direct investment. ,\u039b\u2014\u03b7 fe m m ,\u039b\u2014\u038a The Customs Cooperation Agreement was signed at the EU-US summit in the Hague. May 1997. Despite such an impressive record in economic integration, a number of actual and potential trade disputes between the two transatlantic partners have stolen the headlines in recent months and years. These include the EU's banana import regime, Helms-Burton and D'Amato Acts, the proposed trade ban on animal products containing specified risk materials in the wake of the BSE crisis as well as the Boeing-McDonnell Douglas metger review. Whilst such tensions tend to attract the headlines, it is essential to recognise that at the same time a polit\u00ad ically and economically significant coopetation agenda has been carried forward by the EU and the US in the trade policy area. This agenda has been pursued in accordance with the ambitious chapter on economic and trade issues contained in the New Transatlantic Agenda (NTA). ",
        "Economic and trade relations A driving force for the multilateral agenda... The EU is firmly committed to the promotion of open and fair trade with all of its trading partners. This is why we have worked so hard at the successful establishment of the World Trade Organisation (WTO). As the world's major trading powers, the EU and the US can exercise considerable influence on global trade and investment, but it is vital that we do this together and in close cooperation with all our other trading partners. An important focus of the NTA provisions relating to trade and economic relations is therefore the strengthening of the multilatetal trading system. In this context the EU and the US have worked together to conclude the Information Technology Agreement and the Basic Telecommunication Services Agreement, which together liberalise approximately one trillion ecus in rrade in goods and services, and, most recently, the Financial Services Agreement. In the WTO we are also cooperating effectively in the challenging accession negotiations of new WTO mem- bets, such as China and Russia. In the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, the EU and the US have contributed to the conclusion of a comprehensive convention on combating bribery in international business transactions and we have worked together in the definition of a Multilatetal Agreement on Investment. ...based on a strong bilateral relationship The bilateral section of the NTA has as its centrepiece the creation of a 'new transatlantic marketplace' by progressively getting rid of barriers to the flow of goods, services and investment between the EU and the US. Duting the first three years of the NTA, we have worked on a number of priority actions which have facilitated trade and investment between the EU and US. In identifying these priorities, we have been helped by the recommendations of the business communities on both sides of the Atlantic, which are brought together in a transatlantic business dialogue (TABD). Cooperation in regulatory issues... In line with TABD recommendations, we have made particular efforts in the field of standards, certifica tion and regulatory issues, calling in particular for cooperation in the international standard-setting process. Since the adoption of the NTA progress has been made in a number of areas, with the entry into force of a mutual recognition agreement (MRA) covering telecom equipment, pharmaceuticals, medical devices, electromagnetic compatibility, electric safety and recreational craft. This will allow EU bodies to carry out conformity assessments to US requirements, and vice versa, thus eliminating some of the considerable costs involved for manufacturers on either side of the Atlantic. Effotts to enhance regulatory cooperation have also been at the core of the development of the new ttansat- lantic marketplace. At the December 1997 Washington summit, a joint statement was issued in which, whilst highlighting the importance of preserving consumer and environmental protection, we stressed the importance of making regulatots more aware of the ttade and investment consequences of their decisions. The development of divergent regulations is discouraged, so that issues which might otherwise become the source of a future trade dispute may be addressed at an early stage. ",
        "At the same summit, we turned our attention to the new challenge of electronic commerce and the many complex issues it raises. We committed ourselves to work together in international fora to ensure that buy ing and selling by electronic means (for example on the Internet) does not involve the imposition of addi tional taxes and duties, and to encourage an open dialogue between governments and the private sector on the regulatory questions which are raised. This is a clear example of how transatlantic cooperation can help to create pressure for a coherent and coordinated approach internationally. EU President Jacques Santer and Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan, Washington DC May, 1998 ... and in lowering other barriers to trade Although we have focused much of our attention on regulatory issues we have also made progress on reducing othet barriers. Our efforts have produced an impressive range of agreements and ini tiatives which demonstrate the breadth and depth of the cooperative relation ship between the two partners. These include: \u2022 The signature at the summit of May 1997 in The Hague of the Agreement on Customs Cooperation and Mutual Assistance in Customs Matters covering, inter alia, simplifi cation of customs procedures, data and personnel exchanges and increased investigative coopetation; \u2022 The negotiation of a new agreement in the area of enforcement of compe tition laws which is intended to improve cooperation by comple menting the 1991 EU-US agreement; igation satellite system, aimed at ensuting reliable, fixing services for transatlantic usets. \u2022 Joint efforts to establish a global nav- fficient and highly accutate navigation and position- The transatlantic economic partnership Despite all of these coopetative initiatives and efforts, a numbet of barriers to trade and investment con tinue to exist in the transatlantic marketplace, as shown by the European Commission's and the US trade representative's respective annual reports. The impact of diffeting regulatory approaches in sensitive areas such as biotechnology, food safety, data privacy, to mention only a few examples, demonsttate the need to increase the level and quality of the bilateral cooperation. It was with this in mind that the European Commission made a proposal for an ambitious comprehensive approach in its March 1998 communica tion on the creation of the new transatlantic marketplace (NTM). This led the EU and the US to agree to the launching of the transatlantic economic partnership (TEP) al\u00b7 lhe 18 May 1998 EU-US summit, in London. ",
        "Economic and trade relations Towards the expansion of world trade and closer economic relations The TEP is a majot initiative aimed at breaking down the batriers to trade across the Atlantic and work ing more closely together to pursue multilateral liberalisation. The TEP also has a political dimension, since it is obvious that strengrhening our economic relations will improve and reinforce our overall relationship. In November 1998 a rolling work programme with specific target dates for the implementation of the TEP was agreed between the European Commission and the US administration after intensive talks. This pro- gramme was endorsed by the General Affairs Council of the European Union on 9 November 1998. Its main goal is to intensify and extend multilateral and bilateral EU-US cooperation and common actions in the field of trade and investment. In the bilateral field the project proposes the removal of regulatory barriers to trade in both goods and ser vices by closer cooperation between regulators. This will allow the negotiation of mutual recognition of technical regulations and professional qualifications. The plan also proposes joint action and cooperation in the areas of government procurement and intellectual property, consumer and plant health, biotechnol ogy, environment and food safety. In the multilateral field the programme proposes regular dialogue with the US to reach a closer under standing on the key issues that will be tackled in new multilateral trade negotiations starting in 2000. These include implementation of WTO agreements, dispute settlement, services, agriculture, trade facilitation, industrial tariffs, intellectual property rights, investment, competition, government procurement, environ ment, WTO accessions, developing countries, electronic commerce and labour standards.

        "Establishing people-to-people links Building bridges across the Atlantic 'The links between the peoples of the European Union and the United States have always been strong and remain so. Ties of family and kinship have been the very core of our close historical relationship. The tradition of European emigration to the United States goes back beyond the Pilgrim Fathers and has continued ever since. These personal links have endowed our societies with common cultural, religious and philosophical traditions. ' Sir Leon Brittan, Vice-President of the European Ct at the opening of the first Transatlantic Conference, Washington, D.C. 5 May 1997 ommission Sir Leon Brittan addresses the European-American Business Council, September 1998 tf\u00ed ~a \u03b1\u03ca From the beginning of the new era in transatlantic relations, which was \u00a1naugurared by the signing of the New Transatlantic Agenda in December 1995, it has been recognised that the Agenda should be shaped and driven not only by governments, but with the full participation of people from all walks of life. Building bridges between different communities on either side of the Atlantic has therefore been one of the four fundamental aims of the New Transatlantic Agenda. We have encouraged businesspeople, parliamen tarians, scientists, academics, trade unionists and a broad range of citizens' groups to reinforce links with their transatlantic counterparts, to share their experiences on the challenges that they face and to make their own input to pursuing our shared aims. We have actively promoted these links not only by giving support for conferences and seminars, hut also by funding specific projects and by using new technologies to put people on both sides of the Atlantic in touch with each other. ",
        "Establishing people-to-people links Listening to the business communities One of the major successes so far of our efforts to build bridges between communities on both sides of the Atlantic is the transatlantic business dialogue (TABD). Launched in Seville in November 1995 by the European Commission and the US government, the TABD is now a business-driven process whereby busi ness leaders from both sides of the Atlantic develop joint policy recommendations. Their overall aim is to boost transatlantic trade and investment opportunities by removing obstacles to the efficient conduct of international business. Each year the TABD brings together over a hundred EU and US business leaders and high-level represen tatives of the European Commission and the US administration in a two-day conference. In between these annual conferences, work is carried on by numerous issue and sectoral groups which are overseen by a steer ing committee at chief executive level. The TABD recommendations are presented to the EU-US summits by the TABD chairmen. Listening to business helps us to ensure that our trade policy agenda is one that is genuinely tesponsive to the real needs of business. So far the TABD has been particularly instrumental in the content and the adop tion of the 1997 EU-US Mutual Recognition Agreement on conformity assessment procedures. The TABD has equally contributed significantly to the Information Technology Agreement, adopted in the framework of the WTO in 1997. The business dialogue is also providing constructive input to the attempts to resolve the problems concerning US extraterritorial sanctions legislation. The transatlantic small business initiative (TASBI) was launched at the Chicago TABD conference in November 1996. It is a joint EU-US programme focussing firstly on stimulating small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) from both sides of the Atlantic to form business alliances and partnerships, and sec ondly to develop database systems to assist SMEs to discover the economic environment in each region and to facilitate partnerships across the Atlantic. Links between our legislators The European Parliamenr brings together the democratically elected representatives of the European Union's 375 million citizens, whilst the US Senate and House of Representatives legislate on behalf of 270 million Americans. It is vital to the success of our common agenda that our legislators share fully in shap ing it. Wotking together, they can promote mutual understanding and seek solutions to common problems. Members of the European Parliament and the US Congress meet regularly to exchange views on a wide range of issues relating to the New Transatlantic Agenda including areas such as EU enlargement, the euro, the promotion of democracy in countries such as Cuba and other matters of common interest. Parliament and Congress are also involved in exchanges of staff and secondment of young diplomats. Promoting social dialogue As well as govetnment-to-government dialogue on themes such as employment and health policy, we have promoted initiatives which bring together actors from the governmental, corporate, labour and non-prof it sectors to discuss issues of common concern. During 1998, ttansatlantic conferences have been organised to address issues such as international labout standards, work organisation, occupational health and safety and the role of new technologies in promot ing the role of disabled people in the workplace. We have also encouraged trades unions on both sides of the Atlantic to meet \u00eeblish a labour dialogue to complement the TABD. ",
        "The research and learning communities The EU-US Science and Technology Agreement, which came into force during 1998, is a key instrument for advancing our goal of expanding EU-US scientific cooperation across the Atlantic. It serves as a broad framework for cooperation, enabling some of our most distinguished scientists and best research institu tions to collaborate on a wider range of scientific endeavours and to initiate new joint programmes. The agreement encourages cooperation in areas where the US and the EU are doing some of the most advanced research in the world, including environment, agriculture, information and communications technologies, biomedicine, health, and manufacturing processes. As well as working together on specific projects, we are keen to support an on-going dialogue between our scientific communities on issues of direct relevance to the successful pursuit of the New Transatlantic Agenda, such as genetically modified foods and BSE. Educational activities are vital to strengthening the links between young people in Europe and in the US. At the same time that the New Transatlantic Agenda was agreed, leaders also signed the EU-US Agreement on Higher Education and Vocational Training. The aim of the agreement is to encourage innovative coop eration projects on both sides of the Atlantic and to further the exchange ofinformation on vocational edu cation and training through a variety of mechanisms, not only through governmental dialogue but also through support for cooperation between EU and US educational institutions. Under the agreement, each cooperation project involves a minimum of three partners on each side, name ly higher education or training institutions from two different EU Member States, and partner institutions from two US states. Other partners include businesses, non-governmental organisations, chambers of com merce, and research institutes, thus ensuring that a wide range of communities is involved. Conscious, however, of the fact that the EU is much less widely known about in the US than the US is here in Europe, we have launched an ambitious programme to set up a network of EU centres in US uni versities. The European Commission is funding visiting fellows, research opportunities in Europe for US students and a wide variety of other innovative activities to promote understanding of European integra tion and a shated vision of Europe's future. People-to-people links In order to make the New Transatlantic Agenda responsive to the needs and aspirations of ordinary citi zens, we believe that it is essential to involve them in it and to promote links between groups of people with similar experiences and problems. A Transatlantic Conference entitled 'Bridging the Atlantic: people to people links', held in Washington in May 1997 brought togethet over 300 Europeans and Americans, mainly from the non-governmental sec tor, to take a fresh look at possible coopetation in four areas: electronic exchange; civil society; education, culture and youth; and building partnerships in the global economy. Together they shared their experience in recognising best practices, identified barriers to futther exchanges that require elimination, discussed opening exchanges to those who had not been able to participate, and proposed new initiatives. Some of the fruits of the Transatlantic Conference have included the launch of the transatlantic informa tion exchange service (TIES), an Internet resource supported by the European Commission and the European Parliament which is designed to enable NGOs, institutions and foundations to develop transat lantic partnerships in their areas of interest. Other initiatives which have followed on from the conference include a conference held in February 1998 in Akron, Ohio on learning strategies in a globalising world as well as the launch of a transatlantic consumers' dialogue and of a transatlantic environmental dialogue.
