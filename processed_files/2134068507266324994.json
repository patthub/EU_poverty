Strongly condemns the loss of livelihood and property and the violations and abuses of international human rights and humanitarian law, which include arbitrary killings, sexual violence, inhuman treatment and all forms of attack, as well as aggressions and provocations against the civilian population and peacekeepers; recalls that such targeted attacks may constitute a war crime under international humanitarian law; expresses its sincere condolences to the governments of Morocco and Bangladesh, the families of the victims and MINUSCA; underlines that attacks targeting peacekeepers are unacceptable and against all international norms; 3.

Firmly supports the authority of the UN Secretary-General to implement the UN\u2019s policy of transparency (zero tolerance) for allegations of SEA, and welcomes the initiatives he has undertaken thus far in the CAR; calls on the UN member states to ensure that MINUSCA\u2019s Conduct and Discipline and Internal Oversight teams receive the necessary resources to effectively respond to SEA cases and other crimes; 5. Underlines the paramount importance of security; stresses in this respect the necessity of reforms to transform the CAR\u2019s armed forces into a professional, democratically controlled and ethnically representative army; welcomes the decision of the European Council of 19 April 2016 to establish a military training mission in the CAR (EUTM RCA) to contribute to the country\u2019s defence sector reform; expects that it will help modernise, and improve the effectiveness and inclusiveness of, the Central African Armed Forces (FACA) through strategic advice to the CAR\u2019s Ministry of Defence and the general staff, as well as education and training; 6.

        "9. Deplores the fact that, owing to a lack of funding, the UN\u2019s World Food Programme (WFP) runs the risk of soon needing to halt its aid to 150 000 people in the crisis-torn CAR who have been displaced by violence; notes that the food distributed by WFP represents a lifeline for these displaced people, who have lost everything, and that suspending assistance would have a dramatic impact on their lives; urges donors, in this context, to respect their commitments made to the WFP, and to prevent any further deterioration of delivery of humanitarian aid; 10. Welcomes the scaling-up of the EU\u2019s and Member States\u2019 humanitarian engagement with the CAR in light of the evolving needs; calls on all international donors to support EU humanitarian funding, including the WFP, and to help those affected by the crisis in the CAR, both those inside the country and the refugees in neighbouring countries; 11.

        "EU logistics and the need for additional measures in the TEN-T programme 1. Highlights the importance of ensuring free movement of persons, goods and services, including by an efficient and sustainable freight transport system, for the development of the internal market, prosperity and the economic, social and territorial cohesion of the EU; 2. Considers that a seamless EU infrastructure system will only deliver its benefits to the logistics sector, and thereby also to regional development and growth, if implemented and consistent with EU legislation and with the TEN-T policy already adopted; urges the Member States to transpose legislation correctly into national law without hampering the free exchange of goods; calls on the Member States to increase their efforts to apply and abide by European legislation and to refrain from introducing new barriers; urges the Commission to bring to the Court of Justice Member States that delay or alter the implementation of EU law, and to boost the action of all other relevant actors in order to avoid such delays or alterations; 3. Is concerned about the negative impact on the logistics sector, and thereby also on regional development and growth, of closures of internal borders in connection with the humanitarian and migrant crisis and the terrorist threat in the European Union; calls on the Member States and the Commission to prevent collateral damage on freight flows as much as possible when proposing such measures; calls on the Commission to take disciplinary action against Member States that impede free movement by deliberately preventing freight flows; 4. Underlines that logistics plays a key role, not sufficiently recognised, in ensuring efficient and sustainable freight transport operations in the EU; highlights the need to formulate a renewed EU strategy for freight logistics, \u2014 taking account of the new TEN-T infrastructure policy, \u2014 aiming to further reduce regulatory, operational and technical barriers, \u2014 designed to ensure optimal use of resources, \u2014 aimed at applying and implementing new technologies and innovative solutions that will strengthen the sector\u2019s performance and accelerate the shift towards a secure and low-carbon transport system, \u2014 aiming to increase connectivity and develop infrastructure in areas where it is missing, \u2014 promoting and supporting the European rail supply industry as well as boosting a European rail reindustrialisation policy, with the win-win perspective of making EU logistics more sustainable and obtaining a better competition position for rail products on the global market, \u2014 taking into account from the outset drones as a future mode of transport, \u2014 promoting continued development of academic research and education n the area transport and logistics, and \u2014 presenting an independent scientific study detailing the extent to which road freight could be transferred to rail and inland waterways by 2030 and by 2050, the costs associated with this, and the extent to which environmental damage such as noise and air pollution can be avoided; 5. Stresses that the implementation of the TEN-T network, with particular emphasis on cross-border connections and within the time-frames laid down and completed by 2030, will reduce bottlenecks, improve interoperability between the various modes of transport and contribute to delivering integrated multimodal freight transport in the EU; recalls that national planning of the comprehensive network, in line with the core network, needs to be put in place in order to integrate it with national, regional and local infrastructures, which should be completed by 2050 at the latest; 6. Welcomes the strengthened emphasis, within the core network corridor approach, to enhance the quality of transport nodes and of their last-mile connections, to identify and overcome interoperability barriers, to enhance and innovate ICT solutions and to close any other gap (physical, technical or organisational) that may hamper seamless freight logistics services; 10.7.2018 EN Official Journal of the European Union C 242/17 Thursday 19 January 2017 ",
        "7. Recalls, in this context, the importance of urban nodes \u2014 where a large part of transport modes (ports, airports logistics, hubs, terminals, etc.) are located and where transhipments and last-mile distributions take place \u2014 as they are key to the whole logistic chains, requiring greater attention if seamless city logistics are to be ensured; stresses the importance of investments in these urban nodes, as well as of the promotion of rail connections with industrial plants and improved interconnectivity of rail with seaports, inland ports and hinterland hubs; asks the Commission to prioritise these investments in the 2017 review of the Connecting Europe Facility (CEF); 8. Notes that a lack of efficient harmonisation and on-time implementation on the part of Member States, and of fair political cooperation between neighbouring Member States, may hamper cross-border projects; welcomes the increasing interest of the EU institutions to support cross-border infrastructure and facilities, particularly railway cross-border regional links of significant importance and EU added value; stresses that missing links in rail infrastructure in cross-border regions should be tackled in order to allow efficient and successful rail transport; calls on the Commission, the European Coordinators and the other stakeholders involved to pay equal importance to small-scale and larger TEN-T projects and to short-, medium- and long-term benefits that may be generated through such projects; encourages actors to boost short- term wins; encourages the Commission to facilitate and ensure their inclusion in the CEF financing; 9. Considers that while the comprehensive network is mainly a responsibility of the Member States, in order not to exclude connectivity of certain areas of the EU, both layers of the TEN-T are crucial to EU logistics, bringing capillarity to the core network, and performing last-mile distribution; takes the view that regional networks should not be left outside the European perspective, including in terms of financing and regulatory measures, in particular those measures pertaining to access to the railway network, slot allocation and charges; stresses that missing links in rail infrastructure in cross-border regions should be tackled in order to allow efficient and successful cross-border rail transport; 10. Points out the key role of multimodality in freight logistics, and calls, therefore, for increased involvement of multimodal platforms in Member States\u2019 planning and in the further development of routes; 11. Notes that the distribution of a large number of nodes and freight traffic in the TEN-T network follows highly populated areas and dense networks, including cross-border zones that share capacity with passenger traffic; considers it necessary to optimise how freight infrastructure should be shaped in the TEN-T, in particular in highly congested areas, in an effort to include innovative urban logistic strategies; calls on the Commission, in coordination with the European Coordinators, to assess progress in the implementation of the projects and to urge Member States to deliver; calls, furthermore, on the Commission to reassess the methodology and criteria for establishing freight networks and to ensure, in particular, that investments are made in alternative freight routes with less congested nodes, terminals, airports and ports, also taking into consideration environmental protection and noise reduction; 12. Regrets that Member States\u2019 national infrastructure plans are too often decided without reference to the TEN-T objectives; urges the Commission to examine the reasons for such lack of cooperation and to increase the coordination between the two levels of planning, and suggests adding to the European Semester a chapter on supervising its coherence and clear effectiveness, with appropriate corrective measures; calls on the Commission to prioritise Member State projects that are in line with the TEN-T and that concentrate efforts on those with greater European added value, and to monitor cross-border transport projects; urges the Member States to decide on their national infrastructure plans in accordance with the TEN-T objectives; 13. Notes that Member States experiencing economic and budgetary difficulties are unable to co-finance freight projects as a result of a strict interpretation of the Stability and Growth Pact (SGP); advocates the optimal use of the public and private funding schemes, also in the light of blending the CEF and Horizon 2020 with the European Fund for Strategic Investments and other financial instruments; takes the view that projects carried out as part of the CEF should not be taken into account in calculations of public debt; calls on the Commission to produce a study on whether such a measure would be a suitable means to noticeably increase investments in freight infrastructure; C 242/18 EN Official Journal of the European Union 10.7.2018 Thursday 19 January 2017 ",
        "14. Considers that an efficient EU logistics system requires further coordination beyond physical connectivity and an operational TEN-T network; calls on the Commission to make logistics an integral part of the Core Network Corridors, to increase its coordination with national, regional and local authorities and, in this context, to focus as well on the interconnectivity between the different corridors and regional and urban freight transport networks; calls on the Commission to strengthen the sphere of action of the TEN-T European coordinators to look beyond the geographical scope of the corridors under their respective responsibility, and to cover horizontal policy issues such as multi-modality and efficient freight logistics; calls on the Commission to evaluate this work on logistics and multimodality in the corridors every two years; 15. Consider that poor maintenance of the network can affect the sustainability and performance of TEN-T infrastructure; stresses that transport infrastructure needs not only to be renovated and modernised, but also to be regularly maintained; notes with concern that persistent lack of attention by infrastructure managers and Members States to maintenance is reducing the competitiveness of lines (speed restrictions, reliability, safety), in particular in the case of rail, leading sometimes to closure of lines; calls on the Commission and the Member States, together with the EIB, to study new funding schemes to facilitate investments in maintenance of the network; 16. Asks the Commission to report back regularly to Parliament on the conclusions and measures taken in the Digital Transport and Logistics Forum in order to further support digitalisation of freight transport and logistics; calls for this forum to be continued as long as it remains useful; 17. Stresses the need to guarantee that planned infrastructure meets the effective needs for sustainable logistics, and that it will not be an unsustainable burden on the environment; stresses, in this regard, that the protection of biodiversity and the achievement of EU conservation objectives should be much better integrated into TEN-T planning and implementation; Improved simplification and a new framework for digitalisation 18. Stresses the urgency of greater simplification of documents and administrative and customs procedures across all modes and across the different stages in logistics chains; calls on the Commission and the Member States, under the \u2018better regulation\u2019 agreement, to analyse redundant EU legislation on transport and mobility, to monitor national, regional and local rules that could be in contradiction with EU law and, where such instances are found, to harmonise these rules with EU legislation as soon as possible; calls for a yearly progress report by the Commission on this sector; 19. Urges the Commission to propose, by the end of 2017, a digital framework for electronic information exchange and transport management in multimodal transport (e-freight) with a view to facilitating a simplified, paperless, seamless, transparent, secured and trusted information flow between businesses, customers and authorities, building on established services (such as SafeSeaNet, RFD, e-Manifest, RIS, TAF, ITS); calls on the Commission to ensure a harmonised application of e-transport documents, anti-fraud systems and cyber-security; 20. Calls on the Member States to accept electronic transport documents in general, and to ratify and apply the e-CMR protocol without delay; 21. Underlines the importance of innovation in the use of new technologies, such as digitalisation (e.g. digital freight letters), access to data and data exchange, while maintaining a high level of cyber security and data protection, enabling more efficient transport and logistics solutions, provided interoperability and equal and non-discriminatory access are ensured; calls on the Commission to put forward proposals to ensure the integration, accessibility and protection of data underpinning logistics and freight transport; 22. Calls, with a view to ensuring non-discriminatory treatment in the digital exchange of information, on the Commission and the Member States to develop a system of investment to provide initial IT training and ongoing refresher training on the platforms used for data exchange; 10.7.2018 EN Official Journal of the European Union C 242/19 Thursday 19 January 2017 ",
        "23. Stresses the role that research and innovation can play in developing environmentally sustainable and digitised logistics and in ensuring greater interoperability and interconnectivity of IT systems and services; 24. Highlights the need to further develop information and communication systems, fully deploying the potential of European satellite navigation systems Galileo and EGNOS and related traffic management and information systems in all transport modes and logistics, providing access to all available financial tools to encourage private investment; 25. Calls on the Member States to ensure swift administrative procedures aimed at speeding up the implementation of TEN-T corridors; asks the Commission to ensure that the rules on SGP, State Aid and financial markets do not hinder investments; Shaping and investing in the European Transport System with logistics as a focal point 26. Underlines the need to ensure enough EU funding for the implementation of the TEN-T beyond the present MFF; expects the Commission to present the CEF mid-term review in 2017, proposing a streamlining of measures and resources for the implementation of the priority projects in good time; insists on the \u2018use it or lose it\u2019 principle, whereby unspent CEF funds are made available for upcoming calls for proposals; urges the Commission to assess a proposal for a specific call on logistics in 2017, including multimodal transport and freight as well as cargo solutions in urban nodes, including innovative and alternative transport (i.e. drones, cargo vehicles running on alternative fuels, biking, etc.); 27. Calls on the Commission to urge Member States to make the requisite investments in order to finalise the connections of the EU\u2019s core corridors; 28. Recalls the importance of urban nodes in the whole logistic chain where an important part of transhipments and last-mile distribution takes place; invites the Member States, the Commission and project promoters to put a focus in TEN-T core network corridors on the coordinated development of projects that promote multi-modality in freight logistics, in particular terminal hubs, logistic platforms and urban nodes, based on actual and future transport demand and properly prioritised as regards local, cross-border and corridor-wide impact; 29. Considers that reliability, frequency, flexibility, customer orientation, transport time and price are the main factors taken into account by shippers when choosing between the different methods of transport available; 30. Considers that an efficient logistics system must also be oriented towards future technologies that provide fast, environment-friendly and efficient modes of freight transport; highlights the potential and growing role of automation and autonomation transport for logistics, including automated vehicles, drones and remotely controlled robots; 31. Calls on the Commission to take fully into consideration automation and its impact in its logistic strategy, ensuring its smooth and efficient integration into the TEN-T, and to support research on, and investment in, the development of these key technologies; 32. Stresses the potential of automated, autonomous transport as well as of remote controlled aircrafts (drones) for logistics; calls for measures to ensure, when deploying ITS systems in the network, that automated vehicles and systems interact smoothly with conventional vehicles and vulnerable users; is of the opinion that the future development and widespread use of remotely controlled robots and aircraft systems (drones) foresees new, fast, environment-friendly and efficient modes of freight transport; calls on the Commission to devise a new strategy that guarantees that drones can be integrated into the TEN-T programme efficiently, and to produce a guidebook on the matter for the Member States; C 242/20 EN Official Journal of the European Union 10.7.2018 Thursday 19 January 2017 ",
        "33. Calls on the Commission to take account of the impact that the spread of just-in-time practices is having on the environment, owing to the fact that they increase vehicle traffic; 34. Stresses the need, not least in view of the gradual move towards a circular economy, to integrate outbound and reverse logistics operations with a view to reducing overall vehicle movement volumes; Urgent and more efficient integration of transport modes 35. Stresses the need to concentrate major efforts on the revitalisation of railways and on the strengthening of inland waterways (IWW) as a priority for the EU\u2019s sustainable transport strategy; recognises that railways, in particular, have been losing their market share constantly since the beginning of the economic crisis, and believes, therefore, that the Member States and the Commission should propose new and non-discriminatory initiatives aimed at supporting the development of this sector across Europe; 36. Calls on the Commission to make rail freight services more competitive by means of fully interoperable and interconnected rail networks and by guaranteeing equal access to companies, and to do the same for inland waterway, sea- river, maritime and air transport, enabling each mode to operate on equal terms, and urges it to promote multimodal and intermodal transport; 37. Regards the European Rail Traffic Management System (ERTMS) as a successful European project for the promotion of freight in the rail sector, and welcomes the efforts to accelerate its deployment by establishing milestones per corridor; is aware of the constraints that affect funding of multinational, multi-level (ERTMS) projects; invites the Commission and the European Investment Advisory Hub to come forward with specific funding solutions to ease access to European Fund for Strategic Investments (EFSI) funding for ERTMS deployment in favour of both infrastructure and locomotive installations; 38. Considers that interoperability obstacles and constraints will be significantly reduced through the application by all Member States of the Interoperability Directive; underlines that, in addition, soft measures such as interoperable rolling stock (low wagons, multi-gauge locomotives, etc.) can also contribute to alleviating interoperability restrictions; urges Shift2Rail to analyse the EU market, as well as future developments, and to incentivise the availability of soft, multi- operable infrastructure and rolling stock solutions to support multimodal and combined transport; 39. Points out the need to strengthen combined transport and modernise current EU rules, including those governing intra-Community cabotage and transport documents, so that they are clear, comprehensible and can be implemented by the authorities; welcomes the Commission\u2019s commitment to review Council Directive 92/106/EEC, and urges it to submit the revision without delay; 40. Calls on the Commission and the Member States, without compromising overall safety, to introduce stronger and more effective measures and incentives to encourage rail companies to tackle freight-rail noise, given the adverse health effects of noise pollution, especially as nearly seven million people in the EU are exposed to rail noise levels above the excess exposure threshold, particularly in urban areas; calls, in this regard, on the Commission to introduce freight-rail noise emissions limits; 41. Considers that the shift to rail and water transport should be incentivised, as they reduce congestion and are less polluting than road traffic; 42. Notes that inland waterways must play an increasing role in serving seaports as logistics centres, in particular by moving goods to hinterland and linking the European seas; 10.7.2018 EN Official Journal of the European Union C 242/21 Thursday 19 January 2017 ",
        "43. Welcomes the Commission\u2019s first steps to introduce fuel standards for heavy commercial vehicles (HCVs) and CO 2 limits as well as a GHG reduction target for the road freight sector on the basis of the Paris Agreements; is of the opinion that measures that require a revision of the infrastructure and operational standards of the TEN-T network should only be considered when alternatives such as reducing \u2018empty returns\u2019, better use and availability of alternative fuels, better logistics and powertrains, could not achieve greater efficiency gains with less impact on the infrastructure and the environment; 44. Asks the Commission to assess the feasibility of establishing a single standard method for measuring greenhouse gas emissions along the entire supply chain for all modal transport solutions; 45. Calls on the Commission to foster the development of electric and alternative-powered modes of transport and the necessary infrastructure along the whole TEN-T network, and, especially in town centres, to foster the development of innovative transport schemes involving, for example, the use of electric vehicles and renewable energy sources, and the development of alternative fuels and the necessary infrastructure; stresses that the use of electric light-duty commercial vehicles in last-mile logistics reduces CO 2 emissions in general, as well as local pollutant and noise emissions in particular, and thereby makes a positive contribution to urban air quality; stresses, therefore, the need for charging infrastructure at logistics hubs; 46. Considers that further measures are needed to make road transport more efficient and environmentally friendly in the logistics chain; proposes easing traffic restrictions and ensuring continuity and fully efficient logistics in the core network corridors for HCVs running on clean alternative fuels compliant with the highest emissions, noise, safety and social standards; insists that the core network corridors be extensively provided with, at least, alternative filling stations and safe truck parking areas, including the requisite facilities allowing professional drivers to spend their rest times in decent conditions; 47. Considers that the uptake of cleaner propulsion systems in freight transport should be reinforced by a coordinated and urgent deployment of alternative fuels infrastructure in TEN-T corridors, in line with EU legislation; 48. Stresses the importance of improving the provision of, and access to information on, EU multimodal and logistics services, in particular to SMEs that have limited access to this information; calls on the Commission, in cooperation with network operators and Member States, to facilitate the exchange of current agreements, tools, conventions, legislation and best practices on multimodal transport in the EU, and to provide a handbook, to be available on the internet, to support economic operators; 49. Notes that the digitalisation of services has a role to play in encouraging more environmentally friendly transport solutions; calls, therefore, on the Commission to facilitate, also through a coherent legislative approach at EU level, the access to and sharing of data concerning traffic flows along the corridors and the use of multimodal transport, especially for SMEs, and to secure greater involvement of local operators and public authorities in this sector, in order to improve supply-chain management and make more efficient use of resources and infrastructure, including by pooling best practices; underlines that access to such traffic flow data by actors such as digital map and navigation service providers is fundamental to enabling intermodal transport, more efficient routing, automated driving and intelligent transport systems, as well as \u2018platooning\u2019 (grouping various vehicles) in road freight transport, this latter allowing better use of slipstreaming and thereby reducing emissions and increasing the capacity of roads; 50. Recommends that the fitting of alcohol interlocks \u2014 with a small, scientifically based range of tolerance for measurement \u2014 to all new types of goods transport vehicles be made compulsory; Better training and job conditions to attract new professionals 51. Notes that the working and living conditions of the workforce in the logistic chain have deteriorated substantially in the past years, making this sector less attractive for new generations, in particular for mobile workers; C 242/22 EN Official Journal of the European Union 10.7.2018 Thursday 19 January 2017 ",
        "52. Notes with concern that the logistics sector is facing a workforce shortage, that technological development will create further challenges in the coming years and that slow adaptation of the workforce to new technologies, including digital technologies, could undermine the sector\u2019s performance; calls on the Commission to identify training and learning needs at EU level, as well as to identify the working conditions, costs and barriers that discourage the workforce from entering the transport sector, and to propose, as a matter of urgency, measures to make it more attractive to young people and to future generations; regards this as an opportunity to increase the proportion of women, including through positive discrimination measures, and of new entrants on the transport labour market, including nationals from third countries; believes, furthermore, that strategic investment in training and better work conditions should include initiatives for knowledge development within the public sector, in order to include freight issues in a better manner in social planning, and the development of demonstration and test arenas, where research and innovation related to freight and logistics can be applied and tested under real conditions; 53. Calls on the Commission to evaluate the possibility of financial investment in dual and vocational training in the transport sector; 54. Urges Commission and the Member States to provide sufficient and safe parking space in the TENT-t corridors to avoid increasing security issues with mobile transport workers; 55. Calls on the Commission and the Member States to take into consideration Parliament\u2019s recent recommendations on social-economic aspects in the transport sector and on combating unfair practices in the labour market; notes that legislation concerning social and working conditions must respect all fundamental freedoms of the EU and may not restrict fair competition or create any further administrative burden; Better statistical information on logistics needed 56. Underlines the need for better intermodal transport and performance statistics for the logistics sector in order to facilitate forecast and review of policy and investment measures, as well as to provide valuable information for operators; calls on the Commission to work with stakeholders to develop an EU-wide framework for multimodal transport and logistics statistical data, including developing new indicators that better reflect real freight trends; o o o 57.

        "E. whereas social dialogue can contribute positively to growth, employment and competitiveness; whereas the Union is obliged to recognise and promote the role of the social partners, facilitate dialogue between them and respect their autonomy, including as regards wage-setting, the right to negotiate, conclude and enforce collective agreements and the right to take collective action in accordance with national law and practices; whereas the European Pillar of Social Rights should encourage social partners and Member States to establish standards higher than those agreed at European level; whereas the Commission consults the social partners on the possible direction of Union action in the social policy field; whereas continuous support is needed for social dialogue at all levels; F. whereas it is crucial that companies behave in a socially responsible way, with real regard for sustainability and the interests of society; whereas it is valuable to involve workers in decision making; whereas social economy enterprises, such as cooperatives, provide a good example in terms of creating quality employment, supporting social inclusion and promoting a participatory economy; G. whereas fundamental social rights apply to all people in the EU and the existing body of Union legislation regulating labour, product and service markets applies to all Member States; whereas economic integration makes Member States interdependent in terms of their capacity to ensure decent working conditions and maintain social cohesion; whereas a functioning single market requires a solid core of social rights for workers to prevent competition on the basis of labour conditions; whereas the principle of subsidiarity as defined in the Treaties justifies action at Union level by reason of the scale or effects of the proposed action; whereas the achievement of the EU\u2019s social objectives also depends on national legislation and on well-developed national social systems; whereas regional differences between wage levels and social security systems are to some extent unavoidable but care should be taken to ensure that they do not create downward pressure on working and living conditions; whereas upward social and economic convergence is very important for the proper functioning of the Union; whereas the Union does not harmonise national social security systems but coordinates them, promotes their development and facilitates efficient social security protection of people exercising their right to free movement; whereas regulatory developments need to keep pace with technological and other innovation in order to provide legal certainty and promote economic development through fair competition; whereas the implementation of the European Pillar of Social Rights will require multi-level action, cross-sectoral approaches and full involvement of stakeholders; whereas provisions on workers\u2019 rest time should take into account, where applicable, a common weekly day of rest recognised by tradition and custom in the country or region; H. whereas European welfare states need to be updated and strengthened to support upward transitions into and within the labour market and to maintain economic security throughout people\u2019s lives; whereas, with the labour market becoming more complex, it is natural that the welfare state also needs to adapt its mechanisms and instruments in order to manage correctly the various social risks arising; whereas this updating process should also improve people\u2019s access to and interaction with the welfare state and facilitate the application of relevant rules, including for SMEs; whereas, however, the role of welfare states is broader than what concerns the labour market; it includes inter alia also the operation of social security systems, the fight against poverty and social exclusion and investment in education, childcare, healthcare, social services and other essential services; whereas \u2018social investments\u2019 that support people\u2019s development from early childhood until old age have a crucial role in enabling people to participate fully in a 21st century society and economy; whereas a major effort will be needed to reach the poverty reduction and social inclusion target of the Europe 2020 Strategy; whereas housing is a pressing issue in many Member States and many households are spending a high proportion of their disposable income on housing and energy costs; I. whereas ILO Recommendation No 202 provides that social protection floors should comprise at least the following basic social protection guarantees: (a) access to a nationally defined set of goods and services, in particular essential health care, including maternity care, that meets the criteria of availability, accessibility, acceptability and quality; (b) basic income security for children, at least at a nationally defined minimum level, providing access to nutrition, 10.7.2018 EN Official Journal of the European Union C 242/29 Thursday 19 January 2017 ",

        "disabilities are not fully integrated into the economy and society; whereas the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD) has been ratified by the EU and its principles should therefore be mainstreamed within the Pillar of Social Rights; whereas the negative impact of the crisis on access to healthcare has often come with a delay, and many people have found themselves unable to access healthcare even if services are formally covered, in particular because they cannot afford co-payments or experience waiting lists; N. whereas women still face many forms of discrimination in the EU and are still underrepresented in all areas of decision making; O. whereas gender equality is enshrined in the EU Treaties and in the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights and is a core EU value; whereas, nevertheless, women remain underrepresented in the labour market as a whole, with the employment rate for men standing at 75,6 % compared with 64,5 % for women, and overrepresented in part-time work and the lowest-paid sectors, in addition to receiving lower hourly wages, leading to a gender pay gap of 16 % and contributing to a pension gap of 39 %, with significant differences between Member States; whereas gender-based discrimination continues to prevail in recruitment procedures in the Member States, despite women surpassing men in educational attainment; P. whereas social rights, services and adequate income are gendered issues, as more women are in low-income jobs, at higher risk of poverty, and more dependent on social services, both public and private, and hold the traditional role of caregiver for both children and older members of the family and the primary responsibility for household needs, resulting overall in lower pensions for women; Q. whereas the 2002 Barcelona targets are far from being reached, while the Charter of Fundamental Rights states that children have a right to protection and care, and whereas this has a dramatic impact on female labour market participation, gender equality, work-life balance and female poverty; R. whereas Europe can go much further in developing a cluster of sectors focused on supporting people\u2019s health, knowledge and ability to participate in the economy; whereas people-focused services such as education, healthcare, childcare, other care services as well as sport contain an important job creation potential and should not be viewed as a cost to the economy but rather as enabling factors of sustainable prosperity; S. whereas a strategic approach is needed to the challenges posed by the ageing and shrinking of the EU\u2019s working-age population, notably as regards future skills shortages and mismatches in the EU labour market and projected evolution of economic dependence ratios, taking into account also third country nationals legally residing in the EU; whereas it is important to promote opportunities for professional mobility, in particular among young people, including those following vocational training through apprenticeships; 1. Calls on the Commission to build on the review of the social acquis and of EU employment and social policies as well as on the outcomes of the 2016 public consultation by making proposals for a solid European Pillar of Social Rights (EPSR) that is not limited to a declaration of principles or good intentions but reinforces social rights through concrete and specific tools (legislation, policy-making mechanisms and financial instruments), delivering a positive impact on people\u2019s lives in the short and medium term and enabling support for European construction in the 21st century by effectively upholding the Treaties\u2019 social objectives, supporting national welfare states, strengthening cohesion, solidarity and upward convergence in economic and social outcomes, ensuring adequate social protection, reducing inequality, achieving long overdue progress in reducing poverty and social exclusion, facilitating national reform efforts through benchmarking and helping to improve the functioning of the Economic and Monetary Union (EMU) and of the EU\u2019s single market; 10.7.2018 EN Official Journal of the European Union C 242/31 Thursday 19 January 2017 ",
        "2. Considers that the European Pillar of Social Rights should also help to ensure proper application of international labour standards and help to update the social acquis; is of the view that standards to be articulated by the European Pillar of Social Rights should apply to all countries participating in the single market in order to maintain a level playing field and that legislation, governance mechanisms and financial instruments relevant for their achievement should apply to all EU Member States; underlines that the Pillar of Social Rights should be taken into account in EU economic policies; finds that the specific constraints of euro area membership call for additional specific social targets and standards to be established and relevant financial support to be considered at the euro area level while remaining open to non-euro area Member States on a voluntary basis; points to the possibility of using the enhanced cooperation mechanism under Article 20 of the TEU if necessary to build a solid European Pillar of Social Rights; 3. Emphasises that the EPSR should equip people living in the EU with stronger means of keeping control over their lives, enabling them to live a dignified life and realise their aspirations by mitigating various social risks arising over the course of their entire life and empowering people to participate fully in society and be able to adapt to frequent technological and economic changes, including through up-skilling and support for entrepreneurship; underlines that the EPSR should make markets work for shared prosperity, wellbeing and sustainable development in the context of a highly competitive social market economy, aimed at full employment and social progress and making use also of an industrial policy at the EU level; considers that the Pillar should do so by promoting relevant social standards and by empowering national welfare states to maintain social cohesion and equality across the EU through adequate, accessible and financially sustainable social protection systems and social inclusion policies; emphasises that it should also facilitate free movement of workers in a deeper and fairer European labour market; highlights the fact that the EPSR should also contribute to upholding the principles of equal treatment, non-discrimination and equal opportunities through employment and social policies; recommends that the Pillar thus enable effective realisation of existing social rights and that it set out new rights where justified in view of new technological and socio-economic developments; believes that, in these ways, the Pillar will also enhance the legitimacy of the EU; Updating existing labour and social standards 4. Calls on the social partners and the Commission to work together to present a proposal for a framework directive on decent working conditions in all forms of employment, extending existing minimum standards to new kinds of employment relationships, based on a thorough impact assessment; considers that this framework directive should improve enforcement of EU law, increase legal certainty across the single market and prevent discrimination by complementing existing EU law and ensuring for every worker a core set of enforceable rights, regardless of the type of contract or employment relationship, including equal treatment, health and safety protection, protection during maternity leave, provisions on working time and rest time, work-life balance, access to training, in-work support for people with disabilities, adequate information, consultation and participation rights, freedom of association and representation, collective bargaining and collective action; underlines that this framework directive should apply to employees and all workers in non-standard forms of employment, without necessarily amending already existing directives; recalls that existing labour rights are applied by Member States in accordance with national and EU law; calls also for more effective and efficient implementation and control of existing labour standards in order to improve the enforceability of rights and tackle undeclared work; Working conditions 5. Recognises that a certain variety of employment contracts is useful for efficient matching of workers and employers; recalls, however, the risk of labour market dualism and the danger of people being trapped in insecure contracts without a tangible prospect of upward transitions; stresses the importance of open-ended employment contracts for socio-economic security and points to the benefits which such contracts provide to employers across numerous sectors; supports also promotion of social economy business models; calls on the Commission to broaden the Written Statement Directive (91/ 533/EEC) to cover all forms of employment and employment relationships; calls for the framework directive on decent working conditions also to include relevant existing minimum standards to be ensured in certain specific relationships, in particular: C 242/32 EN Official Journal of the European Union 10.7.2018 Thursday 19 January 2017 ",

Acknowledges the declining labour share of total income in Europe over the past decades; emphasises the need for renewed upward social convergence and the gender pay gap to be closed throughout the EU in order to boost demand, enable sustainable and inclusive growth and reduce inequalities; recognises that decent living wages are important as a means of avoiding in-work poverty; calls on the Commission to support actively wider coverage for collective agreements in line with Member States\u2019 national traditions and practices and with due respect for the autonomy of social partners; recommends the establishment of wage floors in the form of a national minimum wage, where applicable, with due respect for the practices of each Member State and after consulting the social partners; calls on the Commission to help to exchange best practices in this regard; 7. Recalls that the right to healthy and safe working conditions also involves protection against workplace risks as well as limitations on working time and provisions on minimum rest periods and annual leave; urges the Member States to fully implement the relevant legislation; awaits Commission proposals for concrete measures to uphold this right effectively for all workers, including seasonal and contract workers, and comprising also measures to prevent violence against women or harassment; notes that such measures should be based on an impact assessment, reflecting all current knowledge about health and safety risks and taking into account new ways of working associated with digitalisation and other technological developments; 8. Stresses the importance of the right of collective bargaining and action as a fundamental right enshrined in EU primary law; expects the Commission to step up concrete support for strengthening and respecting social dialogue at all levels and sectors, in particular where it is not sufficiently well developed, while taking into account different national practices; recognises the benefits of involving workers in company management, including in transnational companies, and of their information, consultation and participation, also with a view to making good use of new forms of work organisation, ensuring that work is meaningful and rewarding, and anticipating economic change; calls for monitoring of the application of European legislation on European Works Councils and the information and consultation of workers and for effective measures to ensure that company restructuring takes place in a socially responsible manner; 9. Emphasises the need for comprehensive, reliable and regularly updated data on the quality of work and employment which can be used for monitoring the quality of work and employment over time and provide evidence for policy making on the topic; calls on Eurofound to further develop its activities in monitoring job quality and working life throughout its European working conditions survey based on its concept of job quality as comprising earnings, prospects, physical 10.7.2018 EN Official Journal of the European Union C 242/33 Thursday 19 January 2017 ",

Points out that social protection rights are individual rights; supports more integrated provision of social protection benefits and quality social services as a way to make the welfare state more understandable and accessible while not weakening social protection; underlines the need for adequate social protection and social investment throughout people\u2019s lives, enabling everyone to participate fully in society and the economy and sustaining decent living standards; points to the importance of informing citizens about social rights and to the potential of accessible e-government solutions, possibly including a European social security card, with strong data protection guarantees, which could improve EU social security coordination and individual awareness, and also help mobile workers clarify and safeguard their contributions and entitlements in home and host countries and facilitate the work of national labour inspectorates; highlights the importance of personalised, face-to-face support, in particular for excluded and vulnerable households; 11. Agrees with the importance of universal access to timely, good-quality and affordable preventative and curative health care and to medicines; considers this as a right that must be upheld, including in rural areas and cross-border regions; emphasises that all residents must be covered by health insurance; agrees that increased health prevention and disease prevention is an obvious social investment that pays for itself, also through healthier ageing; 12. Is aware that rising life expectancy and a shrinking workforce pose a challenge to the sustainability and adequacy of pension systems and to intergenerational solidarity; notes that closing the gender pension gap must also be a priority in this regard; reaffirms that the best response is to increase the overall employment rate through employment models linked to full pension insurance coverage and with particular attention being given to the younger generation and those most excluded from the labour market; considers that pensionable ages should reflect, besides life expectancy, other factors to be defined at national level, among them developments in productivity, the economic dependency ratio and differences in job arduousness; recalls the importance of investments in active ageing and of arrangements enabling people who have reached their pensionable age to have the option to continue working at their desired level of intensity while being able to draw partially on their pension if they work less than full-time; 13. Calls on the Commission to carry out a substantive analysis of the best practice to assist Member States in the calculation of minimum pensions; 14. Recommends that all workers should be covered by insurance against unemployment or involuntary part-time employment, coupled with job-search assistance and investment in (re)-training in line with the conditions laid down by each Member State in conjunction with the social partners; recalls that adequate unemployment benefits improve the matching process and are therefore useful for productivity, while at the same time playing a key role in preventing and reducing poverty; considers that the EPSR should recommend quality benchmarks for national unemployment insurance schemes, in particular regarding their coverage, activation requirements, a link between duration of support and the average national job-search period, and the quality of support provided by job centres; 15. Highlights the importance of adequate minimum income schemes for maintaining human dignity and combating poverty and social exclusion, as well as their role as a form of social investment in enabling people to participate in society, and to undertake training and/or look for work; invites the Commission and the Member States to assess minimum income schemes in the European Union, including whether the schemes enable households to meet their needs; invites the Commission and the Member States to evaluate on this basis the manner and the means of providing an adequate minimum income in all Member States and to consider further steps in support of social convergence across the European Union, taking into account the economic and social circumstances of each Member State, as well as national practices and traditions; C 242/34 EN Official Journal of the European Union 10.7.2018 Thursday 19 January 2017 ",

Notes with concern that availability and affordability of long-term care remain a major problem across Europe, trapping informal family carers at home and preventing them from pursuing their careers; deplores frequent abuses of carers employed through work agencies or on an informal basis; considers access to quality and affordable long-term care services, including home-based care and independent living schemes, to be a right that should be upheld with the support of adequately qualified professionals employed under decent conditions; believes that adequate public services and assistance should therefore be put in place for households, in particularly those living on low incomes, to avoid institutionalisation and the risk of poverty; repeats its call for legislation on carers\u2019 leave to limit the implications on remuneration and social protection entitlements when workers temporarily need to take care of relatives; calls on the Commission to set out a concrete action plan in this area, including targets on care for elderly persons, persons with disabilities and other dependants, similar to the Barcelona targets, with monitoring tools which should measure quality, accessibility and affordability; calls also for greater sharing and take-up of best practices in this area; 18. Considers child poverty to be a major issue on which Europe should \u2018act big\u2019; stresses the right to universal education, health and social security systems as basic conditions for combating poverty, in particular among children; bearing in mind this objective, calls on the Commission and the Member States to ensure the swift implementation of the 2013 recommendation on \u2018Investing in children \u2014 breaking the cycle of disadvantage\u2019, and for concrete steps to be taken towards a child guarantee in all Member States, so that every child now living at risk of poverty has access to free healthcare, free education, free childcare, decent housing and proper nutrition; points to the necessary connection with programmes offering support and opportunities for parents to come out of social exclusion situations and to integrate the labour market; recognises that these policies require adequate financing at national level and support from the European Structural and Investment Funds; 19. Calls on the Member States to deliver on the right to adequate housing by ensuring access to quality and affordable housing of adequate size for all, and to prevent and reduce homelessness with a view to its gradual elimination; urges them to enact legislation and/or other measures as needed in order to ensure that access to social housing or adequate housing benefits are provided for those in need, obviously including homeless people and families, and that vulnerable people and poor households are protected against eviction or that adequate alternative housing is provided to them; calls for provision of housing to be combined with relevant social services supporting social and economic inclusion; calls for effective measures to be taken to help young people on low incomes set up their own households; highlights investments in energy- efficient social housing as a win-win for jobs, the environment, reduction of energy poverty and realisation of social rights; calls for greater use of relevant European financial instruments to support urban renewal and affordable, accessible and energy-efficient housing provision and to promote the development of social housing in regions where it is underdeveloped; calls for all forms of criminalisation of poverty, such as measures unfairly sanctioning homelessness or other forms of material deprivation, to be abolished; 10.7.2018 EN Official Journal of the European Union C 242/35 Thursday 19 January 2017 ",

Considers that, in our increasingly digitalised world, low-qualified people not only have diminished employment opportunities, but are also more vulnerable to long-term unemployment and experience greater difficulties in gaining access to services and participating fully in society, a situation which is not only detrimental to the individual but is also highly costly to the economy and society as a whole; supports therefore a Skills Guarantee as a new right for everyone, at every stage of life, to acquire fundamental skills for the 21st century, including literacy, numeracy, digital and media literacy, critical thinking, social skills and relevant skills needed for the green and circular economy, taking into account emerging industries and key growth sectors and ensuring full outreach to people in disadvantaged situations, including those with disabilities, asylum-seekers, long-term unemployed people and underrepresented groups; stresses that education systems should be inclusive, providing good-quality education to the whole population, enabling people to be active European citizens, preparing them to be able to learn and adapt throughout their lives and responding to societal and labour market needs; considers that completion of secondary education should be obligatory in 21st-century Europe and that relevant programmes must be available to give all young people who have dropped out from primary or secondary school a new chance; considers that the Skills Guarantee should involve individualised assessment of learning needs, a quality learning offer and systematic validation of the skills and competences acquired, enabling their easy recognition on the labour market; points to the need to ensure widespread access to broadband in order to enable digital literacy; highlights the Skills Guarantee as an important social investment, requiring proper implementation and adequate financing, also with support from the European Structural and Investment Funds; 22. Is worried at the spread of socio-economic uncertainty and the deterioration of working conditions for many workers; recognises that many workers in non-standard forms of employment have difficulties in exercising their rights at work or gaining access to social security benefits and that women and migrants are disproportionately affected by this problem; calls on the Commission to monitor closely the implementation and enforcement of the Fixed-Term Work Directive, the Part-Time Work Directive and the Temporary Agency Work Directive; calls on the Commission and the Member States to take steps to improve the portability of social rights acquired in different activities; stresses the importance of ensuring sufficient capacities to provide adequate social protection at Member State level for people in all forms of employment, standard and non-standard employment relationships as well as self-employment; calls on the Commission to propose a recommendation in this regard; considers in particular that: (a) Member States should organise social security schemes in such a way as to enable all people in all employment forms, employment relationships and self-employment to accumulate entitlements providing income security in situations such as unemployment, involuntary part-time work, health problems, older age or career breaks for child-raising, other care or training reasons; C 242/36 EN Official Journal of the European Union 10.7.2018 Thursday 19 January 2017 ",
        "(b) starting from their first entry into the labour market, all people in all employment forms, employment relationships and self-employment should have a personal activity account, easily accessible through personal contact and electronic means, duly taking into account the needs of persons with disabilities, where they could consult their accumulated social entitlements and other social rights, including to lifelong learning, and where they could learn about their portability across countries if applicable; such personal activity accounts should be made available in a cost-effective way and adequate data protection should be ensured; (c) digital platforms and other intermediaries should have an obligation to report all work undertaken through them to the competent authorities for the purpose of ensuring adequate contributions and protection through social and health insurance for all workers; 23. Points out that professional transitions require adequate investment, both in the institutional capacity of public employment services and to assist individual job-search and upskilling at the earliest stage possible; believes proactive employment policies such as training and placement assistance to be worthwhile tools for the reintegration of the unemployed into the labour market, regardless of age; recalls the useful role of the European Social Fund in supporting active labour market policies throughout Europe and of the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund, which supports re- skilling and a return to employment in case of regional economic shocks and large-scale lay-offs; recalls, furthermore, the important role of social security schemes in supporting secure transitions; emphasises that the preservation and portability of social entitlements accumulated during the career and life-cycle should be ensured to facilitate job and professional transitions; 24. Emphasises that a proactive employment policy implies public support for developing sectors with important employment potential and in many countries also a need to expand the role of public employment services and ensure that they have adequate capacity for direct contact with business, so that re-training and other assistance to jobseekers is provided in line with the profile of the jobseeker and the needs of the local economy; calls for full implementation of the Youth Guarantee for all people under 30, with an emphasis on quality offers and effective outreach to all NEETs, and of the Council recommendation on the long-term unemployed, including through the development of the additional measures required to ensure accessibility of these policies for persons with support needs; stresses the need to take into account the needs of older workers and job seekers and to promote cooperation between younger and older workers; highlights these policies as important structural reforms and social investments that are in need of adequate financing from both European and national levels, including from the European Social Fund, the Youth Employment Initiative and/or other instruments; 25. Recalls that women are more likely to be subject to uncertain and low-paid employment and to interruptions in their career, and that this has repercussions for their entire lives; considers that decisive progress is urgently needed in the area of gender equality and work-life balance in order to eliminate persisting discrimination; awaits Commission proposals in this area as announced in its 2017 work programme, in particular as regards the following: (a) existing mechanisms to ensure equal treatment between men and women should be strengthened, persisting gender gaps in pay and pensions should be closed, and occupational segregation should be reduced; to this end, implementation and enforcement of Directive 2006/54/EC should be monitored and the directive should be revised if necessary; the European Pact for gender equality for 2011-2020 and the Strategic engagement for gender equality 2016-2019 should continue to be pursued, also through annual gender equality reports; (b) there is a need for new effective measures at both European and national levels for the reconciliation of professional, private and family life, including legislative proposals as regards maternity leave, paternity leave, parental leave, carers\u2019 leave, access to quality care services and flexible working time arrangements; equal take-up of leave arrangements by men and women across all categories of workers should be encouraged in order to improve women\u2019s access to and position within the labour market, strengthen the role of fathers in bringing up their children and facilitate work-life balance; the Commission should also support Member States in sharing and adopting good practices in this area; 10.7.2018 EN Official Journal of the European Union C 242/37 Thursday 19 January 2017 ",
        "26. Recalls that the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the EU prohibits any discrimination on grounds such as sex, race, colour, ethnic or social origin, genetic features, language, religion or belief, political or any other opinion, membership of a national minority, property, birth, disability, age or sexual orientation; emphasises that all people should enjoy equal opportunities throughout their lives, including when looking for work and at work; highlights the need for proper implementation of the Employment Equality Directive 2000/78/EC and the Racial Equality Directive 2000/43/EC; urges the Member States to step up implementation and the Commission to evaluate the enforcement of existing measures to ensure non-discrimination and equal opportunities and to enhance labour market participation and social integration of under- represented groups; calls on the Commission to propose new concrete recommendations or other measures in this regard if needed; recalls that the Equal Treatment Directive proposed in 2008 and not yet adopted represents a missing element in the legislative framework concerning non-discrimination; draws attention to European and national case law indicating that a duty of reasonable accommodation for all grounds of discrimination should be laid down in EU and national law, provided that this does not impose a disproportionate burden on employers or service providers; calls on the Commission to monitor the legal frameworks and policies of Member States in line with applicable EU legislation to ensure integration, equal treatment and decent working conditions are guaranteed to all people with refugee status; stresses that access to justice and protection should be ensured to all victims of exploitation and discrimination; Labour mobility 27. Emphasises that free movement of people is one of the greatest achievements of the EU and that free movement of workers is a cornerstone of the internal market, which plays an important role in enhancing convergence and integration among Member States; underlines that mobility within the EU is an opportunity and a fundamental right whose exercise must be supported, including through a smoothly functioning system of social security coordination; calls for proper implementation and enforcement of EU rules regarding mobility of workers and cross-border provision of services; calls, moreover, for support to be provided for labour mobility through adequate language training at all levels of education, improved comparability of education systems and recognition of professional qualifications, readily available information on the rights and duties of mobile workers, and measures ensuring decent working conditions and effective cooperation among public employment services across Europe; notes that mobility should not be the result of inadequate employment opportunities or inadequate social protection in workers\u2019 home regions as prolonged workforce outflows may hinder economic convergence; points therefore to the importance of cohesion policy and other instruments for territorially balanced economic development; considers that labour mobility should not be abused to undermine host countries\u2019 social standards through fraud or circumvention of law; highlights the fact that mobile workers are usually net contributors to host countries\u2019 public budgets; calls for adequate investments in public services in areas experiencing population increases and points to the support which the European Social Fund can provide in this respect; 28. Calls for the EU and the Member States to take into account the social impact of mobility on the increasing number of transnational families, e.g. by providing leave opportunities to care for a family member in another country and ensuring the transferability and comparability of education systems in terms of the mobility of school-age children; 29. Calls on the Member States to make it mandatory for employers to provide an employment contract in a language known by EU mobile citizens, in order to make the labour contract understandable for workers; Building up the means to achieve results in practice 30. Calls on the Commission to build on the outcomes of the public consultation and on the EU institutions\u2019 views by putting forward a clear roadmap of concrete measures for full practical implementation of the European Pillar of Social Rights and full pursuit of the Treaties\u2019 social objectives; highlights the fact that, in order to protect fundamental social rights, provisions such as Articles 8, 9 and 10 of the TFEU should be properly applied, in EU policy making and all actions of the EU institutions, including through social impact assessments; C 242/38 EN Official Journal of the European Union 10.7.2018 Thursday 19 January 2017 ",
        "31. Calls for a social protocol to be introduced in the Treaties when they are revised, in order to strengthen fundamental social rights in relation to economic freedoms; 32. Calls on the Member States to sign and ratify the revised European Social Charter and the European Convention on Social Security (ETS No 78); encourages the Commission to examine the steps required for accession of the European Union to the revised Charter and to propose a time-line for this objective; 33. Calls on the Commission to include gender mainstreaming as an integral part of the EPSR and to include systematic gender impact assessments as part of the fundamental rights compliance assessment; 34. Is concerned at the persisting negative impact of the prolonged economic crisis which Europe underwent in the first half of this decade and which impacted some countries and regions more than others; considers that the objective of upward economic and social convergence should be underpinned by a set of targets, building on the Europe 2020 strategy and the Sustainable Development Goals, serving to guide the coordination of economic, employment and social policies in the EU and providing a compass for the euro area where special attention to upward economic and social convergence is needed; 35. Draws attention to the two-way link between social conditions and economic performance; calls for the Europe 2020 targets, the existing scoreboard of key employment and social indicators in the Joint Employment Report and the potential new Convergence Code to be directly and transparently taken into account in formulating country-specific recommendations and the euro area recommendation, as well as in the utilisation of EU instruments; considers that the instruments of the European Employment Strategy and social open method of coordination should also be reinforced to this end; urges a stronger role for the macroeconomic dialogue with social partners in the formulation of the economic policy mix at European level; considers macro-social surveillance to be of great importance in ensuring that economic imbalances are not reduced at the expense of the employment and social situation and preventing a race to the bottom in terms of social standards in the EU; reiterates its call for a European agenda of reforms and investments aimed at strengthening growth potential based on quality jobs and productivity to promote fair, robust, efficient and sustainable welfare systems, and to foster a sustainable transition of Member States\u2019 economies towards greater resource efficiency; 36. Considers that promoting women\u2019s participation in the labour market and their economic independence is crucial for the purpose of meeting the Europe 2020 target of a 75 % overall employment rate and would boost GDP; calls on the Commission and the Member States, therefore, to strengthen policies and increase investment supporting female employment in quality jobs, particularly in sectors and positions where women are underrepresented, such as in the science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) and green economy sectors, or senior management positions across all sectors; 37. Notes that women and girls are disproportionately affected by poverty and social exclusion, and calls for a renewed political impetus for an ambitious European anti-poverty strategy and a fresh commitment to meet the European 2020 anti-poverty targets; urges the Member States to outline detailed anti-poverty national strategy plans, and the Commission to emphasise poverty reduction within the European Semester; 38. Calls on the Member States and the Commission to work towards ensuring an appropriate level of social investments which are essential for the cohesion of society and have a clear positive impact on economic growth in the short and long term (e.g. childcare, education, the Youth Guarantee and the Skills Guarantee); considers that the assessment of the quality of public spending should also reflect this concern; 39. Reiterates its call for joint meetings to be held between the EPSCO and ECOFIN Council formations with a view to promoting better coordinated socio-economic policies, as well as for regular meetings of euro area labour and social affairs ministers serving to improve policy coordination within the Eurozone and properly address social imbalances; 40. Highlights the fact that current-day phenomena of capital-intensive production and the important contribution of intangible assets to the creation of added value on the one hand, and high rates of inequality, unemployment, the continuing rise in \u2018atypical\u2019 work and the declining labour share of total income on the other hand imply a need to broaden the financial base for welfare systems, with fiscal neutrality, in order to provide adequate social protection and quality 10.7.2018 EN Official Journal of the European Union C 242/39 Thursday 19 January 2017 ",

Considers that the European Pillar of Social Rights can only be credible if accompanied by adequate financing at national and European level, ensuring that Member States are able to achieve the commonly agreed objectives; reiterates its call for accelerated implementation of relevant operational programmes and revision of the MFF 2014-2020 where needed in order to cope with the increased needs; calls, in particular, for further strengthening of the Youth Employment Initiative and further steps to ensure easier access to and full use of the European Social Fund, the EGF and the FEAD; considers that these financial instruments should remain available to all the Member States and be reinforced as needed, including as regards education and training, the Skills Guarantee, child poverty and unforeseen new challenges such as labour market integration of refugees; believes that the rule allocating 20 % of national ESF envelopes for the fight against poverty and social exclusion must be upheld; 42. Calls for further EU support to be provided for institutional capacity-building, e.g. as regards social dialogue, the European network of public employment services, the Electronic Exchange of Social Security Information and the platform against undeclared work, which could evolve in the longer term towards a European system of labour inspectorates; points, in this context, to the importance of the Programme for Employment and Social Innovation (EaSI) and ESF support for relevant capacity-building at national level; 43. Calls on the Commission and the EIB Group to develop further the Investment Plan for Europe in order to strengthen investment in economic recovery, quality job creation, sustainable development and social investment in people\u2019s current and future capacities to engage in the labour market; 44. Considers that the social impact of economic adjustment within the euro area could be alleviated and upward economic and social convergence strengthened through adequate financing so as to avoid a further deterioration as regards inequalities and the growth potential of Member States and to cope with severe macroeconomic shocks while increasing the competitiveness and stability of Member States\u2019 economies; invites the Commission, the Council and other relevant bodies, therefore, to address this issue in further discussions; 45. Calls on the Commission to put forward its proposals on the European Pillar of Social Rights on the occasion of the issuing of its announced White Paper on the future of the EU and EMU; 46. Calls on the Commission, the European External Action Service and the Member States to pursue external action coherent with the European Pillar of Social Rights, in particular by promoting the implementation of the UN conventions and Sustainable Development Goals, the ILO conventions, the relevant G20 conclusions, the relevant Council of Europe conventions and the EU\u2019s trade agreements and strategic partnerships; 47. Considers that the EPSR should be adopted in 2017 as an agreement between Parliament, the Commission and the European Council, involving the social partners and civil society at the highest level, and should contain a clear roadmap for implementation; invites the Commission to propose mechanisms for adequate involvement of all the relevant stakeholders at all relevant levels in the implementation of the EPSR; o o o 48.

Suggests, in particular, stepping up efforts to create more uniform electronic customs requirements and risk- assessment programmes at EU level within the time imparted by the UCC, in order to ensure that the arrival, transit and exit of goods are registered in the EU as effectively as possible \u2014 while not compromising security \u2014 by interconnecting Member States\u2019 systems to form a coherent electronic system based on the same data model and common movement systems; believes that the Commission should take a proactive approach in this respect, in particular through a co-financing arrangement to ensure the development of interoperable IT systems and to guarantee interoperability with other IT systems for health and animal health certificates; 3.

Reminds the Commission of its commitment to creating a genuine Digital Single Market, of which the facilitation of trade from e-commerce should be a key component; stresses that every economic operator should respect standards on customs processes in order to avoid loopholes in customs procedures, and acknowledges that existing simplified customs procedures should not be taken away from economic operators if they are compatible with safety, security and intellectual property rules, for example in the case of the express delivery operators of low-value shipments, who with the UCC provisions will be subject to standard customs processes that could constitute red tape and hamper growth in e-commerce; 6. Asks the Commission to take the opportunity of the current drafting of implementation measures to address the abovementioned objectives and to swiftly rectify any legal shortcomings, in order to maximise the opportunities of the Customs Union; 7. Suggests that the Commission clarify that a customs debt through non-compliance can also be extinguished in cases where it may be established by appropriate evidence that there is no attempt at deception, e.g. in the cases of temporary storage and introduction of non-Union goods into the customs territory of the Union; C 242/42 EN Official Journal of the European Union 10.7.2018 Thursday 19 January 2017 ",

        "B. whereas the most recent Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2016/1675 supplementing Directive (EU) 2015/849 by identifying high-risk third countries with strategic deficiencies has been in force since 23 September 2016; C. whereas Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2016/1675 will still remain in force even if the amending delegated regulation is rejected; D. whereas the list of countries, including after the amendment introduced in the amending delegated regulation adopted by the Commission on 24 November 2016, matches those identified by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) at their 28th plenary meeting from 19 to 21 October 2016; E. whereas, as stipulated in Recital 28 of 4AMLD and repeated in the explanatory memorandum (C(2016)4180) to Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2016/1675, the Commission assessment is an autonomous process; whereas the Commission is thus free to move beyond FATF standards, either by keeping a third country on its list even if delisted by FATF, or by including additional third countries as long as this is in line with the specific criteria set out in Article 9 (2) of 4AMLD; F. whereas the Commission assessment is an autonomous process which has to be carried out in a comprehensive and unbiased manner, assessing all third countries based on the same criteria defined in Article 9 of Directive (EU) 2015/ 849; G. whereas the Commission assessment must be a fully independent and non-politicised process; H. whereas the Commission, in its letter of 26 October 2016, states that it has to identify high-risk countries exclusively on the grounds listed in Article 9(2) of 4AMLD, only relating to AML and CTF deficiencies; I. whereas the evidence gathered by the Parliament\u2019s two Special Committees, Committee on Tax Rulings and Other Measures Similar in Nature or Effect and the Inquiry Committee on Money Laundering, Tax Avoidance and Tax Evasion indicates that there may indeed be AML/CTF deficiencies as regards several aspects of Article 9(2) in some countries not included in the present list of high-risk third countries; J. whereas, in addition, Parliament believes that the list of criteria in Article 9(2) of 4AMLD is non-exhaustive (\u2018in particular\u2019) and that predicate offences to money laundering, such as tax crimes, fall under these criteria and should be duly taken into account in the autonomous process of the Commission; K. whereas Parliament agrees with the point made by the Commission in its letter of 26 October 2016 that tax evasion and money laundering do not indeed always coincide, but disagrees fundamentally with the possibility of an absolute distinction between non-cooperative tax jurisdictions and AML and CTF deficiencies, in particular when it comes to requirements to report suspicious transactions; L. whereas Parliament expects the Commission to conduct its own assessment and to avoid relying solely on external information sources; 1. Objects to the Commission delegated regulation; 2. Instructs its President to forward this resolution to the Commission and to notify it that the delegated regulation cannot enter into force; 3. Calls on the Commission to submit a new delegated act which takes account of the concerns set out above; 4. Instructs its President to forward this resolution to the Council and to the governments and parliaments of the Member States. 10.7.2018 EN Official Journal of the European Union C 242/51 Thursday 19 January 2017 ",
