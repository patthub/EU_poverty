Plenary session in a nutshell: Reviving the single market European Year of Volunteering: Ambition and discipline \u2014 sports to careers DIARY DATES 2 3 6 On 22 March, Group III of the Euro- pean Economic and Social Commit- tee held a very successful seminar on \u2018What are the prospects for partici- patory democracy in Europe?\u2019. Th is event brought together speakers and representatives from the EU institu- tions and from European civil soci- ety organisations. Drawing on the conclusions of the extraordinary meeting of the Various Interests\u2019 Group on 22 March on the prospects for par- ticipatory democracy, the Group III President, Luca Jahier, said that \u2018the foundations for a new way forward have been laid: the process of civil dialogue is both ambitious and com- plex. Participation in this dialogue is not only a right but also a duty that rests on the reciprocal commitment between the European institutional structures and civil society organi- sations\u2019. As noted by Staffan Nilsson, EESC President, the structure and operational modes of the Commit- tee are, in themselves, a form of civic participation, and as stated in the Compendium entitled Participative democracy: a retrospective overview of the story written by the EESC , presented at the meeting, the EESC has become over the last 15 years a place where important innovations and experiments in stable forms of structured civil dialogue have taken place, with a view to constructing a \u2018house of organised civil society\u2019. At the conclusion of the event, a \u2018Roadmap for European participa- tory democracy\u2019, drawing on the interactions of the participants dur- ing the seminar, was presented by Jillian Van Turnhout, Vice-Presi- dent of Group III. Th ese proposals, both for the EESC and for the other EU institutions and Member States, must be agreed as actions and allo- cated clear timelines for delivery. In summing up the day\u2019s proceed- ings, Luca Jahier felt that, taking into account the unthinkable costs of a non-Europe, the revival of the Com- munity method in the fi eld of civil dialogue should be the next step: \u2018The EESC must now organise its work in such a way that it leads to the development of a Green Paper on the practical implementation of civil dialogue, as was done for the citizens\u2019 initiative\u2019. Th e Compendium Participative democracy: a retrospective over- view of the history written by the EESC , the \u2018Roadmap for European participatory democracy\u2019 and other documents concerning the event are available on Group III\u2019s website (http://bit.ly/Article11). (jvt) \u25cf EDITORIAL Dear readers, Global food security is a fundamental human right. Yet this right is oft en fl outed in the interest of global markets where local farm- ers \u2014 most of whom in the developing world are women \u2014 are sometimes forgotten or cast aside. Th e challenges to food security are complex and numerous. Th e solu- tions need to be visionary and long term. Poverty, climate change, food price hikes, water scarcity, market speculation, land rights, fairer agri- cultural policies... all these and more must be addressed in the interest of food security. We cannot forget the riots in 2008 sparked by a sudden spike in food prices. Or the promises Europe made at the L\u2019Aquila G8 summit in 2009 for sustainable agriculture. Here we are today with the poor spending 70 % of their income on food. And now once again we see yet another sudden increase in food prices. Since last year, over 40 million people have been thrown into abject poverty as a direct result. Th is is simply unacceptable. Th ese are the consequences of the fact that countries have not invested enough in agriculture and rural areas, development aid, innovation and research. Th e EESC is committed to engaging people in a sustainable Europe. We are also committed to engaging people in a sustainable world. Th is is why in late January I called upon agriculture ministers from Europe and elsewhere in the world to involve civil society in discussions on trade and global food security. I urged them to complete the Doha Development Round under the World Trade Organisation (WTO) and to improve mar- ket access for developing countries. We recommend that the Member States implement the European Con- sensus on Development so that the EU becomes a key partner in the reform of a system that includes the Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations (FAO), the World Food Programme and the International Fund for Agricultural Development. We want the EU to promote greater regional integration in Africa. And perhaps most of all, we want to end the scourge of poverty and infuse fresh enthusiasm into achieving the millennium development goals. To make this happen, the EU must be prepared to listen to the concerns of the poor and small-scale farmers and to gain from their local knowledge of soil, water and community needs. Come and join us then on 23 May at the EESC conference on food security. Th e title of this conference is also our vision: \u2018Food for every- one \u2014 towards a global deal\u2019 . Engage in the debate with us about the issues of food security, along with the G20 presidency, the FAO, the European Commission and Oxfam. And help make changes we too can believe in! Staff an Nilsson President of the European Economic and Social Committee 4 5 Open Day 2011 Th is year, the European Economic and Social Committee invites eve- ryone to fi nd out about renewable energy by taking up the challenge of the \u2018explorer trail\u2019. Several activities for the whole family are scheduled throughout the day to raise aware- ness and to help people learn about new energy sources, such as water, geothermal, wind and solar energy in a fun and relaxed atmosphere. You will also be able to chat with EESC members from across the continent and share your visions for Europe, your ideas, hopes and fears. Visitors will be shown around the Committee to help them better understand its role and will include representatives from a number of non-governmental organisations involved in the European Year of Volunteering. Th ere will be something for eve- ryone: an activity book to take home and face-painting by make-up artists for children of all ages. More sporty types will be able to test their agility on the rope bridge, while students and eggheads can compete in a quiz on energy innovations and the Euro- pean Union. Come and visit us on Saturday 7 May 2011! The Open Day will begin at 10 a.m. and end at 6 p.m. Venue: European Economic and Social Committee (EESC), rue Bel- liard 99, 1040 Brussels.

European and Japanese repre- sentatives of business, trade unions, academia and non-governmental organisations met at the EESC premises in Brussels on 3 March 2011 to compare their strategies to enhance economic growth and to discuss the potential impact of the global economic crisis on corporate social responsibility (CSR). Th e participants agreed that there was a link between CSR and the crisis. From one perspective, a lack of CSR could be regarded as one of the causes of today\u2019s economic crisis; it could also be seen as a cure for market failures (including those that caused the current economic crisis, such as moral hazard, asymmetric and hid- den information and the free-rider problem), and should be perceived as one of the tools that can help com- panies to deal with the consequences of the crisis. As CSR also continues to be a core strategy in achieving sustain- able development at both local and global level, there is also a strong link between CSR and economic growth. Let\u2019s speak sustainable construction! Sustainable methods of building design and construction can provide solutions to many of the economic, social and environmental challenges facing Europe today. As our continent depends heavily on third-country imports for our energy supply, energy- saving building techniques and mate- rials can help to address issues such as energy poverty, energy security and the diversifi cation of our energy sources. Th ey can also contribute to creating many new jobs in the \u2018green economy\u2019 and to implementing the EU\u2019s energy effi ciency goals. Th e new multilingual glossary \u2018Let\u2019s speak sustainable construction!\u2019 is the tangible result of a joint initiative taken by the EESC, the Architects\u2019 Council of Europe (ACE) and the European Concrete Platform. It was launched on 11 April 2011 during the EU Sus- tainable Energy Week, as a hands-on tool for the use of everyone involved in sustainable construction. Th e fi rst edition of the paper version covers English, French, German and Spanish, while versions with the other offi cial languages will soon be posted on the EESC website. Th is innovative publica- tion follows an original English \u2018wiki\u2019 version and represents a signifi cant terminological eff ort, bravely under- taken by the staff of the joint Transla- tion Directorate of the EESC and the Committee of the Regions (CoR). But, just like sustainable construction as a whole, its vocabulary is and will con- tinue to be a work in progress. As EESC President Staff an Nilsson has stated, there are reasons apart from language why sustainable con- struction has not yet become wide- spread in the EU. Many construction projects require high levels of invest- ment. Th is is not only an issue of pub- lic debt and the crisis in the fi nancial sector; it also concerns the millions of low-income households in the EU that face the threat of energy pov- erty and that do not have adequate access to improved energy effi ciency methods. Th ere is also a shortage of construction staff with the necessary skills, qualifi cations and experience. Th e EESC has called for greater infor- mation and training opportunities in the fi eld of sustainable technologies, especially in construction, the public sector and transport. (ac) \u25cf Soon at the EESC \u2018Food for everyone \u2014 towards a global deal\u2019 \u2014 EESC conference, 23 May 2011 The EESC will be holding a major one-day conference on food security on 23 May 2011. Th e conference will start at 9.30 a.m. and is being held at the EESC building, rue Belliard 99, 1040 Brussels, in Room JDE62. Four workshops have been organised. 1. Food security and the work- ings of the global agricultural markets. 2. Food security as a right. 3. Food security: the need for coherence between agricul- ture, trade and development policies. 4. Food security in developing countries. Participants include delegations and representatives from the FAO, the UN World Food Programme, the G20 presidency, the European Com- mission and Oxfam. Speakers include EESC President Staff an Nilsson and the UN Special Rapporteur on the right to food, Olivier De Schutter, among many others. \u25cf Th e EU and Japan are facing similar challenges: competition from emerg- ing economies, demographic change, climate change, macroeconomic con- straints, the need to support and pro- mote innovation, etc. Th ese challenges, especially invest- ment in R & D, should continue to be the main areas for the exchange of views and experiences between the EU and Japan. (mk) \u25cf Fifth meeting of the European Integration Forum On 23 and 24 May the EESC will host the fifth meeting of the European Integration Forum. Th e Committee, together with the European Commis- sion, manages this platform whose objective is to give civil society organ- isations an opportunity to express their views on migrant integration issues, in particular relating to the EU agenda on integration. Th is will allow the European institutions to promote a comprehensive approach to inte- gration involving stakeholders at all levels. Th e Committee also makes a political contribution to the Forum\u2019s work, via a permanent study group on immigration and integration (IMI) within the Section for Employ- ment, Social Aff airs and Citizenship (SOC) and through its representation in the Forum Bureau. (bw) \u25cf On 16 February, the Czech EESC members met with Ms Milena Vicenov\u00e1, Czech Ambassador to the EU, and the representatives of the CEBRE (Czech Business Representation to the EU). They discussed further cooperation between EESC members and the Permanent Representation of the Czech Republic to the EU on important European topics includ- ing \u2018EU 2020\u2019, the Single Market Act, energy policy, the \u2018Agenda for new skills and jobs\u2019, the European Year of Volunteering and the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights.

Th e main goal of this organisation, which brings together over 400 member organisations from more than 70 countries worldwide, is spelt out in its name: it fi ghts for the recognition of the right to energy as a basic human right. It lobbies international and European organisations to incorporate this principle in their actions and legislation. Congratula- tions! (mb) \u25cf A very Polish aff air! Jan Tombi\u0144ski, Polish Ambassador to the EU, invited Polish EESC mem- bers to a dinner so that he could present the priorities of the EU Council Presidency that Warsaw will be taking over in July. Th e meeting also provided an opportunity for informal discussions on potential cooper- ation between the Polish government and the Committee. Th e Polish Council Presidency had asked the EESC to draw up opin- ions covering four diff erent policy areas: employment, green business, external relations and transport. Ambassador Tombi\u0144ski said he was looking forward to receiving valuable input from civil society on these matters. (mb) \u25cf kg_104863_CESE_EN_b.indd 2 18/04/11 11:54 ",
        "EESC info \u2014 May 2011/4 \u2014 Special edition EE S C in fo European Economic and Social Committee a bridge between Europe and organised civil society May 2011/4 \u2014 Special edition EN ISSN 1725-1923 S p e c i a l E d i t i o n F O O D S E C U R I T Y 3 Global challenges of food security Nine billion people will inhabit the Earth by 2050. Each one will make demands on the ever-more-precious resources of water and food. Already, 1 billion people go hungry while tonnes of cereals rot away in storage facilities, or are used to meet controversial biofuel quotas, or even nourish millions of cattle. And while numerous initiatives, like the EU Food Facility, have been implemented with success, the long-term global challenges of food security remain largely unanswered. Underlying these challenges is pov- erty \u2014 perhaps the greatest and most inequitable culprit in this global equation. Sandy Boyle, EESC member and President of the Section for Exter- nal Relations, is understandably concerned. In his view, a number of challenges could further exacerbate the already delicate balancing act between food security and develop- ment. \u2018For the next years, three main challenges could amplify food insecu- rity,\u2019 he explains, citing population increase, demand for agricultural products from emerging economies, and climate change. According to Mr Boyle, these chal- lenges are themselves intensifi ed by speculation, water scarcity, energy demand and urbanisation. Global food security challenges are so mul- tifarious that solutions must be as varied and as tailored. \u2018Eliminating or even reducing food insecurity is a long-term pledge and a diffi cult goal to reach. Globally, it is just too early to see practical results from recent commitments.\u2019 However, positive initiatives and projects throughout the developing world have proved that concerted eff orts combined with political will can and do produce stunning results. Malawi, for instance, allocates 16 % of its state budget to agriculture and has introduced initiatives to support small farmers. Not only has the country achieved food self- suffi ciency but it has also \u2018insulated itself from the impact of runaway food prices on international mar- kets\u2019, according to the EESC opinion \u2018Ensuring sustainable food security in ACP countries\u2019. However, responsibility over glo- bal food security and its challenges is also an issue for developed countries. In February, banks, hedge funds and pension funds tried to pressure G20 fi nance ministers not to regulate food commodity markets. International organisations, including the EESC, want greater transparency and supervision of fi nancial markets in food commodi- ties. Th is also includes placing a ban, among other things, on financial institutions buying up food stocks and arable land. So far the success has been limited. And yet, since last June, 44 million people have been forced into extreme poverty as a direct result of food price increases. And then there are the promises. Over EUR 20 billion was pledged over three years for agriculture development during the G8 sum- mit in L\u2019Aquila, Italy, in 2009. But the advent of a global financial crisis has more or less derailed the initiative. \u2018Out of the USD 22 billion prom- ised in L\u2019Aquila, only a small part has been given so far and there is no indication that the goals will be met. Finally, there is some spending directed towards programmes that do not really help, for example bio- fuels,\u2019 says Mr Boyle, adding that the EU must ensure that Member States fulfi l their pledges. \u25cf \u2018A hungry man is an angry man\u2019 Food price volatility helped spark the revolutions throughout north Africa. In 2009, a joint study by the Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations (FAO), the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD) and the World Bank Group warned of dire consequences in north Africa and Arab countries as a result of their lack of food security policies. On average, says the report, states throughout these regions were import- ing at least 50 % of the food calories they consume. Th ey are also the larg- est net importers of cereals. Exposed to extreme fl uctuations in agricultural commodities prices, many people struggled just to feed their families. Th e EESC opinion on \u2018Trade and food security\u2019 also warned that the speculation in agricultural com- modities could \u2018lead to serious con- sequences in terms of increasing food insecurity\u2019. Th e FAO food price index rose by nearly 60 % between 2007 and 2008. Riots followed shortly aft er. Around 7 % of Egypt\u2019s GDP was used to subsidise imported food and energy. Egypt, the most populous Arab nation and the world\u2019s largest consumer of bread, threatened to reduce these subsidies. Baladi , a fl at round bread staple of the Egyptian diet, suddenly quadrupled in price. Th ousands poured onto the streets in protest in 2008. Cars were over- turned and buildings set ablaze until the police descended en masse. Similar scenes occurred on 1 Janu- ary 2011 in Algeria. By the time Alge- rian police fi red tear gas at rioters in the capital, the price of cooking oil, sugar and flour had already more than doubled. To quell the anger, the government promised to increase the supply of soft wheat onto the local market by 18 % \u2014 but to little avail. On 5 January, the FAO announced that food prices in the region had hit a \u2018record high\u2019 in December 2010, topping 2008 levels. And just three days before Egypt\u2019s President Mubarak fl ed, his trade min- ister made the claim that the country would shield its citizens from massive increases in world food prices. Today, throughout much of the region, it is still not possible to guarantee food security for populations enduring his- toric transitions. And many are going hungry \u2014 once again. \u25cf Global agricultural markets When the World Bank revealed in February that food price rises since June 2010 had driven 44 million people into poverty in low- and middle-income countries, fears grew of a rerun of the 2007\u201308 food crisis, which saw violent protests across the world. Much of the blame for the 2007\u201308 crisis was laid on speculators. In the wake of the global banking crisis, many investors deserted commer- cial property and stocks in favour of commodities, causing prices to rise steeply. Calling for tighter regulation on commodities trading to prevent speculation on agricultural prod- ucts, an EESC exploratory opinion on trade and food security pub- lished in December 2009 (REX 273) also supported the idea of a tax on international fi nancial transactions, \u2018the proceeds from which could be allocated to food security initiatives\u2019. More recently, in a response to the recent price rises, the European Parliament adopted a resolution in February asking the Commission to consider giving the new European Securities and Markets Authority more power to prevent abuses in commodity markets, and \u2018ensure that dealing with food commodity derivatives is restricted as far as pos- sible to investors directly linked to agricultural markets\u2019. Forecasters say the upward trend in prices will continue, as climate change and pressure on oil, water and land resources threaten food supply, while a growing global population will mean greater demand for food, especially resource-intensive meat and dairy products. The answer to rising demand is to ramp up production, argue farm- ers\u2019 organisations. \u2018Th e EU is a big exporter and probably needs to think about how to become an even big- ger exporter. We should be trying to harness the advantage and make EU farmers more competitive and pro- duce more food while impacting less,\u2019 says Tom Hind of the UK\u2019s National Farmers\u2019 Union. Mr Hind is cautious about the impact of attempts to crack down on speculators. \u2018Regulating futures\u2019 exchanges is fi ne if it increases trans- parency, but if it damages liquidity it could harm farmers.\u2019 Others argue that the issue is less about production than access to markets: after all, four out of fi ve of the world\u2019s hungriest people are farmers in rural areas, lacking the infrastructure to acquire tools, products and know-how that could help them boost soil fertility, increase yields and sell their produce. Mean- while, production is highly concen- trated \u2014 most rice is grown in just four countries; wheat in Australia and Russia \u2014 so any shock in a major production centre has a substantial impact on global prices. \u25cf kg_104863_CESE_EN_b.indd 3 18/04/11 11:54 ",
        "EESC info \u2014 May 2011/4 \u2014 Special edition 4 An EESC exploratory report on \u2018Trade and food security\u2019 (REX 273) called for trade governance, struc- tures and policies to be reformed in line with development policies: \u2018Th e principles of the right to food must underpin the processes of decision- making and implementation, and States must refrain from entering into international obligations which confl ict with those principles.\u2019. Trade and farming policies threaten food security \u2014 and devel- opment \u2014 in three ways, according to Mute Schimpf, food campaigner at Friends of the Earth Europe: fi rstly, by requiring farmers in developing countries to comply with very high standards in order to access the EU market; secondly, by subsidising EU exports which undermine local pro- duction (and by not setting a date for the phase-out of these subsidies); and, thirdly, by supporting trade rules that disfavour small-scale producers. \u2018Two thirds of global food produc- tion is consumed locally. Our trade rules are designed for the global market but this is only a minority of the sector. EU trade policy should encourage local markets to allow small-scale farmers to participate at local level.\u2019 There is also a danger, warns Marco Contiero, policy director for genetic engineering and sustainable agriculture at Greenpeace European Unit, in counting on trade liberalisa- tion and increased food productivity to meet the needs of a much larger global population. \u2018We should start by asking how can we feed the world today, before asking how will we feed the world in 2050. Certainly we need to increase productivity, but in developing coun- tries, not in the USA, EU and Canada. Farmers in developing countries have the least food security: on average, 30 % of food production is lost post- harvest in the developing world. We need to improve infrastructure,\u2019 he says, and reverse the decline in global development aid over recent decades. EU environment policies are also part of the problem, warns Mr Con- tiero. \u2018Policies on biofuels in the USA and EU will lead to deforestation, land degradation and rising food prices. If we\u2019re serious about food security, we need to assess the impacts of biofuel policies and meat consumption, and we need to decrease each of these,\u2019 he insists. In its 2010 exploratory opinion, the EESC also called for \u2018interna- tional human health and environ- mental organisations to discourage diets that make excessive use of ani- mal protein\u2019. And in urging a speedy conclu- sion to the WTO\u2019s Doha Develop- ment Round, it recommended that the EU should \u2018lock in the conces- sions gained by developing countries instead of looking for further conces- sions for itself\u2019. \u25cf Some countries produce an excess of food that simply goes to waste. Other, poorer nations are unable to sell their goods because of infl ated tariff s and unjust trade barriers. In March, EESC member Madi Sharma went to India together with an EESC delegation to research the impact of Europe\u2019s free trade agree- ment (FTA) on food security. Speak- ing from New Delhi, Ms Sharma told EESC info that the EU\u2019s FTA policy \u2018could destroy Indian food produc- tion and the livelihoods of local farmers\u2019. She claims the EU is seeking to take away the \u2018right to the seed\u2019 from farmers and give it to seed produc- ers. Th e Union has fi ve of the largest seed companies in the world which could impose genetically modifi ed seeds on farmers who do not want them. \u2018GMO seeds from the EU also adversely affect animals here,\u2019 she says, adding that the delegation had spoken to numerous street vendors and local farmers. \u2018We need to make sure that the FTA does not aff ect food security or livelihoods. We need transparency.\u2019 According to Ms Sharma, the Euro- pean Commission\u2019s Trade DG failed to consult with civil society on the matter \u2014 including the EESC and Indian civil society. \u2018We came here on our own initiative to see what is happening on the ground.\u2019 Still, local farmers in 57 devel- oping countries have been able to increase their own crop yields by 80 %. Agroecology, which applies ecological science to the design of agricultural systems, has doubled crop yields in 20 African countries over an average of seven years. By replacing pesticides and fertilisers with local knowledge adapted to the natural environment, farmers are on a path that diverges from large-scale agro-industrial practices. Th e trick is getting these crops to market. But that entails far greater public policy support and a change in international business practices \u2014 plus FTA transparency. Agroecology benefi ts the farmer, not the multina- tionals which see little interest in a practice that cannot be \u2018patented and which doesn\u2019t open the markets for chemical products or improved seed,\u2019 claims Olivier de Schutter, UN Spe- cial Rapporteur on the right to food. Stronger regulation does not necessarily support free market and liberal economic practices, espe- cially when it comes to food which, according to the EESC opinion on food security, is a human right. And you cannot put a price on that. \u25cf Food security in the developing world The world produces enough food to feed everyone. However, unequal distribution of resources, subsidies and unfair trade balances are barriers to food security. How EU policies undermine food security EU eff orts to ensure global food security may be undermined by its own trade, agriculture and environment policies, warn experts. Europe\u2019s biofuel bonanza According to the FAO, government consumption targets and financial incentives for biofuels are among the driving forces behind land acquisi- tion in Africa. Moreover, in 2008, the Joint Research Centre of the European Commission pointed out that \u2018indirect land use change could potentially release enough green- house gas to negate the savings from conventional EU biofuels\u2019. \u2022 40 000 square miles of arable land are lost each year to bio- fuel production. \u2022 By 2020, 9.5 % of Europe\u2019s transport energy will come from biofuels \u2014 92 % of these fuels will come from food crops. \u2022 An area over twice the size of Belgium will be needed to meet demand. \u2022 23 Member States expect to be importing 50 % of their needs in bioethanol and 41 % of their needs in biodiesel by 2020. \u25cf CAP \u2014 transparency at last? Talks on the reform of the EU com- mon agricultural policy (CAP) have shift ed up a gear, with the EESC and other institutions delivering their response to the Commission\u2019s com- munication published last November. Against this backdrop looms the threat of a new global food crisis, with fl oods and adverse weather conditions damaging wheat, corn and soybean crops in Australia and the USA; and a famine early-warning issued for east Africa due to 30 % less than average rainfall in October to December 2010. Europe has come a long way since the old-style CAP, with its overpro- duction and dumping of surpluses on world markets. But to what extent can the Europe of today claim to be help- ing rather than hindering a sustain- able future for food production? \u2018Food security is not a problem in Europe; what the CAP should be addressing is global food insecurity,\u2019 says Mario Campli, President of the Section for Agriculture, Rural Devel- opment and the Environment. In its opinion published in mid- March, and coordinated by Franco Chiriaco, the EESC gave the Com- mission\u2019s proposal a broadly positive response, but asked the Commission to provide greater clarity on links between the policy\u2019s goals, tools and funding. More detail is needed in particu- lar, says Mr Campli, on \u2018what instru- ments, besides direct aid, will address the volatility of markets\u2019. Th is element of the reform could contribute directly to food security worldwide, he con- tinues, but \u2018the proposal is not clear.\u2019 The proposal would boost food security indirectly through its sup- port for direct payments, which decouple subsidies from production and allow farmers to respond directly to the market; also, by suppressing the subsidy calculation based on a historic reference period. Th is creates a more level playing field between Member States and types of farmers, and makes the CAP less protectionist, argues Mr Campli. Linking direct pay- ments to environmental measures also contributes indirectly to global food security, he states, by promoting more sustainable farming practices and bet- ter stewardship. Farmers are less convinced by the proposals. Lobby group Copa-Cogeca warned that the emphasis on \u2018green- ing\u2019 \u2018will raise production costs for farmers... thus threatening their com- petitiveness and production potential,\u2019 the organisation\u2019s Secretary-General Pekka Pesonen told EESC info . He even suggested that Europe\u2019s own food security could be under- mined. \u2018Greater weight must be put under the CAP to reinforcing the economic role of farmers in produc- ing food, in order to safeguard food security for 500 million EU consumers and maintain 28 million jobs in the EU agriculture sector.\u2019 Whether the reform will bring greater transparency to the CAP depends, says Mr Campli, on how proposed changes make it through to the concrete legislative package, due later this year. For example, the EESC backs the recommendation to restrict pay- ments to \u2018active farmers\u2019 but calls on the Commission to defi ne what an active farmer is. According to the EESC, he or she should be engaged in \u2018the production and marketing of agricultural products, also through direct local marketing, and the crea- tion of public goods and services of social interest\u2019. The Committee also backs the proposal to cap payments to farm- ers at a certain threshold. Whether this measure survives in the legisla- tive proposal \u2014 Member States\u2019 farm ministers have since rejected this ele- ment \u2014 remains to be seen. If it does not, the biggest benefi ciaries of CAP funding \u2014 20 % of farmers currently receive 80 % of subsidies \u2014 would appear to have their taxpayer funding assured for the time being. \u25cf kg_104863_CESE_EN_b.indd 4 18/04/11 11:54 ",

(ac) \u25cf Reviving the single market In the presence of Michel Barnier , Commissioner for the Inter- nal Market and Services, the most recent EESC plenary session welcomed the Commission\u2019s initiative to relaunch and revive the single market. Th e EESC approved an exemplary opinion by three rapporteurs: Ms Federspiel (Various Interests\u2019 Group, Denmark), Mr Siecker (Workers\u2019 Group, the Netherlands) and Mr Vole\u0161 (Employers\u2019 Group, Czech Republic). Each represented a separate component of the EESC and they had been able to reach a substantial qualita- tive consensus on a complex issue within a short time. Th e opinion emphasises the importance of an integrated approach, suggesting that the Commission\u2019s proposals should work in tandem rather than targeting individual segments of the single market. Th e contribution of civil society is an indispensable asset in reviving the single market. Aft er all, it represents the users of the single market who will ultimately determine the success of the relaunch. (ma) \u25cf Supporting farmers Th e EESC is under no illusions about the scale of the challenges facing the agricultural sector. Th e demographics of the sector refl ect concerns about the accessibility of farming; there is only one farmer aged under 35 for every nine farmers over the age of 55. With a view to confronting this problem, the EESC issued an opinion in an eff ort to both safeguard and encourage the growth of farming across Europe. Th e opinion prepared by rapporteur Franco Chiriaco (Work- ers\u2019 Group, Italy) concludes that the future of food security and environmental protection relies on a continuation of support to farmers. Th e Commission\u2019s current communication on the CAP is deemed inadequate, as it fails to clarify the post-2013 goals, tools and funding. (ma) \u25cf Smart focus missing Narrow fi scal consolidation has been prioritised at the expense of smart, sustainable and inclusive growth, according to an opinion prepared by Michael Smyth (Vari- ous Interests\u2019 Group, United King- dom). Th e Commission has been criticised in relation to the annual growth survey, which provided guidance for national economic and fi scal policies. Th e EESC opin- ion asserts that an opportunity has been missed to pursue the \u2018Europe 2020\u2019 strategy by promoting smart growth policies. Th e scenario envisaged by the Commission concentrates on drastic fi scal consolidation as a prerequisite for growth, and has not attempted to maximise the potential of the single market. More attention should be directed towards growth drivers that will enable Member States to consolidate budgets while following a sustainable path. (ma) \u25cf Flourishing through innovation Innovation is at the heart of the European approach to achiev- ing prosperity. Undeterred by a number of great challenges, the Innovation Union can contribute to overcoming many obstacles. During the March plenary session, Gerd Wolf (Various Interests\u2019 Group, Germany) presented an opinion on the Innovation Union, a \u2018Europe 2020\u2019 fl agship initiative which aims to enhance innova- tion policy across Europe. The Committee welcomes and supports the Commission\u2019s approach to the Innovation Union, and considers it an essential part of the \u2018Europe 2020\u2019 strategy. Th e European Innovation Partnerships are also supported by the EESC. Th ey are designed to tackle specifi c societal challenges that are shared across the EU by linking research and innovation to create opportunities. An innovation partnership on active and healthy ageing is already under way and this will serve as a good example for future partnerships. (ma) \u25cf Strengthening energy security An opinion approved by the EESC has raised concerns about the EU\u2019s energy security. Prepared by rapporteur Edgardo Iozia (Workers\u2019 Group, Italy), the opinion scrutinises the EU\u2019s dependency on unstable and undemocratic areas for energy, concluding that this could pose a significant security risk in the long term. The appointment of a high representative for energy policy is endorsed, as a way of ensuring a unified European voice. There is also encouragement for improved energy networks, by strengthening strategic partnerships with supplier countries and improving rela- tions with the neighbouring countries through which most energy supplies transit. EU institutions must make a concerted eff ort to confront the energy issue, on the basis of solidarity. Th e Committee calls on the Council, the European Parliament and the Commission to utilise energy diplomacy as a tool to protect workers, businesses and Europeans\u2019 quality of life. (ma) \u25cf PLENARY SESSION IN A NUTSHELL \u2018Your Europe, your say\u2019 \u2014 EESC members visit schools The second EESC youth plenary session \u2018Your Europe, your say\u2019 will take place in Brussels from 5 to 7 May 2011. About 150 students from schools across the EU will take part in draft ing an opinion on \u2018Youth on the move\u2019, a new European initiative designed to help young people gain the essential knowledge and skills needed to get a job. To give all the participants a chance to be better prepared for the event, members of the EESC have been visiting the selected schools in their own countries and providing Please enjoy \u2014 don\u2019t destroy In 2008, Robbie Hughes was vio- lently attacked and badly beaten in Crete while on holiday with friends. Maggie, his mother, fl ew out to help him through a tragic nightmare in a country that she was unfamiliar with. Although everyone tried as hard as they could to be helpful and sympa- thetic, she quickly realised that there was no structured support or advice available for victims which she could rely upon. Struggling through a legal, linguistic and institutional maze, she decided that her traumatic experi- ence must become a starting point for a campaign \u2018Please enjoy \u2014 don\u2019t destroy\u2019 to provide organised help and support for victims and families of people injured while abroad. Kathleen Walker Shaw, an EESC member (Workers\u2019 Group, United Kingdom) liaised with Mrs Hughes and brought her to Brussels when the European Commission was about to propose legislation on support for victims of crime committed abroad. Mrs Shaw guided her through the structure of the EU and helped organise meetings with EU institu- tions, including the EESC. At the March plenary session of the European Parliament, Commissioner Reding paid tribute to Mrs Hughes Michel Barnier, Commissioner for the Internal Market and Services Edgardo Iozia, EESC member Michael Smyth, EESC member pupils with a general overview of the European Union, the Committee and the role of organised civil society. Pupils now have to table amend- ments which, once approved, will feed into the fi nal text of the opinion which will be approved at the EESC youth plenary session in May. Aft er a demanding two-day ses- sion in May, which involves constant debating, bargaining and consensus- seeking, the pupils will have the opportunity to take part in numer- ous fun activities, games and quizzes, while introducing the legislative package on support for and rights of victims. In her letter to the Commis- sioners, Mrs Hughes insisted on the need to ensure \u2018equal treatment for victims of crime in terms of care and support\u2019, and called for measures to be \u2018practical, far-reaching and, above all, eff ective\u2019. Although Robbie, a professional football player, will never fully recover, his love of football con- tinues and he is expected to play for the England national team in the Paralympic Games in London 2012. \u2018When Robbie walks out on to the pitch in the Olympic stadium in 2012, I would like to know in my heart that real progress has been made to prevent other people going through the same awful experiences that we had because there were insuffi cient provision and structures to support victims of crime, \u2026and I believe you would too\u2019, his mother said in her let- ter to the Commissioners. (mb) \u25cf IN SHORT The EESC agrees to reduce its budget In March the EESC adopted its draft 2012 budget that would, if approved by the budgetary authority, consti- tute a real-term decrease in the insti- tution\u2019s funding. \u2018Expenditure for 2012 is limited to an increase of 1.5 % which, given an estimated infl ation rate of about 2 %, would constitute a reduction in real terms\u2019. Recalling the situation in the Mem- ber States where austerity measures are kicking in, Mr Krawczyk, Vice- President responsible for the budget, explained that as the EU body rep- resenting organised civil society the EESC had clearly and unanimously decided to act accordingly and set an example. The EESC\u2019s spending reduction refl ects the appeal made a few weeks ago by Janusz Lewandowski, EU Com- missioner for the Budget, encouraging all institutions to limit expenditure to below the infl ation rate. Savings stem from the EESC Bureau\u2019s decision to use existing human resources and focus on administrative effi ciency. In this context Mr Krawczyk insisted on the crucial importance of \u2018a continuous review of existing resources, including possible redeployment, syn- ergies and prioritisation\u2019. Th e overall budget of the EESC is EUR 130.5 million. (mb) \u25cf The Employers\u2019 Group hosted Maria Damanaki, Commissioner for Maritime Aff airs and Fisheries, for a debate on the maritime economy Henri Malosse, President of the Employers\u2019 Group of the EESC, welcomed Maria Damanaki, Com- missioner for Maritime Aff airs and Fisheries, during a debate on the future of the European strategy for the maritime economy on 15 March 2011. Th e Commissioner stressed the importance of the economic potential of European seas and broached the subject of \u2018blue growth\u2019 which holds a prominent place in \u2018Europe 2020\u2019. Ms Damanaki stressed the vital role of employers who can provide the interface between the European Com- mission and national investors in order to promote a maritime policy that off ers the greatest possibility of long-term development. She outlined the priori- ties of the EU maritime policy, includ- ing investment in scientifi c research and analysis of needs in the areas of trans- port, tourism and fi sheries.

Next issue: June 2011 P RINTED ON 100 % RECYCLED PAPER Ambition and discipline \u2014 sports to careers Gabriela Szabo is among the fi rst athletes in the world to win every title in the European, world and Olympic championships. With 21 gold and 12 silver medals, this track and fi eld athlete is now the Romanian Athletics Federation\u2019s Vice-President. She is currently pursuing a PhD in anthropologic motricity at ANEFS Bucharest. She talked exclusively to EESC info . EESC info: Can you discuss the skills you learned as an athlete and how you apply them in your professional life? Besides the physical skills, I truly believe that sport develops other abili- ties useful in personal and professional activities. An athlete gains a lot more from playing sports than one expects. I\u2019ve learned important lessons, such as being ambitious or the power of posi- tive thinking. It\u2019s about being competi- tive, and more than that, about getting focused again after you failed once. Sports teach you to be tough, organ- ised, rigorous and motivated: \u2018Th ere is no try. Only do or do not\u2019, as a famous character once said. Last but not least, it is the quality of being fair. Once you\u2019ve learned to be competitive but also fair you are ready for any kind of position. EESC info: To what do you attribute your success and what advice would you give to young peo- ple who want to pursue similar paths? Valuable careers in sport are sup- ported by an extraordinary will. I\u2019ve always wanted to be the best and com- peted mostly with my own goals, not with other athletes. My advice is to keep this fl ame of enthusiasm. Pursue your dream no matter the diffi culties. Sports require a lot a dedication and determination, great work and ambi- tion, so great results come from this mix. Also, young people should learn discipline, how to stay away from excesses and things that may ruin their integrity. EESC info: Volunteering is oft en associated with active citizenship. A lot of people volunteer their time for sporting endeavours. How do you suppose their efforts contribute to active citizenship? Volunteers are people who are engaged in civil society and contribute great value to athletes and society at large. Individuals execute citizenship skills through practice and participa- tion in sports events. Th is activates their sense of citizenship by building relationships with other peers and by promoting active involvement in the evolution of society. Basically, people learn their citizenship skills by taking on great responsibility for others when fulfi lling their volunteer mission. Th rough volunteering, people are involved more in making decisions about key areas of active citizenship such as politics, the workplace, civil society and the private domain. EESC info: By far, the sector with the most volunteers is sports. And this is often dominated by males. How can we get more females involved in sports-related volunteer activities? I think women can be proud of their many achievements in sports. By informing women of the benefi ts of volunteering in this area and also by showing them the achievements, we might get them more involved. For example, the organisation I founded, Sport for Life, actively encourages girls and women to vol- unteer by appealing to their specifi c interests. EESC info: This is the year of volunteering. Do you see a value in Europe getting behind such an ini- tiative? And if so, what would you say are its benefi ts or disadvantages? I have noticed a great value in the initiative led by the Commission. Th ere are many benefi ts, the key ones being: promoting more charitable work, bringing volunteers closer to society as a whole and recognising their hard work. As President of Sport for Life, I see this as a great possibility to motivate vol- unteers and to encourage their partici- pation, as they have brought signifi cant results over the past years. Moreover, this is a great opportunity to celebrate all our outcomes. Certainly, this European Year of Volunteering has only advan- tages and no drawbacks. \u25cf International Women\u2019s Day \u2014 100 years on Women forging the way ahead: Malta While acknowledging the work of many courageous women activists whose foresight in diff erent parts of the world created the pathway to gen- der equality, not without diffi culty and personal pain, the National Council of Women (NCW) has called for an anal- ysis of the Maltese situation to ensure that \u2018Women forging the way ahead\u2019 can be translated into action. Studies prove that the issue of political representation is still viewed in highly diff ering ways depending on if one asks a man or a woman. Too many men still see a balance in parlia- ment or in local councils as unneces- sary, the reasons for this ranging from \u2018women should look aft er the family\u2019 to \u2018women have no time\u2019. In the case of local councils, 32.8 % of those who said that there should not be a balance said that this was because men were more suitable. The challenge is how to address power inequality and/or abuse of power. Very oft en, the demands of a patriarchal society or a male-domi- nated society like ours encourage and re-enforce the imbalance of power. Th e empowerment and autonomy of women and the improvement of women\u2019s social, economic and political status is essential for the achievement of both transparent and accountable gov- ernment and administration and sus- tainable development in all areas of life. Oft en, as a result of a lack of self-confi - dence or culturally ingrained attitudes and behaviour and the lack of support structures, the potential of many capa- ble women is lost. However, the suc- cess stories of the increasing number of women entrepreneurs in Malta clearly show a diff erent dimension of women\u2019s determination to succeed. The traditional working patterns of many political parties and govern- ment structures continue to be barri- ers to women\u2019s participation in public life. Women may be discouraged from seeking political offi ce by discrimina- tory attitudes and practices, family and childcare responsibilities, and the high cost of seeking and holding public offi ce. Women in politics and decision- making positions in governments and legislative bodies contribute to redefi ning political priorities, placing new items on the political agenda that refl ect and address women\u2019s gender- specifi c concerns, values and experi- ences, and providing new perspectives on mainstream political issues. Th e failure to adequately address the gender imbalance in our education system has not helped either. Gender inequality is further perpet- uated by the way women are portrayed in the media, in particular in report- ing news: women are almost always depicted as victims, hardly ever as achievers, except in sports. We should also be addressing issues of women in vulnerable groups such as women in undeclared domestic work. A recent ILO report introduc- tion states that \u2018paid domestic work remains virtually invisible as a form of employment in many countries\u2019. Policies addressing the situation of single parents need to include active labour market policies and incentives to encourage entry in the labour mar- ket and reduce the risk of poverty. The high incidence of domestic violence in Malta requires an eff ective national strategy. The NCW reiter- ates the urgent need for an integrated, multidisciplinary approach and will be launching a campaign roping in men and boys in general to stand up against violence against women, encouraging them to have a proactive, rather than defensive, response and not to tolerate or perpetrate violence against women and girls. At the same time, the cam- paign will address those men and boys who commit violence against women and girls with the aim of stopping them from perpetrating violence.

(mb) \u25cf The role of family policy in demographic change On 21 March, the EESC held a hearing on \u2018The role of family pol- icy in demographic change: Shar- ing best practice among Member States\u2019, where stakeholders were consulted on family matters in order to improve policies and share practices between Member States. The Hungarian Council Presi- dency asked the EESC to provide advice on this topic and to discuss demographic change and the role of families. The outcome of the hearing fed into the Hungarian Council Presidency\u2019s conference on demographic change and the meeting of the Informal Council of Ministers for family policies in Budapest to which the Commit- tee presented the results of the hearing and its own contribution. Moreover, the Hungarian Council Presidency wants to include the EESC opinion in the formal con- clusions of the June EPSCO Coun- cil. (pb) \u25cf kg_104863_CESE_EN_b.indd 6 18/04/11 11:54 "
