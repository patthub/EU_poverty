        "REPORT OF THE THIRD MEETING OF THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION\u2019S INTERNATIONAL DIALOGUE ON BIOETHICS 4 1. Introduction 1.1 European Commission\u2019s International Dialogue on Bioethics (EC IDB) In the science and new technologies sector the Commission is promoting a responsible use of science and technology, both within the European Union (EU) and worldwide. The goal of the Commission is to strike a balance between ethical and sociocultural diversity, both at EU level and globally in other regions of the world, while also respecting internationally recognised fundamental values. The international dialogue platform is therefore conceived as a tool to cluster chairs of national ethics councils (NEC) or equivalent bodies from differ- ent regions of the world in order to allow a better exchange of information and communica- tion between the above-mentioned bodies and facilitate interactions and links between the European Commission (EC) and the bodies above. On 19 February 2009 the first meeting of the International Dialogue on Bioethics took place, organised by the EC Bureau of European Policy Advisors (BEPA), following the request of the European Group on Ethics of Science and New Technologies (EGE). The event was chaired by the President of the EGE, Prof. G\u00f6ran Hermer\u00e9n, and the chair of the NEC of the EU Member State holding the Council Presidency and representing the EU-27 NEC Forum, Prof. Josef Kure. Invited participants at this event included: Dr No\u0451lle Lenoir, former French minister for European affairs; the Chair of the European Parliament\u2019s Scientific Technology Options Assessment (STOA) commission, Mr Philippe Busquin; the Commissioner for Edu- cation, Training, Culture and Youth, Mr J\u00e1n Figel; members of the EGE; the chairs of 15 non- EU NECs; the chairs of the EU-27 NECs; and representatives of international organisations (Council of Europe, UNESCO, World Health Organisation). The chairs of NECs attending the meeting agreed unanimously on having this event organised on an annual basis, with the EC leading this initiative and providing its secretariat. The second meeting of the International Dialogue on Bioethics, organised by BEPA, took place on 4 and 5 March 2010 in Madrid, Spain, under the auspices of the Spanish rotating Presidency of the Council of the EU and the Spanish National Bioethics Council. The event was chaired by the President of the EGE, Prof. G\u00f6ran Hermer\u00e9n, and the chair of the NEC of the EU Member State holding the Council Presidency and representing the EU-27 NEC Forum, Ms Victoria Camps. Invited participants at the event included: Mr Margaritis Schi- nas, Deputy Head of the President\u2019s Bureau of European Policy Advisors (BEPA), European Commission; Ms Victoria Camps, President of the Spanish NEC; Mr Fernando Correia de Campos, member of STOA; Sir Michael Marmot, Director of the International Institute for Society and Health and rapporteur of the WHO report on \u2018Social determinants of health\u2019; as well as the presidents of the NECs from 41 countries from five continents and the heads of the bioethics sectors of the Council of Europe (Ms Laurence Lwoff), UNESCO (Ms Dafna Feinholz) and the WHO (Ms Marie Charlotte Bou\u00ebsseau).

        "THE PROTECTION OF FUNDAMENTAL ETHICAL PRINCIPLES IN INTERNATIONAL RESEARCH AND INNOVATION PROGRAMMES 5 The third meeting of the International Dialogue on Bioethics, organised by BEPA, took place on 20 September 2011 in Brussels, under the auspices of the Hungarian and Polish rotat- ing Council presidencies and the Hungarian and Polish National Bioethics Councils. Invited participants at this event included: the members of the EGE; the chairs of 15 non-EU NECs; the chairs of the EU-27 NECs; and representatives of international organisations (UN agen- cies, Council of Europe, etc.). The meeting addressed issues related to \u2018the protection of fundamental ethical principles in international research and innovation programmes\u2019 and it aimed to (1) facilitate an inter- national debate on the notion of responsible innovation, (2) share information on how the respect of fundamental rights has been embedded in national and international research and innovation programmes/initiatives in other regions of the world and (3) debate the embedding of ethics in research and innovation globally. Maurizio Salvi Bureau of European Policy Advisors (BEPA), Secretary-General of the EC International Dialogue on Bioethics (IDB) 1.2 Remit of the EC IDB Remit of the EC International Dialogue The International Dialogue on Bioethics intends to achieve the following goals. \u2022 To cluster chairs of national ethics councils or equivalent bodies from different regions of the world. \u2022 To allow a better exchange of information and communication between the above-men- tioned bodies. The international dialogue will be chaired by the President of the European Group on Ethics of Science and New Technologies (EGE) and the chair of the NEC of the EU Member States having the Council Presidency. The international dialogue will be financed by the European Commission (Bureau of Euro- pean Policy Advisors \u2014 BEPA). The Commission will provide its Secretariat. The interna- tional dialogue should meet on annual basis, preferably in Brussels. The first Secretary-General of the international dialogue will be Mr Maurizio Salvi (BEPA, Head of the EGE Secretariat). ",
        "REPORT OF THE THIRD MEETING OF THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION\u2019S INTERNATIONAL DIALOGUE ON BIOETHICS 6 1.3 European Group on Ethics in Science and New Technologies (EGE) The EGE was established in 1991 (with the name of the Group of Advisers on the Ethical Implications of Biotechnology (GAEIB)). The new EGE mandate was adopted by Commis- sion decision on 23 December 2009 ( 1 ) (C(2009) 10353). According to the above remit, the role of the EGE is to provide the Commission with high quality and independent advice on ethical aspects of science and new technologies in connection with the preparation and implementation of Community legislation or policies ( 2 ). On 10 January 2011 the President of the European Commission, Jos\u00e9 Manuel Barroso, appointed the 15 members of the European Group on Ethics in Science and New Technolo- gies (EGE) for 2011 \u201316. The selected EGE members will serve in a personal capacity and are asked to offer independent advice to the Commission. They have been appointed on the basis of their expertise and a geographical distribution that reflects the diversity in Europe. Expertise required from the EGE members is: (1) ethics/philosophy/theology, (2) law, (3) science. Law: 1. Julian Kinderlerer (UK), Professor of Intellectual Property Law (chair of the group) 2. Linda Nielsen (DK), Professor of Global Law and Governance 3. Paula Martinho da Silva (PT), lawyer, visiting Professor at the Bioethics Institute 4. Herman Nys (BE), Professor of Medical Law 5. Laura Palazzani (IT), Professor of Philosophy of Law Ethics, theology and humanities: 6. Emmanuel Agius (MT), Professor of Moral Philosophy 7. Inez de Beaufort (NL), Professor of Health Care Ethics 8. Hille Haker (DE), Professor of Social Ethics 9. G\u00fcnter Virt (AT), Professor of Moral Theology 10. Peter Dabrock (DE), Chair of Systematic Theology (Ethics) ( 1 ) The EGE\u2019s mandate was renewed by the Commission Decision of 26 March 2001 for a 4-year period and its remit was slightly modified to improve the group\u2019s working methods. The EGE\u2019s mandate was decided on 11 May 2005 (Decision 2005/383/EC) and extended by the Commission Decision of 14 October 2009 (Decision 2009/757/EC). Members of the EP cannot be selected as EGE members because this may determine conflict of interest and would contradict provisions stated in the remit of the group (Legal Service (JUR(2006)30358 JFP/fag, dated 3.7.2006). ( 2 ) The Parliament and the Council may draw the Commission\u2019s attention to questions which they consider to be of major ethical importance. ",

        "THE PROTECTION OF FUNDAMENTAL ETHICAL PRINCIPLES IN INTERNATIONAL RESEARCH AND INNOVATION PROGRAMMES 11 2.2 Summary report of the third meeting The meeting was opened by Mr Jean-Claude Th\u00e9bault, Director-General of the Bureau of European Policy Advisors . Mr Th\u00e9bault welcomed and thanked the partici- pants for coming to the meeting. He underlined the support of President Barroso on the embedding of ethics and fundamental rights protection into EU policy sectors. He explained the role that ethics plays in BEPA and the Commission as a whole and he explained that European Union institutional bodies are confronted with the need to react on economic austerity, stagnation and job losses. He underlined that the European economic strategy, Europe 2020, proposed by President Barroso to the EU Member States and the European Parliament, identifies research and innovation as a main pillar for the prosperity of Europe. He then stated that the IDB meeting aimed to clarify how ethics, the respect of fundamental values and societal aspects can play a role in the European economic strategy. A number of keynote speeches followed his welcome speech. Prof. Julian Kinderlerer, President of the EGE Prof. Kinderlerer stated that both responsibility and integrity are key elements for a proper use of science and technology. He explained to the participants that the EGE\u2019s work covers science and technology related to policy options. He stressed the importance of ethics in the EU domain after the entering into force of the Lisbon Treaty and thanked Prof. Hermeren for the work done in the past years as the former EGE President. He made reference to the last opinion of the US Presidential Bioethics Commission on scientific misconduct in clinical trials carried out in Guatemala in the 1950s and 1960s and underlined the need to have an intimate link between ethics and clinical and research practices. Prof. Andrzej Gorski, President of the Polish National Ethics Council (NEC) (rotat- ing Presidency of the Council of the EU) Prof. Gorski, on behalf of the Polish rotating Presidency of the Council of the EU, thanked the Commission for the work done in the fields of bioethics and reported on actions carried out in Poland to further reinforce the role ethics plays in the Polish research and medical policy domains. He also referred to the Polish Presidency\u2019s initiatives on ethics and clinical trials and ethics and nanotechnology. Prof. Szonyi L\u00e1szl\u00f3, President of the Hungarian NEC (former rotating Presidency of the Council of the EU) Prof. L\u00e1szl\u00f3 thanked the participants and reported on actions carried out by the Hungarian NEC in the past years. He particularly referred to Hungarian initiatives to debate and clar- ify issues related to informed consent, data protection, human genetics and public health policies. Dr Rudolf Strohmeier, Deputy Director-General (Research and Innovation DG) Dr Strohmeier made a speech on the role that science and technology play in the global EU macroeconomic strategy, Europe 2020. He reported on the expected goals of the above strategy with specific regard to its scientific and societal dimension. He explained that the European Commission has proposed a multiannual budget of EUR 1 trillion for ",
        "REPORT OF THE THIRD MEETING OF THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION\u2019S INTERNATIONAL DIALOGUE ON BIOETHICS 12 the period 2014\u201320. He explained that the largest part of this budget will be aimed at get- ting people into work and growing the economy, tied in with the Europe 2020 strategy for smart, sustainable and inclusive growth based on investment at a European level to compli- ment what EU Member States do on a national level. He also underlined that research and innovation have been identified as main pillars for the prosperity of Europe. He stated that we will then boost growth and jobs across the EU by investing more in Europe\u2019s brains: EUR 15.2 billion will be invested in education and vocational training, an increase by 68 % in this type of expenditure; and EUR 80 billion will be dedicated to research and innova- tion funding, an increase of 46 %. The above EUR 80 billion will also be complemented by EUR 60 billion from the EU Structural Funds. He underlined that innovation is a mean of suc- cessfully tackling major societal challenges, such as climate change, energy and resource scarcity, health and ageing, and he underlined the need to align new technologies with societal needs, expectations, concerns and values. Dr Strohmeier explained that finding a balance between economic and sociocultural consid- erations for promoting a responsible economic policy in the EU is a key question to address. He underlined the need to strike a balance between cultural diversity and the fundamental values indicated in the Charter of Fundamental Rights and underlined the constructive role international debates play in that. Dr Vittorio Prodi, European Parliament, STOA Dr Prodi thanked the Commission for making the European Parliament part of this initia- tive and underlined the positive role science and technology play in EU policy strategy to establish a \u2018wealthy but fair\u2019 European Union. He stressed the relevance of the notion of human dignity in the debate on science and technology and he urged the need to introduce the notion of responsibility in environmental policies. He also referred to other sensitive policy domains where the notion of responsibility plays a crucial role, such as energy policy, sustainable use of environmental potentials (including food safety) and climate change. He also underlined the central role human beings play in the debate on ethics of science. He addressed the problem of the carbon economy with regard to climate change and issues related to the cultural and technological divide and the free circulation of knowledge. He stated that a development model must have new basis: from resource exploitation, produc- tion and pollution to a new energy system based on renewable and diffused cogeneration. He also stated that a social system based on shared knowledge, learning and participa- tion can be our path, but we can\u2019t walk it without the drive of science \u2014 a new science, a science for the good of a global community. Dr Prodi then referred to the digital agenda and the need to ethically assess the use of the Internet and stated that scientific research can provide a path for responsible growth but this target should never erode the respect of the fundamental rights of European citizens. He claimed that science and technology are motors of peace and justice and stated that EU science should avoid dual use and maleficent uses of technology. ",
        "THE PROTECTION OF FUNDAMENTAL ETHICAL PRINCIPLES IN INTERNATIONAL RESEARCH AND INNOVATION PROGRAMMES 13 Prof. George Gaskell (Professor of Social Psychology) Prof. Gaskell addressed societal aspects of research innovation policies, with specific atten- tion to EU macroeconomic considerations and public perception. He reported on indicators on the public perception of science and technology (Eurobarometer 2010) and stated that it is possible to identify a positive attitude towards science and technology in the following research sectors: biofuels, green energy, nanotechnology and ICT. He underlined that in order to promote innovative uses of science and technology it is of paramount importance to communicate the expected benefits linked to specific technology sectors and clearly spell out national benefits as well as benefits for developing countries. He addressed issues related to the public perception of (1) GMO, (2) GM food, (3) animal cloning, (4) biobanks and (5) regenerative medicine. He stated that country differences exist in the EU in the public perception of the above research sectors and the role ethics plays in scientific decisions. He explained that when conflicts between scientific and ethical considerations materialise, scientific considerations tend to prevail but when new technologies are concerned then ethical considerations play a central role in the public perception of new technologies and the role of ethics advisory bodies in their policy design. He stated that the notion of respon- sible innovation varies across technologies and different EU Member States. He stated that responsible innovation needs to be confronted with citizen concerns, and that ethics delib- erations play a role in science and technology governance. Following the above speeches a session on embedding ethics in national research innova- tion programmes started. The session was chaired by Prof. Andrzej Gorski, President of the Polish NEC and representing the rotating Presidency of the Council of the EU. Prof. John Arras, USA Prof. Arras reported on US actions which may have relevance for the debate on responsible innovation. He underlined the US Presidential Bioethics Commission report on synthetic biology and the latest report on ethics on clinical trials in Guatemala in the 1950s and 1960s. He stressed that research and innovation play a key role in the US policy design and indi- cated the NIH programmes as an expression of this priority setting. He explained that ethics plays a reactive role in the US when technology is developed (think of the debate on repro- ductive technologies in the USA). He underlined that the request of President Obama to the US Presidential Bioethics Commission to issue an opinion on synthetic biology opened a new anticipatory rather than reactive approach. He underlined the existence of differences between the EU and the US on the role the precautionary principle plays in the use of sci- ence, but stressed the existence of similarities between the two sides of the Atlantic with regard to the importance of democratic debates on R & D. He indicated a positive reaction by the US on international coordination of dual use technologies. He equally stressed that general rules for clinical trials (protection of volunteers, informed consent procedures) are important. Prof. Ryuichi Ida, Japan Prof. Ida addressed issues related to the embedding of ethics in national research and inno- vation programmes. He explained that the Japanese science and technology basic plan was adopted in August 2011. The above plan addressed the 5-year technology policy covering ",
        "REPORT OF THE THIRD MEETING OF THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION\u2019S INTERNATIONAL DIALOGUE ON BIOETHICS 14 resources, priority setting and a society-oriented approach. He explained that the above priorities include, inter alia, the promotion of innovation (in the biotechnology and biomedi- cine sectors) and regulatory science (regulatory framework for science and technology). He explained that this goal aims at deepening the link between society and R & D policy actors. Social impact is conceived as a tool to identify R & D policy priorities and monitor their responsible use. Ethical, legal and social aspects (ELSA) are therefore identified as specific sectors to be autonomously financed and embedded in R & D practice. He also explained that awareness raising (scientists and citizens) is another key goal of the above R & D 5-year strategy with the full support of the minister for education (including budget allocation). This approach reverses the previous approach which was science based and science oriented. Dr Genevi\u00e8ve Dubois-Flynn, Canada Dr Dubois-Flynn gave a presentation on Canadian actions on ethics and R & D. She explained that knowledge and innovation are, for the Canadian government, drivers of success in the 21st century global economy and that the Canadian Institutes of Health Research, a feder- ally funded agency, is striving to create innovative health research in maintaining investiga- tor-driven research to fuel discovery and enhancing commercialisation and relationships with industries. She explained that Canada has been particularly successful in integrating ethics in research in areas such as genetics (Genome Canada requires the integration of ethics in funding applications) neuroimaging (in basic and clinical research), regenerative medicine and the commercialisation of cognitive neuroscience. She stated that challenges remain, however, in several areas such as the reciprocal respect of rules of engagement with industry partners, the sharing of research data and the streamlining of ethics reviews of multisite studies. She also underlined that in biomedicine the embedding of ethics in research practice is a legal requirement, in particular for clinical trials. Prof. Xiaomei Zhai, China Prof. Zhai reported on the Chinese R & D policy framework and underlined that the budget allocated to R & D has been increased by 20 %. She explained that contrary to the approach taken in the 1990s (aimed at maximising scientific freedom at the cost of ethical aspects) the embedding of ethics is now required in research and technology in China. She explained that in 1999 the Chinese scientific community asked the for embedding of ethics in human embryonic stem cell research. In 2010 and 2011 there was a paradigm shift in China and responsible innovation has become a key objective of the Chinese R & D policy. Debates began on universal values to embed in science and technology, together with debates on ethical pluralism and national provisions for research ethics. She also explained that religious considerations (Confucianism, Taoism, Buddhism, etc.) play a role in the debate on ethics and science in China and that the approach chosen by the government is to participate in the preparation of international guidelines on the ethics of science and new technologies that otherwise may only reflect Western cultural features. In this sense, she stated, interna- tional ethics guidelines can be embedded in Chinese R & D practices only when related to, and filtered by, local cultural features. ",
        "THE PROTECTION OF FUNDAMENTAL ETHICAL PRINCIPLES IN INTERNATIONAL RESEARCH AND INNOVATION PROGRAMMES 15 Prof. Boris Yudin, Russia Prof. Yudin explained that Russian bioethics regulatory frameworks started in 1996 with a regulation on genetic engineering (gene therapy). He then reported other examples of nor- mative bioethics documents in Russia, such as the one on human cloning (2002, amended in 2010). He stated that Russia is now preparing a regulatory framework for clinical trails addressing, inter alia, informed consent procedures, participation of healthy volunteers and human embryonic stem cell ethics provisions. He underlined that normative systems on nanotechnology are still missing in Russia but reported on a declaration of ethics principles by Commonwealth of Independent States countries (EU and NIH and UNESCO involved) to be discussed by the CIS Assembly in 2011. Prof. Vijay Kumar, India Prof. Kumar addressed health research in India and the role ethics plays in this. The Indian science and technology system consists of central government science and technology departments, state government science and technology departments, central socioeco- nomic and other ministries, independent research institutions, in-house R & D in private research institutions and science and technology in non-governmental organisations. The Department of Health Research, under the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (MOH & FW) of the government of India, aims to bring modern health technology to people by encourag- ing innovations related to diagnostics and treatment methods as well as prevention, translat- ing the innovations into products and processes by facilitating evaluation and testing in syn- ergy with other departments of the MOH & FW, as well as other science departments, and introducing these innovations into the public health service and health systems research. He stated that the President of India has declared 2010 to be the start of the \u2018Decade of Innovation\u2019. To take this agenda forward, the Prime Minister has approved the setting up of a National Innovation Council (NIC) which aims to: (1) formulate a roadmap for innovation for 2010 \u201320; (2) create a framework for evolving an Indian model of innovation with its focus on inclusive growth, delineating policy initiatives within the government required to spur innova- tion, developing and championing innovation attitudes and approaches, creating appropri- ate ecosystems and environments to foster inclusive innovation, exploring new strategies and alternatives for innovations and collaborations, identifying ways and means to scale and sustain innovations; (3) encourage central and state governments to innovate, encouraging universities and R & D institutions to innovate, facilitating innovations by SMEs, encouraging all important sectors of the economy to innovate; (4) encourage innovation in public service delivery, encouraging multidisciplinary and globally competitive approaches for innovations. The council will also promote the setting up of state and sector innovation councils to help implement strategies for innovation in states and for specific sectors. Prof. Kumar said that Indian science and technology policy encourages research and innovation in areas of rel- evance for the economy and society by promoting close and productive interaction between private and public institutions in science and technology and innovating systems to docu- ment, protect, evaluate and learn from India\u2019s rich heritage of traditional knowledge. The development of technologies that add value to India\u2019s indigenous resources and that pro- vide holistic and optimal solutions that are suited to the Indian social\u2013cultural\u2013economic ethos is given importance. The substantial strengthening of enabling mechanisms that relate ",
        "REPORT OF THE THIRD MEETING OF THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION\u2019S INTERNATIONAL DIALOGUE ON BIOETHICS 16 to technology development, evaluation, absorption and upgrading from concept to utilisa- tion is always encouraged. All innovation programmes should follow the principles of univer- sal harmony, respect for all creation and an integrated holistic approach. Prevalent problems should be the guiding principles for national innovation programmes. In health-related areas, innovations should aim at bringing modern health technology to people, keeping in view bioethics principles. Mechanisms should be in place which recognise, respect and reward the knowledge-rich, economically poor indigenous people who may have made innova- tions in traditional knowledge for inclusive development. International cooperation and col- laboration should address common goals effectively by pooling both material and intellec- tual resources. International cooperation should ensure global justice and narrow the gap between developed and developing nations. Proven means of intervention should be made available to developing countries and prevent the exploitation of research participants. All collaborations should adhere to ethical guidelines. Dr An\u00edbal Gil Lopes, Brazil Dr Lopes stated that Brazilian investment in R & D, although lower than the investments of the leading countries, has been increasing continuously and it is expected to sur- pass USD 19 billion in 2011. He explained that a system has been established in Brazil (CEP/CONEP system) for reviewing and monitoring the ethical aspects of scientific research involving human beings throughout the national territory, keeping the databases updated. The system is formed by the National Commission for Ethics in Research (CONEP), which is directly linked to the National Health Council. The Ministry of Health is responsible for the functioning of the commission and its executive secretariat; and of the Committees for Eth- ics in Research (CEPs), which are directly linked to the scientific research institutions. The scientific research institutions are responsible for the functioning of the committees and their executive secretariats. Members of the CEP/CONEP system have complete independ- ence to make autonomous decisions in the exercise of their functions, with all information received remaining confidential. The CEP/CONEP system takes into consideration several aspects relating to science and technology, such as social, cultural and economic issues, ensuring ethical parameters for research and innovation in humans. Both \u2018Plataforma Brasil\u2019 and the \u2018Brazilian Clinical Trials Registry\u2019 further the social control of ethics in research and give public transparency to the research done on human beings. Following the above presentation a debate started. Issues discussed included, inter alia: \u2022 scientific reviews of drug production processes and assessments; \u2022 the notion of innovation in research and the role ethics plays in it; \u2022 the participation of healthy volunteers in multicentre international clinical trials; \u2022 the role ethics is acquiring in the global discussion on science and technology and the impact on macroeconomic policies at world level. Following the above speeches a session on embedding ethics in national research innova- tion programmes started. The session was chaired by Prof. Szonyi L\u00e1szl\u00f3, President of the Hungarian NEC and representing the Hungarian rotating Presidency of the Council of the EU. ",
        "THE PROTECTION OF FUNDAMENTAL ETHICAL PRINCIPLES IN INTERNATIONAL RESEARCH AND INNOVATION PROGRAMMES 17 Prof. Manuel Ruiz de Chavez, Mexico Prof. Manuel Ruiz de Chavez explained that Mexico\u2019s National Bioethics Commission (NBC) was established in 1992 but its mandate was changed by a Presidential Decree issued in September 2005 that conferred on it the mission to contribute to the development of a bio- ethics culture in Mexico. The NBC will therefore be a leading independent organisation, rec- ognised by society as a national and international point of referral in the context of bioethical dilemmas and the development of a bioethics culture. He stated that the Mexican NEC\u2019s main objectives include: establishing public health policies related to bioethics; serving as a national advisory body on specific topics in bioethics; facilitating discussions on bioethical issues with the participation of various social sectors; promoting the teaching of bioethics, particularly in the healthcare field; promoting, nationwide, the establishment of local com- missions on bioethics; promoting in health institutions, both public and private, the organisa- tion and operation of hospital bioethics committees and research ethics committees. He explained that the key ethical issues identified by the NBC to be worked on are: bioethics and public policy in Mexico; bioethics infrastructure; research ethics; bioethics, drugs and medications (prescription, access and advertising); maternal mortality and other reproduc- tive health issues; ethics in the doctor\u2013patient relationship; informed consent; end of life; protection of personal data and biological samples. He explained that Mexico has estab- lished several programmes for ethics in national research innovations. These programmes have been developed to make sure that the benefits and burdens of research are fairly distributed among all groups and classes of the members of society, without prejudice due to age, gender, economic status, culture and ethnic origin, among others, and focusing on the safeguarding of vulnerable groups, protection of living beings and preservation of the environment. He also reported on international activities carried out by the Mexican NBC with the following international actors: the World Health Organisation (WHO); the Pan Ameri- can Health Organisation (PAHO); the University of Miami, specifically the CITI (Collaborative Institutional Training Initiative) programme; BEPA; the Council of Europe; the Pan American Health and Education Foundation (PAHEF). Prof. Leonardo de Castro, Philippines Prof. de Castro explained that the remit of the Philippines NEC is under revision in order to open the work of the above body to ethics issues arising from emerging technologies. He stated that this new approach will allow the NEC to address new uses of biomedi- cal technologies, from stem cells to biomedicines for commercial output. He stated that the Philippines NEC is preparing information sheets for vulnerable patients in clinical and research trials and that it is also working on the risks and benefits of nanotechnologies, IPR and unknown risks arising from the use of drugs by people with different genetic profiles. He explained that the Philippines NEC\u2019s main goal is to clarify patients\u2019 rights with regard to capacity building, benefit sharing, informed consent procedures, voluntary participation, etc. He also reported on some cases of organ trafficking in the Philippines and stressed the role patients should play in designing innovation research policy.

        "REPORT OF THE THIRD MEETING OF THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION\u2019S INTERNATIONAL DIALOGUE ON BIOETHICS 18 Prof. Umar Anggara Jenie, Indonesia Prof. Jenie explained that there is much international scientific cooperation between Indonesia and other countries in Asia, Europe and America, including research collaboration in the field of biosciences. The Indonesian Institute of Sciences (LIPI or Lembaga Ilmu pengetahuan Indo- nesia), where the secretariat of the Indonesian National Bioethics Commission (KBN) is based, has entered into many research collaborations with overseas scientific institutions. The LIPI is a government body responsible for carrying out scientific research and development in many fields, excluding medical sciences, and the structural organisation of the LIPI is similar to that of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS). The LIPI has many research centres, including those for physics, chemistry, geotechnology, oceanography, biology and biotechnology. The legal documents which are always considered and used for setting up international collabora- tions in the field of biosciences are: the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD), adopted by the UN in 1992 in Rio de Janeiro (Brazil); the Cartagena Protocol (CP) on Biosafety to the CBD, adopted on 29 January 2000 in Cartagena (Spain), which entered into force on 11 September 2003; the Nagoya Protocol (NP) on Access to Genetic Resources and the Fair and Equitable Sharing of Benefits Arising from their Utilisation to the CBD, adopted on 29 October 2010 in Nagoya (Japan); the Universal Declaration on the Human Genome and Human Rights (UDH- GHR), adopted by the 29th General Conference of UNESCO on 11 November 1997 in Paris (France); the International Declaration on Human Genetic Data (IDHGD), adopted by the 32nd General Conference of UNESCO on 16 October 2003 in Paris (France); the Universal Declara- tion on Bioethics and Human Rights (UDBHR), adopted by the 33rd General Conference of UNESCO on 19 October 2005 in Paris (France). The CBD, CP and NP, adopted by the United Nations, and the Conference of the Parties (COP) to the CBD are legally binding on the member states. The Indonesian government has ratified the CBD as Act No 4, 1994. The UDHGHR, IDHGD and UDBHR are not legally binding, but can be used as guidance for member states in preparing their own legal documents. He explained that, after ratifying the CBD, the Indonesian government is now setting up some technical rules to implement the CBD, including the CP and the NP. In the above two examples of international research collaboration between Indo- nesia and Japan, as well as Indonesia and the US, the agreement made by both parties was based on international legal documents, such as the CBD, including the CP and the NP, and the three UNESCO declarations were also considered, as well as the countries\u2019 own national laws. In implementing the CBD, especially the CP, the Indonesian government is endorsing the use of material transfer agreements (MTA), set up and agreed by all parties to the collabora- tive research, especially for regulation of the transboundary movement of biological samples, regardless of whether or not they are modified organisms. In research collaborations on the human genome, such as cloning and stem cell research, Indonesian standpoints follow the rules set up in the UDHGHR, which states that practices which are contrary to human dignity, such as reproductive cloning of human beings, shall not be permitted (Article 11, UDHGHR). He then stated that the protection of ethical principles in international research collabora- tion means that the collaboration agreement shall respect: human rights and human dig- nity (especially for medical research); sustainability of biodiversity, the biosphere and the environment (especially for bioscience research); and the international research agreement which has already been agreed by all parties, including with regard to access to biodiversity, access to technology, biosafety and benefit sharing . ",
        "THE PROTECTION OF FUNDAMENTAL ETHICAL PRINCIPLES IN INTERNATIONAL RESEARCH AND INNOVATION PROGRAMMES 19 Dr Abrahim Mohsen, Egypt Dr Mohsen explained that there is an exponential increase in clinical trials in developing coun- tries. He explained that 23 clinical ethics committees exist in the country and research ethics committees (RECs) are also established to assess the ethical implications of research trials as defined in the regulation on REC functioning adopted in 2011. The above guidelines define informed consent procedures, the involvement of health volunteers, etc. Sixty-seven per cent of projects were approved and the rest approved under specific requests. International sources financed 40 % of projects and the Egyptian government 3 %. He stated that information about medical research ethics committee (MREC) activities in developing countries is limited. RECs in developing countries were reported to have limited expertise, while ethical principles are still in their early stages. Members of these committees meet infrequently, have no formal training in ethics and many lack important financial and administrative resources. Against this, there is an exponential increase in clinical drug trials funded by multinational pharmaceutical compa- nies. Countries of the developing world offer many advantages, mainly lower overhead costs for conducting drug trials when compared to industrial nations. Supervision and monitoring mechanisms are either weak, absent or amenable to manipulation. Other problems include offering unproven therapies and exploiting desperate patients. Egypt, with a population of 85 million, very low per capita income and very limited annual healthcare expenditure, has wit- nessed a recent increase in the intensity of research activities and, similar to other developing countries, there is a growing concern with the potential for exploitation in the area of interna- tional research. Therefore, the establishment of MRE committees is critical in order to ensure that risks to subjects are minimised and reasonable in relation to anticipated benefits. A particular accent should be placed on respect for the dignity of research subjects, making appropriate compensation for any injury which may occur during research and protecting confidentiality. Dr Hamdy El-Sayed, Egypt Dr Sayed explained that according to the Egyptian constitution, informed consent is a pre- requisite for clinical trials in the country. Transgenic technology is forbidden, and for repro- ductive purposes technology can only be used for married couples. The Ministry of Public Health verifies the ethical approval of drugs to be marketed and licensed. He explained that the Egyptian Medical Syndicate keeps the register and is responsible for medical ethics, including bioethics. The Medical Syndicate also administers the disciplinary committee, and any doctor accused of violating medical ethics, including bioethics, will stand before such a committee and, in case of severe violation, may lose his/her medical licence. He explained that in Egypt there are several RECs in faculties of medicine, institutes and teaching hospi- tals and that there is a central REC in the Ministry of Health and another one in the Academy of Research. Dr Abraham Aseffa, PABIN Dr Aseffa explained that science and innovation are of low priority in Africa and the work of NECs suffers from this situation. He stated that international innovation programmes, when related to Africa, have to face a poor level of local technological capacity. He explained that PABIN is composed of 324 members in 26 African countries, and reported on the ",
        "REPORT OF THE THIRD MEETING OF THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION\u2019S INTERNATIONAL DIALOGUE ON BIOETHICS 20 international activities regarding ethics that PABIN is carrying out with a number of inter- national organisations, such as the WHO, UNESCO and the EDCTP. He also reported on actions carried out with the US National Institute of Health and UK research bodies. Following the above presentation a debate started. Issues discussed included, inter alia: \u2022 good clinical trial provisions in different regions of the world; \u2022 clinical trials sponsored by private enterprises and consistency with public health priorities in the countries where the trials are carried out; \u2022 organ donation and organ trafficking; \u2022 community benefits in African clinical trials; \u2022 the link between diversity in ethics and multiculturalism; \u2022 informed consent procedures and multiculturalism; \u2022 innovation, often in biomedicine and in other scientific sectors. Following the above speeches a session on international initiatives for the promotion of responsible research globally started. The session was chaired by Prof. Julian Kinderlerer, President of the EGE. Dr Javier Arias Diaz, Council of Europe (CoE) Dr Arias reported on an initiative under the CoE Spanish Presidency. He explained that in the context of the Spanish Chairmanship of the Committee of Ministers of the CoE (2009), and in order to ensure the protection of the individual rights of persons participating in such research, the Spanish authorities had taken the initiative of organising a conference, the purpose of which was the adoption of a declaration agreed by the representatives of states participating as members or observers in the CoE\u2019s work on bioethics. The latter would therefore be called upon to participate fully in the preparation and adoption of the declaration. The issues identified as being particularly relevant were the following: justifica- tion of the research, including reasons to carry out the research in the country concerned; cooperation/partnership with the country concerned with carrying out the research; review of the research project in all countries concerned; independence and multidisciplinarity of research ethics committees (REC); safety of research participants; standards of care, including provision of treatment; issues of control groups and placebos; appropriate prior information and free, informed consent; potential benefits and foreseeable risks for research participants or the community or group; compensation for damage; monitoring of research projects; public access to research results (e.g. publication); measures to ensure that ethi- cal standards are effectively applied (e.g. criteria for authorisation to put products, such as drugs, on the market); access to treatment and other benefits after research. He then stated that the \u2018draft declaration on the implementation of fundamental ethical principles in transnational biomedical research\u2019 is intended as a brief and is not binding from a legal point of view. It will also have an attached explanatory report. After a series of proposals by as many countries and institutions as possible, it plans to submit this draft for approval and then leave it open for approval by any additional countries that wish to ratify it.

        "THE PROTECTION OF FUNDAMENTAL ETHICAL PRINCIPLES IN INTERNATIONAL RESEARCH AND INNOVATION PROGRAMMES 21 Dr Dafna Feinholz, UNESCO Dr Feinholz reported on UNESCO\u2019s actions to promote responsible innovation globally. She explained that the target would be to ensure the same quality of protection of human sub- jects in international research (taking into account the diversity of sociocultural and economic realities) across the globe. She stated that UNESCO can play a central role in this effort also because of the UN Universal Declaration on Bioethics and Human Rights adopted by 191 countries in 2005. She stated that 191 countries committed themselves to enhancing REC and NEC work at national and international level. She indicated the main ethical principles stated in the declaration, such as protection of environment, intergenerational responsibility, protec- tion of human beings, capacity building and benefit sharing. She explained that the UNESCO International Bioethics Committee (IBC) had also decided to further elaborate the principles, and informed consent, social responsibility and vulnerability are topics covered by the IBC. Dr Marie-Charlotte Bou\u00ebsseau, WHO Dr Bou\u00ebsseau reported on the WHO\u2019s actions on ethics. She reported that the WHO aims to promote transparency and facilitate international cooperation. She stated that the Pan Afri- can Clinical Trials Alliance (PACTA) is a WHO initiative bringing together 19 sub-Saharan Afri- can countries for an ethics review of vaccine-related clinical trials. The WHO aims to facilitate a common strategy for the ethics review of clinical trials. Similar actions are also carried out for RECs, including the production of a text book for RECs (the second edition will be pub- lished in October 2011). The WHO organises the global NEC forum, and the second meet- ing will take place in Carthage, Tunisia, in September 2012. The WHO also provides data on clinical trials freely in order to allow a transparent approach to a debate on clinical trials. Following the above presentation, a debate on how to promote responsible innovation started. Issues discussed included, inter alia: \u2022 the notion of vulnerability (including vulnerable groups) in multicentre research trials; \u2022 benefit sharing; \u2022 the role of local ethics committees and the EU regulatory framework (Directive 2001/20/EC); \u2022 publication of negative results and EDTCP and WHO works; Closing remarks by Prof. Julian Kinderlerer, President of the EGE Prof. Kinderlerer thanked participants for their contribution and BEPA for having facilitated and organised this event. He stressed that ethical review and ethical analysis in research and medical practice are considered of key importance and need to be further improved qualitatively. But a global approach to ethics and innovation needs to be confronted with the existence of divergent interpretations of common concepts. He then stressed the role initiatives such as the IDB play in clarifying these divergences and in identifying existing commonalities in the ethics governance of science and technology.

I also express my gratitude to the President of the European Group on Ethics, Prof. Kinder- lerer, the Chair of the Hungarian National Ethics Council, Prof. Szonyi, the Chair of the Polish National Ethics Council, Prof. G\u00f3rski, Doctor Prodi, the honourable member of the European Parliament, and all of you for coming here from all over the world. Please allow me also to forward you a warm welcome from President Barroso, who today had to attend the United Nations General Assembly in New York and could not open this meeting as initially foreseen. President Barroso asked me to communicate his strong sup- port for this initiative and for the embedding of fundamental values and ethics in European and international research and innovation policies. Distinguished guests, ladies and gentleman, I am honoured to be here with you in my capac- ity as Director-General of the Bureau of European Policy Advisors, BEPA, the strategic think- tank of the European Commission President. As you know BEPA has a leading role in ethics within the Commission. BEPA provides the Secretariat of the European Group on Ethics in Science and New Tech- nologies, the external advisory body which, for the past 20 years, has provided the Com- mission with high quality and independent advice on ethical aspects of science and new technologies. BEPA also chairs the Inter-service Group on Ethics and European Union Policies, a Com- mission coordination body which aims to rationalise and coordinate Commission activities in the fields of bioethics and ethics of science and new technologies. BEPA organises and provides the Secretariat to the European Commission International Dialogue on Bioethics which you are attending today and I am happy to see that this initiative has been further linked to the National Ethics Councils Forum by facilitating the establish- ment of synergies between the EGE and the national ethics councils worldwide. BEPA therefore works to integrate ethics (1) within the Commission, (2) at inter-institutional level with the European Parliament and the Council and (3) at international level with the ",

The goal is to strike a balance between ethical and sociocultural diversity, both at European and global level, and to respect internationally recognised fundamental values. Ladies and gentlemen, the world is confronted with the worst financial crisis in the last 50 years and all institutional bodies are confronted with the need to react to economic austerity, stagnation and job loss. In such a complex historical period, the need to define a common European strategy for growth and economic recovery, in order to transform Europe into a smart, sustainable and socially inclusive economy, is urgent. How? The European economic strategy, so-called Europe 2020, has already been communicated by President Barroso to the EU Member States and the European Parliament. Research and innovation has been identified as a main pillar for the prosperity of Europe. Today you will help us in understanding how ethics, the respect of fundamental values can play a role in the European economic strategy. This meeting is therefore a unique opportunity to share information and experiences and discuss how ethics can play a role in innovation programmes across the globe. I look forward to your fruitful contributions, Thank you. ",
        "REPORT OF THE THIRD MEETING OF THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION\u2019S INTERNATIONAL DIALOGUE ON BIOETHICS 24 Prof. Julian KINDERLERER Prof. Julian KINDERLERER President of the EGE Dr Jean-Claude Th\u00e9bault, Prof. Andrzej G\u00f3rski Polish NEC, Prof. Laszlo Szonyi Hungarian NEC, Mr Vittorio Prodi. It is with enormous pleasure that I welcome you this morning on behalf of the EGE. Ethical behaviour in science, technology and medicine should be regarded as a norm, where those who work in new and exciting fields behave in a manner that is beyond reproach and ensure that their work is reproducible, interpreted in an honest manner, performed with integrity and treats the subjects of the work with utmost respect. Only short weeks ago the United States Presidential Commission on Bioethical Issues released its report \u2018Ethically impos- sible\u2019 on experimentation on human subjects in Guatemala some 60 years ago. It said \u2018The best thing we can do when faced with a dark chapter is to bring it to light.\u2019 The President of the US Commission said that \u2018A civilisation can be judged by the way that it treats its most vulnerable individuals.\u2019 \u2018It is our moral responsibility to care for those who cannot protect themselves and clearly in this dark chapter of our medical history we grievously failed to keep that covenant.\u2019 I chair Europe\u2019s equivalent of that committee. We are not limited to bioethics, but rather face a wider task: ethical issues derived from science and new tech- nologies. The 15 of us are drawn from a wide range of disciplines: science, law, philosophy and theology. We are appointed as individuals and are totally independent in our analysis of the issues put before us by the President of the Commission. There are still times in science and medicine when ethical considerations are ignored \u2018for the greater good\u2019. The European Union has taken a major step in incorporating a charter of fundamental rights in its treaties. We must provide the vision and forethought to ensure that we do try at least to implement the standards to which we (as individuals) and the European Union aspire. I want to take this opportunity (the first public opportunity) to thank Goran Hermeren for the work he did over 10 years as President of the EGE, for he helped forged a team spirit which is crucial to the work of this group. We believe that we achieved a little in ensuring that ethical principles and values are central and integral in the daily life of the European Union. I took the chair of our group with trepidation, and hope I can emulate that which Goran achieved. ",
        "THE PROTECTION OF FUNDAMENTAL ETHICAL PRINCIPLES IN INTERNATIONAL RESEARCH AND INNOVATION PROGRAMMES 25 Prof. Andrzej GORSKI Prof. Andrzej GORSKI President of the Polish NEC It is a great honour to represent Poland at this important conference, the leading theme of which is the protection of fundamental ethical principles in international research and innovation. Recently, Poland has made significant progress towards building and upgrad- ing the standards of protection of these principles. A Commission for Ethics in Science was established at the Polish Academy of Sciences \u2014 its nine members were elected out of 44 candidates by the academy\u2019s General Assembly and the commission subsequently elected as its chair a reputed Polish lawyer, Prof. A. Zoll. The mission of this body is awareness rais- ing and education in responsible conduct of research as well as addressing individual cases of scientific misconduct and therefore safeguarding the principles of research integrity. Fur- thermore, the Committee for Bioethics was also established to be led by a prominent Polish philosopher and ethicist, Prof. Z. Szawarski. We hope, therefore, that its activities will help to formulate opinions in several difficult issues which so far have not been approached, at least in Poland. As you probably remember, next month an international conference organised with the European Commission \u2014 Nanoethics 2011 \u2014 will be held in Warsaw as one of the major events of Polish Presidency of the Council of the EU. Finally, I would also like to men- tion a planned new legislation on clinical trials which should lead to better transparency in health research by introducing mandatory trial registration. This initiative is the result of our Committee\u2019s action; we advised the Minister of Health to issue similar instructions to all units conducting health research in Poland and now the respective legislation will follow. Poland is the first country in Europe which has made this significant step forward in ensuring more transparency in health research and I hope that this conference might be an appropriate forum to suggest what other countries should follow.

Today I would like to address two main policy items of the EU: (1) the role research and innovation plays in the EU economic strategy and (2) the role fundamental values play in European Union policies. Let me first start with the EU economic strategy and the role research and innovation plays in it. Last June, the European Union leaders adopted the Europe 2020 strategy, the EU\u2019s growth strategy for the coming decade, and it aims to transform Europe into a smart, sustainable and socially inclusive economy. The five targets for getting Europe out of its current economic difficulties and boosting growth are: \u2022 having 75 % of 20\u201364-year-olds in employment; \u2022 having 3 % of the EU\u2019s GDP invested in research and innovation; \u2022 reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 20 % or even 30 %, having 20 % of EU energy from renewable sources, increasing EU energy efficiency by a factor of 20 %; \u2022 reducing school drop-out rates below 10 % and at least 40 % of 30- to 34-year-olds com- pleting third level education; \u2022 reducing by at least 20 million the number of people in, or at risk of, poverty and social exclusion. To achieve these targets proper financial means are needed. Negotiations over the EU\u2019s next multiannual budget were therefore launched in June 2011, with the European Commis- sion proposing to allocate EUR 1 trillion for the period 2014\u201320. The largest part of this budget will be aimed at getting people into work and growing the economy, tied in with the Europe 2020 strategy for smart, sustainable and inclusive growth ",
        "REPORT OF THE THIRD MEETING OF THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION\u2019S INTERNATIONAL DIALOGUE ON BIOETHICS 32 Dr Rudolf STROHMEIER based on investment at the European level to compliment what EU Member States do at the national level. Research and innovation has been identified as a main pillar for the prosperity of Europe. We will boost growth and jobs across the EU by investing more in Europe\u2019s brains: EUR 15.2 billion will be invested in education and vocational training, an increase of 68 % in this type of expenditure; and EUR 80 billion will be dedicated to research and innovation funding, an increase of 46 %. The above EUR 80 billion will also be complemented by EUR 60 billion from the EU Structural Funds. Ladies and gentlemen, the EU\u2019s 27 national leaders agree to prioritise research and inno- vation as a motor for growth. These are crucial areas for Europe\u2019s global competitiveness, allowing us to create the jobs and ideas of tomorrow. Besides this clear economic rationale, we also need to boost research and innovation to tackle other challenges we face. Ensuring a smooth path from lab to market, whatever the research sector, whatever the technology, is one of the key aims of the innovation Union. We do know that innovation is a means of successfully tackling major societal challenges, such as climate change, energy and resource scarcity, health and ageing, which are becom- ing more and more urgent by the day. However, for new technologies to be accepted by society, they have to be aligned with societal needs, expectations, concerns and values. The open question is how to promote research innovation in the EU as a tool conducive to socioeconomic welfare while respecting EU citizens\u2019 preferences, concerns and beliefs. How to find a balance between economic and sociocultural consideration of such a com- plex and heterogeneous dimension, such as the EU. How to avoid promoting R & D sectors which might not be consistent with consumers\u2019 desires and thus risk being refused when introduced on the market. These are questions that you are going to debate during the following several days and that will help to provide clarification. Ladies and gentlemen, the European Union is a world player in economic, trade and finan- cial terms and has bilateral and multilateral agreements covering most countries and regions of the globe. Although these relationships focused mainly on trade issues at the beginning, they have expanded over the years to cover investment, economic cooperation, energy, science and technology and environmental protection as well as political matters such as international crime and human rights protection. The European Union is therefore devoting specific attention to the embedding of funda- mental values and ethics in European and international policies, and today\u2019s meeting is an example of international dialogue that we want to promote globally. A dialogue which aims at defending and debating the notion of responsibility in different policy sectors, including research and innovation. ",
        "THE PROTECTION OF FUNDAMENTAL ETHICAL PRINCIPLES IN INTERNATIONAL RESEARCH AND INNOVATION PROGRAMMES 33 Dr Rudolf STROHMEIER In the political guidelines presented by President Barroso to the Parliament and the Euro- pean Council at the beginning of the mandate of this Commission, the President said that the European Union is founded on values: respect for human dignity, freedom, democracy, equality, the rule of law and respect for human rights. The Europe 2020 strategy and its implementing measures cannot contravene these values. This is a legal requirement of the Lisbon Treaty and the governance method which has characterised EU policy design and implementation for decades. We therefore have to strike a balance between ethical and sociocultural diversity, both at EU and non-EU level, while respecting internationally recognised fundamental values and the Charter of Fundamental Rights. There are many concrete research sectors that may contribute to the achievement of EU 2020 priorities: the EU digital agenda, the future Horizon 2020 programme, the innova- tion Union, EU policies on climate change and sustainable use of natural resources and EU energy policy, to mention just a few. All these areas will realise their full potential when optimally aligned with societal challenges and European fundamental values. The Euro- pean Group on Ethics, the Forum of EU-27 National Ethics Councils and the International Dialogue on Bioethics can play an important role in this process. Our goal is to define and implement a responsible use of research and innovation in the European Union. Ladies and gentlemen, to conclude, the European Union is an extremely dynamic reality which has been progressing steadily during the last 60 years. Only in the last 10 years has it adopted a common currency, opened to 15 new Member States and adopted a new Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union ending several years of uncertainty around its institutional future. Today, the European Union is confronted with the worst economic crisis since its establish- ment. If there is a lesson to be learned from this complex situation is that common global governance is needed. The ongoing financial crisis has shown us that ethics and global governance are tools to promote effective EU innovative growth policy, within the EU and with third parties. The EU is promoting a \u2018European way\u2019 to innovation, where ethics is conducive to innovative uses of science, which are socially acceptable, sustainable and responsible. The integration of societal considerations at an early stage of development may help strategic decisions in promoting innovative uses of technology supported by public acceptance. But this mecha- nism implies open debate, mutual respect and tolerance; three axes on which the EU is focusing efforts, actions and initiatives. The meeting today is a unique opportunity to share information and discuss how ethics can play a role in innovation programmes across the globe. I look forward to your fruitful contributions. Thank you for your patience. ",
        "REPORT OF THE THIRD MEETING OF THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION\u2019S INTERNATIONAL DIALOGUE ON BIOETHICS 34 Dr Vittorio PRODI Dr Vittorio PRODI MEP, Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats (S & D) \u2018Equity, solidarity and global governance\u2019 In this time of crisis scientific research can play a crucial role in finding innovative solutions to old problems and new answers to unexpected questions. Focusing upon the concept of well-being, science can not only improve our knowledge of the world, but play a key role in improving our quality of life while shaping a new kind of society. We are facing a more and more evident scarcity of resources. Global competition will inten- sify and put our environment under greater pressure. Recognising the inevitability of resource scarcity we must use materials in a wiser way and find adequate substitutes; a successful example we can point to is the recently discovered special properties of graphene, a carbon monolayer. The lack of international consensus surrounding the definitions of equitable access to and distribution of resources is increasingly worrying. Today\u2019s economic model must urgently be rethought in the perspective of a new, universal solidarity towards present but also future generations. We can\u2019t delay innovative politics and approaches, aimed at sustainable devel- opment. In this perspective research can play a key role, for example elaborating theoretical grounds and technical solutions for newly distributed energy systems, paradigm of a new social model. Today, crisis can paradoxically be an extraordinary opportunity to catalyse a transition towards a low carbon economy. In this sense it could also be a great occasion for science to contribute to a better society. Research and innovation can display their full potential when optimally aligned with societal challenges and European fundamental values, such as soli- darity, the common good, equality and democracy. It is just to uphold these principles that we can face the risks of globalisation, steering it from an unsustainable fractured network of sheer markets towards an integrated and dynamic force for human development. Science can rediscover an ethical goal. \u2018And certainly we should take care not to make the intellect our god; it has, of course, powerful muscles, but no personality. It cannot lead, it can only serve; and it is not fastidious in its choice of a leader. This characteristic is reflected in the qualities of its priests, the intellectuals. The intellect has a sharp eye for methods and tools, but is blind to ends and values. [\u2026] The most important factor in giving shape to our human existence is the setting up and establishment of a goal; the goal being a community of free and happy human beings who ",
        "THE PROTECTION OF FUNDAMENTAL ETHICAL PRINCIPLES IN INTERNATIONAL RESEARCH AND INNOVATION PROGRAMMES 35 Dr Vittorio PRODI by constant inward endeavour strive to liberate themselves from the inheritance of antisocial and destructive instincts. In this effort the intellect can be the most powerful aid.\u2019 [A. Einstein, The goal of human existence, 11 April 1943] Let me consider the present global situation. Those least responsible for climate change, for instance, are currently experiencing (and will continue to experience) its greatest impacts. We can\u2019t avoid speaking of climate justice if this ethical issue persists unsolved. Such dis- parity is an example of greater divisions in our perceptions of the global environment. Present global governance is showing its limits and seems to have difficulties in finding shared solutions. National interests are prevailing over the common good. In this sense I think that scientific research could forge a new path, contributing to elaborate innovative tools to achieve a sort of \u2018grass root equity\u2019, where tools governing the scientific community can provide a backbone for global solidarity across cultural divides. I propose an example: Desertec. A particularly efficient technology, the result of years of research, has created the oppor- tunity for a finally equal partnership, expedient both for European countries and for south Mediterranean countries. The basic concept of Desertec is to generate electricity from renewable sources at the places where they are most abundant. A high voltage direct current grid carries the electric- ity generated from renewables over long distances with a minimum loss of power, making it available wherever it is needed. This can provide the world with an economical, safe and sustainable supply of clean electricity. Desertec is a comprehensive solution that not only aims to cover our increasing energy needs, but also to reduce carbon emissions before global warming gets out of control. Alongside climate protection and ensuring the energy supply, it also has many benefits in terms of development and security. The effects of cli- mate change caused by Europe will be felt first in the Middle East and North Africa region. Thus, it is only fair if Europe promotes the introduction of renewable energies in MENA. The transfer of technology, along with educational and academic programmes, is explicitly pro- moted within the framework of the Union for the Mediterranean. When progressing with technology I find it important to learn from past mistakes, therefore, coming back to the ultimate goal I was talking about previously, we must respect the planet as a vital space, common to all human beings, and, thanks to science and innovation, find a new harmonious ways for humankind to live with it. Ethics can be defined by various standards but I prefer to link it with beauty, in the sense of the combination of good and beautiful (kalos kai agathos) and also justice, truth and free- dom at all levels of governance. ",
        "REPORT OF THE THIRD MEETING OF THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION\u2019S INTERNATIONAL DIALOGUE ON BIOETHICS 36 Dr Vittorio PRODI A development model must have a new basis: from resource exploitation, production and pollution to a new energy system based on renewables and diffused cogeneration. A social system based on shared knowledge, learning and participation can be our path, but we can\u2019t walk it without the drive of science \u2014 a new science, a science for the good of a global community. Needless to remember that the European Union is a non-violent institution; this is valid also for R & D, which has to be directed at peaceful applications and with the basic commitment of directing dual-use knowledge, avoiding applications implying any kind of violence on human persons and the environment. Ethics of reciprocity: broadening and consolidation of the radius of the empathic relation that every human being is able to experience. ",

Figure 8: Brazilian scientific production in some specific areas. Brazil has 0.92 researchers for every 1 000 workers. That figure is low compared to well- established G7 economies, where there are typically around six to eight researchers per thousand, but it is entirely comparable with other large, growing research bases, such as China. Brazilian scientists collaborate with many international organisations.

Brazil also produces over 500 000 new graduates and about 10 000 new PhD researchers each year \u2014 a similar number to France and South Korea. This represents a tenfold increase in 20 years: Brazil\u2019s skilled research workforce is growing. There are several well-known Brazilian S & T (science and technologies) organisations pos- sessing the material and intellectual capacity to promote significant progress. They include: Petrobras/CENPES; the Brazilian Agricultural Research Corporation (Embrapa); the Bioetha- nol Science and Technology Laboratory (CTBE); the Brazilian Reference Centre on Biomass (CENBIO); the Centre for Sugarcane Technology (CTC); the Oswaldo Cruz Foundation (Fiocruz); and the National Institute of Metrology, Standardisation and Industrial Quality (Inmetro). First conclusion: The data presented indicate that Brazil\u2019s policies on research and innovation have been effective both in promoting a growing economy and in eradicating poverty. Despite the clear progress observed, 16.27 million Brazilians still live below the poverty line, in a vulnerable situation. We believe that a rich country is a country without poverty. Second question: To what extent do research innovation policies take into consideration societal and ethical aspects of science and technology? Considerations: In order to guarantee respect for the ethical aspects relating to research in human beings, in 1996 the Brazilian National Health Council created the CEP/CONEP system. The CEP/CONEP system represents the organised form of social control over the practices of science. This sys- tem is responsible for the review and monitoring of the ethical aspects of scientific research involving human beings throughout the national territory, and it keeps the databases updated.

        "REPORT OF THE THIRD MEETING OF THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION\u2019S INTERNATIONAL DIALOGUE ON BIOETHICS 56 Brazil (An\u00edbal Gil Lopes) CEP/CONEP system role and responsibilities: The CEP/CONEP system ensures and safeguards the integrity of rights and the freedom of the volunteers participating in research, protecting them from potential abuse. By the same token, it also assures society that the research is being ethically developed, i.e. that the interests and the welfare of the human being prevail over the interests of researchers, society and science. The economic and social conditions described above make part of our population vulnerable, and this has the effect of limiting its autonomy. For this reason, particular attention is paid to the recruitment of human beings as subjects of research. It is also responsible for informing and advising the Ministry of Health, the Health National Council and other bodies within the unified health system, as well as the government and society, on ethical issues concerning research that involves human beings. The system consists of the National Commission for Ethics in Research (CONEP), which is directly linked to the National Health Council. The Ministry of Health is responsible for the functioning of the commission and its executive secretariat, as well as the Committees for Ethics in Research (CEPs) which are directly linked to the scientific research institutions. The scientific research institutions are responsible for the functioning of the committees and their executive secretariat. Members of the CEP/CONEP system have complete independence to make autonomous deci- sions in the exercise of their functions, maintaining the confidentiality of all information received. CEP is an independent and interdisciplinary committee, consisting of members of both sexes, and has an advisory, deliberative and educational character, designed to protect the interests of research subjects in their integrity and dignity and to contribute to the development of research within ethical standards. Institutions that conduct research involving human beings may have one or more CEPs, as necessary. CEPs maintain regular communication with CONEP. Their quarterly reports include the protocols that are analysed, completed or in progress. CONEP is an independent and interdisciplinary commission of the National Health Council, consisting of 30 members and five alternates/substitutes of both sexes, with consultative, deliberative, legislative and educational duties. Each CEP nominates two candidates for the Health National Council, which is responsible for electing the members of CONEP for a four- year term, with half of the candidates being renewed every two years. CONEP coordinates the work of 598 CEPs established throughout the country. Over 9 000 members meet regularly in order to analyse and review the research protocols on human beings submitted by scientists from different areas of knowledge. During the last three years, over 30 000 protocols were analysed by the CEP/CONEP system. The CEP/CONEP system aims to: \u2022 Provide transparency in the scientific research process to bring potential conflicts of inter- est under social control, while maintaining the confidentiality necessary to ensure the intellectual property of researchers. \u2022 Empower and broaden the autonomy of areas of research, by reinforcing the participation of representatives and users of SUS (Public Health System) in the Committees for Ethics in Research. ",
        "THE PROTECTION OF FUNDAMENTAL ETHICAL PRINCIPLES IN INTERNATIONAL RESEARCH AND INNOVATION PROGRAMMES 57 Brazil (An\u00edbal Gil Lopes) \u2022 Establish the importance of the process for obtaining free and informed consent, check- ing all aspects of the vulnerability conditions (physical, psychological and socioeconomic). \u2022 Ensure that the language used in the free and informed consent is clear and simple, in order to guarantee that all risks and benefits involved in the experimental protocol are easy to understand. \u2022 Ensure that ancillary medical treatment is provided during the clinical trial. \u2022 Ensure that proper treatment and compensation are provided for subjects of research who are injured during trials. \u2022 Ensure access to medicines that are being tested, after the completion of the clinical study, independently of the registration or commercialisation of the drug in Brazil. \u2022 In accordance with Brazilian regulations, the use of placebo control is ethically acceptable when there is no effective treatment and its use will not cause any harm to the participant. In order to improve the social control of ethics in research and to give public transparency to the research done in human beings, an online Brazilian database \u2014 the Plataforma Brasil (http://www.saude.gov.br/plataformabrasil) \u2014 was recently launched, designed to facilitate the management of all research protocols involving human subjects analysed by the CEP/ CONEP system. This platform enables scientific protocols to be followed up from their sub- mission to the CEP/CONEP system to final approval and execution, including monitoring of their development through partial and final reports. The system provides transparency of the ethical analysis by offering access to the public data of all approved research protocols and to the operational flow of the analyses. This methodology significantly reduces the time spent in ethical analysis. In addition, the Brazilian Clinical Trials Registry (Registro Brasileiro de Ensaios Cl\u00ednicos (ReBEC)) was recently launched; this is an open access virtual platform for the registration of ongoing or concluded experimental and non-experimental studies on humans performed in Brazil and elsewhere. ReBEC is a joint project under the Brazilian Ministry of Health, the Pan American Health Organisation (PAHO) and the Oswaldo Cruz Foundation (Fiocruz). The executive com- mittee of ReBEC comprises the aforementioned institutions and the National Health Surveil- lance Agency (ANVISA). This means that ReBEC is a publicly owned governmental research organisation attached to the Brazilian Ministry of Health and managed by the Oswaldo Cruz Foundation (http://www.ensaiosclinicos.gov.br). All details of studies registered on ReBEC are made publicly available. Registration is voluntary and free of charge, but certain fields are mandatory when registering studies. These mandatory data items comply with the minimum dataset requirements of the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors (ICMJE) and the World Health Organisation (WHO). Once the submitted data have been checked, the study is allocated a unique registration number. Responsibility for registration information and study details lies with the sponsor. Trial data will not be removed once the trial has been registered. Second conclusion: The CEP/CONEP system takes into consideration several aspects related to science and technology, such as social, cultural and economic issues, ensuring that ethical parameters are applied to research and innovation in humans. Both Plataforma Brasil and the Brazilian ",

Third question: What aspects should be taken into consideration when devising an international responsible policy for research innovation? Answer: The system should be seen to provide effective international social control of research and innovation, able to respect and protect society as a whole, and the subjects of research in particular, guaranteeing their autonomy. Also, it should be regarded as a genuine com- mitment to social justice, freedom of expression and equal opportunities for every human being, and to respect local cultural values and a socially inclusive economy.

The 2011 budget speech stated that \u2018Canada must increase capacity for world-leading research and development, improve the commercialisation of research and promote education and skills development.\u2019 In the 2011 federal budget mas- sive investments are made, for instance, in Genome Canada research programmes, new Canada Excellence research chairs, sustainable development technology and the \u2018Idea to innovation\u2019 programme, an international education strategy. The Canadian Institutes of Health Research, a federally funded agency, is striving to cre- ate innovative health research in maintaining investigator-driven research to fuel discovery and enhancing commercialisation and relationships with industry. Strengthening the clinical research environment and commercialisation activities create opportunities to integrate eth- ics in such health research innovation programmes. Canada has been particularly successful in integrating ethics in research in areas such as genetics. For instance, Genome Canada requires the integration of ethics in funding appli- cations; it funds research that explores the relationship between genomics and society and the related ethical, environmental, economic, legal and social aspects of research. Crea- tive ways have been used to sensitise and engage the public on issues of genetic testing, such as plays performed in theatres with large audiences. The Public Population Project in Genomics has created the tools for the international harmonisation of 25 major population genomic biobanks around the world. Canada has also been an ethics leader in neuroim- aging (in basic and clinical research), regenerative medicine, and the commercialisation of cognitive neuroscience. Challenges remain, however, in several areas such as the reciprocal respect of rules of engagement with industry partners, the sharing of research data and the streamlining of ethics review of multisite studies. In today\u2019s global economy, research organisations have to increase international partner- ships and collaborations. Important considerations must be addressed when developing an international responsible research innovation policy: it should promote socially bene- ficial research over the long term; require a needs assessment based on cultural, eco- nomical, environmental and political factors; include the need for an impact assessment of research to be conducted and the involvement of end users; provide assurances for ",

Mohsen Ibrahim, MD Chairman of the Research Ethics Committee Prof. of Cardiology \u2014 Cairo University Medical research ethics committees (MRECs) Information about MRECs\u2019 activities in developing countries is limited. Research ethics committees (RECs) in these countries were reported to have limited expertise, while eth- ics principles are still in their early stages. Members of these committees meet infrequently and have no formal training in ethics; many of them lack important financial and administra- tion resources. Against this, there is an exponential increase in clinical drug trials funded by multinational pharmaceutical companies. Countries of the developing world offer many advantages, mainly in the form of lower overhead costs for conducting drug trials in com- parison with industrial nations. Supervision and monitoring mechanisms are either weak, absent or susceptible to manipulation. Other problems include offering unproven therapies and exploiting desperate patients. Egypt, which has a population of 85 million, very low per capita income and very limited annual healthcare expenditure, has witnessed a recent inten- sification in research activities, and \u2014 as in the case of other developing countries \u2014 there is growing concern over the potential for exploitation in the area of international research. Therefore, the establishment of MRE committees is critical in order to ensure that risks to subjects are minimised and reasonable in relation to the anticipated benefits. The dignity of research subjects must be respected and appropriate compensation should be made for any injury which may occur during research. Confidentiality must also be protected. MRECs in Egypt The current regulations in Egypt are governed by the Egyptian Constitution (1971, Part 3, Arti- cle 43: \u2018Any medical or scientific experiment may not be undergone on any persons without his free consent\u2019 (sic)). MRECs are also covered by the Professional Ethics Regulations issued by the Minister for Health and Population, No 238/2003, Articles 52 to 61. Egypt has 15 RECs in total, most of which are affiliated to universities with medical schools and research institu- tions. In addition, a recently developed REC has been set up in the Ministry of Health and a single private independent REC has been developed by a group of medical professionals. Cairo University Medical Research Ethics Committee This committee was established in 2003 following the approval of the dean of the Medi- cal School and the board of directors.

Science and technology has been an integral part of Indian civilisation and culture over the past several millennia. The innate ability to perform creatively in science was backed by an institutional set-up and strong state support following the country\u2019s independence in 1947. India\u2019s science and technology policy encour- ages research and innovation in areas of relevance for the economy and society, in particu- lar by promoting close and productive interaction between private and public institutions in science and technology and innovating systems to document, protect, evaluate and learn from India\u2019s rich heritage of traditional knowledge. Considerable importance is attached to developing technologies that add value to India\u2019s indigenous resources and that provide holistic and optimal solutions that are suited to Indian social\u2013cultural\u2013economic ethos. Sub- stantial strengthening of the enabling mechanisms that relate to technology development, evaluation, absorption and upgrading from concept to utilisation is constantly encouraged. India\u2019s science and technology system consists of central government science and technol- ogy departments, state government science and technology departments, central socio- economic and other ministries, independent research institutions, in-house R & D in private research institutions and science and technology in non-governmental organisations. Major science and technology departments under the government of India comprise the central government S & T departments, such as the Department of Science and Technol- ogy, the Department of Atomic Energy, the Department of Biotechnology, the Ministry of Earth Sciences, the Indian Council of Agricultural Research, the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research, the Administering Council of Scientific and Industrial Research, the Indian Council of Medical Research, defence research and developmental organisations and the Department of Space. All of these departments promote innovations. India has a rising burden of chronic diseases. It has the largest number of people with diabe- tes in the world, with an estimated 19.3 million in 1995 and a projected 57.2 million in 2025. The number of people with hypertension is expected to rise from 118.2 million in 2000 to 213.5 million in 2025, affecting nearly equal numbers of men and women. India suffers the highest loss in potentially productive years of life due to deaths from cardiovascular disease in people aged 35\u201364 years (9.2 million years lost in 2000). By 2030, this figure is expected to rise to 17.9 million years. The burden of cardiovascular disease in India is rising. ",
        "REPORT OF THE THIRD MEETING OF THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION\u2019S INTERNATIONAL DIALOGUE ON BIOETHICS 112 India (Vijay Kumar) The aim of the Department of Health Research under the Ministry of Health and Family Wel- fare (MOH & FW) of the government of India is to bring modern health technology to people by encouraging innovations related to diagnostics, treatment methods and also prevention, translating the innovations into products/processes by facilitating evaluation/testing in syn- ergy with other departments of the MOH & FW, as well as other science departments, and introducing these innovations into health systems research in the public health service. Mandates allocated to this department include: (i) promotion and coordination of basic, applied and clinical research; (ii) promoting and providing guidance on research governance issues, including ethical issues in medical and health research; (iii) intersectoral coordination and promotion of public\u2013private partnerships in medical, biomedical and health research- related areas; (iv) advanced training in research areas concerning medicine and health, including granting of fellowships for such training in India and abroad; (v) international coop- eration in medical and health research, including work relating to international conferences in related areas in India and abroad; (vi) technical support for dealing with epidemics and natural calamities; (vii) investigation of outbreaks due to new and exotic agents and devel- opment of tools for prevention; (viii) matters relating to scientific societies and associations in the areas of medicine and health research; (ix) coordination between organisations and institutes under the central and state governments; (x) administering and monitoring the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR). The ICMR serves as a fulcrum for the Depart- ment of Health Research in the creation of new knowledge and its evaluation, whereas nine other tasks connect to people through medical colleges, state services, governance, a net- work for handling epidemics/pandemics and intersectoral coordination. The ICMR supports basic, epidemiological, applied and operational research in areas of national importance for public health, including the tools of modern biology. All these activi- ties are pursued and promoted under bioethics oversight. The ICMR\u2019s innovation initia- tives include strengthening bioethics in the country, setting up a tribal forum with a specific focus on tribal populations and other marginalised populations, strengthening translational research, promoting research into vector-borne diseases, infrastructure development, drug development initiatives including research into traditional medicine, setting up of biomedical informatics centres, creation of disease registries, preparing stem cell research and therapy guidelines as well as other guidelines, setting up of a clinical trial register and promoting innovations by creating a medical innovation fund. Another organisation in India \u2014 the National Innovation Foundation (NIF), Ahmedabad \u2014 empowers the knowledge-rich, but economically poor, grassroots innovators and traditional knowledge holders by helping the innovators in prior art searches, drafting and filing of pat- ent applications, coordinating with various intellectual property institutions and attorneys, providing legal assistance to the innovators in negotiating and drafting licensing arrange- ments, etc. Knowledge of the local communities and individuals is accessed and used only with the prior informed consent of the knowledge holders, indicating that ethics is embed- ded in these programmes as they respect the main principle thereof, namely the autonomy of the individual.

This cooperation will also serve to recognise, respect and reward the knowledge-rich, economically poor indigenous people who may have made innovations in traditional knowledge for inclusive development in the Decade of Innovation. Under this collaboration, any benefit generated will go mainly to the traditional knowledge holders and partly to other stakeholders in the value chain, according to the extent of their involvement. This bridge between people\u2019s knowledge and institutional science attests to the resolve of the country\u2019s scientific institutions to become more and more responsive to the needs of the common people. The President of India has declared 2010 the \u2018Decade of Innovation\u2019. To take this agenda forward, the Prime Minister has approved the setting up of a National Innovation Council (NIC), the aims of which are: (1) formulating a roadmap for innovation for 2010\u201320; (2) creat- ing a framework to evolve an Indian model of innovation, with a focus on inclusive growth, delineating policy initiatives within the government that are required to promote innovation, developing and championing innovation attitudes and approaches, creating appropriate ecosystems and an environment to foster inclusive innovation, exploring new strategies and alternatives for innovations and collaborations, identifying ways and means to scale and sustain innovations, encouraging central and state governments to innovate, encouraging universities and R & D institutions to innovate, facilitating innovations by SMEs, encouraging all important sectors of the economy to innovate, encouraging innovation in public service delivery and encouraging multidisciplinary and globally competitive approaches for innova- tions. The council will also promote the setting up of state and sector innovation councils to help implement strategies for innovation in states and for specific sectors. An international responsible research innovation policy should include international coop- eration and collaboration, addressing common goals effectively by pooling both material and intellectual resources, encouraging collaborative programmes between academic insti- tutions and national laboratories in the country and their counterparts throughout the world, participation in mega-science projects as equal partners, etc. Conclusion and recommendations India\u2019s science and technology policy encourages research and innovation in areas of rel- evance for the economy and society by promoting close and productive interaction between private and public institutions in science and technology and innovating systems to docu- ment, protect, evaluate and learn from India\u2019s rich heritage of traditional knowledge.

The Indonesian Institute of Sciences (LIPI or Lembaga Ilmu pengetahuan Indonesia), where the Secretariat of the Indonesian National Bioethics Commission (KBN) is hosted, has on many occasions collaborated on research with overseas scientific institutions. The LIPI is a government body, responsible for carrying out scientific research and develop- ment in many fields of science except medical sciences, and the structural organisation of the LIPI is similar to that of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS). The LIPI has research centres for physics, chemistry, geotechnology, oceanography, biology and biotechnology. Concerning international research collaboration, two examples are given here. 1. Indonesia\u2013Japan: collaborative research on conservation and sustainable use of micro- bial resources. This collaborative research was carried out in two phases. Phase I: taxonomical and ecological studies of fungi and actinomycetes in Indonesia and Japan, 2003\u201306. Phase II: characterisation of oil-degrading micro-organisms from the Indo- nesian environment, 2006\u201309. The research collaboration was carried out by the LIPI Research Centre for Biotechnology, representing Indonesian government research centres, and the Bioresources Research Centre of the National Institute for Technologi- cal Evaluation (NITE BRC), Japan. 2. Indonesia\u2013United States of America: collaborative research on exploration on micro and macroflora for health and energy solutions, started in 2010. The research collabo- ration was carried out by the LIPI Research Centre for Biotechnology (as leader of the Indonesian group), Ministry of Forestry R & D, the Bandung Institute of Technology (ITB) Department of Chemistry and three campuses of the University of California, namely Davis (leader), Berkeley and San Francisco.

        "REPORT OF THE THIRD MEETING OF THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION\u2019S INTERNATIONAL DIALOGUE ON BIOETHICS 126 Indonesia (Umar Angarra Jenie) International legal documents for the protection of ethical principles To ensure the protection of ethical principles in setting up an agreement on research col- laboration, some legal documents which are recognised by international bodies, such as the United Nations and UNESCO, were considered and used. The legal documents which are always considered and used for setting up international collaboration in the field of bio- sciences are as follows. 1. The Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD), adopted by the UN in 1992 in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. 2. The Cartagena Protocol (CP) on Biosafety to the CBD, adopted on 29 January 2000 in Cartagena, Spain, which entered into force 11 September 2003. 3. The Nagoya Protocol (NP) on Access to Genetic Resources and Fair and Equitable Sharing of Benefits Arising from their Utilisation to the CBD, adopted on 29 October 2010 in Nagoya, Japan. 4. The Universal Declaration on the Human Genome and Human Rights (UDHGHR), adopted by the 29th General Conference of UNESCO on 11 November 1997, Paris, France. 5. The International Declaration on Human Genetic Data (IDHGD), adopted by the 32nd General Conference of UNESCO on 16 October 2003 in Paris, France. 6. The Universal Declaration on Bioethics and Human Rights (UDBHR), adopted by the 33rd General Conference of UNESCO on 19 October 2005 in Paris, France. The CBD, CP and NP adopted by the United Nations and the Conference of the Parties (COP) to the CBD, are legally binding on Member States. The Indonesian government has ratified the CBD as Act No 4, 1994. The UDHGHR, IDHGD and UDBHR are not legally bind- ing, but can be used as guidance by Member States in preparing their own legal documents. Access to biodiversity It is very common that in setting up agreements on international research cooperation, especially in the field of biosciences, access to biodiversity is one of three crucial points to be agreed by the parties. The other two points are biosafety and benefit sharing. Concerning access to genetic resources, Article 15 of the CBD states that, \u2018(1) Recognising the sovereign rights of states over their natural resources, the authority to determine access to genetic resources rest with national governments and is subject to national legislation. (2) Each contracting party shall endeavour to create conditions to facilitate to genetic resources for environmentally sound uses by other contracting parties and not impose restrictions that run counter to the objective of this convention.\u2019 Article 15(4) states that, \u2018Access, where granted, shall be on mutually agreed terms and subject to the provision of this article.\u2019 The CBD gives clear statements and, ethically, it ensures that states have sovereign rights over their natural resources, and access to these resources rests with the national govern- ment. The CBD strongly endorses that each contracting party shall endeavour to create ",
        "THE PROTECTION OF FUNDAMENTAL ETHICAL PRINCIPLES IN INTERNATIONAL RESEARCH AND INNOVATION PROGRAMMES 127 Indonesia (Umar Angarra Jenie) conditions for the safety of genetic resources and their environment, and shall not impose restrictions on access. Moreover, access when granted shall be on mutually agreed terms. Biosafety and access to biodiversity and benefit sharing Biosafety and benefit sharing are also crucial points to be agreed by the parties. The Carta- gena and Nagoya Protocols could help in reaching agreement. The objective of the CP is to contribute to ensuring an adequate level of protection in the field of the safe transfer, han- dling and use of \u2018living modified organisms resulting from modern biotechnology\u2019 that may have adverse effects on the conservation and sustainable use of biological diversity, also taking into account risks to human health, specifically focusing on transboundary move- ments (CP, Article 1: Objective). Concerning the circulation of biological samples in inter- national cooperation, another international legal document, the IDHGD, states that \u2018States should regulate, in accordance with their domestic law and international agreements, the cross-border flow of human genetic data, human proteomic data and biological samples so as to foster international medical and scientific cooperation and ensure fair access to this data. Such a system should seek to ensure that the receiving party provides adequate protection in accordance with the principles set out in this declaration\u2019 (Article 18(a), IDHGD). Benefit sharing in international research collaboration has been regulated in the Nagoya Protocol (NP). The objective of the NP is \u2018the fair and equitable sharing of the benefits aris- ing from the utilisation of genetic resources, including by appropriate access to genetic resources and by appropriate transfer of relevant technologies, taking into account all rights over those resources and to technologies, and by appropriate funding, thereby contributing to the conservation of biological diversity and sustainable use of its components\u2019 (NP, Article 1: Objective). The IDHGD also has a statement on benefit sharing in its Article 19(a), that \u2018In accordance with domestic law or policy and international agreements, benefits resulting from the use of human genetic data, human proteomic data or biological samples collected for medical and scientific research should be shared with the society as a whole and the international community.\u2019 The Universal Declaration on Bioethics and Human Rights (UDBHR) has statements on the sharing of benefits (Article 15) and transnational practices (Article 21). According to Article 15(1), \u2018Benefits resulting from any scientific research and its applications should be shared with society as a whole and within the international community, in particular with developing countries.\u2019 Concerning transnational practices, Article 21 states that \u2018Transnational health research should be responsive to the needs of the host countries\u2019, and that \u2018terms for col- laboration and agreement on the benefits of research should be established with equal participation by those party to the negotiation.\u2019 Indonesian standpoints After ratifying the CBD, the Indonesian government is now setting up some technical rules to implement the CBD, including the CP and the NP. In the above two examples of inter- national research collaboration, between Indonesia and Japan and Indonesia and the US, ",
        "REPORT OF THE THIRD MEETING OF THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION\u2019S INTERNATIONAL DIALOGUE ON BIOETHICS 128 Indonesia (Umar Angarra Jenie) the agreements reached by the parties were based on international legal documents, such as the CBD including the CP and the NP, and the three UNESCO declarations were also considered, as well as their own national laws. In implementing the CBD, especially the CP, the Indonesian government endorses the use of material transfer agreements (MTA), set up and agreed by all parties in the collabora- tive research, especially for regulating the transboundary movement of biological samples, regardless of whether they are modified organisms. In research collaboration on the human genome, such as cloning and stem cell research, Indonesian standpoints follow the rules set out in the UDHGHR, which states that \u2018Practices which are contrary to human dignity, such as reproductive cloning of human beings, shall not be permitted\u2019 (Article 11, UDHGHR). Closing remarks Protection of ethical principles in international research collaboration means that the agree- ment for collaboration shall respect: \u2022 human rights and human dignity (especially for medical research); \u2022 sustainability of biodiversity, biosphere and environment (especially for biosciences research); \u2022 international research agreements already agreed by all parties, including on access to biodiversity, access to technology, biosafety and benefit sharing.

        "REPORT OF THE THIRD MEETING OF THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION\u2019S INTERNATIONAL DIALOGUE ON BIOETHICS 144 Mexico (Manuel Ruiz de Chavez) Mexico (Manuel Ruiz de Chavez) Embedding ethics in national research innovation programmes \u2014 a Mexican strategy Dr Manuel H Ruiz de Ch\u00e1vez Chairperson of the Council of Mexico\u2019s National Bioethics Commission Mexico\u2019s National Bioethics Commission (NBC) was established in 1992. However, it is now entering a new era as a result of the presidential decree issued in September 2005 which establishes it as a decentralised body of the Health Secretariat, with technical and opera- tive autonomy, and confers on it the task of contributing to the development of a bioethics culture in Mexico. The comprehensive mission of the NBC is to promote a bioethics culture in Mexico, by means of a lay, plural and inclusive analysis of bioethical dilemmas, based on the respect of human rights, protection of living beings and preservation of the environment. The NBC is intended to be a leading independent organisation, recognised by society as a national and international point of referral in the context of bioethical dilemmas and the development of a bioethics culture. In order to contribute to establishing a bioethics culture in Mexico, the NBC must foster an attitude of multidisciplinary and multisectoral reflection, deliberation and discussion of top- ics linked to human health, the development of ethical standards for healthcare, research and education and a relationship with other living beings and the environment. Its main objectives are to: \u2022 establish public health policies related to bioethics; \u2022 serve as a national advisory body on specific topics in bioethics; \u2022 facilitate discussions on bioethical issues with the participation of various sectors of society; \u2022 promote the teaching of bioethics, particularly in the healthcare field; \u2022 promote the establishment of local commissions on bioethics nationwide; \u2022 promote, in both public and private health institutions, the organisation and operation of hospital bioethics committees and research ethics committees. The key ethical issues identified for the attention of the NBC are: \u2022 bioethics and public policy in Mexico; \u2022 bioethics infrastructure; \u2022 research ethics; \u2022 bioethics, drugs and medication (prescription, access and advertising); \u2022 maternal mortality and other reproductive health issues; \u2022 ethics in the doctor\u2013patient relationship; \u2022 informed consent; ",
        "THE PROTECTION OF FUNDAMENTAL ETHICAL PRINCIPLES IN INTERNATIONAL RESEARCH AND INNOVATION PROGRAMMES 145 Mexico (Manuel Ruiz de Chavez) \u2022 ethical dilemmas at the end of life; \u2022 protection of personal data and biological samples. The Centre for Bioethical Knowledge (CECOBE) represents the core of the NBC in the accomplishment of its mission. It is characterised by: \u2022 a specialised library on bioethics; \u2022 the development of media strategies to promote bioethical knowledge; \u2022 the publication of material related to bioethics; \u2022 the holding of workshops. The national infrastructure that Mexico has to promote is related to a bioethical culture in research, as well as to making sure that the research carried out in the country corresponds to the interests and needs of the population, for whom the leading agency is the NBC. Furthermore, one of the major responsibilities of the NBC is to establish, strengthen and provide operative continuity to the local bioethics commissions in the 32 entities that shape the Mexican Republic. These local commissions must replicate at the entity level the actions that are needed in order to promote fundamental principles of ethical research. Finally, at the operational level, in all medical research institutions there are research ethics committees, which act in the interests of all research participants and communities involved, taking all international and national regulations into account. Some of the foremost Mexican ethics regulations for health research include the following. A. Research on health, included in the General Health Law: \u2022 establishment of ethics research committees; \u2022 duty to perform research in accordance with the Helsinki Declaration; \u2022 informed consent. B. Ethical aspects of research in humans, included in the General Health Law: \u2022 respect for human dignity and human rights; \u2022 privacy protection; \u2022 risk assessment; \u2022 informed consent. C. Statement of the Health National Council creating ethics research committees. National guidelines for ethics research committees laid down by the NBC. D. Presidential Decree of 2005 establishing the NBC as a body separate from the Health Secretariat. Mexico has established several programmes for ethics in national research innovations based on the particular circumstances of its cultural and social background. The relation- ship between bioethics, society and culture arises from the need for scientific and techno- logical knowledge to work towards improving the welfare of the Mexican population. ",
        "REPORT OF THE THIRD MEETING OF THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION\u2019S INTERNATIONAL DIALOGUE ON BIOETHICS 146 Mexico (Manuel Ruiz de Chavez) Furthermore, bioethics should generate strategies that will enhance a social awareness that will lead to the development of policies which will ensure that biotechnological innovations derived from science are used on behalf of society in a manner which reconciles cultural diversity and respects each individual. Programmes for ethics in national research innovations include: \u2022 respect for the autonomy and dignity when performing research on human subjects, and informed consent; \u2022 detection of the main health problems in a national context; \u2022 equitable and just distribution and application of research; \u2022 protection of animals used for experimentation and research; \u2022 preservation of the environment. Among the innovation programmes that have been integrated as initiatives of the National Bioethics Commission and the National Council for Science and Technology (CONACYT), we can acknowledge the following. Training opportunities and support for institutional ethics committees, through resources from the NBC Centre for Bioethical Knowledge. \u2022 The establishment of a model for the ethical analysis of scientific and technological devel- opments, by setting up a specific committee for such purposes. \u2022 Direct participation by the National Bioethics Commission in ethical analysis, and evalua- tion of research and innovation projects. \u2022 Taking into account ethical issues when setting national priorities for research and techno- logical developments, such as Health National Contact Point FP7-UE. These programmes have been developed to ensure that the benefits and burdens of research are distributed fairly among all groups and classes of society, without prejudice due to age, gender, economic status, culture or ethnic origins, among others, and focusing on the safeguarding of vulnerable groups, protection of living beings and preservation of the environment. As part of its international interactions, the NBC has been working with the World Health Organisation (WHO) and the Pan American Health Organisation (PAHO), and has links to the ethics programme of the University of Miami, specifically with the CITI (Collaborative Institu- tional Training Initiative) programme. In addition, since 2002, Mexico has been an observer in the Council of Europe\u2019s Steering Committee on Bioethics (CDBI), which is a forum for discussion on legal, ethical and human rights issues, with regard to developments in biosciences and biomedicine. It is important to realise that, throughout this year, the NBC has taken part, and will continue to take part, in several international events, such as the \u2018Nuffield Council on Bioethics.\u2019 Mexico\u2019s participation in these fora is important because it will help to unify and advance the ",
        "THE PROTECTION OF FUNDAMENTAL ETHICAL PRINCIPLES IN INTERNATIONAL RESEARCH AND INNOVATION PROGRAMMES 147 Mexico (Manuel Ruiz de Chavez) agendas around bioethical issues of research and technological development in a harmoni- ous way at international level. Furthermore, in October 2011, the NBC is keen to hold a regional meeting of bioethics advisory bodies of the Americas. The aims of this meeting include the promotion of interac- tion and the establishment of a regional network of national advisory bodies, discussion of topics of interest related to research on the region and carrying out the preliminary work in order for Mexico to host the Tenth Global Summit of National Bioethics Advisory Bodies and the 12th International Congress of Bioethics (IAB) in 2014. Other international activities which the NBC is keen to promote include the Manuel Velasco- Su\u00e1rez Award for Excellence in Bioethics, which was created in 2002 and is one of the five awards presented by the Pan American Health and Education Foundation (PAHEF) through its Awards for Excellence in the Inter-American Public Health Programme, which is a part- nership between PAHEF and PAHO. To encourage young scholars to develop their capaci- ties for bioethical analysis, Mexico\u2019s Health Secretariat, PAHEF, in cooperation with PAHO, has created this award to honour Dr Manuel Velasco-Su\u00e1rez. The NBC is committed to promoting the principles and values that underpin good research practices and we see this as a great opportunity for international collaborative interactions in areas such as: \u2022 relevance of research according to national, regional and global health priorities; \u2022 access and distribution of the benefits of health research among the whole population; \u2022 protection of vulnerable groups; \u2022 certification of ethics research committees; \u2022 development of an international cooperation structure for ethics in health research. Finally, we acknowledge that, in order to address the dilemmas arising from advances in sci- ence and modern technology, and to achieve the growth and strengthening of our country\u2019s needs, it is imperative to promote a bioethics culture in all strata of Mexican society.

Abraham Aseffa MD, PhD, Armauer Hansen Research Institute, Ethiopia, Chair of PABIN Introduction The role of independent research ethics review committees is to safeguard the protec- tion of study participants and to ensure fairness in the implementation of study protocols. This requires embedding ethics in the research and innovation programmes of institutions and nations, including in projects conducted through national or international funding. The increasing number and complexity of research proposals emerging in and flowing into Africa has necessitated capacity building in health research ethics across the continent. In addition to protection of the study participants, ethics committees are increasingly faced with prob- lems of partnership ethics. Health research in Africa is mostly carried out through interna- tional funding, often marginally involving national investigators in study design. Local health workers collaborate in conducting these investigations and facilitate access to community and volunteer participants. It is not uncommon for such projects to limit the role of the Afri- can partner to initial processing of specimens for shipment to laboratories in high-income countries, hampering the growth of local science and nurturing long-term dependence. Competent ethics committees are essential to ensure not only that study participants are protected from harm, but that institutions are protected from exploitation and that research contributes to further development of science and local capacity in Africa through mutually beneficial north\u2013south or south\u2013south partnerships. PABIN The Pan-African Bioethics Initiative (PABIN) was established in 2001 as part of the Strategic Initiative for Developing Capacity in Ethical Reviews (Sidcer) (http://www.sidcer.org), a global effort comprising five regional forums. Its membership is constituted of individuals com- mitted to contributing to the advancement of high ethical standards of research in Africa. PABIN\u2019s aims include developing competent in-country ethical review systems, contribut- ing to a concerted African voice in international discussions on health research ethics and assisting governments with the development of national guidelines for ethical review. PABIN has conducted a series of pan-African meetings on health research ethics under several themes. The Third PABIN Conference was held in Addis Ababa on 28 to 30 April 2003 under the theme of \u2018Good health research practices in Africa\u2019. The Fourth Conference held in Yaound\u00e9 on 5 to 7 June 2006 addressed the theme \u2018Millennium development goals and health research ethics in Africa\u2019. On 21 to 22 March 2011, PABIN held its revitalisation General Assembly in Addis Ababa, where it decided to prioritise embedding quality in health research ethics through the ",
        "THE PROTECTION OF FUNDAMENTAL ETHICAL PRINCIPLES IN INTERNATIONAL RESEARCH AND INNOVATION PROGRAMMES 155 PABIN (Abraham Aseffa) implementation of the Sidcer ethics review committee recognition programme in its capac- ity-building efforts. The programme has previously been successfully tested by the Sidcer sister forum in south-east Asia and the Pacific region (Forum for Ethical Review Committees in the Asian and Western Pacific Region \u2014 Fercap). The objective of the programme is to measure and provide accountability for the quality and effectiveness of ethical review in countries. A Sidcer recognition certificate provided to an institutional review board (IRB) or an independent ethics review committee (ERC) is a sign that the highest standards of ethical review in clinical research are being met. Sidcer recognition programme The Sidcer recognition programme provides training to ethics committees as units, meaning that all members of an ethics committee will participate in the training as a team. The course covers basic international principles of health research ethics through interactive facilitated discussions and reviews of relevant laws and national guidelines. This is followed by training on the development of standard operational procedures (SOP) for ethics review committees. Members then work together to draft their own SOPs covering all functions of the ethics committee. Standard templates are examined to facilitate the process. The SOPs are sub- sequently finalised and formally adopted at a committee session. In the following months, the IRB or ERC will ensure implementation of its SOPs and modify them as needed. Once the practice is standardised, IRB/ERCs are encouraged to monitor compliance with their own SOPs through self assessment tools. Independent surveys are organised by PABIN/ Sidcer to assess the performance of the ethics committees in due course. The Sidcer sur- vey is a systematic and independent examination of ethics committee activities and docu- ments to determine if the IRB/ERC meets requirements (SOPs, local and regional require- ments, human subject protection). It is designed to establish a standard for ethical review and provide public assurance that the standard is met. The surveyors provide feedback to the committees for corrective measures. Where additional training is required, PABIN/Sidcer might provide assistance. Recognition is granted when the IRB/ERCs have met five quality standards: appropriate structure and composition of ERC, adherence to specific policies, completeness of its review process, activities after review process and documentation and archiving. A cer- tificate is provided to the committee upon full recognition, valid for three years. Renewal is subject to continuous monitoring through annual reports. PABIN has so far recognised three institutional ethics review committees: the Addis Ababa University Medical Faculty ERC (2009); the Armauer Hansen Research Institute (AHRI/ALERT) ERC (2009); and the Uganda Virus Research Institute (UVRI) ERC (2010). The process is ongoing for ERCs in Zanzibar, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Liberia and 11 ERCs in Ethiopia. National chapters PABIN operates in countries through national chapters. The Ethiopian Bioethics Initiative (ETBIN) has organised several national discussion forums to address relevant ethical issues such as standards of care in HIV research. It is currently working with the government and ",

ETBIN has supported the establish- ment and strengthening of 15 institutional ethics committees, most of which are in newly established universities, through EDCTP support in 2009\u201311 under the Sidcer recognition programme. Similarly, the Cameroon Bioethics Initiative (Cambin) is actively supporting health research ethics capacity building in West Africa. Cambin organised PABIN/Sidcer recognition programme training in Madagascar in 2008 and in the Democratic Republic of the Congo in 2011. PABIN is actively seeking collaboration with partners to establish more national chapters in the near future. Conclusion The experience of PABIN to date is that there is a huge amount of unmet need in embedding quality in ethics review in existing ERCs. It is difficult to measure the impact of ethics training on the quality of health research ethics review unless a targeted programme is developed in which committees rather than single individuals are trained and monitored through self assessment and regular support. The Sidcer recognition programme provides such a tool that has proved itself in south-east Asia and to a small extent to date in Africa. While it is important to encourage the formation of new ethics committees to meet the expanding requirements for review, it is even more important to link this with a recognition programme that guarantees a quality outcome in a measurable and cost-effective manner. This will facilitate the strengthening of national regulatory systems and formal accreditation.

Arras Representing US Presidential Commission for the Study of Bioethical Issues (PCSBI, www.bioethics.gov) I. To what extent research and innovation play a role in your country\u2019s political strategy? Research and innovation obviously play a very important role in contemporary US society \u2013 see, e.g., the robust annual budget of the National Institutes of Health (NIH). The Commis- sion examined this relationship, in part, in its synthetic biology report when it commented on how constraints should, and should not, limit scientific research.( 1 ) The Commission embraced a notion of \u201cregulatory parsimony,\u201d recommending only as much regulation as is truly necessary to justice, fairness, security and safety while pursuing the public good. II. To what extent research innovation policies take into consideration societal and ethical aspects of science and technology? A. Business as usual: Science and technology usually spin off innovative products and processes, with which the rest of society eventually must come to terms after the fact. Eth- ics is thus usually a reactive afterthought in the story of technological development. (E.g., reproductive technologies) B. A notable exception: President Obama\u2019s recent charge to the PCSBI to provide a forward- looking assessment of the potential benefits and risks of synthetic biology . Our report stressed the following points (among many others): \u2022 Technologies posing serious biomedical and/or social risks should be regulated by a prin- ciple of \u201cprudent vigilance\u201d every step of the way. \u2022 The principle of \u201cdemocratic deliberation\u201d emphasizes collaborative decision making among all stakeholders, including ordinary citizens. Technologies like synbio should thus be developed and deployed within a context of ongoing ethical, legal, political oversight and debate. \u2022 Downside of ethical review ab initio : Technologies often need to develop further (ripen) before we get a secure handle on their ethical implications. Importance of iterative review as technologies develop.

        "THE PROTECTION OF FUNDAMENTAL ETHICAL PRINCIPLES IN INTERNATIONAL RESEARCH AND INNOVATION PROGRAMMES 181 USA (John Arras) C. What elements should be considered for an international responsible research innovation policy? Drawing both on our Synthetic Biology report and on our work-in-progress on the ethics of international biomedical research,2 we would offer the following principles: 1. International coordination will be essential for (1) safety and security of developments in \u201cdual use\u201d biotechnologies, such as synbio, and (2) the protection of research subjects in a globalized research environment characterized by widespread off shoring and out- sourcing. Harmonization of existing international guidelines is highly desirable. 2. Researchers must demonstrate respect for human subjects and their communities in all phases of clinical trial design and implementation. For individuals, this requires genuine informed consent; for communities, it means grass roots engagement, not top-down imposition of foreign research agendas. 3. Fair, equitable risk sharing: Risks in the context of research and in commercial produc- tion and distribution of biotechnologies should not be unfairly or unnecessarily borne by certain individuals, populations, or sub-populations. Advances should be shared by those who can most benefit from them (e.g., New malaria drugs). 4. I would personally add (i.e., not speaking for the Commission): In the area of biomedical research, this principle of equity should govern (a) the design and sitting of clinical trials according to host country public health priorities, (b) the provision of ancillary medical treatment during trials, (c) access to fair \u201cpost trial benefits,\u201d and (d) compensation for subjects injured during trials.

The latter would therefore be called upon to participate fully in the preparation and adoption of the declaration. The following bodies were set up in order to prepare the conference: \u2022 The Preparatory Committee for the Conference (Conf/Prepa). It was responsible for pre- paring the draft declaration to be submitted to the conference for adoption. This commit- tee was composed of all the governmental delegations of the CDBI member and observer states. Conf/Prepa and the CDBI worked in close association, given that the theme of the conference represented a further development of the principle contained in Article 29 of the Protocol on Biomedical Research. \u2022 The Consultation and Drafting Group (Conf/RED), responsible for submitting proposals to Conf/Prepa, including alternative proposals where appropriate. \u2022 Select groups of experts (Conf/Exp) appointed by Conf/RED to consider a specific field and submit proposals. The members of the Consultation and Drafting Group (Conf/RED) were elected by consen- sus as follows: Dr Ingrid Callies (France); Prof. Elmar Doppelfeld (Germany); Prof. Eugenius Gefenas (Lithuania); Prof. Knut Ruyters (Norway); Prof. Boris Yudin (Russian Federation); Prof. Joze Trontelj (Slovenia); Prof. Javier Arias (Spain): Chair; Dr Imogen Evans (United King- dom); Ms Dafna Feinholz (Mexico), Dr Jerry Menikoff (USA).

Three further meetings were subsequently held in Madrid during 2009 and 2010. The con- clusions of Conf/Prepa were presented in the Steering Committee on Bioethics (CDBI) meetings during this period. The preparatory meeting put forward the following suggestions as to the main issues that could be contemplated in the preparation of the declaration; \u2022 it would take as a basis the provisions of Article 29 of the Additional Protocol to the Con- vention on Human Rights and Biomedicine concerning Biomedical Research; \u2022 it would elaborate on this provision and be applicable to research projects within the scope of the additional protocol. However, the relevance of a number of principles contained in the protocol for other types of research involving humans should be acknowledged; \u2022 it would draw attention to the responsibility of states to take appropriate measures to ensure protection of the individual rights of persons participating in research; \u2022 the application of the ethical principles contained in universally adopted instruments, in particular the UNESCO Declaration on Bioethics and Human Rights and stated in the additional protocol, would need to be considered in the light of the local circumstances. The issues identified as being particularly relevant for the research concerned, and to be discussed at the preparatory meeting, were the following: \u2022 justification of the research, including the reasons for carrying out research in the country concerned; \u2022 cooperation/partnership with the country concerned for carrying out the research; \u2022 review of the research project in all countries concerned; \u2022 independence and multidisciplinary nature of research ethics committees (RECs); \u2022 safety of research participants; \u2022 standards of care, including provision of treatment; \u2022 control group and placebo issues; \u2022 appropriate prior information and free and informed consent; \u2022 potential benefits and foreseeable risks for research participants or the community or group; \u2022 compensation for damage; \u2022 monitoring of research projects; \u2022 public access to research results (e.g. publication); \u2022 measures to ensure that ethical standards are effectively/actually applied (e.g. criteria for authorisation for putting products, such as drugs, on the market); \u2022 access to treatment and other benefits after research.

Year of establishment of NEC 1983 Legal basis and mandate The National Consultative Ethics Committee for Health and Life Sciences (CCNE) was established by presidential decree on 23 February 1983. Set up under the Law of 29 July 1994, the CCNE now operates within the framework of the Law of 6 August 2004, which gives it the status of an independent authority linked to the Ministry of Research and the Ministry of Health. The bioethics law is presently being reviewed. Taking an ethical view on health and life sciences The CCNE\u2019s mission is to \u2018provide opinions on the ethical problems and societal ques- tions raised by progress in the fields of biology, medicine and health, and to publish recommendations on these issues.\u2019 ( 1 ) The CCNE at work The law of 6 August 2004 and Decree No 2005-390 of 28 April 2005 established the composition, organisation and modus operandi of the committee, and specified how it can be tasked. A purely consultative body, the CCNE receives requests submitted by presidents of parliamentary assemblies, government representatives, higher learning establishments, public institutions and officially recognised foundations working in research, technologi- cal development or the promotion and protection of health. The committee can also decide itself to take on various issues raised by entities other than those listed above. The CCNE\u2019s highest decision-making authority is the plenary committee, composed of all its members. Cases are investigated by the technical section, which has 12 members chosen by the committee on the basis of nominations by the CCNE president. Each issue is handled by a working group made up of committee members, who may request help from out- side experts in order to shed new light on a subject. The technical section then exam- ines the case and presents it to the plenary committee. Meetings of the plenary com- mittee and the technical session are closed to the public. After the case is examined, a final report is published, including recommendations or opinions. ( 1 ) Article 1412 of law No 2004-800 of 6 August 2004. ",

Year of establishment of NEC The council was founded in 1985 at the initiative of the Swedish parliament, and has been operational since 1986. 2. Remit of NEC The National Council on Medical Ethics is an advisory body to the Swedish govern- ment and parliament on ethical issues raised by scientific and technological advances in biomedicine. The council is a forum for the exchange of information and ideas promoting discussion on new medical research and applications. The council deals with issues that have been referred to it, but it can also pronounce on issues it identifies itself. Administratively, the council is a committee established by the government and affiliated to the government offices where its secretariat is located. The council has 20 members, each of whom serves in a personal capacity. The chair and eight political representatives have the right to vote. The other members represent agen- cies and organisations related to the field of healthcare or relevant academic disciplines. The members are appointed for a term of three years by the Minister for Health, based on nominations from political parties, agencies and interest groups. The academic members are selected by the ministry on the basis of their professional expertise and standing. The council meets on a monthly basis. Special experts are often invited to hearings and seminars with the council. The discussions may result in official opinions addressed to the Ministry of Health and Social Affairs and may also be made public. Each year the council organises a one-day conference which is open to health professionals and others with an interest in medical ethics. 3.

It was attended by some 150 profes- sionals from all relevant disciplines (e.g. medical doctors, nurses, carers, lawyers, philoso- phers), as well as representatives of patients. The objective was to clarify certain concepts and identify points of convergence and possible divergence on issues related to the decision-mak- ing process concerning medical treatment in an end-of-life situation. The conclusions of the symposium, by its general rapporteur Dr R\u00e9gis Aubry (France) and co-rapporteurs Dr Beatrice Ioan (Romania) and Dr Takis Vidalis (Greece), will be presented to the Steering Committee on Bioethics (CDBI) in June 2011 and might be used as a basis for guidelines on such end-of-life decision-making processes. Predictivity, genetic testing and insurance The Steering Committee on Bioethics is continuing its work on predictivity and genetic testing in the field of insurance, with a view to drawing up a legal instrument. A Green Paper on pre- dictivity, genetic testing and insurance is being finalised and should go public for consultation by the end of 2011. It will identify and examine the problems arising from collecting and processing health-related personal data for insurance purposes, in particular predictive information and social aspects, and will propose ways of addressing them. Comments from all stakeholders will be sought during the consultation process, the input being taken into account in drafting the future legal instrument. Biobanks \u2014 research on biological materials In 2006, the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe adopted its Recommendation Rec(2006)4 on research using biological materials of human origin. The recommendation applies to the full range of research activities in the health field involving: \u2014 the removal of materials of human origin to be stored for research purposes (research biobanking); \u2014 the use of biological materials of human origin either stored for research purposes or ini- tially removed for another purpose. Article 26 provides for the recommendation to be re-examined within five years of its adoption, notably in the light of experience and of scientific developments in the field. This process will start in 2011 in close cooperation with the European Commission. A symposium in spring 2012 will provide a basis for any revision of the recommendation. ",

Work of the International Bioethics Committee of UNESCO (IBC) and the Intergovern- mental Bioethics Committee (IGBC) Through its advisory bodies in the field of bioethics, UNESCO continues to offer a unique platform for reflection and debate based on its interdisciplinary, multicultural and plural- ist approach. The International Bioethics Committee (IBC) builds on the universal values enshrined in the Universal Declaration on Bioethics and Human Rights to ensure that progress in science and new technologies serves all human beings, in particular those who are the most vulnerable. The programmatic biennium 2010\u201311 has been marked by an extensive reflection on three major topics: the principle of respect for human vulnerability and personal integrity, as set forth in Article 8 of the UNESCO Universal Declaration on Bioethics and Human Rights (2005); the issue of human cloning and international governance; and the issue of the ethical impli- cations of traditional medicine. The 18th (ordinary) session of IBC, held in Baku from 31 May to 2 June 2011 at the invitation of the government of Azerbaijan, was an occasion to further advance the reflection on these issues, as well as to bring to the forefront the bioethical chal- lenges in Azerbaijan and the eastern European region. It was also an occasion to pave the way for considering possible new issues which would require the special attention of IBC within the framework of UNESCO\u2019s mandate, including new areas of scientific and technological devel- opments such as synthetic DNA and regenerative medicine, biobanks or neuroethics. The seventh session of the Intergovernmental Bioethics Committee (IGBC), which is com- prised of 36 Member States whose representatives meet at least once every two years to examine the advice and recommendations of the IBC, took place in Paris on 5 and 6 Septem- ber 2011. 2. Capacity-building activities: from principles to practices and policies Global Ethics Observatory (GEObs) Launched in December 2005, UNESCO\u2019s Global Ethics Observatory (GEObs) is a system of databases, available in UNESCO\u2019s six official languages and freely accessible online, with worldwide coverage in bioethics and other areas of applied ethics in science and technol- ogy such as environmental ethics and science ethics. GEObs serves as a platform for sup- porting and advancing ethics activities by assisting Member States and other interested parties to identify experts in ethics, ethics committees, ethics institutes and centres, ethics teaching programmes, legalisation in the area of bioethics, codes of conduct for scientists and resources in ethics. It is also designed to support and enrich all activities within the organisation. The observatory consists of the following databases: \u00b7 Database 1: Who\u2019s who in ethics . Detailed information regarding ethics experts around the world is included in this database. This database currently contains data for more than 1 500 ethics experts (36 % women, 64 % men). For the coming two years, the goal is to increase this number to 2 000 ethics experts. \u00b7 Database 2: ethics institutions . This database provides information on departments, insti- tutes, centres, commissions, councils, committees, review boards, societies, associations and other relevant entities. This database currently contains data for more than 500 ethics institutions. For the coming two years, the goal is to increase this number to 1 000 ethics institutions. \u00b7 Database 3: Ethics teaching programmes . This database contains extensive descriptions of teaching programmes in bioethics and other areas of applied ethics (collected through the ethics education programme). This database currently contains data for more than 230 eth- ics teaching programmes. For the coming two years, the goal is to increase this number to 330 ethics teaching programmes, with mapping activities planned for southern Africa, Latin America, the Caribbean, Asia and the Pacific. ",
        "THE PROTECTION OF FUNDAMENTAL ETHICAL PRINCIPLES IN INTERNATIONAL RESEARCH AND INNOVATION PROGRAMMES 251 UNESCO \u00b7 Database 4: Ethics-related legislation and guidelines . Descriptions of ethics-related legislation and guidelines, in connection to the principles in the Universal Declaration on Bioethics and Human Rights, as well as in connection to bioethical issues (such as medical research, cloning, genetic testing) are included in this database. The information is collected by legal experts from Member States, and subsequently reviewed and validated by a review committee consisting of legal experts from various regions and legal traditions. This data- base currently contains 643 instruments covering 29 countries. Data for Mauritius, Namibia, Swaziland, Turkey, Zambia and Zimbabwe has been collected and is in the process of being validated, and will be entered into the database in the coming months. Further data col- lection activities are planned for Africa. The goal for this year is to increase the number of countries covered to more than 30. \u00b7 Database 5: Codes of conduct . This database provides a selection of codes of conduct related to the ethics of science and technology issued by professional entities in the private and public sectors. Provisions within these codes are examined to identify common princi- ples, according to the criteria set out in an interim analysis of codes of conduct and codes of ethics. There are currently 150 codes in the database. \u00b7 Database 6: Resources in ethics . This database, launched in October 2008, makes resources in ethics available online (e.g. concerning relevant journals, websites, events, cases, videos). It is designed to reinforce ethics teaching, especially in regions where such activities are absent or minimal. There are currently 219 ethics resources in the database. For this year, the goal is to increase this number to 300. To date, GEObs has been accessed more than 61 000 times by more than 15 345 unique users, with more than 62 590 searches and more than 136 800 data views. Assisting bioethics committees (ABC) project Although the bioethics committees have assumed an indispensable role in addressing bioethi- cal challenges in various countries, they are mostly absent from the picture in developing countries, contributing to a serious handicap of these societies in confronting important ethi- cal questions that put at risk millions of vulnerable persons. Member States of UNESCO have recognised the significance of supporting such committees by dedicating a separate article to this issue in UNESCO\u2019s Universal Declaration on Bioethics and Human Rights (2005), which calls for the establishment and support of independent, multidisciplinary and pluralist ethics committees at the appropriate level. As a response, the bioethics programme designed the assisting bioethics committees (ABC) project to offer Member States comprehensive capacity-building assistance for a period of three years. After graduating from ABC, the newly established committees will have under- taken three separate training modules, established a working partnership with a long-stand- ing committee and developed the independent internal capacity to carry on its important mandate. The project is characterised by its depth of engagement with the participating Member States \u2014 it makes a concerted effort to holistically develop the capacities of the committees in order to make sure that they can stand on their feet independently and address the bioethical chal- lenges, both substantively and procedurally, after being weaned off the project. By the end of 2010, eight countries had established national bioethics committees within the framework of the ABC, and several more are expected to join the project in 2011. Ethics education programme (EEP) The ethics education programme (EEP) aims at initiating and reinforcing educational activities in Member States, through various phases. \u00b7 Assessment of the infrastructure for developing and implementing teaching pro- grammes. Mapping of experts in ethics teaching and sampling of teaching programmes have already been initiated through regional expert meetings (Hungary 2004; Russian Federation 2005; Croatia 2005; Iran 2006; Oman 2006; Turkey 2007; Morocco 2008; C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire 2008; Senegal 2009; Democratic Republic of the Congo 2009). Data have been made available online through the GEObs. ",
        "REPORT OF THE THIRD MEETING OF THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION\u2019S INTERNATIONAL DIALOGUE ON BIOETHICS 252 UNESCO \u00b7 Development and promotion of teaching programmes. The UNESCO bioethics core curriculum was launched in October 2008. The aim is to introduce the bioethical principles of the Universal Declaration on Bioethics and Human Rights to university students and facilitate the teaching of bioethics. The core curriculum has gained widespread recognition and acceptance in the field of bioethics and medical ethics education. A large portion of the core curriculum was adopted by the Standing Committee of European Doctors (CPME) in its medical ethics core curriculum on consent, confidentiality and human rights. The core curriculum also played a role in the revision of the core content of learning for medical eth- ics and law in the United Kingdom ( 1 ). This revised \u2018core content\u2019 now has the backing of the General Medical Council of the United Kingdom and the British Medical Association. The core curriculum is also an essential component of the Master Programme in Bioethics of the National Guard Health Affairs in Saudi Arabia. At this stage, the core curriculum is being tested at pilot universities around the world, and is anticipated to be ready for global deployment \u00b7 Ethics teacher training. Ethics teacher training courses have been organised in coop- eration with the UNESCO chairs in bioethics in Israel and Kenya. The aim of the courses is to train a new generation of scientists and professionals so that they are able to intro- duce ethics education in university curricula. Courses have been given in Romania (2006), Kenya (2007), Slovakia (2007), Saudi Arabia (2007), Belarus (2008) and Croatia (2010), while new ones are scheduled in the USA (2011), Serbia (2011), Croatia (2011), Kenya (2011) and Namibia (2011). UNESCO also initiated the establishment of an International Society for Education in Ethics in 2010. \u00b7 Development of educational resources. In order to support ethics teaching programmes, adequate resources need to be available for students as well as teachers. UNESCO, with its experience in education, is in a strategic position to address this need. The production of such educational resources is supported through a variety of publications, including those by the IBC and Comest, as well as in cooperation with UNESCO chairs. Books with case materials related to principles of the Universal Declaration on Bioethics and Human Rights are currently being developed. \u00b7 UNESCO chairs and regional documentation centres. They assist the organisation in the implementation of the EEP. UNESCO chairs in bioethics are currently located in Abid- jan (C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire), Barcelona (Spain), Brasilia (Brazil), Buenos Aires (Argentina), Egerton (Kenya), Haifa (Israel), Porto (Portugal), Presov (Slovakia), Mexico City (Mexico), Rome (Italy) and Washington D.C. (USA). New chairs are in the process of establishment in Oman and Sudan. Regional documentation centres are an important resource for future activities since they will make information and documentation from the region itself available and distribute information materials from other regions and UNESCO. Centres have been established in Vilnius (Lithuania) and Egerton (Kenya). A centre will also be established in Cairo (Egypt) this biennium.

In December 2010, the Ethics and Health Unit and the Stop TB department jointly published the guidance document \u2018Guidance on ethics of tuberculosis prevention, care and control\u2019. This document is the first of its kind and is available in English (http://whqlibdoc.who.int/publica- tions/2010/9789241500531_eng.pdf). It is currently being translated into the five other official UN languages. Since the publication of this guidance document, the Ethics and Health team has been work- ing on the implementation and dissemination of the guidelines in countries; an online training course is being developed with the support of the University of Miami ethics programmes, one of the WHO collaborating centres for bioethics. The intended targets of this course are health- care managers, policymakers and national TB programmes. The impact of this document will be evaluated considering the extent to which the ethics guidance has been incorporated into formal policies. Standards and operational guidance for ethics review of health-related research with human participants. A new edition of the WHO\u2019s guidelines for research ethics committees (RECs) will be avail- able in 2011. The standards put forward in this document do not represent new ideas for REC functioning; rather, they are based on requirements for RECs delineated in existing interna- tional guidance documents. Accompanying the standards is a series of \u2018operational guid- ance\u2019 points, which reflect commonly used strategies for implementing and fulfilling each of the standards. This document is the result of a wide consultation process in which RECs and international organisations actively contributed.

        "REPORT OF THE THIRD MEETING OF THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION\u2019S INTERNATIONAL DIALOGUE ON BIOETHICS 258 BRAZIL BRAZIL * Contribution from Ethically Speaking, issue No 15, July 2011 Name of NEC: National Committee on Research Ethics Pioneering system in Brazil \u2014 Resolution 196/96 \u2014 part 3 * Resolution 196/96 has a conceptual content and lays down bioethical guidelines based on the four principles of autonomy, beneficence, non-malfeasance and justice. It creates a mecha- nism for applying standards and establishes an operational system and a (support) system that ensures autonomous and independent social control. This control system is linked to the National Health Council, which is the social control body under Brazilian law. Resolution 196/96 introduced the system comprising the National Research Ethics Committee (CONEP) and the research ethics committees (comit\u00ea de \u00e9tica em pesquisa \u2014 CEP). The resolution was drawn up by a (multidisciplinary) bioethics committee and approved after a wide-ranging consultation of scientific societies, governmental bodies and various associations representing society. Research projects must be approved by the CEP of the institution in question. This committee must be accredited by the National Research Ethics Committee (Comiss\u00e3o Nacional de \u00c9tica em Pesquisa \u2014 CONEP). The committees are completely independent and do not take orders from anyone. The CEP and CONEP are essentially bioethical in nature (the number of members engaged in the same profes- sion must not be more than half the total number of members) and their members must include at least one representative of human research subjects. CONEP is responsible for standardising and coordinating all research involving human beings in any research area. It has 15 members (professionals in the areas of health, human sciences and natural sciences and theologians) and 15 alternate members. Of these, four represent people suf- fering from the pathologies that are being researched, four are advisers from the National Health Council and the others are nominated by the National Health Council based on names proposed by the research ethics committees at various institutions in Brazil. Members are elected for four years, renewable every two years. When a Committee approves a project it becomes jointly responsible for that project with the author. This responsibility cannot be delegated with regard to matters relating to ethics. Quarterly reports on all the projects are sent to the CONEP. In addition to a final annual report that must always be submitted by the researcher and the researcher\u2019s obligation to indicate any negative events that have taken place and make a precise assessment of them, the Committee may also request interim reports. The research institutes will not release funds until the research ethics committee has issued approval. Resolution 196/96 is not a law but it is legally binding. Failure to comply with it can lead to pros- ecution before the ordinary courts and the board of the professional body in question. One of the main documents concerns free and informed consent. This document is an instrument intended to protect the human being in question and not to obtain \u2018exoneration from responsibil- ity\u2019. It must be clearly drafted and contain all the important information. A signed copy is sent to the human research subject, who is also given the address and telephone number of the person to be contacted if a problem arises during the research. Before the results of the research can be published, journals require proof that these results have been approved. The researcher must keep records for at least five years and make them available at any time to the ethics committee. Results of research must be made public whether or not they are positive. ",
        "THE PROTECTION OF FUNDAMENTAL ETHICAL PRINCIPLES IN INTERNATIONAL RESEARCH AND INNOVATION PROGRAMMES 259 BRAZIL In cases of research into a new medicine, where applicable access should be provided to the medicine once the project is completed. In cases of foreign cooperation, supporting documents should be provided to prove that the project will also be carried out in the country of origin (or, if not, to explain why). In addition, proof should be provided of approval by the ethics committee in the country of origin. It is rec- ommended that the Brazilian researcher take part in drawing up the project. He must declare in writing that he agrees with the procedures to be followed. The foreign researcher who is to coordinate the project and the person responsible for the project in Brazil should be identified. The researcher is responsible for providing guidance to the human research subject (in the case of research into medicines) to ensure that he does not participate in another project. The person should not be involved in another project for at least a year after the completion of the project unless it is in his interest to do so. The researcher is responsible for assessing the advantages of the subject\u2019s involvement in another project. In cases of research into indigenous peoples, the researcher must consider not just the human subject but also his entire habitat. Any exploitation of the fauna, flora or subsoil, which must be regarded as an integral part of the heritage of indigenous peoples, is forbidden. In addition to Resolution 196/95, the ethics system has seven other specific resolutions on research involving new medicines, foreign cooperation, human reproduction, indigenous populations, human genetics and multicentric research and setting up databases. Today the system consists of 610 institutional ethics committees (over 10 000 persons). Almost 90 % of research projects are submitted for approval to the ethics committee of the institu- tion in question, while the remaining 10 % (specific projects) also require the approval of the National Research Ethics Committee. According to estimates, around 10 000 research projects involving human beings are carried out in Brazil each year. These projects cover all areas of research, not just biomedical projects, and involve half a million human subjects. This figure includes both retrospective research done on medical records and research on stem cells (of adults). Some additional information. \u2014 The members of the National Health Commission are proposed by the ethics commit- tees and appointed by the National Health Council. Multidisciplinarity is ensured and no one profession predominates. Each committee must always include at least one representative of the human research subjects. \u2014 Cases not dealt with are resolved by the CONEP, which is the body of final appeal. \u2014 The CONEP\u2013CEP system does not come under any corporate or executive body. It is fully autonomous and is directly associated with the National Health Council. \u2014 The ethics committees and the CONEP hold their discussions like collegiate bodies after analysing specific opinions on each project. In addition to members\u2019 opinions, the CEP and CONEP may conduct ad hoc expert consultations. \u2014 The committees must issue their final opinion within 30 days and CONEP within 60 days. * By Christian de Paul Barchifontaine and William Saad Hossne.

On stem cell experiments \u00b7 Life must be respected right from the beginning of conception, i.e. from the fertilisation of the egg by the sperm. \u00b7 The research, development and application of stem cells is very important in Indone- sia, including the introduction policies and regulations which are derived from universal bioethics principles, or at least from internationally accepted rules. \u00b7 Therapeutic cloning using non-embryonic stem cells is allowed and can be practised in Indonesia, whether by domestic or overseas researchers, as long as the requirements of informed consent and best clinical practices are fulfilled in accordance with Indone- sian regulations or laws. On genetic resources \u00b7 Genetic resources are substances found in all living organisms (animals, plants, microbes, whether they be terrestrial or marine based). They regulate the specific nature and mortality of these organisms, and can be transmitted to their descendants; they also form part of biodiversity, known as germplasms. \u00b7 Bioethical issues concerning genetic resources include accessibility and utility of the resources, traditional knowledge, biodiversity, biosphere and environments. Therefore, the management of Indonesia\u2019s genetic resources has to be based on the national interest and be regulated in accordance with national regulations and internation- ally ratified conventions or declarations, such as the CBD (Convention on Biological Diversity), the Manila Declaration Concerning Utilisation of Biological Resources and UNESCO declarations, such as UDHGHR, IDHGD and UDBHR. \u00b7 Advancing and encouraging policymakers, researchers, teachers and field workers to acquire a comprehensive understanding of the principles of bioethics and genetic resources issues.
