        "INTRODUCTION What is the European Community? It is\u2014and this is perhaps something we do not always realize in our everyday life \u2014 the greatest venture of the twentieth century, one which aims to give the old continent of Europe a new dimension, a new order. It is this Community of the Twelve (Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Portugal, Spain and the United Kingdom), this Community of 324 million inhabitants, that we would like to introduce you to briefly here. This booklet is intended to help you find your way around the Community and its institutions and understand its historical roots, the variety of its scenery, the unity of its different cultures, the strength of its economy\u2014in a word, to become aware of our European identity. At a time when the Community has decided to take up the challenge of the remainder of this century by giving itself until the end of 1992 in which to remove the obstacles that still impede the free movement of people and goods within its frontiers and to proceed resolutely towards true European union, we hope to help Europe's inhabitants to gauge the importance of what is at stake and to take charge of their future in full awareness of the issues involved.

        "HISTORICAL BACKGROUND: THE WAR PUTS AN END TO THE OLD EUROPE European supremacy For many centuries, the world seemed to revolve around Europe. Europe was at the centre of everything. It was in Europe that the great scientific and technological revolutions occurred and in Europe that the modern State took shape. This outburst of inventiveness was accompanied by far-reaching European imperial expansion. In 1939, on the eve of the Second World War, Europe's political, economic, cultural and military power dominated the whole world. Over a third of the earth's surface was colonized by the European powers\u2014an area more than 30 times the size of Europe itself. The Second World War The Second World War, however, changed all that. It was a war which broke out in Europe and, to a very large extent, it was fought there. It was totally disruptive. Millions of Europeans were killed. Much of the European economy was destroyed. So, too, was European power and influence. The colonial empires were destined soon to crumble, leaving the United States and the Soviet Union facing each other as the new super-powers. The European Community The establishment of the European Community was an attempt to come to terms with many of these issues. The European Community was first set up in order to prevent future conflicts and to render war between member countries materially impossible. These countries were fairly modest in size compared with the super-powers and Japan, so that the human, scientific and economic resources of Western Europe needed to be mobilized if it was to make its voice heard once again in the world and to meet the challenge from its larger competitors, thanks to the 1992 single market and a concerted effort at technological development. Two scenes from the ages of European industrialization and expansion. By the mid-twentieth century, however, Europe's predominant work position had ended. ",
        "HISTORICAL BACKGROUND: Former French Foreign Minister Robert Schuman. In 1950, with his solemn declaration of 9 May, he signed the birth certificate of the European Community. The Schuman plan and the ECSC The European Community came into being at 6 pm on 9 May 1950 when the French Foreign Minister, Robert Schuman, outlined the aims and methods of the so-called Schuman plan. The aim of the plan was to integrate the coal and steel industries of those Western European countries who wished to participate in the scheme, thus creating a European Coal and Steel Community (ECSC). It was formally established in 1951 when six countries\u2014Belgium, France, the Federal Republic of Germany, Italy, Luxembourg and the Netherlands\u2014signed the Treaty of Paris. Common institutions were established to govern the operation and development of the coal and steel industries in the Member States. First steps to unity The ECSC was the first step towards European unity. It enabled the integration of the coal and steel industries, thus paving the way for the integration of other sectors, and then of European economies as a whole. This could result eventually in the formation of a United States of Europe. The EEC and Euratom In 1957, a few years after the establishment of the ECSC, the process of integration was taken a step further with the signing of the Treaties of Rome establishing the European Economic Community (EEC), to integrate the member countries' economies as a whole, and the European Atomic Energy Community (Euratom), to encourage cooperation in the peaceful use and development of nuclear energy. The three Communities are run by joint institutions, so that there may be said to be one single European Community. From Six to Twelve: The three enlargements In 1973 the original six member countries were joined by Denmark, Ireland and the United Kingdom, making a total of nine. In January 1981, the Community was further enlarged by the accession of Greece. View of a coal mine. The ECSC was established in 1951 to encourage the rational management of the Member State's coal and steel industries. ",
        "THE FOUNDATION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITY Finally in January 1986, the accession of Portugal and Spain raised the number of member countries to Twelve. The Single Act The Community's objectives and means of action were recently spelt out in the 'Single Act', a new treaty that came into force in 1987 and aims at the creation, by 1992, of a Europe without frontiers, a Europe in which the movement of people, goods and services will be completely free. At the same time, joint European action must be stepped up in fields such as social and regional policy, protection of the environment, scientific research, monetary affairs and foreign policy. \u00a9 The six original members of the European Community \u2014 Belgium, France, the Federal Republic of Germany, Italy, Luxembourg and the Netherlands sign the Treaty of Rome on 25 March 1957. \u00ae - \u00a9 - \u00a9 Denmark, Ireland and the United Kingdom sign the Treaty of Accession in Brussels in January 1972. \u00a9 The tenth member of the Community, Greece, signs its Accession Treaty at a ceremony in Athens in May 1979. \u00a9 - \u00a9 Portugal and Spain sign the Treaties of Accession in Lisbon and Madrid in June 1985. ",
        "WHAT IS THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITY? The creation of a common market As we have seen, the essential aim of the founders of the European Community was to bring member countries closer together, first by economic cooperation and integration, leading gradually to greater political cooperation on a whole variety of issues. The people of the European Community decided to begin this process by the creation of a large, single, common market to enlarge the existing individual markets of the Member States. In this large market all manufactured goods would circulate without payment of customs duties as they crossed frontiers between Member States. Imports from outside the Community would be subject to a common tariff wherever they entered the Community. The main idea behind this provision was the desire to create a larger and more secure home market in which the Community's industries could sell their goods. This in turn would lead to more efficient, cheaper production methods which would benefit people by creating more jobs, higher wages and lower prices. In addition, it was decided that all citizens would have the right to work anywhere in the Community. The common policies For more than a quarter of a century the Community has tried to make the common market a reality through the adoption of common policies. These include: \u2014 the common agricultural policy (CAP), which has stabilized agricultural earnings and brought about a modernization of European agriculture. Today the CAP has to adapt to new conditions and is currently undergoing extensive reform; \u2014 social policy, which aims at improving working conditions and social benefits and to combat rising unemployment; \u2014 regional policy, which promotes regional development and offers support to Europe's poorest areas; \u2014 transport policy, which aims to facilitate the free movement of people and goods in Europe; \u2014 competition policy, which seeks to ensure equal treatment for Community firms and bans State aids that distort free trade; \u2014 the common fisheries policy, which was adopted in January 1983 to improve the management of the Community's fishery resources; trade policy, which reflects the Community's belief in free trade and includes numerous agreements with both the industrialized countries and the developing world. One of lhe original aims of the Community was to enable workers to move freely between Member States. Growing areas of intervention Community activities have grown in recent years. The Twelve now face a variety of problems together such as those of environmental protection, the restructuring of industrial sectors in difficulties, and the fight against unemployment. They try to present a united front in terms of shared research into the development of new technologies. Other achievements include the establishment of the European Monetary System (EMS), the adoption of a common energy policy and the adoption of a common development policy to help the Third World. ",
        "Thus, more and more issues are being dealt with at Community level as the Member States recognize the value of solidarity. This degree of cooperation represents a very considerable move away from the rather chauvinistic attitudes prevailing between the nations of Europe up until 1945. There has, therefore, been a very considerable step forward. It is preparing to take another step by abolishing, between now and 1992, the last\u2014but numerous\u2014 obstacles to the creation of a vast internal market. At the same time, the Community will reinforce its economic and social cohesion through increased coordination of the economic policies of its Member States, especially as regards growth and employment. It will be contributing more to the development of the Community's disadvantaged regions and the fight against unemployment, and finally developing the social dimensions of the single market. The Community is gradually developing policies in economic, social and other areas. For instance, the European Monetary System was set up in 1979 to limit exchange-rate fluctuations. u i <^ An important original aim was the establishment of a common market. All tariff barriers between Member States have been abolished in fact. Before customs checks at frontiers can be abolished, however, VAT rates have to be aligned and common rules drawn up governing the safety of goods and the combating of terrorism. All this should be done between now and 1992. \u00a1\u00e7\u2014L-.-.g J\u00abss jp\" f/w\u00e0 LS '-\"\"\u00cf\"\" HB mi \u25a0k ite JjL\u00b7 i ll I 1 \u25a0 u - \u0397 \u0399, B9MJ\u00e4| ",
        "HOW THE COMMUNITY IS GOVERNED The President of the Commission, Jacques Delors The Community is composed of twelve member countries. In most matters these countries still govern themselves quite independently of each other. However, certain matters are decided at Community level and the Community makes policies and laws which apply in all its member countries. Below we describe how these policies and laws are made. Proposal The headquarters of the Commission is in Brussels, the capital of Belgium. The Commission is a body of seventeen people, two each from the Federal Republic of Germany, France, Italy, Spain and the United Kingdom and one each from Belgium, Denmark, Greece, Ireland, Luxembourg, the Netherlands and Portugal. Each commissioner, as he or she is known, serves for four-year renewable periods. On appointment, they cease to act as Germans or Frenchmen or Britons and try to act only in the common Community interest. The Commission proposes new policies and laws based on the Treaties and other objectives agreed by Member States. It also has the job of ensuring that these laws, when passed, are properly enforced in the Member States. However, the laws themselves are made by the Council of Ministers, but only after two other bodies have been consulted. Consultation First, the opinion on a proposed law has to be sought from the European Parliament, the 518-member parliament of the Community elected every five years, and thus in 1989, by the people of the Community. It represents the views of the people and contains politicians of the many different European political parties. Besides its right to be consulted on all Commission proposals, the European Parliament has the final say on the Community's budget and has the power to censure the Commission. Second, the opinion of the Economic and Social Committee has to be sought. This is a 189-member committee of representatives from such bodies as trade unions, employers' associations and consumer groups throughout the Community. Law making Once their opinions have been obtained, the proposal then passes to the Council of Ministers, who decides whether it should become Community policy or law. The Council is composed of twelve ministers, one from each Member State, and, unlike the commissioners, these ministers act very much as representatives of their own country. Each one weighs up the proposal and, in the case of the more important matters, they all have to agree before it can become law. In order to strengthen the Community's effectiveness, the number of cases where decisions can be taken on a majority vote has just been increased. In such cases the European Parliament is more closely associated in general with the decisions. The Commission takes part in Council debates, which are often animated, with ministers defending national viewpoints, so that the Commission is asked to mediate. Once a proposal becomes law, it must be observed in all the Member States. Anyone breaking it may be taken either before their own national courts or before the Community's Court of Justice in Luxembourg. A European Council, which is made up of the Heads of State or Government of the Twelve and the Commission President, meets at least twice a year in order to set i broad guidelines for the Community.

        "COMMUNITY EUROPE: The piace Community Europe has a certain homogeneity as a geographical area. Its climate, even in the northernmost regions, is temperate thanks to the influence of sea currents, while the physical movement of people and goods across the continent is easy thanks to the absence of difficult natural features such as impassable rivers and mountains. Community Europe's longest river, the Rhine, is a mere stream compared to the rivers of other continents and the Alps, cut by glacial valleys, are more open to human exploration than the Andes or the Himalayas. There are no deserts or jungles and few insects or animals hostile to man. Community Europe has a surface area of about 2.26 million square kilometres which is about one-fourth the size of the USA and one-tenth the size of the USSR. It is, thus, a small and compact area offering easy communication and favouring economic activity. The people Community Europe numbers some 324 million inhabitants out of a world population of more than 5 000 million. This means therefore that the Community's population accounts for just over 6.5% of the world's population. Other areas of the globe account for far more\u2014a fact which will become even more apparent in the future as the populations of Latin America, South-East Asia and the Arab World continue to grow at a faster rate than Europe's. An ageing population As a result of advances in medicine as well as other improvements in our standard of living, life expectancy has now greatly increased. On average, a woman can now expect to live to the age of 78.2 and a man to 71.6 despite the fact that certain diseases such as heart disease and cancer have still to be conquered. On the other hand, the birth rate has dropped everywhere. The consequence of this is that the percentage of old people in the Community's population is rising while the percentage of young people is falling. The result is an ageing population. ",
        "THE PLACE AND THE PEOPLE A dense population Another feature of the Community is that it has a dense, largely urban population. As the figures show, with the exception of Japan, Europe is one of the most densely populated areas in the world\u2014a fact which has been accentuated by the continued movement of people away from country areas to live in towns and cities and their surrounding suburban areas. This concentration has enormous implications for the quality of life of the people of the Community. For instance, it matters a good deal where we locate nuclear power stations and industrial plants and it has important implications, too, for dealing with such issues as waste disposal and traffic congestion. It also means that land is in short supply and has a high price. This affects all of us who want a decent home in which to live. THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITY ",
        "THE CIVILIZATION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITY: With its nine official\u2014and numerous unofficial\u2014 languages, and its hundreds of dialects, the Community often appears to be a Tower of Babel. What is frequently forgotten, however, is that this very diversity is an enriching factor and one that reflects the fundamental unity of the European culture that has grown up over the last three thousand years on the soil of Europe's ancient civilizations. The various migrations, invasions and wars have made havoc of frontiers, influenced the development of languages, changed customs and ways of life and have altered the face of the old continent, but for all this Europe has not lost its identity. All the new arrivals have fitted into the European mould and have rapidly become some of the staunchest supporters of their new culture. Greece: The Acropolis, Athens. \u25a0 : :'\u00ed\u00e2^a*u\u00eakz,.... A common history For a long time this unity was symbolized by Latin, the common language of a common religion and culture. For a long time philosophy, poetry, science and art had no nationality, and Erasmus of Rotterdam, Bacon and Dante could have been equally at home in London or Paris, Florence or Toledo. The repositories of their common heritage were the great universities of Heidelberg, Prague, Paris, Padua, Salamanca, Oxford and Uppsala, a compact universe within which the same men of learning travelled around, imparting to other students the same knowledge and the same awareness of belonging to the same world. Everything helped to unify this Europe\u2014the merchants' caravans between Venice, Bruges, Barcelona, Genoa and L\u00fcbeck, and the holy pilgrimages to Santiago de Compostela and Rome. Today the Community encourages contacts between its citizens. Freedom of movement for workers and the right of establishment for professional people is very largely a reality now. The Community has launched programmes aimed at stimulating exchanges between young people, students and scientists (Comett, Erasmus, Science, etc.). At the end of 1992 the Community's citizens will be able to work, study and reside where they like. Belgium : The Orval Abbey. \u25ba\u00b7 The diversity of the European cultural heritage... ",
        "UNITY IN DIVERSITY Languages: different facets of a common heritage The history of Europe is common to all of its peoples, and this is not altered by the fact that they speak many different languages. On the contrary, the new civilizations that have emerged from ours, such as those of North America and Latin America, regard the old continent as one single cultural entity. When people in New York or Rio de Janeiro talk of us, they talk of Europe and forget our regional boundaries. The linguistic diversity of the 12-nation Community should be safeguarded. At the same time the people who make up the Community should be helped to communicate with each other. The teaching of a second European language right from the first years of school would make a major contribution here, and the Community has already taken a step in this direction by asking all the Member States to make the teaching of at least one European foreign language compulsory. A standard school textbook on European history is also being prepared for all teachers who wish to use it. Italy: The Medici Chapel, Florence. .. is the wealth of our common civilization. O ",
        "THE COMMUNITY ECONOMY: The European Community has chosen economic integration as a means of achieving unity. We should, therefore, pay particular attention to its economy. The wealth of the Community The Community is a heavily industrialized area and in consequence it is much richer than many other parts of the world. First of all, let us consider how people are employed, bearing in mind that if many people in a country work in agriculture, it usually indicates a backward economy. In the Community as a whole, eight workers out of every 100 work in farming. Of the remaining 92, 33 work in manufacturing industries and 59 in service industries. These figures confirm that the Community is, by and large, a highly developed area. Another gauge of wealth is the income produced per inhabitant in terms of purchasing power. The income per capita for the Community in 1987 was about \u00a36 864 (IR \u00a38 763). This was, however, less than that of the USA, \u00a3 10 718 (IR \u00a313 683), but much higher than that of Latin America or Africa. In other words the Community is rich in a world of comparative poverty. Rich region, poor region These comments, however, are based on average figures for the whole Community and they tell us very little about the differences in wealth between the various countries and regions of the Community. If we analyse the wealth produced by each member country, it will be seen that countries can roughly be divided into two categories. The first category consists of eight countries with a per capita income of between \u00a38 607 (IR \u00a310 987) and \u00a36914 (IR \u00a38 827) with Luxembourg heading the list followed by Denmark, the Federal Republic of Germany, France, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Italy and Belgium in descending order. Spain, Ireland, Greece and Portugal constitute the second category with a per capita income of between \u00a3 5 079 - \u00a3 3 683 (IR \u00a36 484-\u00a34 702). These differences in wealth are even more marked if we compare regions instead of countries. If, for example, the ten wealthiest regions of the Community are compared with the ten poorest, it will be The Community is a highly industrialized region of the world. seen that the per capita income of the former is about three or four times that of the latter. The Community is trying to reduce these differences by making numerous investments in the poorest regions. In particular, it has set up a European Regional Development Fund. Unemployment Apart from the question of differences in wealth between regions and countries, there is another dramatic and far-reaching issue which involves all Community countries, namely unemployment. ",
        "WEALTH AND POVERTY AID GRANTED BY THE EUROPEAN REGIONAL DEVELOPMENT FUND BETWEEN 1981 and 1986 In November 1988, there were 15.4 million registered unemployed in the Community, of whom 33.5% were under 25 years of age. This is not simply an economic problem but one which also raises important political, social and moral issues and can only be solved by combined national and Community efforts. A view of Paris. The Paris Basin is one of the Community's richer regions. The Commission of the European Community has put forward several proposals with this in mind. The Community is already playing an important part in the attempt to improve employment prospects for young people. The reform of the Community's structural Funds, and the doubling of their budgets between now and 1993, should enable the Community to do much more to help regions which are either disadvantaged or in difficulties, to help young people find jobs and to fight long-term unemployment. In many of the poor regions of the Community, there is little industry and agriculture is not very prosperous. ",
        "THE COMMUNITY ECONOMY: Agriculture is vital to the Community. The common agricultural policy aims to give farmers a decent income and to guarantee consumers a steady supply of produce at reasonable prices. We have seen in the previous section that Community Europe is comparatively rich despite the fact that there are marked differences in wealth between Member States and between the different regions of the Community. How is this wealth produced? A varied economy The Community's economy is very varied and people earn their living in many ways. Some people work in manufacturing industry, producing everything from iron and steel to watches and computer games; others work in professional and service jobs such as doctors, teachers and train drivers; while others work in agriculture. Agriculture Agriculture is an important part of Europe's economy. All told, some 9.9 million people work in agriculture either as farmers or farm workers or as processors of agricultural produce and together they produce some 3.4% of the wealth of the Community. And this figure, being an average, hides some marked differences between Member States. For instance, 16.9% of the Greek national income is produced by agriculture compared with only 1.4% in the case of the United Kingdom. A prosperous Community agriculture is vital to the Community not only because of the large numbers of people employed but also because the Community needs its food production to eat and its industrial raw materials production for industry. Reform of the Community's agricultural policy is under way. The main objectives are to bring production under control and stabilize markets; facilitate structural adjustments; promote rural development and contain public spending. Industry and services But as important as agriculture is to the Community, its contribution to Community wealth is nevertheless small compared with that of industry. Compared with agriculture's 3.4% in 1986, manufacturing industry contributed 36.5% and service industry 60.1 %. Looked at another way in terms of people employed, this picture of the relative importance of industry is again confirmed. Compared with agriculture's 9.9 million workers, manufacturing ",
        "AGRICULTURE, INDUSTRY AND SERVICES industry employed 40 million and service industry 75.9 million. Even in countries like Greece and Ireland, where agriculture is of considerable importance to the economy, the numbers employed in industry far exceed those employed in agriculture. While possessing a large agricultural sector, the Community is thus heavily industrialized also. It is crucial that its industry continues to be able to compete with American or Japanese firms on equal terms. The Community has already taken numerous measures with this in mind, but fresh efforts are needed if European industry is to take full advantage of modern technology and an internal market of continental dimensions. This is why the Community has adopted a wide-ranging, framework programme of technological research and development, which enables it to support and coordinate the work of numerous national laboratories, both public and private. The Community plans to abolish by the end of 1992 the remaining physical, technical and fiscal obstacles to the free movement within its frontiers of persons, goods, services and capital. CONTRIBUTION OF EACH SECTOR TO THE GROSS DOMESTIC PRODUCT (%) 1986 &\\'6)'f&\\ EMPLOYMENT BY SECTOR (%) 1986 ",
        "THE COMMUNITY ECONOMY: Industry is thus of vital importance to the economy of the Community. Likewise, of considerable importance to the Community is international trade. Raw materials and markets International trade is important for two main reasons. First, trade brings many of the raw materials on which industry depends. The Community is far from being self-sufficient in a whole range of commodities vital to industry. To name but a few, it is heavily reliant on outside sources for petroleum products, gold, diamonds, tin, lead, mercury and bauxite while there are, of course, a whole range of agricultural commodities for industrial use which for a variety of reasons are not produced commercially in the Community\u2014cotton, cocoa, vegetable oils and rubber, to name but a few. Second, trade is important because a large percentage of the output of Community industry is sold overseas. The European home market is too small to absorb all industrial output. Despite North Sea production, the Community still has to import large amounts of crude oil. This importance of trade can quickly be seen if reference is made to statistics. In 1987 Community exports represented 20.4% of world exports compared with the United States' 13.2% and Japan's 12.1 %. The figures speak for themselves. The Community is thus the world's leading trader. Important implications Certain implications arise from the importance of trade. ",
        "THE IMPORTANCE OF TRADE * Excludes mira Community trade First, it will be noted that the Community's economy is basically very vulnerable. Any trend towards protectionism or economic self-sufficiency in the world would have serious consequences for Community industry and levels of income and employment. Moreover, the Community must be In a position to adapt constantly to any changes which occur in other parts of the globe. In order to sell abroad, it must be able to offer products at a price and of a quality which compare favourably with those of its competitors, such as the United States, Japan, the newly industrialized countries, etc. Second, the regulation of trading relations between the Community and other countries is very important, especially for the developing nations, which are heavily reliant on sales to the Community. That is why the Community has cooperation agreements with many nations\u2014the most important being the Lom\u00e9 Convention with developing countries, allowing them, amongst other things, important trading privileges and technical and financial aid to promote their economic development. \u00a9 The Community is the world's leading trader. Commercial relations wfth other countries are therefore very important. \u00ae Trade relations with developing countries are especially important. An agreement signed in Lom\u00e9, Togo in 1984, regulates commercial relations between more than 60 developing nations and the Community. ",
        "CONCLUSIONS: FROM THE FIFTIES TO THE NINETIES In the past twenty or so pages we have looked briefly at the Community\u2014what it is, how it works, its historical background, its geography and its economy. We finish now with a few concluding points which it is important to emphasize. A novel institution The first point to emphasize is that the Community is in many ways a novel sort of organization quite unlike anything that has gone before. It is made up of twelve independent member countries which retain most of their independence but which, on certain matters, have yielded up their independence or sovereignty to the Community so that decisions on these matters can be taken jointly. That is quite a dramatic step for proud nation States to take. The Community, therefore, is more than just a forum for nations to come together merely to discuss and exchange ideas, which are in no way binding on members. It is not just 'a talking shop'. It does make policies and laws which are binding on Member States. Some may see this as a step towards the building of a United States of Europe; others would be worried at the prospect. Whatever the point of view, however, it nevertheless remains true that the Community experiment is breaking entirely new ground in terms of international relationships. A considerable achievement The second point is that, since its foundation, it has already achieved a considerable amount. In the face of many shortcomings and fair criticisms of the Community, it is often forgotten just how much has been achieved. There are important common policies in agriculture, trade and competition, in economic and industrial matters and in foreign relations, especially with the developing countries. Moreover, a common market has been created in which goods and people can move about with significantly greater ease than before. Most important of all, however, is the fact that twelve countries of Europe, many of which not so long ago were fighting one another with massive loss of life and physical devastation, are now cooperating very intimately with one another. There are still disagreements but they are now resolved in a spirit of cooperation rather than aggression. The future of the Community The final point to emphasize is that the future development of the Community is largely a question for its people. It is up to us to decide whether we destroy it, whether it should remain as it is today, playing an important yet limited role, or whether it should become something more by evolving towards a Europe without frontiers in the nineties. If we choose the latter, there will have to be new policies, which, amongst other things, must help to overcome the present problems of high unemployment and to meet the challenges of the modern world. At the same time, there will have to be improvements in existing policies, such as the CAP, which nevertheless preserve the basic principles of these policies. In order to take an informed decision, it is essential for each of us to know about the Community. There is no shortage of ways of making our opinions known, either. First, Europeans can influence the future of the Community by voting in the direct elections to the European Parliament. Within their political parties, trade unions, etc., Europeans can also exert day-by-day pressure on their governments, who have publicly and solemnly undertaken to create a true Europe without frontiers by 1992.
