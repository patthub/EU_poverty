        "Policy Department for Citizens' Rights and Constitutional Affairs Author: Jos Heezen Directorate-General for Internal Policies PE 608.832 - October 2018 AT A GLANCE Requested by the Committee on Women\u2019s Rights and Gender Equality EN Mission to Austria 11/12 October 2018 The FEMM mission to Autria on 11 and 12 October 2018 will have as its main focus participation in the Conference \u201cGender Equality and YOU\u201d. This conference is organised by the Austrian Presidency and aims at \u201cinspiring a positive and open dialogue at eye level between young people, youth representatives, Ministers and other high-level political representatives as well as experts from NGOs, public administration international and EU bodies\u201d. This document, provided by the Policy Department for Citizen\u2019s Rights and Constitutional Affairs, is intended to provide information on various aspects of gender equality, based on studies and analyses which have been commissioned by the Policy Department and delivered to FEMM in the course of the current legislature. Of two recent studies - considered to be the most relevant in the context of the conference - a short summary, as well as a link to the full text of the study is given. A number of other Policy Department studies on specific issues of gender equality in the EU are listed and hyperlinked for further reading. Backlash in Gender Equality and Women\u2019s and Girls\u2019 Rights (2018) This study identifies in which fields and by which means the backlash in gender equality and women\u2019s and girls\u2019 rights in six countries (Austria, Hungary, Italy, Poland, Romania, and Slovakia) is occurring. The backlash, which has been happening over the last several years, has decreased the level of protection of women and girls and reduced access to their rights. The Gender Equality Index shows persistent inequalities with only a marginal progress from 2005 to 2015. The main areas and fields of this backlash include the key areas of institutional and policy framework for gender equality, certain policy fields (such as education, sexual and reproductive health and rights, and preventing and combating violence against women) as well as the working environment/operating space for women\u2019s human rights NGOs. The backlash is connected with intensifying campaigning against what is called \u201cgender ideology\u201d. It is alleged that \u201cgender ideology\u201d is being propagated by feminists, scholars, gender equality experts, and in gender mainstreaming etc., and that it undermines family and cultural values. One interpretation is that the concept of gender ideology has become \u201csymbolic glue,\u201d uniting opponent groups against various issues: modernity in its postmodern form, identity politics that are identified with gender equality, same-sex marriage, women\u2019s rights issues (such as sexual and reproductive rights), sex education, and challenging of restrictive traditional gender roles. The instability of the post-2008 crisis world adds to this. Gender Equality Index Source : EIGE ",

In parallel, other, non-rights-based women\u2019s groups and/or initiatives are being supported or favoured by some governments. Since the Istanbul Convention became a target of opponents of \u201cgender ideology\u201d, its ratification or implementation has been hindered. Gender Equality Plans in the private and public sectors in the European Union (2017) This study aims to analyse how Gender Equality Plans (GEPs) have both impacted and are impacting the economic situation of women in the EU, analyses national legislation and collective agreements in connection with GEPs, analyses the impact of the crisis and subsequent austerity on GEPs and, more in-depth, analyses the substance and impact of GEPs in the private and public sectors in two Member States, Austria and Spain. Gender mainstreaming has been adopted as the European level strategy to promote equality between women and men, and to combat gender discrimination. It involves integrating a gender perspective into the preparation, design, implementation, monitoring, and evaluation of policy making (policies, regulatory measures, and spending programmes). Gender Equality Plans and Gender Action Plans (GAPs) can be defined as strategic and tailored initiatives meant to define the legal framework and the operational conditions to implement gender mainstreaming and put them into practice at the workplace. In terms of the impact of GEPs on the economic situation of women in the EU, the overall picture of Europe shows that this impact is very hard to gauge at a macro level although some positive results have emerged at micro level. The economic crisis has had a direct impact on gender equality and indirect effects on GEPs. Direct impact of the crisis on gender equality consisted in an initial reduction of gender differences in all relevant indicators for employment, unemployment, wages, and poverty due to a worsening of the situation of men. Then the situation of women worsened due to the retrenchments in public administration and welfare benefits and other provisions worsening the conditions for women. The economic crisis has had indirect effects on GEPs, as gender equality has been rarely taken into account in anti-crisis measures. Gender equality has been downgraded as objective and only some countries have introduced innovations in the field of gender equality (in particular some Eastern European countries).
